1
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,510
Customer No. 34, your latte is ready.

2
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:55,055
Customer No. 35, your iced Americano is ready.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,106
No iced Americano

4
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,524
Hmm? I just finished it.

5
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,068
Maybe another customer took it.

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,280
Customer No. 34

7
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,990
Customer No. 34

8
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,326
Oh, it's me

9
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,621
Where's my coffee?

10
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,373
Excuse me, I'll make you a cup right away.

11
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,884
If no one steals

12
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,727
The coffee will stay there.

13
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,940
But if someone takes it

14
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,984
Are you kidding me? What is this?

15
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,445
The coffee won't be there.

16
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,668
I need someone to steal my destiny

17
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,307
Episode 2

18
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,893
All down, you know all down, right?

19
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,187
I just need to lose a ball

20
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,772
All fell down

21
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,901
I throw the ball, and the pins are like bowling pins

22
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,111
All fly out

23
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,781
Looking back, I really was...

24
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,408
Oh, Ji Won

25
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,830
If someone steals my destiny

26
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,623
That should be you.

27
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,587
Because you will only be happy if you take my things

28
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,055
Come here soon

29
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,322
minister

30
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,369
Hello, Minister

31
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,195
Minister, are you going on a field trip?

32
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,323
Agent Yang just said you won't be coming to work today

33
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,658
Oh, yes.

34
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,576
I have something unexpected this morning.

35
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,744
So that's it

36
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,374
Jiang Zhiyuan, are you working on your project plan properly?

37
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,918
If you do it badly again this time, I really won't tolerate it.

38
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,003
I'm trying to do

39
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,630
The section chief said

40
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,632
It feels like Ji Won is not working hard.

41
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,134
Our Ji-won works very hard.

42
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,388
Is this the delicious coffee?

43
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,182
Is it the one in front of the bus stop?

44
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,643
Look at you, you're lazy at work.

45
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,854
Leaving work to buy coffee during work hours

46
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,231
sorry

47
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,693
- I bought it on my way back from a field trip
- Women don't work anyway.

48
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,152
Just stuffing delicious food into your mouth...

49
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,879
-Agent Jiang
-Um?

50
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,048
Please come over here

51
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,104
Let's have coffee

52
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,152
Minister, would you like some drink?

53
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,571
I haven't drunk yet

54
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,992
Actually I didn't have breakfast

55
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,160
That’s why when I go out on a mission…

56
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,287
It's better to have breakfast

57
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,584
You drink it

58
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,254
I'm afraid you'll be embarrassed to drink coffee by yourself when you get home

59
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,673
That's why I deliberately asked you to come here to drink

60
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,302
Thanks

61
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,891
That's right

62
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,019
I don't plan to quit.

63
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,025
Do you want to see this?

64
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,989
This is what my dad gave me.

65
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,408
Every time my dad gives me pocket money

66
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,494
Draw a love heart

67
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,664
Even though I always ask him not to scribble on the money

68
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,709
But it still couldn't suppress his artistic soul

69
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,632
I am such a beloved daughter of my father

70
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,387
I plan to try hard

71
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,522
besides…

72
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,401
You said I was a capable person

73
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,363
Gave me a lot of strength
It allowed me to make up my mind, thank you.

74
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,537
Actually, it's been a long time since I last saw you.

75
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,789
I haven't been pursuing anything.

76
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,126
I'm just busy living

77
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,172
I decided not to live that kind of life anymore.

78
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,010
Good decision

79
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,265
Will you laugh?

80
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,102
I think it's the first time I saw you smile

81
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,529
Excuse me

82
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,407
Do you have any dates this weekend?

83
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,825
This weekend?

84
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,749
No

85
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,543
-So…
- I have made an appointment with Jiwon

86
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,170
We're going out together this weekend.

87
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,882
You've forgotten? That's so sad.

88
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,469
I have already made a reservation at Gusuting
That's a delicious barbecue restaurant.

89
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,015
Lonely Pavilion?

90
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,391
Yes, do you know that store?

91
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,355
I think I've heard

92
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,026
I see

93
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,284
I want to drink that delicious coffee too.

94
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,452
Let's go buy it together

95
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,289
Sorry, I'm a bit busy now

96
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,291
Why? I want to drink

97
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,210
I heard the sandwiches there are delicious too.

98
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,303
Kang Ji-won is so boring

99
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,932
The minister wanted her to work on the weekend, and I rescued her.

100
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,309
Can't you even drink a cup of coffee with me?

101
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,228
A model student who only knows how to work

102
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,271
So annoying

103
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,376
(Employee Search)

104
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,502
(Kang Ji-won)

105
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,047
(Name: Jiang Zhiyuan)

106
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,967
(Taeha High School, Korea University)

107
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,472
Hello? Is this Guseting?

108
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,558
I would like to inquire about group reservations for this Sunday

109
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,144
Busan Taeha High School Reunion, 6 o'clock...

110
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,314
Oh, is it half past five?

111
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,484
(Zhao Dongshuo)

112
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,198
Hello? Dongshuo

113
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,033
Can you help me find someone?

114
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,577
Yes, now

115
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,208
I'll call you back later

116
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,799
Minister, this is for you.

117
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,717
(Pain Relief)

118
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,388
This is a painkiller

119
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,683
I heard it's best to take it whenever you feel a little pain.

120
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,686
Have you eaten?

121
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,479
Your injury should hurt.

122
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,567
Oh, I'm fine.

123
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,324
You're well prepared, but take care of yourself first

124
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,784
You probably need this more than I do.

125
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,256
Thanks

126
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,530
Come out for a while

127
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,624
I must let Jung Soo Min steal my destiny

128
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,562
Wouldn’t you…

129
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,107
It's because of Liu Zhihe
Are you saying you want to break up with me?

130
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,775
What?

131
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,986
Liu Zhihe became a minister at a young age

132
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,030
You seem to think he has some background.

133
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,743
You only know one thing but not the other.
Half-witted vixen

134
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,289
I said that men should be judged by appearance and brains

135
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,374
Do you know?

136
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,169
What does that expression of yours mean?

137
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,632
You don’t have anything going on with Liu Zhihe, do you?

138
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,218
Minister, I'm sorry.

139
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,639
You are here because the minister asked me to buy an OK bandaid
That's why it's like this?

140
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,142
Did that guy ask you to buy a Band-Aid?

141
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,352
That crazy old man

142
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,479
He actually wants you, a person with an injured foot, to buy it?

143
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,981
I can't stand it

144
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,610
I will break up

145
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,158
Because I feel that between us
It doesn't seem to be the same as before

146
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,245
I don't know

147
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,830
I don't want to say it out loud

148
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,251
What is this?

149
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,046
You think I'm a little cold
Are you throwing a tantrum?

150
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,341
Um

151
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,638
I want a relationship that everyone admires

152
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,432
I hope you are that kind of

153
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,351
The kind that others would want to steal

154
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,062
Excellent boyfriend

155
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,731
What?

156
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,234
What does it matter what other people think?
It's enough that we are sincere to each other

157
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,155
Kang Ji-won, you little guy

158
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,824
I thought you were stupid, but it seems you are not.

159
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,535
Okay

160
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,038
I'll pay more attention

161
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,040
Let's reconcile.

162
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,709
-good
-Um

163
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,629
What? What are you doing?

164
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,713
Let's reconcile

165
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,340
Why in the company?

166
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,466
It's okay, no one will come.

167
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,967
-Yes
-Won't

168
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,347
Wait, there's a phone call.

169
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,849
It's my mom. She called and asked me to take medicine.

170
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,687
This won't work.

171
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,742
Oh, yeah

172
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,578
I untie this

173
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,007
I…

174
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,512
I know it's none of my business

175
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,806
But even if they are couples

176
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,310
You shouldn't force intimacy.

177
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,689
that…

178
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,899
I just remember that I used to

179
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,068
I regret it

180
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,281
You are a smart person

181
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,242
Don't make the wrong choice like me.

182
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,336
Did she come here specially because she was worried about me?

183
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,052
It's lunch time

184
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,596
Let's go eat

185
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,140
Agent Yang

186
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,933
Have you made a restaurant reservation?

187
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,277
Honey, what shall we eat?

188
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,862
I want to eat curry

189
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,281
Let's go to an Indian restaurant.

190
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,409
Sorry, I'm poor lately.

191
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,203
And today the meal in the staff cafeteria is spicy fried pork

192
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,498
Minhwan, why don't you take Xiumin out to eat curry?

193
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,587
No, if you want spicy fried pork

194
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,047
Then I will also eat at the staff restaurant today

195
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,132
Oh well

196
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,176
Then let's go to the staff restaurant.

197
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,151
Thanks, my other half

198
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,327
for you

199
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,089
It's not that I don't know

200
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,509
As long as it doesn't suit your taste, you will be scheming

201
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,308
Let's sit there.

202
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,148
Oh, really, you should be careful too.

203
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,317
Ji Won, are you okay?

204
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,528
Ji Won, are you okay?

205
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,029
what to do?

206
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,532
The reason why I endure

207
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,951
Because I thought you were my only friend

208
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,037
-sorry
- You should have avoided it, but you got splashed

209
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,873
what to do?

210
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,380
Let's sit there.

211
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,353
Ouch

212
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,897
hateful

213
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,941
Damn

214
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,777
Oh god, I'm sorry.

215
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,195
How are you?

216
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,823
sorry

217
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,617
Xiumin, I'm sorry.

218
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,661
Did you trip over my feet?

219
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,539
Honey

220
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,500
-Are you hurt?
- Really

221
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,379
Isn't this your favorite shirt?

222
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,508
Ossendic?

223
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,969
The whole thing is ruined

224
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,345
what to do?

225
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,930
Give me a napkin

226
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,099
Oh, napkins, ok

227
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,021
I won't be bullied anymore.

228
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,774
Excuse me

229
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,567
Is there anyone outside?

230
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,861
Are you calling me?

231
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,488
right…

232
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,656
Excuse me

233
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,617
Can you help me?

234
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,579
Do you need sanitary napkins?

235
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,664
right…

236
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,749
right

237
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,794
Please wait a moment. I'll get it for you.

238
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,590
Thank you, thank you so much.

239
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,841
Thank you so much

240
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,845
I just want to know who is this great benefactor

241
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,390
The one who saved my life, I didn't expect it was someone I knew

242
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,560
I will definitely treat you well once

243
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,730
No need to entertain, it's nothing.

244
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,235
Xiyan, don't move yet.

245
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,778
Excuse me

246
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,490
really

247
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,760
alright

248
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,637
How can you be so nice?

249
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,392
You are the one I thought didn't exist in this era
The Good Samaritan

250
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,477
Kind people who only exist in movies

251
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,189
And you are the light and salt of my life
My real savior

252
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,070
Is this your personality?

253
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,363
God

254
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,866
You look so pretty when you smile

255
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,993
Why don’t I know this?

256
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,912
Beautiful and kind

257
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,248
You are truly the best person in the world.

258
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,794
You are really exaggerating.

259
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,046
Others will surely do the same.

260
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,257
No, it's not.

261
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,510
There was another person who came in before you.

262
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,470
I really begged her.

263
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,307
But she just kept mumbling

264
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,767
I went to the toilet, washed my hands and left.

265
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,521
Thanks, my other half

266
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,071
Excuse me, have you eaten yet?

267
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,656
I haven't eaten yet

268
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,284
I came to eat without any preparation

269
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,162
The result was a crisis.

270
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,497
Yes

271
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:10,418
Looking back
We haven't had dinner together.

272
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,672
If possible, would you like to eat together?

273
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,684
You said you were going to get a napkin.

274
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,895
But he never came back, so I wondered what happened.

275
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,151
She's in an emergency, too.

276
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,153
What's going on?

277
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,155
Anyway

278
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,658
We've taken care of it ourselves

279
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,952
Very well handled

280
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,038
Is this handled well?

281
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,042
Park Min-hwan must be furious

282
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,670
He begged me for a year to buy him that shirt

283
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,797
I'm really sorry, Agent Park.

284
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,508
I'll buy you a new shirt

285
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,177
No

286
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,845
It's just a shirt.

287
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,222
You don't need to care

288
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,059
Isn't that a famous brand?

289
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,645
Shouldn't it be 1.5 million or 1.8 million won?

290
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,775
Not that expensive, probably around 1.2 million won

291
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,445
-Um…
-what to do?

292
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,824
I'm just a contractor, I don't have much money.

293
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,543
It's okay, don't worry about it, just eat.

294
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,253
Is it really okay?

295
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,172
As expected, he is Agent Park, very capable

296
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,258
-Super strong
-You're great too

297
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,052
I should go buy a shirt.

298
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,555
Eat, everyone. I have a lot of shirts at home.

299
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,181
Your heart is as broad as the sea

300
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,767
Today I was planning to try the spicy fried pork
It smells so good.

301
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,563
Agent Park is the best

302
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,996
(Weite Western Restaurant)

303
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,711
Always be careful with fire

304
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,213
Chop some more onions

305
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,508
Very good, continue

306
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,843
Hey, this is burnt.

307
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,138
If you leave it alone, it will burn. Redo it.

308
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,867
Thank you for visiting

309
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,951
The food is so delicious

310
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,036
Thanks

311
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,595
Chef Baek Eun-ho

312
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,681
yes

313
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,978
You graduated from Busan Taeha High School, right?

314
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,023
Yes, what's up?

315
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,199
Xiyan, you are really good at eating.

316
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,535
yes

317
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,246
Why do girls eat so much?

318
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,540
Whether male or female

319
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,084
To do great things, you must definitely eat more

320
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,044
This is what my grandfather taught me.

321
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,507
So did your grandfather do something big?

322
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,426
He is selling bean sprouts.

323
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,928
And tofu and sauce

324
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,641
It turns out that he runs a small vegetable shop.

325
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,353
Xiyan, you are blessed by your grandfather
That's why it's so energetic

326
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,522
Koreans just want to eat rice

327
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,482
Yes, well said.

328
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,069
I'm a picky eater, it's too bad

329
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,406
How are you supposed to work if you only eat that?

330
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,740
You eat too little

331
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,534
That is to say

332
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,619
I should be able to eat like Jiwon

333
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,079
Looking back

334
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,582
Ji-won has never had indigestion since she was a child.

335
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,084
Her digestive ability is so good that she can even eat steel.

336
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,421
-Isn't that right? Jiwon
-Um

337
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,089
Is that really the case?

338
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,885
I remember I used to eat pork soup rice with her

339
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,428
She's just like an uncle.

340
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,471
Eat generously

341
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,015
You uncle

342
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,476
Min-hwan, you can't say that.

343
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,270
No matter what, you have to love our Ji Won

344
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,563
like

345
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,648
Yes, love is important.

346
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,403
I envy you for having such a good friend.

347
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,659
Yes, Xiumin is so great.

348
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:54,994
Why are there no men...

349
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,580
Agent Jiang, let me pour you a glass of water

350
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,291
- Help me pour it too
-What? Why would I?

351
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,501
You have to pour water anyway.

352
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,296
- Help me too...
- You come to work in the company anyway

353
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,797
Would you like to help me with my work too?

354
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,053
this…

355
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:13,888
that…

356
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,558
That woman is so young, how dare she do that?

357
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,144
Don't call that woman.

358
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,438
This is the company

359
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,107
Although she is younger, her rank is the same as yours.

360
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,360
What?

361
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:33,908
oh

362
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,119
But I'll remind her.

363
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,163
Yeah, tell her.

364
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,749
Have her manners been eaten by a dog?

365
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,044
Min-hwan, you should finish eating with Soo-min before going upstairs.

366
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,921
You know she's a picky eater.

367
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,090
Ignore her, she doesn't eat much.

368
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,299
Very different from me

369
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:52,802
Yeah, okay

370
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,804
See you later

371
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,983
Hee-yeon, I'm sorry.

372
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,318
I recycled the plates for you.
You feel very unhappy, right?

373
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,946
Sorry, I should have held back.

374
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,660
I knew it as soon as I saw it

375
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,121
The person who just ignored me in the bathroom

376
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,372
It's Zheng Xiumin

377
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,962
Excuse me, the person who just came in

378
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,090
Could you please do me a favor?

379
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,427
I am not ready yet, I need help from others

380
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,471
It's troublesome

381
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,105
After our meeting, shall we go for coffee?

382
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,566
- It's my treat
- I said I'd like to invite you

383
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,160
Ji Won seems angry

384
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,247
Because I ruined your shirt

385
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,167
Ouch

386
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,210
You also know that Ji Won is not that kind of person

387
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,380
Just now she was worried that you ate too little

388
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,883
She usually cares about you very much.

389
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,052
Is this really the case?

390
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,389
Ji Won is so ruthless sometimes

391
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,435
I don't know how much I like her.

392
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,483
Ouch

393
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,109
It doesn't matter.

394
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,447
- Come in
- I want a ride too

395
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,700
Ouch

396
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,539
My hand...

397
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,416
Oh, okay

398
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,261
this…

399
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,681
What should I do?

400
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,642
Well, that...

401
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,815
No, no.

402
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,525
Excuse me

403
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,151
Sorry, can you lend me this?

404
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,241
You use

405
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,452
What perfume?

406
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,080
This is...

407
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,209
Good smell

408
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,544
Yeah, yeah

409
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,515
（Conference Room）

410
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,475
-for you
-Thanks

411
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,477
good

412
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,439
What are you doing?

413
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,733
What?

414
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,987
Chief, those are the meeting materials.

415
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,323
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

416
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,950
Um?

417
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,911
To be honest

418
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,622
I don't even need to read the business plan you wrote to know it's terrible

419
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,041
At least be sincere.

420
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,544
Will the atmosphere of the meeting be good?

421
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,755
Do you think this makes sense?

422
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,175
- You guys tell me
-Once a person becomes incompetent

423
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,845
They only make a big fuss about the little things they know

424
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,556
Oh, it does feel a bit insincere.

425
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,018
Hee-yeon, the staple

426
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,519
Be like this

427
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,229
Slanting nails

428
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,273
Staples?

429
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,233
That's right

430
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,319
Xiumin is really sensible

431
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,697
All reprints and repins

432
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,534
All?

433
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:49,371
This seems to waste a lot of paper.

434
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,625
I want you to realize

435
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,793
You've wasted a few trees.

436
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,045
Section Chief

437
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,756
I think Agent Yang understands what you mean

438
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,219
Ji-won, pour the chief a cup of coffee

439
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,139
Section Chief

440
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,142
Please help me look at the business plan I wrote

441
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,020
I have to be a full-time employee.

442
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,523
Should we go out for some fresh air?

443
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,358
Is that so?

444
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,576
Agent Yang, I'm sorry.

445
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,161
Because I don't know much

446
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,996
No

447
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,498
It doesn't matter

448
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,673
This really can't go on any longer.

449
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,761
Agent Yang

450
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,680
Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me?

451
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,684
I have to do what the section chief wants me to do.

452
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,727
It will be fine in a moment

453
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,149
You're a bit weird.

454
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,859
Next time

455
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:04,238
At least please take a look at this.

456
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,908
"One-person family"

457
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,079
Isn't this the project proposal that was rejected by the section chief?

458
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,832
What do you want me to watch this for?

459
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,585
Please take a closer look

460
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,546
If you're still not free, forget it.

461
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,548
Then I'll go first

462
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,555
Scare me

463
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,766
Where did you run back from?

464
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,019
Oh, that...

465
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:39,481
The meeting is over, wait till I go to the bathroom
Let's go to the lounge and laze around.

466
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,775
etc.

467
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,155
Min Hwan said he had something to tell me

468
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,489
I'll find you later

469
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,872
(Proposal for quick-cooking meal kits in the one-person household era)

470
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,855
(Pain Relief)

471
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,674
Hee-yeon, I have something to ask.

472
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,801
Got to go back to the office.

473
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,305
So you want me to finish eating this by myself?

474
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,148
I can't just accept the benefits you give me every time, right?

475
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,028
So this Sunday
Do you want to go on a date with me?

476
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,029
My treat

477
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,365
Sunday?

478
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,867
You're going to date me this weekend.

479
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,329
I found a delicious barbecue restaurant.
Guse Pavilion

480
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,416
I can't seem to do it on Sunday.

481
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,418
Do you have a date?

482
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,754
I have an appointment.

483
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,881
But I don't think I'll go

484
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,466
Can I not go?

485
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,510
What is the appointment?

486
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,305
Alumni Reunion

487
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,349
Of course I have to go to the class reunion.

488
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,018
Go see First Love

489
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,270
Then feel disappointed

490
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,480
This is the way to move forward and forget the past.

491
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,025
No one knows where my first love is

492
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,694
What are you doing?

493
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,114
I was actually very unpopular in school.

494
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:57,536
I need to go there
Looking back on my shameful past?

495
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,580
This is more appropriate, right?

496
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,336
If you don't go, it will just be a miserable past.

497
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,965
If you change it drastically
That will become a glorious history.

498
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,572
minister

499
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,325
yes

500
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,539
You asked me if I was free on Sunday.

501
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,917
If it's urgent, I'm willing to come to work

502
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,835
Don’t you have an appointment?

503
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,505
That's right

504
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,175
But it doesn't matter, work comes first

505
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,551
I think this is right

506
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,346
You are the priority

507
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,018
that…

508
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:08,232
I'm actually wondering whether I should go or not.

509
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,275
Go ahead

510
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,071
Although I hesitated
The answer will be different every time

511
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,697
But let’s try it this time.

512
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,449
You can go

513
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,163
Just remember that you owe me a favor.

514
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,791
What?

515
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,435
(Basic nutritional information of quick-cooking food packs)

516
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,941
Please take a closer look

517
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,861
If you're still not free, forget it.

518
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,612
Very well written

519
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
Agent Yang

520
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,328
Have you seen it?

521
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,789
Um

522
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,708
I have seen

523
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,917
very nice

524
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,090
Do you want to do it with me?

525
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,181
That's not how things work in the company

526
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,727
The section chief has a different point of view from us...

527
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,604
That person has not seen

528
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,523
-What?
- I saw

529
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,362
He pretended to read

530
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,034
But it's just for show

531
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,952
Not just this time

532
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,288
Including your report.

533
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,332
He vetoed everything.

534
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:54,588
This is something everyone knows.

535
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,515
Look at him, he's really outrageous.

536
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,893
Because he thought that was power.

537
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,896
Impossible

538
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,109
If you are controlled by emotions for too long, you will lose your objectivity

539
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,820
Regardless of other

540
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,781
Regardless of the section chief's opinion

541
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,575
What do you think?

542
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,871
Do you really think my proposal
Is that outrageous? Really?

543
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,586
Then I'll discuss it with the section chief.

544
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,466
Section Chief Kim Kyung-wook…

545
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,697
She's really annoying lately.

546
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,952
Scare me

547
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,495
Section Chief

548
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,539
Excuse me, have you had lunch?

549
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,749
The beautiful Xiumin in our group

550
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,002
I ate loach soup to nourish my body

551
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,796
What about you?

552
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,049
I had spicy fried pork in the staff cafeteria

553
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,759
It seems delicious.

554
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,431
Say

555
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:32,102
I have a secret to tell you.

556
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,229
secret?

557
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,066
You know I want a full-time job.

558
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,320
I have an idea, but I can't figure it out.

559
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,866
Of course I'll help you.

560
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,118
Really?

561
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,536
Thank you so much

562
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,246
No

563
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,458
Our group is
The yellow-faced woman and the ugly one who doesn't look like a woman

564
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,085
Because of the low mood in our group

565
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,005
We really need you to become a full-time employee.

566
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,091
The section chief is really

567
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,968
You are so humorous

568
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,807
You know he does whatever he wants.

569
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,769
So he always opposes what you say

570
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:22,069
Ever since he pursued you and was rejected

571
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,324
What are you talking about? That's too childish.

572
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:31,411
Jin Jingxu for seven years
I have been doing such childish things.

573
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,415
I know he can become a section chief.

574
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,502
Because he took your project plan

575
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,836
Submit it under your own name

576
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,296
As he did before

577
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,508
He used my business plan to get Zheng Xiumin a full-time job

578
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,301
He is my predecessor

579
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,723
In the company, people would always give away things made by their subordinates.
Use the name of your superior...

580
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,683
You never did that.

581
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,564
I am very confident in this plan

582
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,151
You know this is a good plan.

583
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,781
But the Chief...

584
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,785
On Monday I will submit the rejected proposals

585
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,829
Submit it again without changing the title

586
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,122
What?

587
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,208
Wait until you are sure he has not seen it before vetoing it.

588
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,835
Then…

589
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,254
Would you like to work with me?

590
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,986
I'm 100% sure he didn't see it.

591
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,243
No, maybe 99%?

592
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm sure Kim Kyung-wook didn't read the project proposal

593
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:01,334
But if he remembers a chart or a picture...

595
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,630
Don't be afraid, I'm right.

596
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,468
I know how lazy he is and how he doesn't do anything.

597
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,817
Chief, please take a look.

598
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,152
This is a new project

599
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,014

604
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,525
Are you kidding me?

605
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,072
This is the same as what you gave me last time...

606
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,617
I'm speechless

607
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,037
This is the same as what you gave me last time...

608
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,206
It's worse than before!

609
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,090
I am this person

610
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,134
It's not that I haven't seen people who can't do things.
But this is the first time I see someone like you

611
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,095
How could you be so bad?

612
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,807
This is obviously cutting and pasting information from everywhere

613
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:43,311
If you don't want to work, don't do it.
Why do you want to torture me?

614
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,695
Chief, I'm really sorry.

615
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,613
This is the same one as last time.

616
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,657
I got the wrong one. Please wait.

617
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,000
This one is right, the green one

618
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,502
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm so sorry.

619
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,341
What? Didn't he realize that he had seen it?

620
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,302
Exaggeration, he really didn't do anything

621
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,387
It really lives up to its reputation

622
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:46,291
I didn't quite believe it.
He actually didn't know

623
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,710
The title is exactly the same, how could he not know?

624
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,420
I said he wasn't working.

625
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,089
Now we are the same team

626
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,383
Quick cooking packs will definitely be popular

627
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,636
Providing consumers with fast, simple and delicious food

628
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,432
good

629
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:06,186
Now I finally know why everything goes wrong for me

630
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,771
I can't believe it.

631
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,565
I've been working for this guy.

632
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:13,902
Are you two the only ones drinking coffee?

633
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:18,615
cheers

634
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,954
Chief Jin is exaggerating, how could he not know?

635
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,010

cheers

639
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,573
Why did you ask me out after get off work?

640
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:07,372
To tell you the secret I told you today.

641
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,458
The word secret

642
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,960
It's really exciting

643
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,550
Is it okay to eat pork belly?

644
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:21,678
Oh, that's right.

645
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,763
Did you say you had spicy fried pork for lunch?

646
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,015
Eating pork for two consecutive meals

647
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,600
Isn't this a bit bad?

648
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:29,519
Won't

649
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,896
I prefer Korean pork to Korean beef

650
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,398
You really know how to eat

651
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,482

00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,734
Xiumin, you are such a nice girl

653
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,154
I'm not

654
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,739
The really nice girl is Ji Won

655
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:46,911
All I talk about is Kang Ji-won

656
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,998
Do you like her that much?
I really don't understand women.

657
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,291
Ji Won

658
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,086
Not like us
She graduated from a Korean university.

659
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,671
She is smart

660
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,006
and

661
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,257
Still a bit ambitious

662
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,135
What's so great about Korean universities?

663
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,638
The people who graduated there only know how to study, but they are useless.

664
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,683
The plan is full of unrealistic nonsense.

665
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,644
Ji Won probably doesn't think so.

666
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,814
She'll probably think you don't know talent.

667
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,441
No vision

668
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,776
You say I have no vision?

669
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:26,284
I think you have an inferiority complex about your academic qualifications.

670
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,119
Don't do this

671
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,245
University?

672
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,872
It's of no use at all

673
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,415
No

674
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,044
I mean, her idea might be good.

675
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,047
Although execution is another matter

676
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,841
That Jiang Zhiyuan

677
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,885
Always so rigid

678
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,387
So that's what she thought in her heart?

679
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:52,185
By the way, the one she printed wrong today
Quick cooking meal package project

680
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,730
It's terrible, but the idea is good.

681
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,524
You bring it over here

682
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,692
Develop with me

683
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,655
It might be a big seller.

684
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,533
With you...

685
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,536
-Together?
-right

686
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,498
Anyway, if Zhiyuan were to do it, she would definitely not do it well.

687
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,918
If you can rely on your experience, you can grasp the direction

688
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:22,382
I think it should be OK for me to get a full-time job.

689
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:30,098
I really feel comfortable with you.

690
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,434
It's like I'm chatting with my brother about work.

691
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,522
She just said

692
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,024
Am I like a brother?

693
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,410
Of course, yes.

694
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,162
The boss is my brother.

695
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,498
Come

696
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,208
Our Xiumin

697
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,794
Tell me more about the project plan.

698
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,588
us

699
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,340
Let's have a drink first.

700
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,509
cheers

701
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,600
Brother Chief, come and have some meat.

702
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,687
Well played

703
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,609
Why is she Kang Ji-won's friend?

704
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,819
I can't even try.

705
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,863
What does it matter?

706
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,866
I think she's in love with you too.
Just make a quick deal.

707
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,286
What's the deal? Are you selling used goods?

708
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,413
Are you kidding?

709
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,081
All down, right?

710
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,291
Too strong

711
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:40,668
Well played!

712
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,253
Well played!

713
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,054
Shang Tsung

714
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,555
Do you know any nice girls?

715
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:53,848
I'm really going crazy

716
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,516
nerve

717
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,935
You are full of energy.

718
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,395
Where is your girlfriend?

719
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,856
Why does mentioning her make me feel cold?

720
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,983
She's just for marriage.

721
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,569
What is used for marriage?

722
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,821
Look

723
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:13,159
She is kind-hearted and frugal.

724
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,496
She works hard to make money but doesn't know how to spend it.

725
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,664
-how?
-Wow

726
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,124
She's the perfect wife.

727
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,669
She's super boring.

728
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,089
She will look at the company's outlook report

729
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,924
Have you ever seen anyone watching that kind of thing?

730
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:32,887
I guess she should be looking at materials in the company now

731
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,348
Like this

732
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,318
Rebirth means you can do anything

733
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,321
Although it's not a big deal
But I let Zheng Xiumin eat the turtle

734
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,656
Kim Kyung-wook too

735
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,534
I can do anything

736
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,735
These are couple earrings. You must wear them on Sunday.

737
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,653
Your everlasting love, Xiumin

738
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,531
Did you see the earrings she was wearing?

739
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,254
You've been so distant lately, I'm so sad

740
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,506
I'm not saying this because I'm drunk

741
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,133
I'm going to sleep at your house tonight.

742
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,803
We spent the weekend together and went to Guse Pavilion on Sunday

743
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,308
(Guse Pavilion)

744
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,768
Guse Pavilion

745
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,644
I am sure

746
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,735
(Guse Pavilion)

747
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,746
(Busan Taeha High School, 37th Reunion)

748
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:30,963
She really came

749
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,048
Ji Won!

750
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,884
Jiwon, you're here?

751
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,093
Let's go in quickly

752
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,178
What's going on?

753
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,181
Aren’t we both going to have dinner?

754
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,142
If I said it was a class reunion, you definitely wouldn't come

755
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,771
We are all over 30, let's forget the past

756
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,397
They are all very nice people.

757
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,107
- Let's go
- Xiumin, I...

758
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,234
It's okay.

759
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,161
I'm leaving, help me with my bag

760
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:04,539
Kang Ji-won is really amazing

761
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,999
No one who is familiar with her dares to come

762
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,459
She must be here to eat meat.

763
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:11,087
Looking at her dress, she looks very poor.

764
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,632
Why are you speaking in Seoul accent all of a sudden? So corny

765
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,469
By the way, why is she still playing with Xiumin?

766
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,096
Can't you tell it at a glance?

767
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,432
Xiumin, that innocent child, is so kind to her.

768
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,103
If Xiumin wasn't here, she wouldn't even have any barbecue to eat.

769
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,813
Drink milk!

770
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,532
Don't be like this.

771
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:50,585
Zheng Xiumin is so kind

772
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,378
We should take care of her.

773
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,005
Did you see the earrings she was wearing?

774
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,631
She should have learned how to wear it from Xiumin

775
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,342
You can tell it's a fake from 500 meters away.

776
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,097
When Jiang Zhiyuan was in high school...

777
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,432
Wisdom, etc.

778
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,684
What's wrong?

779
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,061
Jiang Zhiyuan was not at her seat just now

780
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,928
Hello, have you been here all the time?

781
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,723
Why are you pretending not to be there?

782
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,977
You are really insidious.

783
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,319
I won't go there

784
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,239
No, don't come over. Today I...

785
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,910
I'm going to your house today

786
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,621
After a drink, I want to see my lover

787
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,206
I'll be there in an hour

788
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,587
Do these two people think my home is a hotel?

789
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:18,756
them…

790
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,342
etc.

791
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,140
All right

792
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,643
There's no need to wait for something that's going to happen anyway.

793
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,563
You two love each other to death

794
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,442
I will help you get results quickly.

795
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,136
You go this way.

796
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,472
Thanks

797
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,517
Are you just getting off work now?

798
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,687
Yes, you just came back now?

799
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,857
I have something to do.

800
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,319
You've worked hard. I'll take my leave now.

801
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,447
etc.

802
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,751
This one?

803
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,546
This is the gift I received

804
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,301
That is...

805
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,722
Counterfeit goods

806
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,559
Those who understand will know it at a glance

807
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:03,736
That is...

808
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,530
Counterfeit goods

809
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,286
Those who understand will know it at a glance

810
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,538
Are you talking about me?

811
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,082
What's the meaning?

812
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,003
It's better not to wear it

813
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,005
It's better not to wear it

814
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,257
I remember

815
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:29,595
He's said the same thing to me before.
I think he's being disrespectful.

816
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:34,391
Because I didn't know to go to the class reunion
What kind of humiliation will I suffer?

817
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,771
That's a gift from my friend.
Of course I think it's bad for him to say that.

818
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,482
sorry

819
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:42,983
no

820
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:44,944
Thank you

821
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:50,866
Do you want me to take you home?

822
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,660
What?

823
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,495
Because it's late

824
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,498
Oh, no thanks

825
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,542
There are also buses available, which will arrive soon.

826
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,669
I want to take you back

827
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,635
Thank you for your kindness

828
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,140
I have a date with my boyfriend

829
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,185
goodbye

830
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,537
Thanks, no need to look for it

831
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:40,916
What?

832
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,713
I was working overtime. I'll be back soon.

833
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,549
She is rushing back in the middle of working overtime?

834
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,511
Right, she is also a human being. She will definitely be hungry if she hasn’t eaten for too long.

835
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:55,556
There's beer in the fridge, have another one and wait for me

836
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,892
It's incredible

837
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,478
Jiang Zhiyuan, you are dead today

838
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:07,067
(whisky)

839
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,195
Will you get drunk if you drink this?

840
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:16,368
I love you, my other half

841
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,912
Be gentle with me

842
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,914
I love you, I said I like you

843
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,135
"Come quickly"?

844
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,805
There's not even an emoji, so cold

845
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:38,933
It's really too much

846
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:41,769
I'm not going

847
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,853
I'm not going anymore

848
00:58:56,242 --> 00:59:01,789
You make my heart go up and down

849
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,088
Jiang Zhiyuan, you are dead today

850
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,382
How come he got here so quickly?

851
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,853
I'm not going, I'm not happy, I want to go home

852
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,272
I'm a little sad

853
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,023
What? Why isn't she here?

854
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,407
Honey, you're back.

855
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:43,956
You're here soon.

856
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,083
I thought you would be here in a while.

857
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,919
I'm eager to spend a hot night with you

858
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:51,630
So I took a taxi.

859
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,550
There's no need to do this.

860
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,512
us

861
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,141
Long time

862
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:04,310
there is none left

863
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:05,853
Right?

864
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:08,939
It's been a long time.

865
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,942
So we should talk...

866
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:15,237
Wanna chat?

867
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,280
Talk with your body

868
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,286
Let's put the clothes...

869
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,915
Now

870
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:28,792
us

871
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,127
unnecessary

872
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,714
Clothes

873
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:43,974
Come

874
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,310
Don't move

875
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,627
It suits you very well and looks good.

876
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,630
Turning the shameful past into a glorious history

877
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,841
People like me
It's not something that can change overnight.

878
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,511
I was bullied before.

879
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,847
She forgot how bad she was.

880
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,518
Fortunately, I met you, Agent Park

881
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,853
I'm coming, behind you

882
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,981
I used to like you!

883
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:34,108
I have someone I like.

884
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,528
Which woman did he fall in love with to do that?

885
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,113
Go and ask around

886
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,327
