1
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,299
Thank you for sending me back

2
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:50,760
Ji Won

3
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,013
Are you feeling unwell?

4
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,684
Actually, my stomach has been feeling uncomfortable since just now.

5
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,186
Stomach…

6
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,291
minister

7
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:24,752
minister

8
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,003
minister

9
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:27,588
minister!

10
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,783
Please come in. Where are you going?

11
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,285
Sir, did you see a man sitting there?

12
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,372
- Go over there, please.
-What? In front of there?

13
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,589
Minhwan

14
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,679
Are you hurt?

15
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,098
Oh my god

16
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,892
Did you fight with anyone?

17
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,151
(Regional Emergency Center)

18
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,798
minister

19
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,808
You fainted, I took you to the hospital

20
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,104
Are you awake? The test results are out.

21
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,737
Liu Zhihe, 30 years old, type A, right?

22
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,863
right

23
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,865
You've been overworked and sleep deprived lately

24
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,034
Somewhat

25
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,702
Irregular diet

26
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,454
Probably drank a lot of wine

27
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,749
Do you have anything stressful?

28
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:34,006
You pushed too hard and your brain decided to shut down.

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,802
There seems to be something wrong with your autonomic nervous system.
More testing is needed

30
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,721
How is your digestion?

31
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,140
You should feel sick to your stomach.

32
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,476
By the way, Jiwon, do you have a stomachache?

33
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,478
Me?

34
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,648
She has a very bad stomach, please help her get checked

35
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,815
What?

36
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,694
Are there any family members? Do you have any medical history?

37
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,614
No, I just have gastritis, no need for examination

38
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,617
No, you looked really bad just now.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,244
Because you are in a state of shock
Maybe it's okay

40
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,205
Please check her out.

41
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,540
No, I had a CT scan not long ago.

42
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,833
It's just gastritis

43
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,128
Did you have a CT scan?

44
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,547
Why?

45
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,262
Just by the way

46
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,056
Just by the way? Just a CT scan?

47
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,645
But how do you know I have a bad stomach?

48
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,147
That’s because…

49
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,151
You often take medicine at work.

50
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,449
Then should we be fair?
Did you two get checked?

51
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,724
Minhwan

52
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,787
Can't

53
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,291
I can't hurt Ji Won

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,334
I might as well just die...

55
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,255
I can…

56
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,008
leave

57
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,554
Oh, that...

58
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,849
I can't let you get it so easily.

59
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,194
Don't cry, silly.

60
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,154
what to do?

61
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,867
Ji Won…

62
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,037
What should I do?

63
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,468
-Keep the change, please
-Oh, okay, walk slowly

64
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,637
-Thanks
-You're welcome

65
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,062
Is he getting off here?

66
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,527
Then please walk slowly and carefully

67
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,323
I'll take you back. My car is over there.

68
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,033
oh…

69
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,461
I am a good person

70
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,512
He is a good person

71
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,350
But I can trust someone again

72
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,227
Start over?

73
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,022
I have a boyfriend

74
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,442
And he is your subordinate.

75
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,821
Because of what happened today, I am in a difficult situation.

76
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,160
He will definitely care a lot, so...

77
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,370
Then he should pay more attention.

78
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,083
Let him treat you every moment

79
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,046
Be more careful and cautious

80
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,262
Do you want to take a taxi back?

81
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,483
I like you

82
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,074
But if you don't like it, I won't do anything.

83
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,700
It won't make things difficult for you.

84
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,748
You just need to say one word.

85
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,625
Say you don't like

86
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:07,798
I…

87
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,008
But not now

88
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,219
Please consider this first.

89
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,268
If you say you don't like it, I won't do anything.
So until then…

90
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,813
I hope Park Min-hwan can be a little...

91
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,316
No, I hope he'll pay more attention.

92
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,403
And you

93
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,783
I hope you can think about it slowly.

94
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,791
I can guarantee
You'd be a good choice to be with me

95
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,920
Although it is difficult to prove

96
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,631
But I'm really a good person.

97
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,559
I won't take the bus, so you don't have to feel burdened. Just get in the car.

98
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,550
Oh my god, I didn't sleep at all.

99
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:40,552
Good morning, I'm on my way to the restaurant.
I'll bring you coffee.

100
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,728
Are you coming out to wait for me?

101
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,773
Now is the time for traffic jam
You came all the way here to bring me coffee?

102
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,442
Yeah, yeah

103
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,028
-Thank you
-Won't

104
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,364
I just happened to come here for something.

105
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,342
Be careful, the minister is in a bad mood today.

106
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,760
Be careful not to be spotted by him.

107
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,599
He looks the same as usual.

108
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,810
No, he was in a bad mood and in a bad condition.

109
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,566
How do you know?

110
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,152
Because they are siblings

111
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,781
But they really don't look alike at all

112
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,533
No matter how you look at it, it doesn't look like

113
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,707
You look worse.
Are you not doing well?

114
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,045
Hello everyone, good morning

115
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,925
Ji-won, did you sleep well?

116
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,426
Um

117
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,727
Hey, morning...

118
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,618
How? What?

119
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,222
She obviously wants to see my face
Why are you still being so arrogant over there?

120
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,601
So women should be taught a lesson every three days.

121
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,520
No smoking here

122
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,439
Oh, yes, Minister.

123
00:14:58,857 --> 00:14:59,691
That's not right.

124
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,361
What happened yesterday?

125
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,323
U&K's company regulations
There are still rules against office romances

126
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,701
No love allowed?

127
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,038
What era is it now? This is too outdated.

128
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,665
Because it is outdated, it has not been executed for a long time.

129
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,418
Therefore, many people are not aware of this rule.
But it still exists

130
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,087
-No
-It exists because

131
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,048
Office romance can affect work

132
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,635
Just like what you did today

133
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,435
No matter whether that rule exists or not,
Let’s talk common sense.

134
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,606
What happened yesterday?
Are you stalking my girlfriend?

135
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,940
Or are you mutual?

136
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,280
Just behind that alley

137
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,742
There is a building that our company uses as a logistics warehouse

138
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,785
What?

139
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,621
(U&K Logistics Warehouse)

140
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,666
Yes, there is.

141
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,794
I'm on my way to the warehouse
Seeing that the safety of my subordinates is seriously threatened

142
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,547
Even though she is your subordinate

143
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,425
But she's also my girlfriend
This should belong to our private life, right?

144
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,344
Because it affects work.

145
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,639
Just like the way you behaved when you arrived at the company today

146
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,020
It doesn't mean you will grow up when you get older.

147
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,689
You won't necessarily become a man.

148
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,526
Date children instead of men
Women will become unhappy

149
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,114
So for Kang Ji-won's sake
It would be better if you break up.

150
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,576
separate?

151
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,331
Minister, aren't you crossing the line?

152
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,209
Then just assume that I like Kang Ji-won

153
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,919
Like her?

154
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,421
You are...

155
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,591
No matter what

156
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,554
Don't do that to her again.

157
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,228
Minister, that's because you don't understand...

158
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,313
-What time is it now?
-What?

159
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,484
What are you doing

160
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,153
11:30

161
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,904
What are you doing?

162
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,783
You didn't hit her, did you?

163
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,577
Hmm? What?

164
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,580
You didn't hit her, did you?

165
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,665
Well, no

166
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,919
Could you please stop hitting her?

167
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,883
Can!

168
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,093
Can I be mature enough to not care about what happened yesterday?

169
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,055
Can!

170
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,570
What is going on?

171
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,821
What's that guy like?

172
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,699
hateful

173
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,788
-Minhwan
-Oh my god

174
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,791
How come you walk without making any sound?

175
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,753
You are really becoming more and more unsatisfactory.

176
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,506
Were you angry yesterday?

177
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,468
I thought about it, we...

178
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,679
If we break up now
What will happen to him and Jung Soo Min?

179
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,848
Feeling like something is going on

180
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,563
Was it painful yesterday?

181
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,733
I'm sorry I hit you.

182
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,154
But you know you're also wrong, right?

183
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,491
If you weren't so exaggerated
Why would that guy interfere?

184
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,494
I'm not the kind of rubbish that hits women.

185
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,329
Using violence is a crime

186
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,373
You treat your boyfriend like a criminal.

187
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,837
You're so stupid that you're driving me crazy

188
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,633
Before, it was because you put up with my temper.
That's why I kept enduring

189
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,014
From now on, I have to discipline you.

190
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,767
Let's go

191
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,898
He doesn't care too easily.

192
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,442
Will we not break up even if this happens?

193
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,403
Or has something changed?

194
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,781
No matter how hard I try, I can't imagine what Liu Zhihe has.

195
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,410
He said he was on his way to the logistics warehouse yesterday
See Us

196
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,787
I haven't done anything right.

197
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,623
Why don’t you come over here quickly?

198
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,749
oh

199
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,253
-Did you go straight home yesterday?
-What?

200
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,053
I'm going in.

201
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,140
Oh, yeah, of course.

202
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm going home too.

203
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,644
Your home is here.

204
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,898
This area is beautiful, very nice.

205
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,691
I feel good with you.

206
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,360
What?

207
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,157
But…

208
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,161
It's complicated between us, isn't it?

209
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,457
Yeah, yeah

210
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,345
Just today, I'm going to be honest with myself

211
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,611
Thank you for sending me back. Be careful.

212
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,701
Of course, where else could I go?

213
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,211
There must be something, otherwise he wouldn't just let it go.

214
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,090
It's hard to find someone like her.
Such a suitable woman to marry.

215
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,175
It was Liu Zhihe who was jealous of her.

216
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,302
She only has eyes for me

217
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,764
- I have to be on my guard.
- You have to be on your toes.

218
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,651
I like you

219
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,572
But if you don't like it, I won't do anything.

220
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,366
It won't make things difficult for you.

221
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,549
Kang Ji-won

222
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,802
Come to lunch with me

223
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,473
Agent Yang, do you know where this is? Come over here too.

224
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,149
Things turned out like this

225
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,443
I won't have lunch with you today.

226
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,069
So…

227
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,239
Xiumin is all alone

228
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,409
I don't want to eat

229
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,579
I'll just drink coffee in the lounge.

230
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,706
Oh, well...

231
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,668
Something is really unfolding.

232
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,966
All right

233
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,426
This won't work.

234
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,721
It's obvious if you skip a meal
You were already very thin.

235
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,434
Don't do this, Min-hwan
Why don't you take Xiumin out to eat something delicious?

236
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,355
-Delicious?
- I want to ask you

237
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,649
But because of the section chief...

238
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,443
Oh, yes.

239
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,238
Please
I'll use my credit card to express my feelings

240
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,574
-Is it really possible?
- Let's eat at a place with a good atmosphere

241
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,159
good

242
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,291
steak?

243
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,552
Sorry, I have too much to do.

244
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,054
Have you been waiting long?

245
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:14,352
Do you know Executive Director Wang Xingren?
The marketing executive

246
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,896
Do I have to see it before I can decide?

247
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,858
He is my father-in-law's distant cousin.

248
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,693
So I have a lot of things to help him.

249
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:28,282
You don't know anything.
How easy it is to wait for your paycheck

250
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,377
I don't know what's so good about soy sauce

251
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,213
Sashimi is supposed to be served with vinegar sauce, right?

252
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,467
Why don't you eat?

253
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,938
You really don't know how to eat

254
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,066
Sushi should not be eaten with chopsticks

255
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,322
But even if you don’t know how to eat, you still have the blessing of a noble person.
Where can I find a boss like me?

256
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:13,119
Just give me an idea.
I will send you Agent Yang who is very capable.

257
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,579
And beautiful staff

258
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,373
Not only that, I also found a general manager for you.

259
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,545
Even if the plan is not very rigorous
We still have to find a way to do it.

260
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,173
I will try my best

261
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,718
Alas, that's not the problem.

262
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,512
This is not an agent level job. Just work hard.

263
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:35,099
I don't mean to interfere with your work.

264
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,936
But I will lend you my name

265
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,149
It's all about making things work.
Otherwise why would I do this?

266
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:48,196
So I do everything.
And you want to sit back and reap the benefits?

267
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,034
Now that I think about it, that's too unrealistic.

268
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,702
This can't be done.

269
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,580
Where can I find a real gourmet restaurant?
Starting to make instant meal kits?

270
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,583
Let's replace the original packaging and materials

271
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,918
What is that called?

272
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:06,339
Yes, borrow the name of a famous chef to build a brand

273
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,841
Then use our company's distribution channels.

274
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,221
If you push it well
It should be available this summer

275
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,931
No…

276
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,391
Three-minute meatballs, just pack well

277
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,311
Add the name of a famous chef and it becomes a high-end steak.

278
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,562
You can't do that.

279
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:24,607
What?

280
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,570
The focus of this project is
It is convenient to make delicious food at home

281
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,113
What kind of logic is that?

282
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:35,868
That is your personal focus!
My main goal is to become the Deputy Minister

283
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,788
Let Yang Zhulan be the section chief

284
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,415
That way you will have a future

285
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,752
People of your rank, just do as you're told.

286
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,839
You can't do this.

287
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,425
You are stubborn, you don't know how to do things, you are so stupid

288
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,219
But

289
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,929
- This project
-never mind

290
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,555
You exit

291
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,268
Section Chief

292
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,186
Chief, this is my project proposal.

293
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,399
You are so funny

294
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,817
How come this project is yours?

295
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,654
Strictly speaking, this is the company's

296
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,864
I approve the development

297
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,700
Agent Yang also helped

298
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,410
So what should we do with the idea proposed by Agent Yang?

299
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:23,499
Kang Ji-won, we did this together
Why do you take it upon yourself?

300
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,001
Don't you want to stay in the company for a long time?

301
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,962
From today on, you quit

302
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,924
Handed over to Yang Zhulan and Zheng Xiumin

303
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,655
Isn't this a very classy place?

304
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,950
This is not enough to entertain you.

305
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,202
Really?

306
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,663
I'm so happy

307
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,792
Isn't there that lunch?

308
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,169
Just the one I usually eat.

309
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,047
Which kind of wine do you want?

310
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,343
Don't drink what I stored here.

311
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,970
Any good wines today?

312
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,015
I recommend the best wine to go with today's set menu

313
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,809
Henri Briant, 2008

314
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:27,146
French oak aging method
The flavor is deeper...

315
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,690
He is indeed a good man.

316
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:34,028
He has style, knows a lot, and is an employee of a large company.

317
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,782
He is one of the people that Kang Ji-won has dated.
The best one

318
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,960
Pretty little things
You're totally obsessed with me now, right?

319
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,421
The characteristic is that you can feel its flavor

320
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,590
What kind of wine would you like?

321
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:00,805
- The last one has flavor
-Okay, I'll prepare it for you right away.

322
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:09,230
Did you sleep well yesterday?

323
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,568
I couldn't sleep all night.

324
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:24,787
And you?

325
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,083
How could I possibly sleep well?

326
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,607
Flavor

327
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,700
Section Chief

328
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,953
Do you really want to remove Agent Jiang?

329
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,707
What? Can't we do without her?

330
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,169
It's not a good idea to remove the proposer.

331
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,088
She is right.

332
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,340
In my humble opinion

333
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,886
I also think it’s not a good idea to just change the packaging.

334
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,054
-Who said we were going to do this?
-What?

335
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,934
Although we want to simplify the process, we can't do that.

336
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,520
That will be a real quick-cooking meal package.

337
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,066
Please list a few good restaurants.
The kind that everyone knows at a glance

338
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,321
But just now...

339
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,698
Wang Xingren will promote this plan

340
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,867
But too many people participated

341
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,328
The name of the executive should also be listed above

342
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,333
Did you do that on purpose?

343
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,585
Yes, intentional

344
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,842
The food is pretty much the same anyway
Find a business person who knows how to do business

345
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,012
Good-looking and photogenic ones are better.

346
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,396
Wake up, or I'll take you away?

347
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,358
Frankly speaking, if it weren't for me

348
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:22,196
The person who became the section chief by this project proposal
Will it be you or Kang Ji-won?

349
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,336
Although I decided to fight him.
But how to fight?

350
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,551
(Card amount: 340,000 won)

351
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,929
(340,000 KRW)

352
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,014
340,000 won?

353
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,016
What?

354
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,268
Is he crazy?

355
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,567
Because I didn't know how to fight with people before
That's why you live so miserably

356
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,318
If you don't understand, learn

357
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:05,781
I don't want to be robbed of everything by heartless people again

358
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,907
No

359
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,746
I won't be robbed of anything this time.

360
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:21,088
He didn't bypass you and report directly to me

361
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,675
Section Chief Jin is my distant relative

362
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,554
He is good at his job, but he is unlucky.

363
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:34,018
This time he came up with a very good idea

364
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,270
I am also writing a project for a quick-cooking meal package

365
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,691
I'm not helping him because I'm his relative.

366
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:44,028
I asked the development team and they said it was pretty good.

367
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,654
Let's go ahead.

368
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,073
By the way, Minister Liu

369
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,909
Your personnel performance evaluation is too stingy.

370
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:55,789
Leaders should know how to train their subordinates in a timely manner

371
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,084
If the water is too clear, the fish will not survive.

372
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:03,464
He has been the section chief for a long time.

373
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,715
He's old too.

374
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,219
I'll find out

375
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,846
OK, go ahead.

376
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:13,515
Thank you for your hard work

377
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,979
Why is he always so rigid?

378
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:22,566
So what if his last name is Liu?
Could he be a distant relative of the president?

379
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:35,871
(Liu Zhihe, Head of Marketing Group 1)

380
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,044
The project you mentioned by the Han River
how's it going?

381
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,425
(I'm working on it, thanks)

382
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,307
He's sharper than he looks.

383
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,434
I like you very much

384
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,314
But I have to rely on my own strength

385
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,736
Do you have a date tonight?

386
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,832
(I'll probably be working late)

387
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,254
There are more important things than work, please make time for it

388
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,221
I'm not looking for you, don't worry.

389
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,656
Could you tell me what it is?

390
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,742
I don't think you'd want my help.

391
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,828
I'm just doing what I can to help you.

392
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,540
- Minister, I...
-No request for anything in return

393
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,880
You make me uncomfortable

394
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,257
Why? Do you like rewards?

395
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,638
Would you like to just accept my unconditional kindness?

396
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,517
I do what I want without asking for anything in return.

397
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,062
It's not easy to find someone who can take advantage of you.

398
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,024
-But…
- If you still feel uncomfortable

399
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,359
I will order you as your boss.

400
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,059
Oh, brother, you are here?

401
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,061
Hello, big sister

402
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,647
You are still so beautiful

403
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,274
Have we met?

404
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,697
He will act familiar whenever he sees a beautiful woman
Hello, I'm Kim Shin-woo and he's Cho Dong-seok

405
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,032
Yes, hello

406
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,200
Hello

407
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,245
They are my juniors in the university club

408
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,163
Do you like judo?

409
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,875
Actually, I am a reserve player for the national team.

410
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,795
Taekwondo, but I'm also good at judo

411
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,088
oh

412
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,342
-What's going on?
-Come

413
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,260
(Kang Ji-won)

414
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,056
What's this?

415
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,891
Go change your clothes.

416
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,646
Change this?

417
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,196
As you just saw, it takes only one shot to knock someone down.

418
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,533
Judo is basically physics.
It is easier to understand if you think of it as a lever.

419
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,993
Catch, knock down

420
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,536
- Catch and knock down
-right

421
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,621
Do you want to try it?

422
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:05,998
Oh, okay

423
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,626
catch

424
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,628
- Catch it, yes
-catch

425
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,297
Trip someone's feet

426
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,756
Knock down

427
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,843
- Knock down
- Knock down

428
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,764
-Why can't I fall over?
- Knock down

429
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,435
Come on, shout louder

430
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,314
Start Over

431
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,025
again!

432
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,003
Use all your strength!

433
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,598
You did it, sister. You did it.

434
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,059
-Success
- I knocked you down

435
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,394
You succeeded. You succeeded.

436
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,941
Now that you have the basics, let’s start practicing.

437
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,235
Actual combat?

438
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,200
The first step to victory

439
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,286
Just stand on the mat and face your opponent

440
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:29,831
This is the way to fight

441
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,210
Catch Me

442
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,842
They usually won't let you catch them so easily.

443
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:42,719
but…

444
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,640
Sometimes they'll let you catch

445
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,316
Because they know you can't take them down anyway

446
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,286
I will really knock you down

447
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,957
If you hesitate to fight
Don't stand on the mat at the beginning

448
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,835
Once you're on the mat, there's only one thing to think about.

449
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,838
Knock down the opponent

450
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,757
Knock down the opponent

451
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,051
Hold him tight

452
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:28,974
-call out
-call out

453
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,288
The basics of Judo are pushing and pulling

454
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,625
When your strength is insufficient
Use the opponent's strength

455
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,463
certainly

456
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,923
I think it's okay not to fight in person

457
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,801
You can ask for help

458
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,806
Ask for someone like me who can help you fight.

459
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,419
I succeeded. I really succeeded.

460
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,754
I succeeded

461
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,423
I succeeded

462
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,011
You didn't expect that I would really knock you down, did you?

463
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,515
But you were a little lax just now, right?

464
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,872
Well done

465
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,857
He just asked me to treat it as a real battle, not to let her

466
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,402
-Wasn't he knocked down too easily just now?
-yes

467
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,154
He just jumped up and fell down

468
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,822
He jumps very high

469
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,548
Thank you so much today

470
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,008
Don't forget to shout

471
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,302
You are really good at fighting.

472
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,263
Like cockfighting?

473
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:17,017
The most righteous cockfighting in the world

474
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,647
Once you're on the mat, there's only one thing to think about.

475
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,240
Team Leader Jin, how are your performance?

476
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,287
If performance is not good, you will lose your job

477
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,999
Stand on the mat and face your opponent

478
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,678
I follow your opinion

479
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,430
Revised the plan

480
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,981
And yesterday's incident

481
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,525
terribly sorry

482
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,127
This is mine

483
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,132
I gave you this because you thought
No one has the ideas you have.

484
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,263
(General Convener: Wang Xingren
Proposers: Jin Jingxu, Yang Zhulan, Zheng Xiumin)

485
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,141
What? Your name isn't on it?

486
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,185
Isn't this a matter of course?

487
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:43,687
This case was originally mine.

488
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,566
But now I have become a regular-level person
There is no place to put your name in the case being promoted

489
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:56,700
Chief, could you give me a chance?

490
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,245
Is that so?

491
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,206
So…

492
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,002
Combine this with the one you are preparing.
Submit after integration

493
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,796
I'll decide based on your performance.

494
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,673
Do you want to put your name?

495
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,009
good

496
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,267
sorry

497
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,313
You helped a lot, but it's a bad situation.

498
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,480
I'm really sorry

499
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,694
So we must put the name of Zheng Xiumin
Put it on, huh?

500
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:37,991
Forget it, he's even upset about having to put your name on it.

501
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,617
Thank you for your concern

502
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,537
Eat it

503
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,258
how?

504
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,053
This seems to be...

505
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,888
Using goats running in New Zealand

506
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:05,018
After giving birth to my second child with my beloved husband
Basque cheesecake made with goat's milk

507
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,102
What?

508
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,604
Where did you buy this?

509
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,399
Werther?

510
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:14,486
This is a restaurant owned by my friend.

511
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,655
He just called

512
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,116
-Should I take it?
-good

513
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:24,996
Hello?

514
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,665
Did you receive the cake?

515
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,795
Well, I'm eating with my colleagues.

516
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,714
Who sent such an excellent cake?

517
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:37,133
This is what love is all about

518
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:39,552
What?

519
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,638
-It means it's delicious
-Is that so?

520
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,766
Great, that's what I did.

521
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:46,726
Did you make it yourself?

522
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,145
-You can bake too?
-Um

523
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:52,857
I will make desserts for important people myself

524
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,777
Enjoy

525
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,237
Thank you, I will enjoy it

526
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,784
benefactor

527
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,954
Are you in a relationship with that friend?

528
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,081
no

529
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,419
What are you talking about? I have a boyfriend.

530
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,213
Yes

531
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,592
I'm sure he likes you.

532
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:23,179
Without heart, you can't make such a delicious cake

533
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:29,018
Back to the point
Do you really want to do what Chief Jin said?

534
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:34,315
I was so stupid for losing my temper

535
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,694
He didn't intend to do that.

536
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,029
What?

537
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:45,034
He gave me the plan
I just changed a few words in my proposal.

538
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,828
God

539
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,498
So he is trying to get rid of you?

540
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,005
Oh my god, he's really bad.
Working with a bad heart

541
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,716
It's really unbearable to watch.

542
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,760
Did you know that Judo is all about pushing and pulling?

543
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,224
Jin Jingxu underestimated me

544
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,560
So he let me grab the corner of his judo uniform

545
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,147
I thought I couldn't knock him down.

546
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,734
Why are we suddenly talking about judo?

547
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,743
I don't want to imagine Kim Kyung-wook wearing a judo uniform

548
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,876
Judo is a great sport
When you shout, your mood changes

549
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:38,922
Yell? I know what that's like.

550
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,549
Although it's nothing, but shouting will make a difference

551
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,598

552
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,225

-sorry

553
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:56,105
What about Agent Yang?

554
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:07,659
You should feel bad.

555
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,788
You didn't mean to do that, but because of the section chief...

556
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:17,585
Sometimes being competent is a problem, right?

557
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,171
No, it's not because I can do it.

558
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:22,799
I really love Ji Won

559
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:27,095
But there are principles to follow in work

560
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:31,766
Don't worry too much, you did nothing wrong

561
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,436
Ji Won is good at everything

562
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,648
Too upright, not flexible

563
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:43,319
But there is no way
That's how she got into a Korean university

564
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,363
Let's forgive her.

565
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,033
You are a really good friend.

566
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:56,416
I also want to be your good sister

567

I'm not as smart as Ji Won, I'm stupid

568
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,802
I just know that you'll have a good outcome this time
I will also have good results

569

570

571
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,519
You are very capable and savvy.

572
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,940

581
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:06,152

582
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:09,238

What? She's still doing everything?

717
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:17,036
No wonder she was talking about raising objections.

718
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,121
What? Did she call you?

719
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:22,541
Yes, she complained that her name was not included.

720
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,419
Kill this clueless guy immediately.

721
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,296
I'm so pissed off.

722
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:31,300
What was he talking on the phone about on the plane?

723
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,928
What are you doing?

724
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,271
Hey, come here.

725
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,320
- Were you laughing just now?
-What?

726
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:55,282
I was talking on the phone just now and you were laughing
Do you look down on me?

727
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,036
I'm sorry, General Manager, I will educate her again

728
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,038
I'm here to serve you

729
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,879
This should have been done long ago.

730
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:13,133
General Manager, please keep your seat back upright during takeoff.

731
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,052
Fasten your seatbelts…

732
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,555
Are you kidding?

733
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,308
You really can't do this.

734
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,643
Hello

735
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,396
Call someone bigger than you

736
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:31,652
I'm the business class cabin crew leader.
And it is illegal to assault flight attendants...

737
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,990
What do you mean by violence?
I just clicked on you.

738
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,409
General Manager, violence against flight attendants...

739
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,035
You really are...

740
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,747
I was just holding it like this, you came over and bumped into it

741
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,374
Isn’t it?

742
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,711
How dare you do this to me?

743
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:50,879
What are you looking at? Is there anything good to see?

744
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:54,717
He actually hit the flight attendant

745
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,510
Isn't he famous for being kind?

746
00:59:57,678 --> 01:00:01,098
Not long ago, a commotion on a passenger plane caused controversy

Indicates that the product with A's photo printed on it will be

763

Fully recycled and scrapped

764
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:11,126
You didn't tell me that Kang Ji-won who wrote the project proposal
Is it handled well?

765
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,252
Let me go

766
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:16,340
Let me go, I told you to let me go!

How dare you touch my body?

768

Why don't you let me go?

769
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:24,640
So at this time
U&K's whack-a-mole bully is still in the company?

770
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:29,395
All of them should be in the name of Wang Xingren, the executive

771
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,480
You'll all be fired!

772
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,513
Oh my god, that scared me.

773
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,894
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

774
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:14,356
No, it's okay.

775
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,942

778
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,165
You've worked hard

779
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,427
Then I'll take my leave.

780
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,096
Wait, Minister.

781
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,280
BTS oh I like them too

782
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,868
In fact, according to my current mood
I want to listen to Dynamite

783
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,536
But I can't find it no matter how hard I try

784
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:13,290
Dynamite is great
Although I personally like "Spring Day"

785
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,250
I also like Spring Day

786
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,304
That is...

But let's try it this time. You can go

790
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,356
He was the one who told me there was a class reunion.

791
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:40,317
By the way, Jiwon, do you have a stomachache?

792
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,570
I'm worried that Park Min-hwan will hurt you

793
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,322
People don't change

794
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,575
What I have done before I will do again

795
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:01,380
"Haruhi"?

796
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,429
Do you mean Dynamite?

797
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,109
(Dynamite, 2020)

798
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:36,039
(Spring Day, 2017)

799

(It is now July 10, 2013)

800
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:03,358
What is supposed to happen will eventually happen.

801
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:04,693
I won't run away

802
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,404
My time was over then.

803
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,823
-elder brother
- Yesterday after you got off work

804
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,743
Go back to Cheongdam-dong with her
Are you working overtime too?

805
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,369
I will help you, no matter what

806
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:16,955
Kang Ji-won, how is it?
Feeling like Park Min-hwan?

807
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:20,375
If you want something, you will do whatever it takes to get it.

808
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,586
If you really want it, you will

809
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,254
You are more qualified

810
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,592
Because you will still be alive in ten years.
