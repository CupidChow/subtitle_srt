JUNGRIMCHEON BEWARE OF RAPIDS

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,510
Your necklace.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,840
It's really pretty.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,970
Let's go.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,860
The flag is just down here.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,650
Flag one.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,900
What?

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,450
- What's that?
- What?

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,000
I think someone already got it.

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,600
Goodness.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,650
You're incredible.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,560
I wondered who'd
dare go in there.

13
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,820
It was you?

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,240
You're incredible.

15
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,820
I want to be solid land.

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,620
- Hui-yeon.
- Yeah?

17
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,790
What does it mean when
someone wants to be land?

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,250
Like when asked what you want
to become or do in the future.

19
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,550
Maybe they meant lamb?

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,760
Oh, man. Now I'm hungry.

21
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,260
Maybe it was something else.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,890
Who said it? You
should just ask them.

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,810
Well...

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,150
It's hard to ask them.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,940
Is it Mr. Park?

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,360
You shouldn't be like that.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,910
My husband said things I never
understood, and I couldn't ask him too.

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,910
Especially between lovers,

29
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,750
you should share future
goals or bucket lists!

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,250
You won the camper today.

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,130
Sneak him into your
car and ask him.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,760
What are you saying? So dirty!

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,090
Married women are so...

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,970
<i>I can't do that.</i>

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>Min-hwan can't be
with me tonight.</i>

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,730
<i>In the past, I got number four
which was the single tent,</i>

37
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,070
<i>and Su-min got number
one, the camper.</i>

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,030
<i>And that night...</i>

39
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,870
Hey, I can't sleep
in a sleeping bag.

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,990
Let's go sleep somewhere else.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,540
<i>We left and came back at dawn.</i>

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,410
I'll die if I sleep here.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,080
<i>We drank so we were
overheated. It was horrifying.</i>

44
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,590
Hey.

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,260
- Hey!
<i>- If I'm in the camper,</i>

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,010
<i>Su-min will be in
the single tent.</i>

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,850
<i>If so...</i>

48
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,770
Today could be D-Day.

49
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,850
What?

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,310
Nothing.

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,940
I should go out.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,490
You're going out again?

53
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,360
You found the number
one. Just rest.

54
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,410
We still have time. I
have to follow the rules.

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,540
Goodness.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,200
She's so inflexible.

57
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,630
That was dangerous and reckless.

58
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,600
I know I won't
die from drowning.

59
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,640
What scares me the most

60
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,230
is living the same life as
before with this second chance.

61
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,610
In order to not do
that, I can do anything.

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,840
So since you have
the number one flag,

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,130
has fate changed?

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,050
Or is there a chance that Su-min will
take it before you sleep in the camper?

65
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
I don't know.

66
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,140
Then...

67
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,520
But there's one
thing that's certain.

68
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,400
Park Min-hwan borrowed
money from me,

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,150
and he bought a necklace
before coming here.

70
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,070
He's simple-minded.

71
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,280
It's his killer move to
get into a woman's pants.

72
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,450
I got it too.

73
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,960
It's so pretty, babe.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,500
It's nothing much.

75
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,630
Are you saying he bought
the same necklace?

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,220
No, it's a bit
different. This one...

77
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,100
It looked quite expensive.

78
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,850
I must've been easier to him.

79
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,730
It's okay.

80
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,650
I'm doing all this to
escape someone like him.

81
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,780
I'll only take what's good.

82
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,910
You should.

83
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,290
That's how you'll
make today D-Day?

84
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,080
Yes. First, I'll make sure
Su-min gets number four.

85
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,340
Then I'll get Min-hwan wasted.

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,010
Okay, I'll be rooting for you.

87
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,300
As much as I can.

88
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,470
Okay, I'll root for...

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,520
By the way, what did you say
you wanted to be earlier?

90
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,230
Lamb? Lamp?

91
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,520
What was it? Or maybe champ?

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,440
Was that it?

93
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,240
Not me! Get someone else!

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,070
Can't you get someone else?

95
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,570
Someone else!

96
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,870
You're out.

97
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,550
Who the heck has number one?

98
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,760
No one here would
go in the water.

99
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,180
Except for Ji-won.

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,650
I've never had nice things before,
so protecting this is so hard.

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,850
Sorry, Ji-won!

102
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,770
Let go!

103
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,280
You scared me!

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,700
My bracelet's stuck!

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,950
Be still. Don't move.

106
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,620
That hurts!

107
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,670
Are you mad?

108
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,420
This is just a game.

109
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,930
And this wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't tried to get me.

110
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,750
What's wrong with me?

111
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,630
Why am I worried?

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,620
Ji-won, you're out!

113
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,920
I knew you'd come back.

114
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,130
Did you really go
into the water?

115
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,800
So this is why you
impress everyone.

116
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,600
Find someone who's glamping.

117
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,220
Thanks for this.

118
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,980
Hello, everyone.

119
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,900
I hope you're having fun.

120
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,780
Anyway, I didn't know you'd all
participate so enthusiastically.

121
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,070
You're all so great.

122
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,820
Now,

123
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,160
which female employee will
get to sleep in the camper?

124
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,950
Number one, come out!

125
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,900
BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
<i>MARRY MY HUSBAND</i> BY SUNGSOJAK

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,720
Who is it?

127
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,810
What? Really?

128
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,900
It's me!

129
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,030
Please come forward.

130
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,290
I'll give you the
key to your camper!

131
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,120
Congratulations!

132
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,670
Find someone who's glamping.

133
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,250
Thanks for this!

134
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,730
Isn't sleeping in a camper
better than glamping?

135
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,730
The camper is right
in front of me,

136
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,360
so why would I
consider glamping?

137
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,130
Congratulations, Ms. Kang
Ji-won from Marketing Team 1!

138
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,590
Let's give her a
round of applause!

139
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,260
Congratulations!

140
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,680
Next, let's see which male
employee won the camper.

141
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,810
Who found the number one flag?

142
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,770
Please come to the front!

143
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,900
Come on up!

144
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,950
Happy you beat me?

145
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,620
You know I can't
just sleep anywhere.

146
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,420
Same goes for me.

147
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,090
Really?

148
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,970
Then why did I think you could
sleep just about anywhere?

149
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,470
Because I did so for you.

150
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
What?

151
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,140
Nothing, I'm going.

152
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,530
Why are you like this to me?

153
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,570
What do you mean?

154
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,110
You won't let me win.

155
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,330
How much longer will
you keep this up?

156
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,500
I feel like I've become
a bad person now.

157
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,420
You're too harsh to me lately.

158
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,350
I don't...

159
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,440
like you anymore.

160
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,820
I tried not to show it, but
I failed. I'll just tell you.

161
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,570
I just started to hate you.

162
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,820
You whine and try to act cute.

163
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,580
You think my things are
yours. It's annoying.

164
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,160
You yielded them to me!

165
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,340
Is it bad I took
that for granted?

166
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,880
You made me this way. What
am I supposed to do now?

167
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,300
You're right. I always yielded

168
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,180
and let you whine.

169
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,430
So I'm going to stop now.

170
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,980
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

171
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,980
I'll start a new family.

172
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,610
I can't be tied to you forever.

173
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,290
Thanks for bringing
it up first. Bye.

174
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,140
I feel like a bad person.

175
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,980
She's the one that was wrong.

176
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,360
She's the bad one. I only
said what I should say, but...

177
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,770
You're just too good.

178
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,530
You're not bad enough
to hurt others.

179
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,250
But I know better than anyone.

180
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,920
You did what you had to.

181
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,140
Good job.

182
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,820
<i>Su-min must want to punish me.</i>

183
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,580
<i>If she thinks I'm being like
this because of Min-hwan,</i>

184
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,790
<i>it's obvious how she'll
try to punish me.</i>

185
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,330
- I can't drink anymore.
- What? You have to finish your shot.

186
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,420
- Gosh, I...
- Drink it.

187
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,620
What are you doing here?

188
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,880
Shall we talk?

189
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,100
How did you know
that I wanted...

190
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,900
to talk to you?

191
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,530
I can tell by your face.

192
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,120
Did you drink a lot?

193
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,080
Do you have a lot on your mind?

194
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,920
Just a little.

195
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,670
I feel uneasy.

196
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,720
Just a little.

197
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,530
Do you want...

198
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,070
to sleep with me?

199
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,120
Will it change anything?

200
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,250
You're Ji-won's boyfriend,
and I'm her other half.

201
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,550
Is it the alcohol?

202
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,720
I only care about
who's in front of me.

203
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,780
Me too.

204
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,790
I drank a lot.

205
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,400
I only need you too.

206
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,450
Maybe I'll push
her off somewhere.

207
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,500
You can't check your wounds

208
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,880
or your opponent's on the mat.

209
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,090
Focus only on two things.

210
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,840
"I decided to fight."

211
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,470
"And I will win."

212
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,730
I decided to fight.

213
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,740
And I will win...

214
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,860
The entire company is excited

215
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,740
about our marketing team lately!

216
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,790
Of course, since the
project's going so well.

217
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,750
We could go down in U&K
history at this rate!

218
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,830
I'm sorry, Hui-yeon.

219
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,170
Why would you be sorry?

220
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,460
The original sin
is with Mr. Kim.

221
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,130
And the boomer is Mr. Yu.

222
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,630
No wonder this is so fun!

223
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,220
Mr. Kim isn't here!

224
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,900
I hear aroused elks always
appear during workshops.

225
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,610
I finally get to see it!

226
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,020
Are you insane?

227
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,610
- What? I want to...
- Let's go.

228
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,110
Seriously! Just once!

229
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,110
No, let's go.

230
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,460
I think I found
Su-min so pretty.

231
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,250
When I first met her at 15,

232
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,380
I couldn't believe someone so
pretty and nice was my friend.

233
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,010
I was so proud. It was nice.

234
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,480
So I wanted to protect her.

235
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,650
And Min-hwan...

236
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,030
He was such a jerk.

237
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,120
But I needed someone
to trust and lean on.

238
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,410
And after we got married,

239
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,170
I put up with him even more.

240
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,590
Aren't I such a fool?

241
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,880
It's all over now.

242
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,850
Stop thinking about them.

243
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,430
Think about one thing today.

244
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,600
Kang Ji-won won.

245
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,570
I haven't...

246
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,330
had someone touch my
hand this affectionately

247
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,330
in a long time.

248
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Since I came back to 2013,

249
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,600
I've felt so lonely
since I was alone.

250
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,150
So I'm glad I have you.

251
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,650
Thank you.

252
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,030
To be honest,

253
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,410
my life is like a
well-written novel.

254
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,130
A life without any
worries or obstacles.

255
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,340
Just well-written.

256
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,430
So I'm glad I came back,

257
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,060
and I'm happy I get to
talk to you like this.

258
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,940
I should thank you.

259
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,790
You never keep it simple.

260
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Is that so?

261
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,010
What did you say earlier?
What do you want to be?

262
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,510
I'll help you for
helping me too.

263
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,100
I told you, I don't want
anything from you in return.

264
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,020
I'm being honest,
but you're not.

265
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,980
Then I won't let you help me.

266
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,570
Let's say I said champ.

267
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,780
No, you didn't.

268
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,200
Are you lying?

269
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,780
It's true.

270
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,750
Ji-won.

271
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,430
Did you sleep well when your boyfriend
was sleeping in a sleeping bag?

272
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,850
You're so cold-hearted.

273
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,600
Did you really sleep there?

274
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,020
Where else, then?

275
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,440
My selfish girlfriend
slept in the camper.

276
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,230
Weren't you even worried your
boyfriend might be too cold overnight?

277
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,700
I was, so I went to you with hand
warmers, but you weren't there.

278
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,740
I guess I was in
the bathroom then.

279
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,000
Yes.

280
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,210
You could've just
left them there.

281
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,080
Where's your common sense?

282
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Where's Su-min?

283
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,880
How should I know
where your friend is?

284
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,390
Where did she sleep?

285
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,510
I don't know.

286
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,850
Something happened between us
yesterday, and it's uncomfortable.

287
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,770
Uncomfortable?

288
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,820
Did you fight?

289
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,110
Women are always fighting
and making up. Goodness.

290
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,790
What?

291
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,080
Let's go eat breakfast.

292
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,810
Su-min.

293
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,190
This isn't your tent.

294
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,980
Where were you last night?

295
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,150
I was drunk, so I slept over
there. I just left my stuff here.

296
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,490
Did you drink a lot too?

297
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,990
I was able to sober up a bit after
a walk with Hui-yeon last night.

298
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
I see.

299
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,540
Let's not tell Ji-won.

300
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
What?

301
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,300
It's not like she'll break up
with me. She'll only get hurt.

302
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,010
You're close friends.
It's unnecessary.

303
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,150
Let's just be realistic.

304
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,780
As you said, things are
too complicated between us.

305
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,910
Instead of rolling around
in a messy reality,

306
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,660
let's keep it as a
beautiful memory.

307
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,700
Is it too greedy of me?

308
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,500
Let's go eat.

309
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm so hungover.

310
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,790
Okay.

311
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,050
Why can I never get the best?

312
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,140
What?

313
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,640
The workshop sucked.

314
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,770
I wanted to sleep in a
camper or a glamping tent.

315
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,900
You'll have other chances.

316
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,070
Failure is the
mother of success.

317
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,070
You're right.
Nothing's impossible.

318
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,080
This is so nice!

319
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,710
Babe!

320
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,670
Here.

321
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,300
I'm so hungry.

322
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,760
Let's see the food
over here first.

323
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,220
Babe, here. You like this.

324
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,150
Wow! It's been so long
since I had an orange!

325
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,320
Here's a melon!

326
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,860
Avocado! Wow!

327
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,490
Let's see.

328
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,120
Can this help digestion?

329
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,030
<i>I don't think it
went as expected.</i>

330
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,780
<i>I've been with Su-min for 26
years, and 17 years with Min-hwan.</i>

331
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,990
<i>I'm sure something happened.</i>

332
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,070
<i>Then...</i>

333
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>When I felt something was off, all my
ex-boyfriends broke up with me right away.</i>

334
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,130
<i>Min-hwan was the first
to do it behind my back.</i>

335
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,340
<i>I thought it was
because of marriage.</i>

336
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,050
<i>But if Min-hwan is more of
a scumbag than I thought...</i>

337
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,690
<i>It means</i>

338
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,350
<i>it's not over yet.</i>

339
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,540
Why are you so full of energy?

340
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,040
I hit a homerun!

341
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,000
What? With your
girlfriend's friend?

342
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,380
Shut up!

343
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,550
Wow! Seriously?

344
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,850
But she's her best friend.

345
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,760
I'll tell you in one sentence.

346
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,730
Autumn was coming,

347
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,770
and the night air was sexy!

348
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,070
What the... Okay,
let's try again.

349
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,200
Can you handle the consequences?
You work in the same office.

350
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,840
OUT ON BUSINESS LOG

351
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,260
PARK MIN-HWAN, JEONG SU-MIN

352
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,180
ACTIVITIES: JOMART TASTING EVENT

353
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
What's this?

354
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,640
You're going to Jomart.

355
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,930
It'll be tiring.

356
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,020
Why me?

357
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,480
Shouldn't you go instead?

358
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,440
Right, you guys fought.

359
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,360
Don't talk nonsense. I
have a presentation today.

360
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,530
A presentation? The slides
must be all ready, right?

361
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,700
I'll do it.

362
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,700
Is there a problem?

363
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,710
No, not at all, sir.

364
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,670
Mr. Park, shall we go?

365
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Yes.

366
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,270
I'll get going, Ms. Kang.

367
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,330
Su-min's so smart.

368
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,410
She's working so hard. I hope
she becomes a full-time employee.

369
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,920
<i>To my other half, Ji-won.</i>

370
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,470
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
know how you felt.</i>

371
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,510
<i>You're everything to me,</i>

372
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,350
<i>and I think it made me
blind to your feelings.</i>

373
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,440
<i>I just blindly
believed you loved me.</i>

374
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,690
<i>I didn't think about whether
I deserved your love.</i>

375
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:51,110
<i>So everything you said and
everything you feel towards me...</i>

376
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,700
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

377
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:59,580
<i>Still, can't you forgive me?</i>

378
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,830
<i>You're too precious to me.
I can't live without you.</i>

379
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,750
<i>I'm going to wait
until you feel better.</i>

380
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,630
<i>If I knock and you ever want to
reopen your closed heart to me,</i>

381
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,340
<i>will you smile as
if nothing happened?</i>

382
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,100
<i>You're my other half.</i>

383
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,430
<i>We can't just end
things like this.</i>

384
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,070
If I hadn't seen the end,

385
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,120
would I have been able

386
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,370
to not be swayed
after reading this?

387
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,550
She's a good writer.

388
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,430
Maybe she really means it.

389
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,790
- You're doing well. Hurry up.
- Yes, Chef.

390
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,860
I don't want to see you face.

391
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
I'm jealous.

392
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,040
My life is like a
well-written novel.

393
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,420
But if Kang Ji-won is the
one wrong sentence in it...

394
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,800
How would you feel?

395
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,840
Don't talk nonsense. Get up.

396
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,350
It's short and crooked.

397
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,190
The content and
writing is a mess too.

398
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,940
So it keeps catching my
eye and bothering me.

399
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,860
It opens to her
page when thrown.

400
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,410
There's nothing special to
find or remember in my life.

401
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,870
But only that part is so clear.

402
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,710
Nevertheless...

403
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,880
You're more qualified.

404
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,970
Because you'll be
alive after ten years.

405
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,000
ALLERGEN LABELING

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,950
<i>What is she thinking right now?</i>

U&K FOOD UDAM'S

408
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,990
The rosé goes there.
Make sure it's seen well.

TASTING EVENT

410
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,250
I'll try it.

411
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
What the hell?

412
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,730
It's so good. I
think it'll be a hit.

413
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,150
This is our new product,

414
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,440
so try and make people
taste all three products.

415
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,900
- Okay?
- Okay!

416
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,110
Also...

417
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,120
I'll get the allergy sign.

418
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,890
Let's do two groups.
Those who shop after work

419
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,050
and housewives.

420
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,180
We have to check
preference too. So...

421
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,390
I need to go pee.

422
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,560
Mr. Park!

423
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,310
Why haven't you started?

424
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,330
What are you doing?

425
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,580
Can you check this?

426
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,210
Yeah, sure.

427
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
What the...

428
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
What is this?

429
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,560
What do you think?

430
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,810
What?

431
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,650
We'll start the brief
on Chef's Table,

432
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,400
the meal kit project
set to launch next year.

433
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,400
CHEF AND MENU INTRODUCTION

434
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,320
The winner of <i>One Dinner,</i>

435
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,370
Lee Gwang-min's chicken dish
will be the pilot product.

436
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,160
Production will begin in the 1st quarter,
and it'll launch in the 2nd quarter.

437
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,540
Then we have Daniel
Kim, a traditional chef.

438
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,840
Along with Park Ji-ho who's popular
with those in their 20s and 30s...

439
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,890
Sir!

440
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,560
Well...

441
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,350
Thank you for trusting and
letting me take over this project.

442
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,030
Sure, you didn't trust me.

443
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:51,160
You just had no other choice
given the circumstances.

444
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,750
I'm sure that's why you suggested
it. Still, I was very thankful...

445
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,790
I just wanted to thank you...

446
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,960
That's not why.

447
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,970
I thought you would be
capable of doing it.

448
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,010
Pardon?

449
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,010
And finish your sentences.

450
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,680
Don't trail off
whenever you speak.

451
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,100
Just say, "Thank you."

452
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,480
Yes, sir.

453
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,650
And when you get both good and bad
feedback, remember the good one too.

454
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,110
Pardon?

455
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,780
I said you would be
capable of doing it.

456
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,540
Right.

457
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,000
Thank you.

458
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,170
Well, then.

459
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,770
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

460
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,790
I WANT TO DO IT

461
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,750
Wait.

462
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,250
What? Why?

463
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,210
What will you do?

464
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,630
What? You wanted to
do it! Let's do it!

465
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,090
What about us?

466
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,680
Are you toying with me?

467
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,480
I'll live with you both!

468
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,190
What?

469
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,270
Aren't you two like sisters?

470
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,070
In the old days, competent men
lived with sisters. It's nothing.

471
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,320
Damn it!

472
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,410
- Let go of me!
- Come on...

473
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,490
Just a second.

474
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,210
Excuse me.

475
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm the one in charge.

476
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,260
What's wrong?

477
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,970
My husband's allergic
to pine nuts!

478
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,720
But there wasn't
any allergy sign!

479
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,430
- What?
- What do we do?

480
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,930
Honey.

481
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,520
I'll get the allergy sign.

482
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,560
ALLERGEN LABELING: PINE NUTS

483
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,730
He should go to the hospital.

484
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,160
You must've been so scared, and
it's impossible to make up for it,

485
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,450
but we apologize!

486
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,580
How could a big company like
U&K make such a mistake?

487
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,540
I just don't understand.

488
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,750
We're very sorry.

489
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,180
Let it go. Nothing happened.

490
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,890
Things like this can
happen while you work.

491
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,390
Yes, sir.

492
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,600
Since it's just us,
we'll let it go.

493
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,350
If my daughter were here...

494
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,350
We apologize one more time.

495
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,820
Toss the receipt.

496
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,000
The ambulance fees
and hospital bills.

497
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,830
But compensation too?

498
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,170
If he had such a dangerous allergy,
shouldn't he have been more careful?

499
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,840
Everyone likes money.

500
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,430
If the company finds
out about this,

501
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,430
it'll be bad for us.

502
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,810
Paying them off is the easiest.

503
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,480
Still, you spent so
much of your own money.

504
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,730
It's okay. It's me!

505
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,070
I've gotten a good
return on stocks.

506
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,610
<i>- The CEO of TKU,</i>
- So... What?

507
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,450
<i>Oh Chang-gyu, fled overseas,
and it's been revealed only now.</i>

508
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,700
<i>A political emergency
is happening.</i>

509
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,330
<i>Oh was once investigated for his
relationship with politician Choi.</i>

510
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,290
<i>He claimed he was
innocent, expressing his...</i>

511
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,210
<i>According to TMB's coverage,</i>

512
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,090
<i>it's been 27 days since
he fled the country.</i>

513
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,800
<i>It has been revealed
that TKU employees</i>

514
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,590
<i>haven't been paid
wages for two months.</i>

515
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,720
What do I do?
Seriously? Damn it!

516
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,020
How about selling
everything now?

517
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,190
Who will buy it?

518
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,730
I already put it up for sale.

519
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,990
But everyone's
trying to sell now.

520
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,160
Then what do you have to do?

521
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,040
The transaction will be...

522
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,160
Why are you asking? So annoying!

523
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,790
Then you can't get a cent?

524
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:01,970
Ji-won.

525
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,430
The situation is much more
serious than you think.

526
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,100
I used credit.

527
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,350
Credit? What do you mean?

528
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,350
Then what do you have to do?

529
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,360
What's the point
of talking to you?

530
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,450
Yes, Ms. Yang.

531
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,580
Yes, I'm in the bathroom.

532
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,080
You dummy. The credit
isn't important.

533
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,130
I even took out a private loan.

534
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,050
He didn't mention
the private loan.

535
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,510
He didn't before too.

536
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,510
He never says things to hurt
his pride. He's not the type.

537
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,720
Just in case, keep
an eye on him.

538
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,980
I loved you.

539
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,190
What are you doing?

540
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,070
Was it our fate

541
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,070
to be a threesome,
not just two of us?

542
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,620
Are you possessed? I
don't understand you.

543
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,130
I'm going to marry Ji-won.

544
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,920
If we had more time,

545
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,090
I would've fallen
for you completely.

546
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,260
But this fate puts
the brake down.

547
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,220
Then...

548
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,850
Goodbye.

549
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,940
So keep my mouth shut?

550
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,570
What?

551
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,070
I won't...

552
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,410
say anything,
Min-hwan. Don't worry.

553
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,170
I just want you to be happy.

554
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,380
What?

555
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Happy?

556
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,030
Why does life suck so bad?

557
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,320
Drink slowly.

558
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,410
Hey.

559
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,290
Do you like me?

560
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,630
Of course, I do.

561
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,760
Thank you for liking
someone like me.

562
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,310
You said to drink
slowly, so I should.

563
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,980
I'm sorry.

564
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,190
I wanted to marry you next year,

565
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,980
but what's left...

566
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,660
is the Han River for me.

567
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,280
<i>He's asking for money
in such a literary way.</i>

568
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,250
Damn it!

569
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:25,380
You're young. You can earn
it again. I'm in no rush.

570
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,800
You can't say that.

571
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,890
Think of your age.
What about kids?

572
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,640
You don't want any kids.

573
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,020
You're more important to me.

574
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,350
<i>That's true.</i>

575
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,610
I'm a third-generation only son.

576
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,690
How can I only think of myself?

577
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,530
That's true.

578
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Then what should we do?

579
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,330
Ji-won?

580
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,130
Shall we get married?

581
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,090
I can't give you a
glamorous life as I planned.

582
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:16,600
But we'll be a better family
tomorrow than we are now.

583
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,180
I promise.

584
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,360
Family?

585
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,190
Family.

586
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,700
<i>I know you get weak
when I mention family.</i>

587
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,330
<i>What a crappy way to say you'll sponge
off me for life. You call that family?</i>

588
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,710
It took courage for me to
say that. What's with you?

589
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,420
Is it because I'm broke now?

590
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,630
You're not that type of snob.

591
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,970
<i>How funny, right?</i>

592
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,020
He wants to marry
without a penny.

593
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,440
No, he must want to marry
me now that he's broke.

594
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,530
This is the same as before.

595
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,320
He proposed to me, saying he'd
invest with his parents' money.

596
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:23,120
My debt started to get
bigger when that went south.

597
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,330
But he was the person I chose, so I
thought we'd work it out together.

598
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,210
He was selfish.

599
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,010
Anyway, all my choices
were backwards.

600
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,610
You'll get fat if
you eat like that.

601
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,540
I used to give a stray
cat food in college.

602
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,210
I wanted to bring him home,

603
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,010
but I was scared I couldn't
raise him properly.

604
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,920
Then...

605
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:20,340
the cat disappeared one day.

606
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,970
It was a cold winter.

607
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,390
I regretted it so much then.

608
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,730
He was so tiny. Like this big.

609
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,480
He had such a temper.

610
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,780
He got chased away after
trying to fight other cats.

611
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,200
He hated people, so I don't
think anyone took him.

612
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,550
To tell the truth,

613
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,010
I was discharged early.

614
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,470
It was similar to
a car accident.

615
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,480
Similar to a car accident?

616
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,790
Are you okay?

617
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

618
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,140
Are you okay?

619
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,860
<i>I ruptured my knee ligaments.</i>

620
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,860
I jumped in front of
a car to save a cat.

621
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,530
I didn't get hit, though.

622
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,290
Then...

623
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,790
the cat you're raising now...

624
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,800
It was the winter of 2005.

625
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,640
A cheese tabby
with a bad temper.

626
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,100
Doesn't like people.

627
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,570
Are you going to work out?

628
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,780
Hello?

629
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,410
Where'd they go?

630
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,870
Was it you? It
was you all along!

631
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,960
I thought you looked
similar. It was really you!

632
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,170
It's 20130419.

633
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,800
My passcode.

634
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,090
Come anytime.

635
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,180
Really? Can I?

636
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,890
Let's see each other more often!

637
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,980
You're so cute!

638
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,610
Either way, Mr. Park
must get married now.

639
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,030
Yes. Since he needs to
get money from his family.

640
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:35,870
His debts are probably about
half a billion won in total.

641
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,080
Maybe more.

642
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,340
It was worthwhile lending him

643
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,380
my money to make him
go all in with TKU.

644
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,970
But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.

645
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,220
So I came up with this plan.

646
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,480
Although,

647
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,770
I'll have to get
his crappy proposal.

648
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,780
It must be so annoying
for me, right?

649
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,410
But if I want to live a
long life, I must work hard.

650
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,200
He proposed on my birthday.

651
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,080
Everything he did was
tolerable back then.

652
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,750
But I hated it.

653
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,300
One, two, three.

654
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,710
I have to see that again?

655
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,420
Terrible, right?

656
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,340
It's my first birthday
after being reborn.

657
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,350
Ji-hyuk did?

658
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,020
Yes, sir.

659
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,610
Oh, right. Also...

660
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,370
NECESSITY OF R&D

661
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,450
TEST FLIGHT RESULTS

662
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,120
Wait, so this
technology is possible?

663
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,000
Apparently, the development
team says we can finally try it.

664
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,130
As you can see, those are
the test flight results.

665
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,300
U&K Aerobotics.

666
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,050
Shall I secure more stocks?

667
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,260
If this is possible, of course.

668
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,350
That's that. About
Ji-hyuk again.

669
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,560
What on earth is he
thinking right now?

670
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,190
Ji-won?

671
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,780
Min-hwan, what is all...

672
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,530
Don't say anything.

673
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,040
Tonight's for you.

674
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,420
My princess.

675
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,260
Kang Ji-won.

676
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,930
I love you.

677
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,340
Let me.

678
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:14,110
<i>I'll do everything I
can for you, Ji-won.</i>

679
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,570
<i>She won't know this
is cubic, right?</i>

680
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,860
<i>But it's not like
she'll toss it.</i>

681
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,950
<i>I won't let them marry.</i>

682
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,000
<i>You'd hate to see me happy.</i>

683
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,800
<i>Yes.</i>

684
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:41,220
<i>Please use whatever
means necessary</i>

685
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,680
<i>to marry my husband.</i>

686
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,120
<i>Ji-won jumped in
the water for me.</i>

687
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,290
Ji-won.

688
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,750
It's your turn to make me happy.

689
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,790
It was the best first birthday.

690
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,760
I'm engaged!

691
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,260
<i>I'm going to milk him for
the first and last time.</i>

692
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,800
She bought all this?

693
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,140
My mother-in-law
has high standards.

694
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:27,020
<i>Why are you here?</i>

695
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,560
Isn't the family meeting today?

696
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,890
I'm happy with now.

697
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,320
It's obvious what kind of
family she'll marry into.

698
