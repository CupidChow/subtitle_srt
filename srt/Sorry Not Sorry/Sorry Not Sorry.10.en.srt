1
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,198
Are you all right?

2
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,637
Yes, of course

3
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,177
Gosh, that scared me

4
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,246
I know, it just all of a sudden...

5
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:21,981
Did you get hurt?

6
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,283
No, I'm fine

7
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,217
Good

8
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,736
What brings you here, Ethan's mom?

9
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:54,981
I...

10
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,851
I want to get a divorce

11
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,054
I can't live like this anymore

12
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:06,392
Ethan's mom, did I hear that wrong?

13
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,560
No

14
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,896
You heard it right

15
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,999
I can't...

16
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,736
live with my husband anymore

17
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,676
Is there a reason why
you've come to that conclusion?

18
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,314
Say, did your husband verbally
abuse you? Or did his business fail?

19
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,163
I found this in his bag

20
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,000
At that moment, I felt certain

21
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,471
He must be seeing another woman

22
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,578
Do you have any idea who she may be?

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:21,034
[Sorry Not Sorry]

24
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,669
(One day ago)
Oh, wow

25
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,172
Your baby bump is really showing now

26
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,675
When are you due?

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,576
Next month

28
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,947
I got the C-section date set,
so I'll have to pack my bags soon

29
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,450
It's incredible how you're raising twins,

30
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,019
expecting another baby,
and still managing to be so competent

31
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,189
When I look at you,

32
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,892
I realize super working moms
are a real thing

33
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,261
I'm not a super working mom

34
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,896
It just happened

35
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,700
She didn't become a super working mom
because she wanted to

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,837
It's because she has three kids, and
her husband's business is barely surviving

37
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,180
By the way,

38
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,749
are you wearing perfume?

39
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,851
It smells nice

40
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,720
Do you like it?

41
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,723
It's Lanseage Affaire

42
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,759
It's a luxury perfume
I got it as a gift

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,328
Do you have that perfume, too?

44
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,865
I only have one because I got it as a gift
It's so expensive

45
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,467
How much is it?

46
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,838
I've looked it up, and the small bottle
costs over 200,000 won

47
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,972
Really?

48
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,010
I had no idea it was that expensive
and just accepted the gift

49
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,979
Who gave you such an expensive gift?

50
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,548
What?

51
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,053
Why would they give perfume
to a married woman?

52
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,524
My husband doesn't like me
wearing artificial scents

53
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,961
He prefers my natural body scent

54
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,463
Is that so?

55
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,599
I see

56
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,070
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

57
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,772
Mom!

58
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,340
My babies

59
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,613
Sia, Teo, did you have fun
with your friends today?

60
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,115
Yes, we had a great time with Jay

61
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,784
Really?

62
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,254
While Mommy's at the hospital
to deliver Ddoddo,

63
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,323
you two should get along well, okay?

64
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:23,923
Okay

65
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,024
Okay

66
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,025
Twin's mom

67
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,268
You should pay more attention to the kids

68
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:36,769
Sorry?

69
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,342
Apparently, Teo gave chocolate to Ethan

70
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,113
It's okay, Teo

71
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,449
What's wrong with that?

72
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,252
He probably just wanted to share
something tasty with his friend

73
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,959
I only feed Ethan organic foods
to keep him healthy

74
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,397
If your kid gives him processed foods,
my effort will go to waste

75
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,403
Eating some chocolate won't kill him

76
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,005
Excuse me, Ethan's mom

77
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,478
I'm doing my best as a mom, too

78
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,816
Teo, don't give him chocolate
from now on, okay?

79
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,651
Are you happy now?

80
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,454
I gave him a warning, so you can stop now

81
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,790
We'll get going, then

82
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,258
Let's go

83
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,512
Ethan's mom definitely overreacted

84
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,282
We even ate dirt on the playground
when we were little, but we were healthy

85
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,617
Tell me about it

86
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,287
No matter how I try,
I can't think well of her

87
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,725
It seems like she has
an inferiority complex towards me

88
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,630
If you think about it, she really might
have that inferior complex

89
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,433
She used to work at a big company
before she got married

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,669
She got employed
right after graduating from college

91
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,807
We all had great careers
when we were younger

92
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:26,045
If I hadn't quit my job,
I would've gotten a promotion by now

93
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,617
To be honest,
I may have looked at her pathetically

94
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,554
I mean, every time I do something,

95
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,391
she says, "I bet you don't know
because you're a working mom"

96
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,426
How can I smile at that?

97
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:46,332
It's all because her husband
looks down on her...

98
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,107
Does Ethan's dad look down on her?

99
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,776
Really?

100
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,216
The thing is...

101
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,954
Honey

102
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,723
Can I buy this gummy, please?

103
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,593
No, it's bad for your teeth

104
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,162
I'll eat one at a time

105
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,999
Gosh, sometimes it feels like
I'm raising three kids

106
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,567
Fine, go ahead

107
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,337
Just one

108
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,708
Why is it three kids?
We now have four

109
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,943
Unbelievable

110
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,782
Let's go around this way

111
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,184
Why?

112
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,453
I'd rather not run into her

113
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,723
She didn't even apologize to Song-yi

114
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,057
I don't want to talk to her

115
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,192
I mean...

116
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,395
They have really great meal kits these days

117
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:55,101
I can't cook all three meals every day

118
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:59,939
Hey, isn't that your job, though?

119
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,708
You're a housewife
You're supposed to cook three meals

120
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,546
I'm sorry

121
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,716
Why don't you just use meal kits
when my parents come over?

122
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,321
All you know is how to spend money
since you've never earned money before

123
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,090
I have earned money before

124
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,959
See? Thank goodness I came along

125
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,961
Why do you even need this?
It's a waste of money

126
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,174
(I ran into her couple
at the supermarket)

127
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,779
(He was being so mean to her
in front of everyone)

128
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:43,916
Why?

129
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,751
Does it still bother you?

130
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,690
Why is she putting up with that?

131
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,193
I noticed last time on Father's Day,

132
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,462
but I don't think Ethan's dad is a nice guy

133
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,464
They're both not nice people

134
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,272
Who puts up with getting treated like that
these days?

135
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,776
Well, they must get along in other areas

136
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,179
Remember what you always say

137
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,615
Don't mind other people's business

138
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,252
Why are you suddenly taking
her side, anyway?

139
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,524
You were cursing her earlier
about what she's done to Song-yi

140
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm not taking her side

141
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,096
What is it, then?

142
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,566
I don't know, it's annoying

143
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,205
Still, Ethan's reputation
isn't so bad among the dads

144
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,774
What's it like?

145
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,912
How should I put it?
He's a bit of a macho guy,

146
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,981
but he's smart and has good manners

147
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,750
Really?

148
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,054
Well, it sounds like
he's so full of himself

149
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,390
Just pretend you didn't see it

150
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,460
Nobody wants others to see the things
they'd rather keep hidden

151
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,063
Who said I'm going to say things?

152
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,271
Guess what? I didn't press the button

153
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,706
Yes, exactly

154
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,548
Don't go around telling people, okay?

155
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,417
I have no one to tell it to

156
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,154
After telling people that I'm Jay's aunt,
nobody is talking to me

157
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,291
He's always smiling
and he even gave me a gift,

158
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,126
so I didn't know he was like that

159
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,929
Ethan's dad gave you a gift?

160
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,264
Yes

161
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,566
Chan-yang

162
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,236
Are you wearing Lanseage?

163
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,305
Oh, do you know this perfume?

164
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,541
I guess it's pretty famous

165
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,584
It's this one

166
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,154
He gave me this as a gift

167
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,243
Ethan, don't touch anything

168
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,544
Mommy's watching you

169
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,480
Okay, Mommy

170
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,456
Are you looking for something?

171
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,294
Do you have a perfume called
Lanseage Affaire?

172
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,764
Lanseage Affaire?

173
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,167
Sorry, we don't have it in our store

174
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,137
I see

175
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,873
Would you like me to recommend
a different product?

176
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,075
No, it's okay

177
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,210
Okay, let me know if you need anything

178
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,717
Ethan!

179
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,119
Are you okay?

180
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:08,888
My goodness

181
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,858
Excuse me

182
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,496
Don't worry, my son's fine

183
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,299
It's not that
You can't just leave like this

184
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,940
Are you saying that
my son created this mess?

185
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,875
Then who else would've done it?

186
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,680
I should've known earlier
when he was wandering around

187
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,387
Let's check the security cameras
and see if my son really did it

188
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,421
What?

189
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,990
Let's see who created this mess

190
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,660
Excuse me, ma'am
Stop insisting

191
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,197
Hey

192
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,901
Couldn't you wait until I finished parking?

193
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,404
Let's go, honey

194
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,173
Where do you think you're going?
Are you her husband?

195
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,508
Yes, why?

196
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,011
Your wife left your son to run around,

197
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,581
so our store became a mess,
and now she's just going to leave

198
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,451
Hey!

199
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,623
Should I just throw that perfume away?

200
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,560
Maybe I should sell it on
the second-hand platform

201
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,964
I don't think it's right to keep using it

202
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,234
Men show favors for a reason

203
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,236
They all have other intentions

204
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,538
Aren't you a mom?
What are you doing?

205
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,240
- Is there a discount event?
- Honey

206
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm sorry

207
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,614
My wife is a bit clumsy
This happens all the time

208
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,048
I'll compensate for the items...

209
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,651
What are you saying right now?

210
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,056
You should first see the security cameras
to see if it really is his fault!

211
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,559
Keep it down, will you?
You're embarrassing me

212
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,628
I'm the one who's embarrassed here!

213
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,730
I'm not being ridiculous

214
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,301
Forget it, I need to see your boss
or your manager

215
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,739
Seriously
Such an annoying mom...

216
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,007
What did you say?

217
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,341
- Excuse me
- Hey!

218
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,710
What's wrong with you?

219
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,413
Stop acting all edgy, and just let it slide

220
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,317
She shouldn't just let it slide!

221
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,026
I know this pattern very well

222
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,496
Referring to us as annoying moms
so that we can't complain

223
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,264
Right, right

224
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,733
Every case should be based on
the presumption of innocence,

225
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,236
but people tend to blame the moms

226
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,974
Wow, Song-yi! You've become smarter
after working at the law firm

227
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,012
Okay, I get that you're upset
because she called her an annoying mom

228
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,614
But it's our business,

229
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,116
so let me take care of it

230
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,322
Your husband didn't seem supportive of you,

231
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,557
so I just had to step in

232
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,859
Let's check the security camera footage

233
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,062
We can decide after that

234
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,573
Honey!

235
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,712
- Ethan! Are you okay?
- Did you see that?

236
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,680
It wasn't Ethan

237
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,782
That guy bumped into it carelessly

238
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,585
Thank goodness Ethan didn't get hurt

239
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,495
Hurry and apologize
It was your misunderstanding

240
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,869
Do you think you've stated the facts?

241
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:48,907
No, it's just that she was in the store
without even purchasing anything

242
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,743
See?

243
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,446
You're thinking, "She's an annoying mom
What else should I call her?"

244
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,517
But you know what?

245
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,488
You never know how life will turn out

246
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,558
I also thought I'd live unmarried for life

247
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,260
I didn't know I'd have kids

248
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,398
We all used to be young once

249
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,433
We can become parents one day

250
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,203
And we all grow old

251
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,474
Let's be a bit more generous, okay?

252
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,816
You sound like a tough woman

253
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,953
Do you always treat people so fiercely?

254
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,091
No wonder your husband
always looks so discouraged

255
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,228
Ethan's dad

256
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,632
It seems like you're seriously mistaken

257
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,135
The person who's actually discouraged
is standing right next to you

258
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,440
You yelling at your wife in public

259
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,878
I'm really worried Ethan
might learn from you

260
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,415
Is being a mom some kind of a privilege?
Can't we say anything?

261
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,490
I didn't know I'd be living
as a housewife

262
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,625
What?

263
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,300
If I knew I'd have to live
with my mouth shut all the time,

264
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,573
I wouldn't have chosen to live
as a housewife

265
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,111
You're really going all out today

266
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,712
Fine

267
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,449
If you feel so frustrated,
then don't come home today

268
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,717
Okay?

269
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,086
Ethan, let's go

270
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,670
That employee never apologized to you

271
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,706
It's just an apology

272
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,008
So upsetting

273
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,111
I know

274
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,449
Hana, it seemed like
you've had a lot of pent-up frustration

275
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,284
Of course

276
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,254
When I take the twins to a restaurant,

277
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:19,358
they look at us with daggers in their eyes
to watch if they spill anything

278
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,693
When I go out with Jay,

279
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,630
it's not easy to eat at a restaurant
since they have a lot of No Kids zone

280
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,600
I get where they're coming from since
some parents leave their kids unattended

281
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,203
But it's just unfair sometimes

282
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,109
Thank you

283
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,412
for standing up for me

284
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,989
It's the first time
anyone has stood up for me

285
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,125
since I came to Cheonpo

286
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,228
You have friends

287
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,497
Friends?

288
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,671
Did you think we were friends?

289
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,310
We just hang out because of our kids

290
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,713
Friends...

291
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,952
This is what friends are

292
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,494
Twin's mom

293
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,367
Can I talk to you for a second?

294
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,539
We'll see you later

295
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,373
Yeah, okay

296
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,441
Let's go

297
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,388
I wonder what they'll talk about

298
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,056
No idea

299
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,631
To be honest...

300
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,834
I've never really liked you

301
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,637
I know

302
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,572
Was it obvious?

303
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,709
I'd be stupid not to notice

304
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:26,918
But somehow,
I couldn't stop thinking about you

305
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,754
I thought you didn't like me

306
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,125
I guess I was jealous of you

307
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,235
It's confusing if you suddenly act nice,
so just act how you used to

308
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,572
You can't choose both, you know

309
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,542
I gave up my career

310
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,679
for my family

311
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,982
and to raise my kids well

312
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:04,156
But seeing you holding onto both
no matter what,

313
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,661
to me, you looked greedy

314
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,433
Maybe that's what made me hate you

315
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,137
But actually, it's me that I hate the most

316
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,475
for giving up on my career

317
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,817
Is this what you wanted to tell me?

318
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,958
I keep thinking about it these days

319
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,764
If you were me,
what would you have done?

320
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,737
What would you do
if you were in my position?

321
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:00,812
You wouldn't live so foolishly like me

322
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,918
Is something up?

323
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,824
Actually...

324
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,727
What is it?

325
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,901
I tried to ignore it

326
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,572
Act all dumb and clueless

327
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,076
But then, it turns out

328
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,349
my husband is

329
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,851
even having an affair

330
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,588
An affair?

331
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,895
Him giving perfumes to women,
I can let it slide

332
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,998
But an affair? That's just unacceptable

333
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,270
Who is he having an affair with?

334
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,474
That I don't know

335
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,748
I really don't know what to do

336
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,821
Ethan's mom

337
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,157
You should decide

338
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,262
I'm in no position to tell you this or that

339
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,231
Getting divorced is not easy

340
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,068
So, you should decide

341
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,271
Whatever you decide to do,
I'll root for you

342
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,575
Thank you

343
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,411
(When she said she wanted a divorce,)

344
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,547
(I noticed an unfamiliar scent,)

345
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,116
(a smell I'd never encountered before)

346
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,787
To proceed with a divorce lawsuit,
we need evidence of his wrongdoing

347
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,789
Evidence?

348
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,993
(First, let's see how your husband
reacts to other moms)

349
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,530
Louis' mom and Shannon's mom
have become prettier

350
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,805
Between Louis' mom and Shannon's mom,
who do you think is prettier?

351
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,344
Are you trying to say that
you want to go get Botox with them?

352
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,448
Your life is so comfortable that
you're getting silly thoughts

353
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,453
(Anyone who cheats on their wife
can keep a straight face)

354
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:26,057
The real important clues can be found
in the things they say unconsciously

355
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,026
I'm speaking from experience

356
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,700
You look prettier these days

357
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,270
Really? I changed my makeup

358
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,938
I knew it

359
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,678
Didn't you usually drink sweet coffee?

360
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,713
Are you on a diet?

361
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,815
Can you tell?

362
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,819
I thought I should start getting in shape

363
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,488
But you're so slim

364
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,291
No, I've gained a lot of weight

365
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,127
I was asked if I was pregnant

366
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,229
What? Who said that?

367
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,463
My husband

368
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,102
What did she say?

369
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,305
Shannon's mom is on a diet

370
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,639
She's trying to get in shape

371
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,611
She's even wearing a dewy makeup look

372
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,680
So suspicious

373
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,682
Should I look into it more?

374
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,283
Yes

375
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,492
(Well, paying attention to one's looks)

376
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,029
(could mean that she's trying to
impress someone)

377
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,380
Hello

378
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,382
Why do you look so surprised?

379
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,685
Are you going somewhere fun?

380
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:05,624
You scared me, Ms. Ahn

381
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,958
You were so surprised that

382
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,662
you made me think you were going somewhere
fun without telling your husband

383
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,799
It's...

384
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,204
Can I be honest with you?

385
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:31,683
I've been feeling cranky
because I've cut carbs lately

386
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,552
So, I started eating them again in secret

387
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,455
Do you want to join me?

388
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,325
- I'm okay
- (Shannon's mom tried to cut carbs)

389
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,427
(due to high blood pressure)

390
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,429
(But how can you stop eating tteokbokki?)

391
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,065
(She's eating it secretly
behind her husband's back)

392
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,334
(Shannon's mom)

393
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,143
Hello

394
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,421
Louis' mom, did something good happen?

395
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,190
No

396
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,892
Not at all

397
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,497
(She acted awkwardly like a kid
who got caught while doing something bad)

398
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,365
(You know what I mean?)

399
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,916
Yes, I'm almost there

400
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,250
Okay

401
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,663
Hello

402
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,031
Do you want to see it?

403
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:53,898
Yes

404
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,336
Wow, it's so pretty

405
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:01,439
This is a brand-new Louis bag, right?

406
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,707
Yes, of course

407
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,508
Thank you

408
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:07,712
(Turns out Louis' mom's manner meter
on the second-hand platform is over 80)

409
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,516
(All the bags she's been carrying
were top-grade used bags)

410
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,352
(Louis' mom)
(Maybe she was embarrassed about it)

411
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,488
(She's been buying them secretly)

412
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,201
But why are you all so serious about this?

413
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:38,009
Let's take the two most likely suspects
off the list

414
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,278
I feel like we've become Sherlock

415
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,946
But he solves murders

416
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,950
Is there anyone else you can think of?

417
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,789
No one comes to mind

418
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,159
I know I shouldn't,

419
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,030
but I've looked through his phone
while he was asleep

420
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,467
I went through his messenger,

421
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,903
but I only found his coworkers

422
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,911
These days, people are very meticulous

423
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,213
It won't be easy to find evidence

424
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:19,651
Let's not be swayed
We should calmly assess the situation

425
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,023
Don't worry

426
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,960
No matter how hard he tries to hide,
the truth will reveal itself

427
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,897
But then, what's taking so long?

428
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:33,998
What do you mean?

429
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,968
The tteokbokki that
Shannon's mom secretly eats

430
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,970
I was curious how good it was,
so I ordered it

431
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,408
Are you thinking about eating
tteokbokki right now?

432
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,977
Who knows?
We might shout, "Eureka!" while eating it

433
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,516
Oh, shoot

434
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,785
I forgot to change the address

435
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,287
I had it delivered to my apartment

436
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,122
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

437
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,457
No way

438
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,894
I've been coming to this office so often,

439
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,363
I thought I'd registered this address

440
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,032
You have your house and your workshop

441
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,901
Why would you register my office
as the address?

442
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,004
I don't know
It tastes better when I eat here

443
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,739
I guess I feel comfortable

444
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,110
What is it?

445
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,213
We might be able to find it

446
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:24,849
Huh?

447
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:38,062
First, use Ethan as an excuse

448
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,405
Ethan, let's eat something nice with Dad
It's the weekend

449
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,341
I love delicious food

450
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,011
You just can't let me rest on my day off

451
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,681
Then, why don't we order
some fried chicken?

452
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,250
Original? Spicy? Or half-half?

453
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,954
Just choose whatever you want

454
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,557
I want spicy fried chicken

455
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,168
(Delivery Address)

456
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,102
(That's a good idea)

457
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,004
(Then, check if any of the addresses)

458
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,141
(match the ones in his
recent navigation history)

459
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,345
"543, Ungcheon-dong, Cheonpo-si"

460
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,381
(543, Ungcheon-dong, Cheonpo-si)

461
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,016
I found it!

462
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,884
It's cold outside
Let's drive there instead of walking

463
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:07,885
Sure

464
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,890
You said you wanted to drive
Let's go

465
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:28,606
Huh?

466
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,874
What?

467
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,743
That was the one?

468
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:35,813
Why are you wearing my necklace?

469
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,248
Hey!

470
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,783
You come over here!

471
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,520
This woman is from Cheonpo Motel

472
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,788
Right?

473
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,256
Yes, it's her

474
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,158
Do you know her?

475
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,927
Yes

476
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,096
She's a regular

477
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,599
Not as a client, but as an adulteress

478
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,868
She's a habitual offender

479
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,705
You know what they say
Once a cheater, always a cheater

480
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,178
How could he fall for a woman like that
and abandon the family?

481
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,814
This is unfair

482
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,116
This is so unfair

483
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,756
I know the person's address and all

484
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,492
I'll prepare it thoroughly
so that you can win the case

485
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,929
Thank you, Mr. Cha

486
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:30,168
When the twin's mom recommended you,
I knew you were a competent lawyer

487
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,637
I'm flattered

488
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,775
Song-yi, thank you so much

489
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,678
You're really smart

490
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,449
Smart?

491
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:49,587
Well, I have a knack
for playing petty tricks

492
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,058
And when it comes to affairs,
I can totally relate

493
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,695
I hope you'll take good care of my case

494
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,263
Okay

495
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,503
So...

496
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,573
What are you going to do now?

497
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,376
I'm not sure

498
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,080
I'm going to think about it
while staying at my parent's house

499
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:21,185
You won't leave Cheonpo, though, right?

500
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,287
I'm not sure about that either

501
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,364
By the way...

502
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,099
Yes?

503
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:40,171
I'm sorry I talked like that
about you and Jay

504
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,341
I wanted to tell you that

505
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,347
It's okay
I forgot all about it

506
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,415
You should, too

507
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,888
Thank you

508
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,670
What's with the sigh?

509
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,875
I don't know
I can't help it

510
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,744
You can't help it?

511
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,417
I'm the one who really wants
to leave Cheonpo

512
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,720
I didn't know I'd be living here so long

513
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,791
It feels weird that it could be
Ethan's mom who's leaving,

514
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,793
not me

515
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,398
Why do you feel weird about that?

516
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,367
It's just a neighborhood

517
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,771
Just a neighborhood?

518
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,207
Yes

519
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,483
You can leave anytime

520
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,822
All Korean citizens have
freedom of residential mobility,

521
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:10,561
which means that if you wish,
you can go anywhere in the country

522
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,132
I know that

523
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,969
But...

524
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:19,904
But?

525
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,977
I don't know...

526
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:33,351
What if I'm stuck in this neighborhood
forever?

527
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,559
Don't overthink it

528
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,766
If you want to leave, you can always leave

529
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,741
I'll clock out first, then

530
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,619
What the...

531
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,989
I didn't mean she can leave now

532
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:22,433
I can't believe she left because I said so

533
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,711
Will it be faster for me to leave Cheonpo

534
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,880
or for the apartments to be redeveloped?

535
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,315
I don't know anymore

536
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,193
(Jackpot Real Estate)

537
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,964
Yes, hello?

538
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,400
(Is this Ms. Ji from Building 808?)

539
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,001
Yes

540
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,536
(Are you home right now?)

541
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,305
(There's a person who's interested
in buying the house)

542
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:06,277
(The real estate market must be picking up
I'm getting lots of calls)

543
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,645
I'm on my way!

544
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,327
He's in his twenties, huh?

545
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,432
I guess I've gotten a bit...

546
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,901
older

547
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,079
Wait...

548
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,148
Am I supposed to hang weights on this?

549
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,419
It looks like I need to hang
the weights here

550
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,026
Am I supposed to use this?

551
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,500
Excuse me

552
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,739
Would you like me to help you
with the machine?

553
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,641
Me?

554
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,375
Yes

555
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,013
There aren't many guys around my age
who come to work out at this time,

556
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,581
so I'm excited to see you

557
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,753
I think we've never met
Are you new to this neighborhood?

558
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,822
Umm...

559
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,159
Yes

560
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,995
No, I've lived here for a while now

561
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,264
I see

562
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,232
Nice to meet you

563
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,567
Yes

564
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,509
I have sweaty hands

565
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,179
I see

566
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,387
That's Song-yi's friend...

567
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,889
Isn't she a friend of Song-yi's?

568
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,226
Do you know Song-yi?

569
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,094
Song-yi?

570
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,730
Yes, I mean

571
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,433
I noticed you have a photo of
Song-yi's friend as your wallpaper

572
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,038
I'm Seok Jin-ho, Chan-yang's husband

573
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:17,975
I see

574
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,246
Chan-yang said she's been visiting
this law firm with the other girls lately

575
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,882
Could it be...

576
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,952
Yes, it's probably my office

577
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,553
I'm Cha Hyeon-woo

578
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,289
Nice to meet you

579
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,960
That's why you and Song-yi were...

580
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,297
Are you close with Song-yi?

581
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,131
Sorry?

582
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,869
Song-yi...

583
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,905
Song-yi and you were a bit...

584
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,608
Did she say something about me?

585
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:55,446
So, Song-yi and you tend to

586
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,285
bicker a lot

587
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,988
We bicker a lot?

588
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:05,689
Yes

589
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,424
Geez

590
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,532
I see

591
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,004
So, can I help you with the workout?

592
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,642
It's really nice
It even has a wide entrance

593
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,110
I like it

594
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,111
Let's see

595
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,415
It's a great house

596
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,150
- Really?
- Yes!

597
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,119
Hi...

598
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,720
Ma'am

599
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,990
Ms. Ji, they're here to see your place

600
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,792
Hello

601
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,360
Thank you for coming

602
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,129
You'll be surprised when you see the house

603
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:45,996
So

604
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,097
Let's go inside

605
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,966
Let's go inside

606
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,435
Just trust me

607
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,539
Let's see

608
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,408
Please come inside

609
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,347
Oh, right

610
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,015
Ta-da

611
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,550
Check out this huge shoe cabinet

612
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,652
Look how many shoes can fit in here

613
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:11,555
You can put all the shoes inside

614
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,791
See? It's so spacious

615
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,061
It's so spacious that even I can fit inside

616
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,828
Do you want to see?

617
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,396
Look, I'm going inside

618
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,665
Sliding in

619
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,270
Let me try going inside it

620
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,572
Ta-da! Can you guess where I am?

621
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:29,907
Ta-da!

622
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,079
It's more spacious inside
Would you like to come inside?

623
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,381
- Yes, come on in
- Let's go inside

624
00:43:55,566 --> 00:44:00,738
It's pretty clean for a house with kids

625
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,442
What's this damp smell?

626
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,679
I forgot to ventilate
Wait a second

627
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,785
The ventilation is great in this house

628
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,055
You don't even need to turn
the air conditioner in the summer

629
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,757
because of all the fresh air

630
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,209
It's hard to go outside
because of the fine dust

631
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,591
It's really quiet at night

632
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,860
The neighbors have good manners

633
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:02,833
Song-yi!

634
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,769
- What's this noise?
- Song-yi!

635
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,905
Song-yi!

636
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,674
I didn't know apartments
could be haunted, too

637
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,242
What are you doing?

638
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,377
What noise?

639
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,079
What are you doing?

640
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,580
I don't hear anything

641
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,583
What? Is somebody else in the house?

642
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,584
No

643
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,020
What is this noise?

644
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,421
Now, like this

645
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,590
Push it all the way

646
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,434
Like this

647
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,439
Why don't you give it a try?

648
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,708
You must work out a lot

649
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,045
I try to work out
whenever I have the time

650
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:52,816
I worked out so hard
to take a fitness photoshoot

651
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,785
Above all...

652
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,154
my wife loves it

653
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,556
They say guys have to have strong thighs

654
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,127
Go ahead

655
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,798
Should I increase the weight?

656
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,235
You shouldn't overdo yourself
if you haven't worked out in a while

657
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,404
I've got basic strength, though

658
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,240
Okay

659
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,308
All the way

660
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,443
All the way?

661
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,446
All the way!

662
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,049
Just push a bit more

663
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,522
- One more time?
- Yes

664
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,325
That's right, okay

665
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,461
By the way,

666
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,899
how do you know Song-yi?

667
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,500
Song-yi

668
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,269
Song-yi and I used to date...

669
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:48,972
Sorry?

670
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,878
Data?

671
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,449
Yes, we were in the data analysis club

672
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,319
Data analysis club?

673
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,021
Yes

674
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,161
Oh, that explains it...

675
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,564
I see

676
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,603
But have you heard that news?

677
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,171
What news?

678
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:25,342
Song-yi said she's moving soon

679
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:28,545
What?

680
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,380
You're not supposed to drop it like that

681
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,450
What? Song-yi is moving?

682
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:34,785
Yes

683
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,753
She put the house on market

684
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,488
It's not sold yet,

685
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,225
but people are coming to see the house

686
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,461
What?

687
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,865
The housing prices are crazy these days

688
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,601
I mean, people!

689
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,270
They always complain about
how slow the economy is,

690
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,539
but it seems like that's not the case

691
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,445
Don't you think so?

692
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,093
I need to go get some water

693
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,276
What can we do?

694
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:38,515
The buyers who saw the house today
want to get the one they saw before yours

695
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,617
Really?

696
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,522
That's why the person who
put the house on the market

697
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,558
needs to be ready 24/7

698
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,828
Just like celebrities who stay in shape
all the time

699
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,264
Look at me

700
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:59,102
I'm always smiling because
I never know when I'll get customers

701
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,772
There hasn't been a single person
coming to see the house for months,

702
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,741
so I couldn't prepare for the visit

703
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,510
You could've told me in advance

704
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,879
Gosh, okay, okay

705
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,048
I've been getting a lot of calls lately

706
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,418
So, stay prepared next time

707
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,653
Really?

708
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,088
Of course

709
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:23,794
There's been a lot of developments
in this area, like the subway and stuff

710
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,999
It only takes 30 minutes to get to Seoul

711
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:33,603
Isn't that basically Seoul?

712
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,740
Then, I'll leave it in your good hands

713
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,376
Oh, excuse me

714
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,844
Who is this?

715
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,714
Yes, this is Jackpot Real Estate

716
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,415
Yes, I'm coming

717
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,184
I'll be right there, sir

718
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,086
I'll be there in a second, wait a bit

719
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,455
Gosh, you just couldn't wait

720

(You can sell the house in a day!)

723
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,308
Why did they stop right there?
I was expecting pro tips

724
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,276
Why? It's not going well?

725
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,912
I mean, I'm the one selling the house,

726
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,281
but I'm also the one who has to be ready
all the time and keep it clean

727
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,651
Song-yi, try hanging scissors
on the shoe cabinet

728
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,088
That sounds scary
Why the scissors?

729
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:29,993
I heard that if you hang scissors in
a popular restaurant, the house sells fast

730
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:30,927
Really?

731
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,031
Should I go ask the popular restaurant
across the street?

732
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,233
If you can sell a house
by hanging scissors,

733
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,635
the real estate market in Korea
will never slow down

734
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,707
I personally think the scent
is really important when I go see a house

735
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,844
You know, when you visit someone's house
and it smells like coffee,

736
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,613
the house feels more luxurious

737
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:54,751
Then, should I make some coffee
when they come over to see the house?

738
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,021
You can't sell the house
just by doing that

739
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:02,359
It must be haunted for real
Otherwise, it would've been sold already

740
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:04,861
Haunted?

741
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,096
I actually have a ghost

742
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,965
She yells through the toilet
from upstairs

743
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,735
Boo!

744
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,907
I don't want you to move
to a different city

745
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,242
If you leave,
I have no one to hang out with

746
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,612
Don't say that

747
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,916
I'm going to start a new life
by leaving Cheonpo as soon as possible

748
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:32,389
Whether it's hanging scissors,
or making coffee, I'm up for it

749
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,263
Hello

750
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,367
You came in early

751
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,437
I came early rather than
running on a tight schedule

752
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:51,041
I thought you were going to
stop by the real estate,

753
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,777
hang out with your
young and cute boyfriend,

754
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,679
and come in late

755
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,349
He's not my young boyfriend

756
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,985
It's just an employer-and-employee
relationship

757
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,788
That's it?

758
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,924
What else do I need?

759
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:13,029
I mean, he seemed to have
different feelings for you

760
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,366
Look at you making up stories again

761
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:22,506
Anyway, do you think your house
will sell soon?

762
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,144
Well, I'm trying

763
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,781
Okay, good luck with that

764
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,904
We should redo the interior

765
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,741
Maybe there's not enough natural light
It seemed a bit too dark

766
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:01,511
Are you here to see the house
across the hall?

767
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:02,612
Yes

768
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,714
Do you live across the hall?

769
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,416
Yes

770
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,718
Have you lived in this apartment
for a long time?

771
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,789
Well, I've been living here
since the first move-in

772
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,526
We're thinking of moving
to this neighborhood

773
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,994
What do you think of the house?

774
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,270
It's bad

775
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,339
Yes

776
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,975
This place has a lot of defects

777
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,311
There's a condensation problem
in the dressing room

778
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,446
The bathroom has poor soundproofing

779
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,382
And you know the noise between floors?

780
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,952
That's a serious problem

781
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,386
Oh, my

782
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,523
But that must not be the case
for all units, right?

783
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,427
I don't know

784
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,963
I'm not sure if I can say this

785
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:56,700
But the person across the hall
had a broken-engagement-like divorce

786
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,470
And I had a divorce-like broken engagement

787
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,641
Maybe this place is haunted

788
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,877
What? That sounds too ridiculous

789
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,045
Am I right?

790
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,517
Exactly

791
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,756
Hold on, there used to be groundwater here

792
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,792
Let's see
Was it around here?

793
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,560
I think it was around this place

794
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,262
Geez! The groundwater

795
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,664
The groundwater is overflowing

796
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,899
Yes, ma'am
Can we see the next house?

797
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,268
The groundwater, you know?

798
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,070
The groundwater

799
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,545
This way, I bet people won't come again
to see the house

800
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:56,026
What are you doing, Mr. Cha?

801
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,395
Sorry?

802
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:05,602
Why are you using the stairs
instead of the elevator?

803
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,872
I use the stairs from time to time

804
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,208
There's nothing better than climbing
the stairs to strengthen the thigh muscles

805
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:22,819
How long have you been staying here?

806
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,388
For a while

807
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,058
For a while

808
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,627
Yes, for a while

809
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,696
For a while

810
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,340
This is embarrassing

811
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,008
It's understandable

812
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:50,013
If you really don't want Song-yi to move

813
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,581
What?

814
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,451
If I really don't want her to move?

815
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,222
You like Song-yi, don't you?

816
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:00,757
What?

817
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,892
I've noticed

818
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,397
What? No way!

819
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,673
Did it sound like I was
denying it too hard?

820
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,743
A strong denial means an affirmation

821
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,480
So, I was right
You have feelings for her!

822
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,085
You keep worrying, denying,
and getting all angry

823
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:34,691
I often hear that I can't take the hint

824
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,793
So, if I noticed it,

825
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:40,797
I'm sure everyone in this neighborhood
knows about it

826
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,566
Everyone?

827
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:49,372
Actually, Chan-yang told me that...

828
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,674
there's something going on
between you two

829
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:53,676
No, no

830
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,378
That's not true

831
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,483
That's not true at all

832
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,553
Well

833
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,622
It's just me

834
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:11,094
being conscious of her... Yeah...

835
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,965
(Front Door)

836
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,771
Hello, please come in

837
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:07,577
Look how huge the shoe cabinet is

838
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,678
Hello

839
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,480
Here, please wear these slippers

840
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,081
You can wear these

841
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,583
You've cleaned your house

842
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,018
Yes, please look around

843
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,855
Go ahead and take a look

844
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,458
Wow, look how high it is

845
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,429
What a great house

846
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,330
Yeah

847
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,333
I thought there was a kid in this house

848
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,201
Yes, he's five

849
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:36,072
But I can't stand it
when the house is not clean

850
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,441
That's why I clean the house every day

851
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,843
It's really well-maintained

852
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,280
If you only look at the interior,
you'd believe it's a newly built apartment

853
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,686
It'd be so nice if we
lie down here together, right?

854
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,389
Should we hang our wedding photo here?

855
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,390
Sure

856
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,859
And we can change it to a family photo
when we have a kid

857
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,065
But why are you selling the house?

858
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,499
It's such a lovely house

859
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,235
Oh...

860
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,075
(I can't tell them that)

861
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,711
(I got divorced while living in this house)

862
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,380
(and that I can't afford the loan)

863
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,151
I'm thinking of moving
to another house

864
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,821
It's a real bummer for me, too

865
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:30,660
Maybe it's because of the good energy,
good things happened here in Cheonpo

866
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,197
I want to bring that good energy
and start fresh somewhere new

867
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,121
Song-yi

868
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,089
Yes?

869
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,960
I've really thought about it a lot

870
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,463
Okay

871
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,135
Maybe it's time for us

872
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,738
to stop being so careful

873
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:47,870
What?

874
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,740
Song-yi

875
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,142
I've thought about it a lot

876
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:54,377
About what?

877
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,046
Umm...

878
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,348
What I'm trying to say is...

879
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,484
We...

880
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,453
We should...

881
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,656
My feelings and yours

882
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,424
What's wrong with you?

883
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:10,593
What?

884
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,196
Why are you trying to sabotage
someone who's trying to sell the house?

885
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,697
I heard it from Chan-yang

886
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,833
that Jin-ho caught you while you were
trying to sabotage me

887
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,337
No, it's not like that

888
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,507
Forget it, the person who came today
will be buying the house

889
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,478
Despite all the sabotage,
I managed to sell the house

890
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:50,900
I didn't like it

891
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,104
I did it because I didn't like the idea

892
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,777
What are you saying?

893
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,614
I don't want you to move out, Song-yi

894
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:08,484
I want you to stay here

895
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,768
[Sorry Not Sorry]

896
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:59,602
So, you're saying you have feelings for me?

897
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,770
It feels weird

898
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,205
Hana's leaving

899
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,474
and you sold your house,
so you're leaving, too

900
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,243
Hey, do you want to
move to New York with me?

901
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,412
(Mommy, Aunt Song)

902
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,714
- Jay
- (I don't want to move)

903
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,219
I should've told you
about my feelings a bit sooner

904
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:19,488
I realized that, for some people,
love grows over time

905
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,325
Without even knowing
when and how it all happened
