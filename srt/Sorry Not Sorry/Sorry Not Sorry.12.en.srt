1
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,020
Would you like to go on a date
with me tomorrow?

2
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,923
A date?

3
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,356
Cha Hyeon-woo

4
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,725
That jerk!

5
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,260
What?

6
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,163
Stop being so careful?

7
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,201
How could he cheat on me
after saying that?

8
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,941
Hello

9
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,550
Hey, Cha Hyeon-woo!

10
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,227
S, Song-yi!

11
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,965
I must've been crazy
Why did I think you'd be different?

12
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,433
Why did I believe you?

13
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,601
What was I thinking?

14
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,469
Song-yi, it's not what you think...

15
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,037
Yeah, right!

16
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,206
It's not my first time
going through a situation like this

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,675
What? Are you also going to say that
it's a misunderstanding?

18
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,745
I'm sorry, who are you?
Are you his ex-girlfriend?

19
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,347
Or is it your ex-wife this time?

20
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,248
No, you got it all wrong

21
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,616
I got it all wrong, my foot!

22
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,485
You're dead meat

23
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,061
Gosh!

24
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,263
It's cold...

25
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,366
This is fun

26
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,102
Song, wake up

27
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,371
Wakey-wakey, sleepyhead!

28
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,039
Bang! Bang!

29
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,641
- Jay!
- Bang

30
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,777
Jay, I told you it's mine

31
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,045
- Don't keep spraying this...
- No

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,016
That can't happen!

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,955
No

34
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,724
[Sorry Not Sorry]

35
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,757
Is something up?

36
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,126
Why is she suddenly ghosting me?

37
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,174
(Thank you)

38
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,183
(Agreement on Termination
of Real Estate Purchase Contract)

39
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,656
The couple who agreed to buy
the house called off their marriage

40
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,693
The woman had an affair or something

41
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,463
Gosh, it's unbelievable

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,034
Why do all the couples moving into
that place break off their engagement?

43
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,169
That's so strange

44
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,575
Are you talking about me?

45
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,345
What? Of course not

46
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,314
But...

47
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,017
But it's for the better

48
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,386
How is it for the better?

49
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,356
The housing prices are going up

50
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,394
Because of the new subway line or something

51
00:04:55,695 --> 00:05:00,967
It's actually a good thing
they called off the purchase

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,603
I just wanted to leave this town

53
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:08,441
Why would you want to leave
when the housing prices are going up?

54
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:13,012
You can just live here forever

55
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,281
No, I don't want to do that

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:21,054
Once you get attached to the neighborhood,
it becomes your hometown

57
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,294
By the way,
what will you do about the deposit?

58
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,131
I should return it to them
It's not a small amount

59
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,603
Gosh, you're nicer than you look

60
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,872
You have a kind heart

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,043
I asked if you could understand them

62
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,912
only because I'm delivering
the message on their behalf

63
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,448
Look, it's written right here

64
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,719
"The deposit cannot be refunded
in case of contract cancellation"

65
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,624
You made the right choice

66
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,627
(What? They canceled the contract?)

67
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,432
(But I'm disappointed in Mr. Cha)

68
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,835
(Don't give them the deposit)

69
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,737
(They should learn a lesson)

70
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,739
(I wonder who that woman is)

71
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,007
(His crush? Girlfriend?)

72
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,779
(Who knew Mr. Cha would be a two-timer?)

73
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,281
(Did he play you, Song-yi?)

74
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,541
Hello

75
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,082
Can I get an iced Americano, please?

76
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,650
Sure

77
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,286
Is it for here?

78
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,288
No

79
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:12,832
Here you go

80
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,639
Song-yi doesn't work here anymore

81
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,274
Sorry?

82
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,643
It seemed like you were looking for her

83
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,179
Wait, Song-yi quit?

84
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,046
Yes

85
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,016
Didn't she tell you?

86
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,453
No, she didn't

87
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,489
Then...

88
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,791
Is it not Mr. Cha?

89
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,359
What do you mean?

90
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,964
It's not him?

91
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,403
(Unit 1604 Ji Song-yi)

92
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,709
Hello

93
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,252
Min-jeong

94
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,689
What are you doing here?

95
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,400
Get your bags

96
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,336
Good job

97
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,708
Daddy's here!

98
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,276
Daddy!

99
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,577
Hi, Daddy!

100
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,812
Hello, my babies

101
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,314
How was class today?

102
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,048
Good

103
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,183
Chan-yang, thank you again

104
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,317
Not at all

105
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,152
How is Hana doing?

106
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,020
I miss her

107
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,122
She's doing fine

108
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,225
I heard you three were texting earlier

109
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,393
But you still miss her?

110
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
Unbelievable

111
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,969
Honey

112
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:57,670
Seong-tae

113
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,338
Good to see you

114
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:03,175
I heard that you and Chan-yang

115
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,511
are trying to have a baby

116
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,113
I'm doing my best

117
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,217
How did you have twins
and even a third baby?

118
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,854
Come on, it's nothing

119
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,923
You have my respect

120
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,563
Yes, Honey

121
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,897
Yes

122
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,599
What?

123
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,034
The b...

124
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,068
The baby's coming out?

125
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:30,903
Is it Hana?

126
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,272
I'll be right there

127
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,474
- What is it?
- What happened?

128
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,810
She's supposed to get surgery tomorrow,

129
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,745
but she suddenly had contractions,

130
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,182
so she needs to get
an emergency C-section right now

131
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:43,716
Sorry?

132
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,851
Wait a second

133
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,422
What should I do first?

134
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,091
- Hospital!
- Yes, the hospital

135
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,460
Yes, I need to go to the hospital

136
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,461
Move

137
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,001
Kids, kids

138
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,235
Hurry, hurry, let's go

139
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,270
Let's go, let's go

140
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,705
Let's go

141
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,323
Sorry...

142
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,592
I was a bit late

143
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,063
It's okay

144
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,766
Thank you, Mr. Kim

145
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,802
Just...

146
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,006
Just stay in there for a while

147
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,654
(I hid even though I did nothing wrong)

148
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:56,889
(Because)

149
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,192
(I didn't want to become pathetic again)

150
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,929
Love...

151
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,898
I don't

152
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,801
believe in that anymore

153
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,573
It's the men who don't know
how to appreciate you

154
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,778
What do you mean by that?

155
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,249
(Liar)

156
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,919
(You said)

157
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,923
(love is worthless and that
you're never doing it again!)

158
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,597
Does she have to receive surgery right now?

159
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,600
I think so
But isn't it too sudden?

160
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,742
I'm sorry, but...

161
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,580
Can you do me a favor?

162
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,148
Sure

163
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,962
(Song-yi...)
(Is everything all right?)

164
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,097
(Ji Song-yi, where are you?)
(Please answer my calls)

165
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,364
(If you can't answer the call, text me)
(Please text me back when you see this)

166
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,042
(Quick Sale) (Cheonpo Central River
Forét the Hill 808-1604, 600 million)

167
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,585
Wasn't this house sold?

168
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,121
Sheesh

169
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,958
Oh, it's you

170
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,260
The person who lives across from Ms. Ji

171
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,528
Oh, yes

172
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,232
I heard that this house was sold recently

173
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,501
and that she's moving out in two months

174
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,935
Actually...

175
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,303
It didn't work out

176
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,172
They canceled the contract

177
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,406
What?

178
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,220
Song-yi's sleeping

179
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,722
Is she not feeling well?

180
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,324
No, I don't think she's sick

181
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,060
It seems like something upsetting
happened today

182
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,496
She relieves her stress by sleeping

183
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,703
Do you know if she ate before
she went to bed?

184
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,604
I don't know

185
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,473
Do you want me to wake her up?

186
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,440
No

187
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,911
It's okay
There's no need to do that

188
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,418
Then, I'll talk to her tomorrow

189
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,786
Thank you

190
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,787
Okay, good night

191
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:42,922
Okay

192
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,932
(Taeseoyang Law Firm)

193
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,779
Why haven't you returned my calls?

194
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,181
I was looking everywhere for you

195
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,549
Why?

196
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,784
What do you mean why?

197
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,920
We were supposed to meet that day,
but you didn't come

198
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,822
And I couldn't reach you
the whole weekend,

199
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,326
so I was worried about you

200
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,294
You were worried about me?

201
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,697
I see

202
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,843
You didn't answer my calls,

203
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,846
ignored my texts,

204
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,382
and quit the cafe

205
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,619
Do you know I even went to your place?

206
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,790
I searched through the entire neighborhood
as if I were a dog looking for its owner

207
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,560
I was looking everywhere to find you

208
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,062
Why'd you do that?
You can see me at work anyway

209
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,231
You're right

210
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,901
You came to work

211
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,504
I should earn a living

212
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,608
There's no reason for me to hide
since I didn't do anything wrong

213
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,292
Is it because the contract fell through?

214
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,327
How did you know about that?

215
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,029
Well...

216
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,299
The real estate lady was putting up
the poster again

217
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,136
Did the buyers cancel the contract?

218
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,004
So I heard

219
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,941
Oh, so that's why!

220
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,677
That's why you're in a bad mood

221
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,846
Because you couldn't sell
the house you wanted to get rid of badly!

222
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,416
Yes, well

223
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,285
But

224
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,489
that's none of your business

225
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,978
But they'd have to pay a lot of penalties
for breaking the contract

226
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,512
Are they still willing to do it?

227
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,349
They're not getting married
What can I do?

228
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,084
I didn't ask them for the deposit

229
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,120
But they still terminated the contract
without your consent,

230
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,055
so you don't have to return the deposit

231
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,224
I didn't want to receive it

232
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,462
But you know, the contract

233
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,065
was made after a proper agreement
between adults,

234
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,669
and because of the contract,
the seller spent time and money

235
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,871
So, they can't just change their mind

236
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,773
and ask for you to return the deposit

237
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,576
I just didn't want to receive it!

238
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,583
They must've saved that money
their whole life

239
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,120
They must've started saving
ever since they started work

240
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,324
They saved up that money
to use it for their wedding

241
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,628
What's wrong with calling off a marriage?

242
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,230
That's just life

243
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,264
Song-yi

244
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,199
I was like that, too!

245
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,770
I wanted to live a happy life

246
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,041
I worked so hard to save that money

247
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,076
and paid the deposit for the house

248
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,846
That made me feel so proud

249
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,416
and so happy

250
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,419
So, how can I not return it to them?

251
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,024
How can I not?

252
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,238
How...

253
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,703
(Can you please watch the kids)

254
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,605
(just until their grandmother arrives?)

255
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,773
(I'm really sorry)

256
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,608
(By the way...)

257
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,879
(You need to burn their energy
as much as possible)

258
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:34,813
Energy?

259
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,881
(Yes, yes)

260
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,784
(You need to burn all their energy)

261
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,020
I think they're burning their energy
right now

262
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,390
(Yes, you're doing great)

263
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,758
(But more energetically!)

264
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,026
(More powerfully!)

265
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,230
More energetically and powerfully?

266
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,167
Would this do?

267
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,336
(A bit higher)

268
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,371
(Faster, faster!)

269
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,040
Higher, faster

270
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,212
(Yes! That's perfect!)

271
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,150
(If you keep it up for 30 minutes,
they'll burn their energy)

272
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,186
30 minutes?

273
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,788
Seong-tae, my forearms are tired

274
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,525
(That's it! Low weight, high reps)

275
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,727
(You need to grow your core muscles)

276
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,097
(It'll help when you raise kids later on)

277
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,570
(Look)

278
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,272
(Teo's dozing off)

279
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,407
He's sleeping

280
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,344
Kids are angels when they're asleep

281
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,347
Should I get him a blanket?

282
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,415
(Wake him up)

283
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,384
Wake him up?

284
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,319
(It's the afternoon)

285
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,188
(It's not nap time)

286
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,091
(If he gets a power nap now,
he won't sleep at night)

287
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,396
That must be the side effect of a power nap

288
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,767
Teo, wake up!

289
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,168
Let's play! Get up!

290
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,470
I forgot I was playing right now

291
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,472
I almost dozed off

292
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:09,908
Have fun!

293
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,110
Hold me up, too

294
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,412
Okay, Teo!

295
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,249
(I need to go meet Ddoddo now)

296
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,051
(Good luck!)

297
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,619
Teo, Sia, wish Daddy good luck!

298
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,855
- Good luck, Daddy!
- You got this!

299
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,690
(I got this!)

300
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,862
Teo, let's go play over there

301
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,576
I never knew babysitting was this hard

302
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,846
I knew,

303
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,482
but I didn't expect it to be this hard

304
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,269
Are you feeling better now?

305
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,005
Why do you care?

306
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,878
Song-yi, are you mad at me?

307
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,947
No

308
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,750
Well, I'm mad at you

309
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,490
Do you know how long
I waited for you that day?

310
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,559
Nope, no clue

311
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,132
How could you not come
after keeping me worried so much?

312
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,669
I waited for you that day
until the restaurant closed

313
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,172
I mean, you could've told me
if you weren't coming

314
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,210
I was so worried about you

315
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,796
(I still couldn't reach you
the next morning)

316
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,902
(Tangy fruit will cheer you up)
(Wouldn't you be upset if you were me?)

317
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,604
(But...)

318
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,343
But you...

319
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,744
I what?

320
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:31,550
Did I do something wrong?

321
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,527
(No)

322
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,699
(I'll get fooled again)

323
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,469
I hate you, Mr. Cha

324
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,003
What?

325
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,272
I...

326
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,709
I didn't go that day because I hate you

327
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,344
No

328
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,015
You were there to meet me, Song-yi

329
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,319
But you saw something

330
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,321
Right?

331
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,129
Right

332
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:20,999
I did

333
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,337
But why didn't you ask me?

334
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,515
Who was that person
you were with that day?

335
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,951
My ex-wife

336
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,754
See?

337
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,923
That's why I didn't want to ask you

338
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,898
Don't you want to know why
I met her?

339
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,199
No, I don't want to know

340
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,767
I'm not going to ask

341
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:57,969
Why?

342
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,309
I don't want to get fooled again

343
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,351
She just kept

344
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,221
calling me

345
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,490
I don't want to hear it

346
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,591
Please hear me out

347
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,394
- I didn't call her
- Why?

348
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,630
Now that it's happened,
you should get back together with her

349
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,869
I know you don't want to hear it,
but please, listen to me

350
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,943
I'm trying my best to talk to you, Song-yi

351
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,681
I want to hold on to you, Song-yi

352
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,123
(Hey, it's me
How are you doing?)

353
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,759
(Did you delete my number?)

354
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,562
(Delete)

355
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,997
(No messages)

356
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,633
(I don't want to get back together
with her)

357
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,135
(I have no intention whatsoever)

358
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,939
(I have no feelings for her)

359
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:13,311
(However, I don't want to erase
the times we've spent together)

360
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,014
(That's it)

361
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,950
("Right, that happened")

362
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,952
(That and nothing more)

363
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,525
(I have something to tell you
Can we meet up?)

364
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,237
Thank you

365
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,507
for letting me go on "Divorcee Express"

366
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,590
What are you doing?

367
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,562
How are you?

368
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,832
Does it make you happy
when you do things your way?

369
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,968
It doesn't make me upset

370
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,841
(Wait)

371
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,410
"Divorcee Express"?

372
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,312
The dating show for divorcees?

373
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,414
Yes

374
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,384
She wants to go on that show,

375
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,288
but she was worried that
if she didn't tell me about it beforehand,

376
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,992
I might go online and expose her
on the viewer feedback page

377
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:08,860
Why?

378
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,794
Well...

379
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,764
I guess she didn't want to say that

380
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,532
we got divorced because of her affair

381
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,170
But, then...

382
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,008
What about yesterday at the cafe?

383
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,509
Cafe?

384
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,977
What cafe?

385
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,148
It's so amazing
how we ran into each other again

386
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,484
I don't know what's amazing about that

387
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,886
Anyway,

388
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,656
I said you could go on the show

389
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,157
Why did you come to find me again?

390
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,425
What are you saying?

391
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,826
I'm not here to see you

392
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,362
I'm here to see the owner

393
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,598
What? Who?

394
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,867
The cafe owner

395
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,468
He's famous

396
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,137
Didn't you know?

397
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,274
Enjoy

398
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,642
You're so handsome

399
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,778
- Thank you
- Thank you

400
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,981
He's so cute

401
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,658
I'm disappointed in you, Song-yi

402
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,162
Who knew she'd come for
that kind of reason?

403
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,833
Who could've imagined an ex-wife asking
for permission to go on "Divorcee Express"?

404
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,536
From now on, ask me

405
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,573
Okay

406
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,742
I'll answer everything

407
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,479
Okay, I'll ask everything from now on

408
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,432
By the way, is Mr. Kim that famous?

409
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,201
Oh, yes

410
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,971
I heard that he got calls
to be cast on non-celebrity dating shows

411
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,173
I see

412
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,444
Why? Does it...

413
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,013
make you regret your decision?

414
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,583
Me? No!

415
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,184
Not at all

416
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,052
Are you sure?

417
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,020
Of course

418
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,958
It seems like you're regretting it

419
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,493
No

420
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,028
Are you sure?

421
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,363
Yeah!

422
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,334
Huh? Isn't that Uncle Hyeon-woo
and Aunt Song-yi?

423
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,668
Shh

424
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,103
Shh

425
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,538
- Okay, okay
- Okay

426
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,916
So, what are you planning to do now?

427
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,518
Do what?

428
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,021
Are you going to work at the cafe again?

429
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,191
And what will you do about your house?

430
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,161
I'm not sure

431
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,230
I don't know what
I'm going to do with my life

432
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,499
Nothing goes my way

433
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,202
However,

434
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,105
I do know one thing for sure

435
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,573
What's that?

436
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,677
That I like you, Hyeon-woo

437
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,316
I like you, too, Song-yi

438
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,123
I want to start a proper relationship
with you, Hyeon-woo

439
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,759
Like, make it official
"Bang, bang, bang!"

440
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,794
Isn't that so tacky?

441
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,997
What? Do you hate tacky stuff?

442
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,068
No, I love tacky stuff

443
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,070
Tackiness runs through my veins

444
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,273
I also like to play tic-tac-toe

445
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,510
I also like the bricks
stacked neatly like this

446
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,651
Then...

447
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,022
Are we officially a couple now?

448
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,630
Bang, bang, bang
It's Day 1 starting today

449
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,499
Gosh, it's so tacky

450
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,002
What?

451
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,006
Bang, bang, bang! Day 1!
Isn't that what you wanted?

452
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,276
Bang, bang, bang! Day 1!

453
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,313
Bang, bang! Bang, bang!

454
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,717
I'm sorry

455
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:36,227
I think if you had better memories
in Cheonpo,

456
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,532
it would've been easier to make decisions

457
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,769
Tell me about it

458
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,241
It would've been nice
if I had met you first

459
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,639
How about this?

460
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,350
From now on,

461
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,720
let's make good memories together

462
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:42,694
Okay

463
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,249
Honey, are you okay?

464
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,918
Yeah, I'm fine

465
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,920
Don't worry about me,
and just watch the kids

466
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,556
Teo, she's doing a fire show

467
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,590
Wow!

468
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,826
Kids, that's not a fire show

469
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,062
She's cooking for you, okay?

470
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,332
Let's play

471
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,167
Rock, paper, scissors again

472
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,270
Honey, are you really okay?
Are you sure you don't need my help?

473
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,739
Yeah, I'm fine

474
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,742
Jin-ho, I'm almost done
Bring the kids to the table in 5 minutes

475
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,714
Teo won, right?

476
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,216
Now, one, two

477
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:38,783
Me too, me too

478
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,052
Okay, Sia

479
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,791
Be careful
Make sure you don't fall

480
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,802
Wow, it looks good

481
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,770
Right?

482
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,772
Yes, it looks delicious

483
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,777
You burnt the fish
It's all black

484
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,513
He's going to eat all the burnt part

485
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,615
Me?

486
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,518
Yes, then who would?

487
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,620
It's unhealthy for the kids

488
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,321
Yes, that's true

489
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,492
Let's all say, "Thank you for the meal"
And start eating, okay?

490
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,393
Okay

491
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,729
- Thank you for the meal
- Thank you for the meal

492
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,477
It tastes bad, yuck

493
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,580
Teo, you can't complain about food

494
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,452
But it tastes weird

495
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,455
Teo, weird taste is also a taste

496
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,123
Enjoy it if you can't avoid it

497
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,729
How are you eating this food?

498
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,730
Huh?

499
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,139
It's not that bad if you hold your breath

500
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,653
But Ms. Ahn...

501
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,888
Yes?

502
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,058
Seeing this food

503
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:32,363
makes me miss Mommy

504
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:52,984
Mommy and Daddy went to meet
baby Ddoddo, right?

505
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,888
That's a really hard
and amazing thing to do

506
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:01,092
Sia, Teo
You can wait for Mom and Dad, right?

507
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,927
But...

508
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,030
If they know that Sia and Teo are crying,

509
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,332
it will make them really sad

510
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,904
Don't you want to tell Mommy and Daddy
how bravely you waited for them?

511
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,505
Right?

512
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,973
There, there

513
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,742
I'm impressed, Jin-ho

514
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,714
Should we eat as we wait for them?

515
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,487
Honey!

516
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,523
- Wow!
- Whoa!

517
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,593
It's baby Ddoddo!

518
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,129
So pretty

519
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,906
(Tangy fruit will cheer you up)

520
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,708
Come on

521
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,445
This isn't just ordinary tangerine

522
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,482
Why is it so sweet?

523
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,858
(Kids, your mom and dad...)

524
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,828
Song, what is this noise?

525
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,899
It sounds like Chan-yang's voice

526
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,777
(Ta-da!)

527
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,380
(Our Ddoddo has arrived!)

528
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:34,452
Eun-gyu! Come and see the photo
of Hana's baby

529
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,693
Oh my gosh! She's so tiny

530
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,295
Right? She looks like an angel

531
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,831
I can't tell if the baby looks like
Hana or Seong-tae

532
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,233
You can't tell at that stage

533
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,004
But the eyebrows look exactly like Hana's

534
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,874
Mom, I want a sibling

535
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,510
No, Jay, you're not having a sibling

536
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,178
Hey, don't be too decisive

537
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,847
You never know how life will turn out

538
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,149
Jay's not having a sibling

539
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,019
Wow, it's so cute

540
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,320
So adorable

541
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,389
Jay must've been so tiny like this, too

542
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,890
Jay was cuter

543
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,259
- So adorable
- So cute

544
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,766
Taking care of the kids is no joke

545
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,168
I know

546
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,138
I'd rather lift some more
weights at the gym

547
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,640
No, I'd rather work late

548
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,443
When is their grandmother coming?

549
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,278
She's almost here

550
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,051
Let's get some rest, too

551
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,586
I'm exhausted

552
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,282
You know what?

553
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,117
Huh?

554
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:18,456
I saw a whole new side of you today

555
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:20,991
What do you mean?

556
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,764
I feel like you'd become a wonderful dad

557
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,937
Although it was very tough today,

558
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,374
I actually had a great time

559
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,342
Really?

560
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,012
I thought you'd say
you'd never watch kids again

561
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,383
I didn't expect you to watch
the kids so well, too

562
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,718
I know

563
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,955
I didn't know I was the type of person
the kids like

564
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,825
How should I put it?

565
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:00,731
I feel like I'm finally
getting to know the real you

566
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,011
- (Everyone dreams of an ordinary life)
- Great job today

567
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,212
You, too

568
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,181
(A life that's leisurely,)

569
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,150
(comfortable,)

570
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,085
(and peaceful as others' lives)

571
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,119
You worked so hard

572
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:28,492
(Just an ordinary life that could be
considered the most average life)

573
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,897
(I thought that by the time I turned 35,)

574
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,400
(I'd be at the center of that average life)

575
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,170
(Having a husband,)

576
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,206
(a baby,)

577
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,843
(living in an apartment,)

578
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,348
(and driving a sedan)

579
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,717
(That kind of life)

580
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,420
Mommy!

581
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,355
(However,)

582
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,290
Bye

583
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,026
(there was no such thing
as an average life)

584
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,429
(It seems like everyone is
living similar lives,)

585
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,165
(but when you take a closer look,
it's all different)

586
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,635
Jay

587
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,938
Have a safe trip home

588
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,906
Bye, Song

589
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,877
Be a good boy, okay?

590
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,647
You should go now

591
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,185
Take care

592
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,787
Call me

593
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,690
Don't skip your meals

594
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,731
Go already

595
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,333
We'll get going

596
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,267
Okay

597
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,204
Keep in touch, okay?

598
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,509
See you

599
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,493
(I realized that
everyone lives differently)

600
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,930
(only after)

601
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,333
(coming to Cheonpo,)

602
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,903
(a city where
the average Korean people live)

603
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,005
(Quick Sale) (Cheonpo Central River
Forét the Hill 808-1604, 600 million)

604
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,818
That cafe part-timer...

605
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,154
I mean, the cafe owner

606
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,557
Is this the show that the cafe owner is on?

607
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,026
I heard that it's such a popular show

608
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,794
"Love Signal"

609
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,929
Yes

610
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,466
I think "Love Signal" is much more fun
than "Divorcee Express"

611
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,534
It's more pure and innocent

612
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,138
The cafe owner is the most popular
among male participants

613
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,406
Is that so?

614
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,409
He looks so good on camera, too

615
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,414
That cafe became so crowded that
there were no seats

616
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,454
He looks so cool

617
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,289
Hi, everyone!

618
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,325
Long time no see!

619
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,767
How have you been?

620
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,142
Oh my, that's amazing

621
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,311
An online shopping mall
for children's clothes?

622
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,314
You've become so successful
since we last met

623
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:42,353
As you all know, I got divorced

624
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,656
I was worried about

625
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,325
how I'll raise Ethan alone

626
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,362
But each day brings its own bread

627
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,598
I studied design in college,

628
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,701
so I made some clothes
that would suit Ethan

629
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,603
And that became a huge hit

630
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,474
This is the clothes
I wanted to get for Louis!

631
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,742
But it was sold out...

632
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,344
Really? I'll send you a sample

633
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,316
You should pick one, too
I'll give you an employee discount

634
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,854
You've become quite generous

635
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:21,592
Before, you didn't spend any money
because you were scared of your husband

636
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,895
Oh, did I?

637
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,130
Yes

638
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,771
Anyway, it's so good to see you

639
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,806
I really missed you

640
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,675
Then, you could've called me

641
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,143
I didn't change my number,

642
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,781
but none of you called me once

643
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,859
I'm so busy these days that I just
can't keep track of time

644
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,196
You two should start something, too

645
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,397
Maybe start a side gig

646
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:04,034
You need to work, am I right?

647
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,237
How can you stay at home all day?

648
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,373
Right?

649
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,442
I sell enzymes

650
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:13,610
Is it going well?

651
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,745
Yes, it's going well

652
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,146
I'm happy for you

653
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,721
What?

654
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,090
You want me to buy one more?

655
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,159
(Honey, that's far from enough
to feed everyone)

656
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,861
(The kids eat so much)

657
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,963
But I've already put three bags in the cart

658
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,732
Plus, it's a big one

659
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,000
They can't eat that fast

660
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:37,835
(Come on!)

661
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,471
(Can you just buy it without complaining?)

662
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,774
Honey, I'm not complaining

663
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,710
We've gone way over our food budget
this month

664
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,079
How can we raise three kids?

665
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,383
(Didn't you say that
kids are born with a spoon in their mouth?)

666
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,452
(I wonder who said that?)

667
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,453
Who?

668
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,456
Who said such a thing? A spoon?

669
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:00,824
I take that back

670
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,330
Anything else I need to get?

671
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,071
(He held my hands)

672
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,774
(I could feel every joint of his fingers)

673
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,010
(His long and white fingers)

674
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,746
(were enough to turn me on)

675
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,949
(He yanked off my shirt)

676
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,988
Shirt?

677
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,323
Slip?

678
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,793
Bra?

679
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,329
Geez, what should he yank off?

680
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,066
Does she have to wear something?

681
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,868
What?

682
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,471
Just don't put anything on her

683
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,441
His fingers should tickle
her back right away

684
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,745
Nice

685
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,880
Are you a genius?

686
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,369
What are you doing?

687
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,972
- What?
- It tickles, Hyeon-woo

688
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,907
Seriously, stop that

689
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:24,942
Come on

690
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:26,877
It tickles!

691
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,714
Gosh!

692
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,516
Hyeon-woo, are you all right?

693
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,451
- My arm
- Let me see

694
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,320
- Oh, my arm...
- I'm sorry

695
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,156
It's because you started tickling me

696
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,894
I think it's all better now

697
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,130
Seriously!

698
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,500
So cute

699
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,603
Stop it

700
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,705
What? You're cute

701
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:58,942
But then...

702
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,646
How much longer do we have to
keep doing this?

703
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,182
What do you mean?

704
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,619
Being polite and careful with each other

705
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,888
Do you want to start speaking casually?

706
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,159
I thought it was time...

707
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,228
No?

708
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,065
If we're not sure
if we can keep using honorifics,

709
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:26,403
we might as well
speak casually from now on

710
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,306
You didn't even remember it last time

711
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:30,974
And now you're suddenly suggesting
we speak casually?

712
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:36,847
Wouldn't it be awkward to use honorifics
when we move in together?

713
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,985
You want to move in with me?

714
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,594
You never thought about that?

715
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,231
We live next door

716
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,002
It's a waste of money to pay for
maintenance fees for two houses

717
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:28,832
Song-yi!

718
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,935
Song, I'm home

719
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:33,770
Song-yi!

720
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,938
They're back?

721
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:35,973
Oh my gosh

722
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,375
- What? Why?
- Song-yi!

723
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,144
Song, I'm home

724
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,556
What happened? Huh?

725
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,425
We just... came back

726
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,727
Hey!

727
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,429
This isn't a situation where you can
just say that like it's nothing

728
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,367
I've thought it over

729
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,736
and decided that it'd be better to stay

730
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,037
What?

731
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,941
But what is Uncle doing there?

732
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,560
Hi, Uncle

733
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,461
Hi

734
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:33,764
Hello

735
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,403
Sorry for ruining the mood

736
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,574
We'll move out as soon as we find a place

737
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,510
Can we just stay here for a few days?

738
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,847
You just leave
and come back as you please

739
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,550
I mean, what's going on?

740
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,120
Song-yi, let's hear her out first

741
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,157
I'm sure she has her reasons

742
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,762
Tell me

743
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,498
We...

744
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,101
want to live in Korea

745
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,269
That's why we came back

746
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,940
It seems like Jay needs a family

747
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,343
Jay's grandma, grandpa,
and even his aunt are here in Korea

748
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,312
And...

749
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,181
And?

750
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,855
I also need it, too

751
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,124
Family

752
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:34,017
Wow, it's my house!
I'm not moving!

753
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,921
I'm not moving!

754
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,256
Jay

755
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,591
If you run around,
the downstairs neighbor will come up

756
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,293
Oh my gosh

757
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,730
We'll get another call
from the maintenance office

758
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,566
I'm not moving!

759
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,569
It's nice and crowded

760
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,745
Song-yi, do you need help with anything?

761
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:02,913
No, I'm good

762
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,315
I washed them

763
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,517
Hey, can you put this one over there?

764
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,352
Sure, I'll put that over there

765
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,422
Jay loves them

766
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:14,824
Jay loves vegetables?

767
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,626
Of course, he's not picky,
just like his mom

768
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,195
Song-yi!

769
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,196
Hi, Song-yi

770
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,533
Why did you bring so many things?

771
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,001
What were you doing?

772
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:25,835
We just need to grill the meat now

773
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,536
Hello

774
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,470
- Hi
- Hello

775
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:28,738
Hi, Jin-ho

776
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,906
How was the drive?

777
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,109
Aunt Song-yi!

778
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,713
- Should we play soccer?
- Go have fun

779
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:37,881
Hello

780
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:38,848
Hana

781
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:39,816
Oh, it's Hana

782
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,351
Hana!

783
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,253
(Oh my gosh!)

784
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,489
Thank you so much

785
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,124
With the newborn

786
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,728
and two kids full of energy, it's just...

787
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,330
So exhausting these days

788
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,934
Hana and I have been handling tasks
in perfect harmony

789
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,538
(Since I'm busy,)

790
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:05,008
(it helps when you take the twins out
to play with them)

791
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,042
Of course!

792
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,312
Yes, ma'am

793
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,249
Still, there are so many people here
to help me out

794
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,919
I'm super lucky!

795
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:17,754
That's so old

796
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,788
Boomer

797
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,590
(Gosh, I'm so embarrassed)

798
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,094
(Song-yi, do you need anything?)

799
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,596
(I sent some stuff via Seong-tae)

800
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,764
That's all right

801
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,267
Just take care of yourself, okay? Bye

802
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,668
It's Ddoddo!

803
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,770
- So cute
- Ddoddo

804
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,006
- It's so tiny! Oh my gosh
- Can she see us?

805
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,007
She's so cute

806
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,541
- Aunts!
- Isn't she a carbon copy of myself?

807
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,177
Yes, the baby has your eyebrows

808
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,749
Bye

809
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,018
You're really good at grilling meat

810
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,519
It looks so good, Seong-tae

811
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,755
You need to be an all-rounder
if you want to be a dad

812
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,760
Here, Jay's favorite salad

813
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,195
Thank you for the food

814
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,964
The kids need to eat vegetables

815
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:02,799
Thank you!

816
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,302
Wow, that looks delicious

817
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,237
Let's eat

818
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,139
- Wow! It looks delicious!
- Wow! It looks delicious!

819
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,441
Take one each

820
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,682
Song-yi

821
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:20,116
Say, "Ah"

822
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:22,986
"Ah"

823
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,657
Go ahead and eat

824
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,328
It's so good

825
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,002
Say, "Ah"

826
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,306
- Jay, open your mouth
- It's so good

827
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,478
(Jackpot Real Estate)

828
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,785
Hello?

829
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:01,257
(Ms. Ji! There's a buyer
who wants to see your house next week)

830
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,659
Oh, that

831
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,102
I've thought about it a lot,

832
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,471
but I decided not to sell the house

833
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,340
I want to take my house off the market

834
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,916
(My life, which may seem
insignificant and below average)

835
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,652
Help yourselves, everyone!

836
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,423
Eat up, Jay

837
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,793
- It's so good
- Eat up! You too, Jay

838
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:40,697
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

839
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,237
Let's eat

840
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,005
Enjoy

841
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,073
Bon appétit

842
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,308
Thank you

843
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:53,910
It looks so good

844
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,245
Here

845
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,116
- Is it good?
- You should eat, Hyeon-woo

846
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,884
Me too?

847
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,819
It's so good
Do you want me to feed you?

848
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:06,456
- (I'm sure there will be moments)
- Say, "Ah"

849
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,591
(of disappointment,)

850
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,726
Is it too big? Let me cut it for you

851
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,028
(sadness, and anger moving forward)

852
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,101
(But I'm sure)

853
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,838
(I'll be able to)

854
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,274
(smile again)
