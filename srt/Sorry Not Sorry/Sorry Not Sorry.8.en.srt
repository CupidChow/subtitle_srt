1
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,089
Is she still sleeping?

2
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:59,480
Look at the time
She should be up by now

3
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,628
You don't remember which unit it was?

4
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,330
Which unit was it again?

5
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,233
Let's see

6
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,342
Which unit are you visiting?

7
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,614
We forgot which unit it was

8
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:25,452
Do you, by any chance, know Ji Song-yi?

9
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,988
Geez, young people need more
information than just the name

10
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,623
Are you Song-yi's parents?

11
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,659
I live upstairs from her

12
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,693
Oh, my!

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,562
Really?

14
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,564
Thank goodness

15
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,766
Is she not answering her phone?

16
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,635
She's probably busy getting ready
for kindergarten

17
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,304
You can come inside with me

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,440
- Kindergarten?
- Kindergarten?

19
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,315
Thank you

20
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,111
Good morning

21
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,015
Hi

22
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,690
Song-yi

23
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,692
You're up

24
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,330
Your clothes aren't dry yet
Can you wait a bit longer?

25
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,706
By the way, Song-yi...

26
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,143
How many clothes did I...

27
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,278
Take off?

28
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,484
You didn't take off that many

29
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,589
Baby, did you sleep well?

30
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,597
Hello

31
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:08,248
Love? It's worthless

32
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,950
I'm never going to do it again

33
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,522
Geez, do you know how many times
you've said that already?

34
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,160
Love is worthless

35
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,562
I'm never going to do it again

36
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,998
Stop, stop

37
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,866
It'll get stuck in my head!

38
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,401
Hold on

39
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,837
Be careful!

40
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,278
Password

41
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,314
Love

42
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,285
It's worthless

43
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,987
I'm never going to do it again

44
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,460
Come on

45
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,995
Your password

46
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,865
- Hyeon-woo
- Yes?

47
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,099
What's the password?

48
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,235
Password?

49
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,169
Yeah

50
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,974
F...

51
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,313
Falling in love

52
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,849
It's worthless

53
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,652
I'm never going to do it again

54
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,228
Okay, let's never fall in love again

55
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,467
Don't fall in love

56
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,343
Huh?

57
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,847
S... Song-yi?

58
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,418
Song-yi

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,289
Song-yi

60
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,475
Oh my gosh

61
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,327
I'm sorry

62
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,762
We took up your time
because of our daughter

63
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,864
Don't say that

64
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,932
I'm good friends with Song-yi

65
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,736
It's nice to see neighbors getting along

66
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,205
How did you two become friends?

67
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,607
We...

68
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,978
You talk so kindly, young lady

69
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,115
Are you married?

70
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,683
Yes

71
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,289
I guess everyone else except
our daughters is married

72
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,324
Why would you say that?

73
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,427
What? Am I wrong?

74
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,765
One's a workaholic who's not interested
in getting married

75
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,300
And the other one...

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,572
suddenly announces her divorce

77
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,675
Gosh, I wonder who they take after

78
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,745
They're your kids
Of course, they take after you

79
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,849
By the way...

80
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,818
What does your husband do?

81
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,421
Among your husband's friends,

82
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,726
do you know anyone who could be
a good match for Song-yi?

83
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,031
In my eyes, they sure are your kids

84
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,108
- Hey...
- What?

85
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,443
Come and join us

86
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,878
No, I'm good

87
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,622
Song-yi

88
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,925
I'll come to get my clothes later

89
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,961
See you at the office

90
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,634
Mr. Cha, have some breakfast

91
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,935
You should eat with us

92
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,936
You'll get a sour stomach
if you skip breakfast

93
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,006
No, I'm good
I don't eat breakfast

94
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,274
Then, bye

95
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,077
What about your bag?

96
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,778
It's okay

97
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,114
- Oh, my!
- Oh!

98
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,820
Who...

99
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,723
Oh, my

100
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,591
What are you doing here, Mr. Cha?

101
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,262
Cute T-shirt

102
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,731
It suits you perfectly

103
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,274
M... Mom

104
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,514
Hello

105
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,886
[Sorry Not Sorry]

106
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,414
So? Do you want to start explaining?

107
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:43,916
What?

108
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,658
Oh, there's not much to explain
about that gentleman over there

109
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,663
I was wondering
why you weren't picking up your phone

110
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,398
Was it because
you had a man hidden at home?

111
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,800
No!

112
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,802
It's not what you think

113
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,540
He lives across the hall,

114
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,375
and he drank too much last night

115
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,879
What does that have to do with

116
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,148
him being here?

117
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,618
It's...

118
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,157
We work together,
and one thing led to another

119
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,394
Yes, one thing led to another

120
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,196
One thing... Another thing...

121
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,798
Then...

122
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,667
What about her?

123
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,170
What is she doing here?

124
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,513
Surprise!

125
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,282
It's your 60th birthday in a few days

126
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,184
I wanted to surprise you

127
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,787
It'll spoil the fun
if I tell you in advance

128
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,222
What?

129
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,090
A surprise?

130
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,559
Gosh

131
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,128
I mean...

132
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,064
Getting older is nothing to brag about

133
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,001
Wow, look at you
Without even blinking an eye,

134
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,236
you're lying...

135
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,075
I arrived last weekend

136
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,246
Song-yi and I were secretly planning

137
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,114
your 60th birthday party

138
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,486
But we got busted

139
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,555
Mom's 60th birthday?

140
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,891
That was this year?

141
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,961
Wow, look at her pretending to be clueless
about our surprise party

142
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,031
You should consider acting
You've got the skills

143
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,967
Did you really come back last weekend?

144
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,570
Where is your luggage?

145
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,073
I left it at the hotel

146
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,443
And what's all this?

147
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,677
What's with the toys?

148
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,779
But, Song-yi!

149
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,385
She...

150
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,660
She's sort of dating someone

151
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,328
- What?
- What?

152
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,162
Excuse me?

153
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,971
I didn't want to bother them, so I'm going
back and forth between the hotel and here

154
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,241
I wanted to help them out,

155
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,343
but it was too obvious

156
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,417
Oh!

157
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,025
Hi, Grandma

158
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,428
Grandpa

159
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,597
Grandpa?

160
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,878
(You can send the money to this account)
(I've deposited the money)

161
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,547
This feels off

162
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,451
Why isn't she responding?

163
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,220
What is it?

164
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,758
Teo's scooter's broken

165
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,394
We have to get him a new one
when he grows older anyway,

166
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,297
so I went on this second-hand platform,
but the seller isn't responding

167
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,233
Just get him a new one
It doesn't cost much

168
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,768
What are you saying?

169
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,905
We got him a new one last time,
and he lost it the next year

170
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,275
We're going to have to spend
a lot of money on Ddoddo

171
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,177
We should use get a used one
for things like this

172
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,813
Then, be patient
She'll text you back

173
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,282
It's been ten minutes
I already sent the money, too

174
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,251
I thought it's been an hour or something

175
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,553
If it's only been ten minutes,
wait a bit more

176
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,390
It's unusual to wait ten minutes
on this platform

177
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,460
Honey, you tend to be very persistent...

178
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,364
on things like this

179
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,867
Don't worry too much

180
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,303
You should go to work

181
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,240
Teo

182
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,043
Why isn't she responding?

183
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,483
So, how old are you?

184
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,221
Dad, I told you,
it's not what you think it is

185
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,957
Yeah, right
Then, what's with his outfit?

186
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,527
We'll wait and see
what relationship you two have

187
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,833
I'm the same age as Song-yi

188
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,503
It can be hard when there's a big age gap

189
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,005
Same-age couples are better

190
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,276
It'll feel like growing old
with your friend

191
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,414
But

192
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,151
there seems to be a misunderstanding

193
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,755
Song-yi and I are not in a relationship
I'm serious

194
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,091
I just live across...

195
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,325
Come on

196
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,363
That's how people end up
falling in love and stuff

197
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,234
What do you do for a living?

198
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:03,836
Oh

199
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,971
I'm a lawyer

200
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,341
A lawyer?

201
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,844
Oh, honey

202
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,847
Not all lawyers make a lot of money

203
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,318
Do you own the house
you're living in right now?

204
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,087
Well, yes, for now

205
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,761
Do you have any siblings?

206
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,833
I have a younger brother

207
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,337
Do you have to hold a memorial service
since you're the first son?

208
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,939
No, we don't hold a memorial service

209
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,811
Where do your parents live?

210
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,479
Sorry?

211
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,649
My parents live in Seoul

212
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,220
If your in-laws live close, it won't be
a hassle to visit them during the holidays

213
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,792
But if they live too close,
there will be a lot to worry about

214
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,226
and a lot to take care of

215
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,762
Dad, nothing is going on between us

216
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,432
Be quiet!

217
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,515
So...

218
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:13,973
Do you have any plans for this weekend?

219
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,942
Me?

220
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,846
You never know how things will turn out

221
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:25,517
I'd like to invite you
to my 60th birthday party

222
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,319
- What?
- What?

223
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,887
Your 60th birthday party?

224
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,397
Let's talk about this later

225
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,099
- Follow me
- Okay

226
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,801
Oh, um...

227
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,108
Sir, ma'am, I should get going

228
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,776
- Sure, sure
- Okay

229
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012
- Bye
- Bye

230
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,888
Sorry for putting you on the spot

231
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,591
Don't worry about her birthday party
You don't have to come

232
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,361
But I can't ignore your parent's invitation

233
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,297
It's really fine, though

234
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,135
My parents always make a big deal
out of nothing

235
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,838
They're just worrying about their kids

236
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,974
It's understandable

237
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,643
My mom always calls me while watching TV,

238
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,980
saying she'll sign me up for a
dating program for divorced people

239
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,449
My parents say exactly the same thing

240
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,250
They say that to me, too

241
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,201
I owe you so much

242
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,371
Yeah, well

243
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:53,839
Yes

244
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,445
Hey...

245
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,691
You don't have to come to work today

246
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,593
since your parents are here

247
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,864
Thank you

248
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,232
Sure

249
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,783
There's no way the phone won't work

250
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,384
How strange

251
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,489
Hana, good morning!

252
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,323
Hey

253
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,627
Why do you look upset?

254
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,898
I bought Teo's scooter
on the second-hand platform

255
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,535
But the seller isn't responding
I even sent the money

256
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,572
Maybe it's a scam

257
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,908
What? No way

258
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,011
I checked the manner meter
and the seller's history

259
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:06,945
Is that so?

260
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,384
Hey, something really funny
happened this morning

261
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,186
What happened?

262
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,825
What?

263
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,827
What's Song-yi going to do now?

264
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,462
Hello, sir

265
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,732
Jay's grandma and grandpa came over

266
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,867
He won't be able to go to kindergarten
for a few days

267
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,336
- Yes
- Goal!

268
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,039
I'll see you guys later

269
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,307
Hey

270
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,711
Aren't you here for my surprise party?
Where are you going?

271
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,280
Huh?

272
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,186
I'm also on a business trip
See you

273
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,357
I knew it

274
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,892
You're so cold-hearted

275
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,797
Your work is more important
than my birthday, isn't it?

276
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,532
Be honest with me

277
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,834
Are you really here for my birthday?

278
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,637
Why would you say that?

279
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,040
I am here for your 60th birthday

280
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,877
You should see how other daughters
treat their mothers

281
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,779
When it's their mom's 60th birthday,

282
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,449
they come together
and prepare something special

283
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,753
But our kids...

284
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,889
Enough with other daughters

285
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,324
I'm so sick of it

286
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,293
Song-yi

287
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,029
What's wrong with your skin?

288
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,933
I know you have a boyfriend,
but you're not married yet

289
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,970
Women should always care
about their looks

290
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,405
Mom, you're so old-fashioned

291
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,809
And I told you, there's nothing
going on between me and Mr. Cha

292
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,444
Hey, look at me

293
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,781
You should always care about
your looks like me

294
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,987
Song-yi, I found an amazing facial mask

295
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,821
Come over here

296
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,888
No, I don't want to

297
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,258
- Hey, come sit
- No

298
00:20:59,258 --> 00:20:59,992
Hurry

299
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,093
I don't want to

300
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,268
See? Isn't this nice and moist?

301
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,870
I know this product
I use it, too

302
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,771
Really?

303
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,107
Why didn't you tell me?

304
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,843
Did you gain weight?

305
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,811
Mom, don't touch my belly

306
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,546
Oh, gosh
Are you crazy?

307
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,784
You should start losing weight
to look gorgeous

308
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,953
- Stop it already!
- in your wedding dress

309
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,388
- What will you do?
- I gained weight because of you!

310
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,956
What are you saying?

311
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,325
- Please go home, please
- Gosh, look how wide your back is!

312
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,298
She's driving me nuts

313
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,534
Are your parents staying at your place
until your mom's birthday party?

314
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,269
Yeah, I think so

315
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,405
She's cleaning my house right now

316
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,109
Then, your parents don't know
Eun-gyu returned to Korea for good?

317
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,512
No

318
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,647
What do I do?

319
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,916
Song-yi

320
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,653
Why don't you take this opportunity
to make it work with that lawyer?

321
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,056
What? No way

322
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,940
So, you and that lawyer...

323
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,075
What was that?

324
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:23,942
What?

325
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,377
What did you do just now?

326
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,246
I'm pressuring

327
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,181
Pressure what?

328
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,116
Hana is trying to deny reality

329
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,984
She got scammed

330
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,653
Scammed?

331
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:35,921
You? Of all people?

332
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,690
I didn't get scammed

333
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,825
That's impossible

334
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,728
I've never been scammed
over things like this

335
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,030
She bought something this morning
on a second-hand platform

336
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,699
But the seller ghosted after
receiving her money

337
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,801
It is a scam

338
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,770
She replied, though

339
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,238
We're meeting in person

340
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,507
Look

341
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,813
(If you don't answer on the count of three,
I'm going to the police)

342
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,181
(Three)

343
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,216
(Two)

344
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,384
(One)

345
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,386
(One and a half)

346
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,154
(Hello)

347
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,023
(Will you please meet me?)

348
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,625
(You'll be there, right?)

349
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,762
When? Where?

350
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,232
We're deciding on it right now

351
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,933
through a conversation like this

352
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,502
See?

353
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,670
It is a scam

354
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,407
No, it's not

355
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,274
Wanna bet?

356
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,144
Hana, how long has it been?

357
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,012
You haven't got a reply yet, right?

358
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:35,914
Huh?

359
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,050
Oh! I got a message

360
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,586
Not

361
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,555
Oh! It's my phone

362
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,829
What the heck?
You've got to be kidding me!

363
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,730
- What?
- Why?

364
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,035
What?

365
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,670
What's wrong?

366
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,243
It's a misunderstanding

367
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,447
It's not

368
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,850
It's a misunderstanding

369
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,820
It's not

370
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,522
Misunderstanding?

371
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,502
Let's take these out

372
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:31,803
and do it again

373
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,372
Now

374
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,542
Confess to her

375
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,079
(There used to be an "Ex-boyfriend Time")
Or not

376
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,180
Don't confess to her

377
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,017
(He'd send texts at 2 to 3 in the morning)
Don't confess to her

378
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,486
Confess to her

379
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,756
(Song-yi, are you sleeping?)

380
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:55,961
What?

381
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,696
It's that jerk?

382
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,066
Your ex-husband?

383
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,934
The one that cheated in front of you?

384
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,443
(But after a divorce,)

385
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,745
(I found out about "Ex-husband Time")

386
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,681
(It's between 8 and 10 PM)

387
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:21,553
(The time when middle-aged men
get drunk after a get-together)

388
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,267
I hope I don't run into her

389
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,755
Are you all right?

390
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,056
Sorry?

391
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,761
Gosh

392
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,232
It's not even 10 PM,
but you're drunk already

393
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,205
I'll help you get to your place safely

394
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,473
Which floor do you live in?

395
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,244
Oh, me?

396
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,446
Uh...

397
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,249
I...

398
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,185
16th floor!

399
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,421
Sorry? 16th floor?

400
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:30,588
What?

401
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,657
No

402
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:34,639
No, no

403
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,762
6th floor!

404
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,331
- 6th floor?
- 6th floor

405
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,632
Yes, the 6th floor...

406
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,701
I see

407
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,337
Let me do it

408
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,207
(Please enter the password)

409
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,977
(The door is opening)

410
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:53,912
Thank you!

411
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,347
Thank you

412
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,690
Didn't you use one this morning?
You're putting it on again?

413
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,593
I use two sheet masks every day

414
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,495
I'm just trying to become pretty

415
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:11,963
She's right, Dad

416
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,367
It's better than the entire family
looking gloomy on her 60th birthday

417
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,179
I'm drunk

418
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,615
So, I forgot!

419
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,550
I forgot for a second

420
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:34,886
What do you call that?

421
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,489
Yes, I forgot the password

422
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,290
Thank you

423
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,792
I can

424
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,428
find my house on my own

425
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,096
I'm fine

426
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,967
Yes, it's understandable

427
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,772
I can totally relate

428
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,277
Are you celebrating something?

429
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,912
Oh, this?

430
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,549
It's for my wife

431
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,921
I knew you were a kind person

432
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,457
Your wife must be very happy

433
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,566
I don't have anything to give you
at the moment...

434
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,501
Thank you

435
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,804
This, this...

436
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,307
Ta-da!

437
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,776
Me?

438
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,578
Yes, here you go

439
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,412
For...

440
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,181
For me?

441
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,682
Thank you

442
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,583
Oh, okay

443
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,018
Thank you

444
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:49,127
When you have time,
you should come to the park for a run

445
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,929
- Run?
- Yes

446
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,263
Sounds good

447
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,234
Thank you! Okay!

448
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,235
Yes, yes

449
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,981
That's hilarious

450
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,435
Who is it this late at night?

451
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,873
Nobody

452
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,674
Is it that lawyer from earlier?

453
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,678
Just tell him to come over
instead of talking on the phone

454
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,113
No

455
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,858
(I'm in front of your house)

456
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,528
(Can you meet me right now?)

457
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,462
Crazy jerk

458
00:29:58,763 --> 00:29:59,597
Song-yi!

459
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,066
Watch your language
There's a kid in the room

460
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,502
I need to go throw out food waste

461
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,504
I threw it out this morning

462
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,076
There are more people in the house,
so the food waste is piling up so quickly

463
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,479
There are so many flies around the trash

464
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,549
I'll be right back

465
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,753
Did you see that?

466
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,924
She said she was taking out the trash,
but she left empty-handed

467
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,993
I told you
She has a boyfriend

468
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,295
Good for her

469
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,030
It must be that guy across the hall, right?

470
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,432
Leave her alone

471
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,569
Of course, I'll leave her alone
She's dating the lawyer

472
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:45,944
Song-yi

473
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,613
Hi

474
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,651
I'm sorry I showed up without any notice

475
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,792
What are you thinking?

476
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,160
Are you crazy?

477
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,128
Song-yi

478
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,967
Let's start over

479
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,837
I broke up with her

480
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,008
Now, I know for sure

481
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,647
You're the only one I have

482
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,687
Are you seeing me as an easy option
after getting dumped

483
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,656
by your ex-girlfriend
who's way out of your league?

484
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,158
Song-yi

485
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,895
How could you say that?

486
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,564
You weren't like that before

487
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,032
Do you hear yourself?

488
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,469
Have you been watching
soap opera these days?

489
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,335
Get lost

490
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,037
Song-yi! Song-yi!

491
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,173
This...

492
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,076
This is our last chance

493
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,514
I must've been out of my mind

494
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,250
We...

495
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,986
We should start over

496
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,722
Let's get married as we were supposed to

497
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,779
and live happily in this house

498
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,062
We can turn everything back

499
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,564
I'll do my best

500
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,067
You turn back!

501
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,405
Song-yi

502
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,441
Song-yi, you should pull it harder

503
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,816
How did she open it?

504
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,653
Song-yi

505
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,590
Hana! Where are you going?

506
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm on my way to
meet the scooter seller

507
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,593
Oh, really?

508
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,162
I thought it was a scam

509
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,598
It wasn't a scam
I'm on my way to get the scooter

510
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,135
See? I was right

511
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,137
We're meeting here at 4 o'clock

512
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,539
Really?

513
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,341
Do you want to come?

514
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,009
Okay!

515
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:58,943
Let's go, let's go

516
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,014
(An hour later)

517
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,622
Are you serious?

518
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,459
How dare she makes me
wait for an hour

519
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,896
I told you several times, Hana
It's fraud

520
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,633
She just poked the bear

521
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,770
Hana, let's go find this person

522
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,472
Okay

523
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,941
I've had enough of it

524
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,610
How dare she tries to fool me

525
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,248
I'll show her she has messed
with the wrong person

526
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,283
I'm going to the police station

527
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,653
Can I come with you?

528
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,255
You? Why?

529
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,491
It sounds fun

530
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,926
Sure, let's go

531
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,262
I'll cut her off at the knees

532
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,398
I know her name and account number

533
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,334
I'm going to track her down
to the end of the world

534
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,503
to teach her a life lesson

535
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,972
Geez, seriously

536
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,241
- Let's go
- Let's go

537
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,709
- So cool
- Follow me

538
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,046
- She is so dead
- Let's go

539
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,620
It's a scammer, isn't it?

540
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,255
Is there anything I can do?

541
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,557
I came to get advice from a professional

542
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,229
So, you're saying you've been scammed?

543
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,666
Yes, we're going to go
to the police station

544
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,701
It's my first time going
to a police station

545
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,705
Scam...

546
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,915
Can I ask you a question?

547
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,616
Yes, what is it?

548
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,590
What kind of gift should I get
for a 60th birthday party?

549
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,193
Sorry?

550
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,401
Do I look too old in this?

551
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,336
Mom

552
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,406
Shouldn't you start accepting your age?

553
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,108
You're 60 years old

554
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:10,942
Oh, my

555
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,177
How could you say that?

556
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,380
Do you know what the other ladies
tell me at the sauna?

557
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,151
They ask how I've managed
to stay in shape

558
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,019
They're so curious

559
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,021
Are you happy about that?
You're an old lady

560
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,058
Says the man who dyed his hair

561
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,294
Just put on anything

562
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,166
I've never worn it since the day
I met your ex-husband's family

563
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,635
Mom, stop wearing that coat
It's bad luck

564
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,036
I'll lend you my coat

565
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,005
Or do you want to go shopping today?

566
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,040
Forget it

567
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,511
This coat is perfectly fine
Why would you stop me from wearing it?

568
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,915
At times like this,
I think it's better to live alone

569
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,255
Is he coming, too?
That lawyer, Mr. Cha

570
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,023
No

571
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,092
I thought you didn't mean it

572
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,995
Of course, we meant it
It's a family event

573
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,998
Let's see how he shows up today

574
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,318
I guess I came too early

575
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,094
It's my mother-in-law's
60th birthday

576
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:41,032
She's like a young girl, so I was wondering
if I could decorate the room myself

577
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,733
What name is the reservation under?

578
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,568
Ji Song-yi

579
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,002
Hold on

580
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,704
- I'm her husband
- I see

581
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,273
What? Husband?

582
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,743
Are you celebrating something?

583
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,145
Oh, this?

584
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,848
It's for my wife

585
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,418
I knew you were a kind person

586
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,987
Your wife must be very happy

587
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,760
Are they back together?

588
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,429
Ms. Ji Song-yi is not on the list

589
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,830
Then, can you check under Ji Eun-gyu?

590
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:13,798
Yes, it's here

591
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,632
I'm her brother-in-law

592
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,234
Okay, please follow me

593
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,535
Yes, thank you

594
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:38,854
Isn't this restaurant expensive?

595
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,593
I can get groceries and cook up a storm

596
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,861
Don't be ridiculous

597
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,030
We should celebrate the special occasion
at a fancy restaurant

598
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:50,034
I bet Dad always eats gamjatang,
so I wanted to take you somewhere fancy

599
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,337
Did you make a reservation?

600
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,338
Yes, it's under Ji Eun-gyu

601
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,673
Let me show you to the room

602
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,909
It's fancy

603
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,947
It'd be better if we came with
our sons-in-law and grandchildren

604
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,282
Grandma

605
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,884
You have Jay, your grandson

606
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,121
Oh, you're right

607
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,089
You're right
You're my grandson, Jay

608
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:13,824
You're so smart

609
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,692
Come with Grandma

610
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:18,262
My smart grandson, Jay

611
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,230
Okay

612
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,631
Wow, this place is amazing

613
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,966
You know me

614
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,836
(Happy 60th birthday, Mother)
Happy birthday to you

615
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,274
Happy birthday to you

616
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,945
Happy birthday, dear Mommy

617
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:39,784
Happy birthday to you

618
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,858
Happy birthday, Grandma

619
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:48,659
Mom, happy birthday

620
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,061
Happy birthday to you

621
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,029
Thank you

622
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:57,735
I hope you all stay healthy,
and I hope the best for you

623
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,104
Song-yi, I hope you find a good partner...

624
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,205
Mom, Mom

625
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,206
Here's your present

626
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,307
Oh, my

627
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,778
You didn't have to get me a present

628
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,280
What is it?

629
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,682
It's nothing special
I just wanted you to look pretty

630
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,419
Why did you get an expensive gift?

631
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,756
You should've just given me cash instead

632
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,057
It's not expensive

633
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,460
That's why I sent you cash, Mom

634
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,928
Check your bank account

635
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,503
Anyway, I really appreciate it

636
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,540
Song-yi, I hope you find a decent guy

637
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,510
And Eun-gyu, it's not too late

638
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,581
I hope you meet a good husband
I'd like to see both of you start a family

639
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,183
and live a happy life

640
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,521
- Oh dear
- Hello

641
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,825
It's been a while

642
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,761
Happy birthday

643
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,498
What are you doing here?

644
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,200
Well...

645
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,269
I told you yesterday

646
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,737
That's not my question

647
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,939
How dare you come here?

648
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,042
Song-yi, it's a special day
Don't just start yelling at me

649
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,844
Take a seat

650
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,045
Yes, sir

651
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,947
Dad

652
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,585
I hope you've been doing well

653
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,290
I just wanted to stop by and say hello

654
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,095
This is your favorite
Flowers

655
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,468
Well, it is pretty

656
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,574
This room is a bit different
from the other rooms, right?

657
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,077
I came early this morning
to ask the restaurant owner

658
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,213
that my mother-in-law is turning 60,
which is a beautiful age,

659
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,916
and that I want to decorate the room
in a way that will suit her

660
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,185
The owner was so impressed

661
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:58,022
They said, "Of course, you should
It's so hard to find a son-in-law like you"

662
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,928
So? Do you like it?

663
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,565
- Let's have a drink
- Okay

664
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:15,773
Song-yi

665
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,475
For Mom's sake

666
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,542
Allow me to pour you a glass

667
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,961
I'm...

668
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,866
I'm very sorry

669
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,937
I promised that we would live happily

670
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,074
and make Song-yi happy,

671
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,143
but I ended up showing the worst side of me

672
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,713
I...

673
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:01,385
I would like to start over with Song-yi

674
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,387
From the start

675
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,990
No, we're going back to where we started

676
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,391
Back to where you started?

677
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,928
Mr. and Mrs. Ji

678
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,632
Please forgive me

679
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,967
Stand up, stand up

680
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,371
Marriage is not a one-way street

681
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,173
Song-yi is my daughter,

682
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,711
but I don't think
she did everything perfectly

683
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,846
Dad

684
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,749
Whose side are you on?

685
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,786
But he's not all wrong

686
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:40,591
What he said isn't completely wrong

687
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,630
When two individuals
from different worlds come together,

688
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,766
of course, there will be things
that you can't agree on

689
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,704
You can't agree on everything, can you?

690
00:42:57,404 --> 00:42:58,976
So, going forward...

691
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,945
We should do everything all over again
Starting with the wedding

692
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,948
I'll find a nice venue

693
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,389
Well, okay

694
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,126
People make mistakes in life

695
00:43:17,372 --> 00:43:21,098
Song-yi, don't overthink it

696
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,667
Talk it out with Ju-han

697
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:26,937
He came all the way here for my birthday

698
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:30,074
Mom, how can you take his side?

699
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,277
You, of all people, can't do that to me

700
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:37,314
You don't even know why I got a divorce!

701
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:40,751
Can't you just respect my opinion for once?

702
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,150
It's all my fault

703
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,089
Of course, it's your fault!
Enough with that nonsense!

704
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:49,290
Why are you jumping down his throat?

705
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:52,029
He's here to make amends

706
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,697
I got divorced

707
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:55,766
because he cheat...

708
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:07,745
Oh, my

709
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,413
I'm sorry

710
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,215
I'm a bit late, right?

711
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,417
Wow, look who's here

712
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,352
It's our Mr. Cha

713
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:16,820
Hello

714
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,493
Who is he?

715
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,795
Oh, he is...

716
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,289
It must be tough

717
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,591
because the economy isn't doing well

718
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,393
No, I'm fine

719
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,029
We ran out of side dishes

720
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,064
Excuse me!

721
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,166
Can we get some more side dishes?

722
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,101
I called them

723
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,402
Here you go, ma'am

724
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,241
Well...

725
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:18,615
I'm not a picky person with high standards

726
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:24,088
It's nice if he's handsome

727
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,425
But our Song-yi's picky

728
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:33,630
I'm sure she's thought it through

729
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:37,868
I don't have double eyelids,
but my eyes are bigger than his

730
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:41,305
What's that?

731
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,144
Anyway,

732
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,815
I respect my daughters' opinions the most

733
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,318
I don't want anything else

734
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,257
I'm picky?

735
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,294
Aren't you the picky one?

736
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,930
Whenever I showed you my boyfriends,

737
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,601
you complained about this and that

738
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,570
So, I took your advice and married him,
and now I'm divorced

739
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,905
Who are you blaming?

740
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,807
Song-yi

741
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,643
Are you saying it's my fault?

742
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,578
Gosh

743
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,783
Fine

744
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,252
I'm always the villain, huh?

745
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:33,524
I'm just doing it for your own good

746
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,992
It's not out of ill intention, is it?

747
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,228
What is your definition of good?

748
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,333
You've never asked me what makes me happy

749
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,169
I bet it's never occurred to you

750
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,304
What about you?

751
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,875
Is your happiness so important
that you decide on your own

752
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,644
without listening to your mom and dad?

753
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:59,917
Then, the two of you should
continue to live alone

754
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,986
Why do you even need family?
We don't even talk

755
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,121
Fine, I'll talk

756
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,689
Yes, go ahead!

757
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,694
The thing is,

758
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,099
I broke up with him
because he had an affair

759
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,970
- What?
- What?

760
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,344
An affair?

761
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:31,949
I didn't tell you

762
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,586
I mean, I couldn't
It's embarrassing

763
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,423
I didn't want to make you
parents with a pathetic daughter

764
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,758
You don't have to know all the details

765
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:42,993
But what?

766
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,698
You want me to get back together?

767
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,266
Talk it out with him?

768
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:53,237
Can you still say that
you're doing it for my own good?

769
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,344
Ju-han, is that true?

770
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,412
Did you cheat on her?

771
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:04,115
No, I didn't

772
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,383
Song-yi is mistaken

773
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,261
Please hear me out

774
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:10,687
Mr. Yuk's affair was 100%
upheld by the court

775
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,858
I gave her advice on her divorce

776
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,227
She's managed to get through it,

777
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,763
but at the time...

778
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,333
It must've been tough for her

779
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:29,504
You...

780
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,941
You piece of trash!

781
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:31,775
Sir, sir!

782
00:48:31,777 --> 00:48:32,809
What? You cheated on her?

783
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,910
- Sir, calm down
- Even before the wedding?

784
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,214
- You jerk! You terrible jerk!
- No, please relax!

785
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,715
- How could you?
- No, no

786
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:40,448
- I had no idea!
- That's not true

787
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,584
- It's all a misunderstanding
- But I was hard on Song-yi!

788
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,820
- It's a misunderstanding
- How could you do that?

789
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,623
- Hey, you!
- Wait, wait! Dad!

790
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,556
Hey, you stop right there

791
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,294
Stop! Just wait until I catch you!

792
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,628
- Stop it!
- Hey! Stop right there!

793
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:52,829
- Sir, that's not true
- Don't you dare try to run away

794
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,698
Song-yi, say something!

795
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,000
- You! You jerk!
- Mr. Ji! You have it all wrong

796
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,793
What Song-yi said isn't wrong

797
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,628
Is it your turn now?

798
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,595
Fine

799
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,398
I might as well just be honest with you

800
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:29,900
I

801
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,705
returned to Korea for good

802
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,407
I've been staying at Song-yi's place

803
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:39,276
What?

804
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,610
What are you saying?

805
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,745
What about your work?

806
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,581
There's also this guy
I dated back in the States

807
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,616
Why haven't you told me anything?

808
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,186
I saw how you treated Song-yi

809
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,488
That's why I couldn't tell you

810
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,993
You always tried to fit us into
your standards

811
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,000
Do you agree with her?

812
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,436
You think I do that?

813
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,844
I got carried away earlier,

814
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,514
but to be honest,

815
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,284
you are kind of bossy

816
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,732
I've worked so hard to raise you

817
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,943
You know what?

818
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,080
I did have high expectations for you

819
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,817
What's wrong with that?

820
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:57,921
Is it wrong for a mom to have expectations

821
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,190
on her children?

822
00:51:04,453 --> 00:51:07,423
To me...

823
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:11,007
I'm so proud of you two

824
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,004
You're both beautiful

825
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,741
You girls are just amazing

826
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,853
To me, you two

827
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,557
are the best

828
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:36,262
Compared to anyone in this world

829
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,233
No matter what kind of guy you dated,

830
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:47,531
I went all picky because you, Song-yi,
deserved better than any of those guys

831
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,141
And no guy was good enough for

832
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,778
my youngest daughter

833
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,146
So, I didn't like any of them

834
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:57,747
What's wrong with that?

835
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:01,411
Why can't I have high standards?

836
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,520
Am I not allowed to do that?

837
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,322
Mom

838
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,029
I didn't know you felt that way

839
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,199
I'm sorry

840
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,469
I'm sorry, Mom

841
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,505
Why didn't you tell us?

842
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,111
I'm sorry...

843
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,993
Jay, should we go back inside?

844
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,438
Jay

845
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,874
Oh, Jay, you're here

846
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,242
Mom, why are you crying?

847
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,978
- I'm not crying
- I'm not

848
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,280
We're not crying

849
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,581
Love you, Jay

850
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,383
- I love you all
- I love you

851
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,451
I love you

852
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,819
Jay

853
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,823
Don't skip your meals

854
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,825
Mr. Cha, see you next time

855
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:16,793
Oh, okay

856
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,594
See you!

857
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,528
Bye

858
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:23,333
Mrs. Ji!

859
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,269
- Huh?
- I got you flowers

860
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:27,237
Oh, my!

861
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,005
- Thank you
- Here you go

862
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,208
Let me shut the door for you

863
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,108
Thank you

864
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,216
Call me when you run out of side dishes

865
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,117
Okay, you should go now

866
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,888
Jay, let's meet again soon

867
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,291
Bye, Grandma, Grandpa

868
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:52,729
Bye

869
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,464
- Bye
- Get home safely

870
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:58,935
Song-yi

871
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,305
I'm going to hang out with Jay
You should go home first

872
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,775
You're going in the same direction
You don't mind her joining you, right?

873
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:21,791
Mommy

874
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,428
I was so, so happy

875
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,064
because I got to eat out with
Grandma and Grandpa

876
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,299
Me too

877
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:49,986
I'm sorry

878
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,356
for making you go through all that

879
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,427
I feel like I'm always apologizing

880
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:00,830
It's all right

881
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:06,036
It was fun
It felt like I was watching a movie

882
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,271
A movie?

883
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:09,372
Yes

884
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:14,110
From action to tear-jerking family drama

885
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,683
A lot of things have happened, for sure

886
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,555
I'm sure there were reasons why
you couldn't tell

887
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,025
But you're family

888
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:33,330
Maybe you should sit down
for an honest conversation

889
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,699
I should

890
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,867
Wait

891
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,103
But seriously,

892
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,839
I hope Yuk Ju-han won't come again

893
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:43,707
No

894
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,575
He probably won't

895
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,778
I threatened him that
I'd file a restraining order

896
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,349
But if he shows up again,

897
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,584
then...

898
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,754
I'll switch houses with you or something

899
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,799
I guess I have bad taste in men

900
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,606
I disagree

901
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:21,044
It's the men who don't know
how to appreciate you

902
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:37,127
What do you mean by that?

903
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,433
It doesn't...

904
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:45,702
mean much

905
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,176
Oh, right

906
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,179
Didn't we agree to speak casually?

907
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,582
Did we agree to do that?

908
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,484
You seriously can't remember?

909
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,620
When we drank last time...

910
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,388
I really can't remember...

911
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:06,589
Oh, watch out!

912
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,763
Watch where you're going!

913
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,666
You can't drive that fast around people!

914
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,370
And you're not even wearing a helmet

915
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,939
Mind your manners!

916
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,175
That's a 20,000 won fine for you!

917
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,316
Mr. Cha is so cool

918
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,886
He must've scored some points
from your parents

919
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,658
I knew it from the moment
I saw him in your T-shirt

920
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,660
It looked good on him

921
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,563
I think you two are a good match
for each other

922
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,836
Maybe you're starting to get lucky
with men in Cheonpo

923
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,571
No way

924
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,207
Just because he helped me with that
doesn't mean there's something between us

925
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,243
As Hana said, he could've
just helped me out as a lawyer

926
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,146
Yes, that's what I'm saying

927
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,448
You shouldn't mistake

928
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,418
professional help for romantic interest

929
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:15,358
Haven't you caught that scammer yet?

930
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,427
Don't even start, Song-yi

931
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:20,396
She's so dead when Hana finds her

932
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,664
She's dead meat

933
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,540
Hello? This is Choi Hana speaking

934
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:32,682
Sorry?

935
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,844
The police station?

936
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,180
What? What did they say?

937
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:38,448
They caught the scammer

938
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,340
Really?

939
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,205
That close?

940
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,521
She lives in our neighborhood

941
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,089
Wow

942
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,421
- Oh my gosh
- That's so cool

943
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,358
Okay

944
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,528
Hold on

945
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:54,330
They want me to choose if I want to
get the money back

946
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:56,434
or go get the scooter

947
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:57,413
What do you want to do?

948
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,137
If you give me the address,

949
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,973
I'll go get the item and end the case

950
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,609
Okay, thank you for your hard work

951
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,844
Okay

952
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,580
Are you going to end it
after getting the scooter?

953
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,081
Are you crazy?

954
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:15,783
I should get my scooter and
get a good look at that scammer's face

955
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:16,719
Hana, Hana

956
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,321
Can I tag along?

957
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:20,537
Me too, me too!
I want to go, too

958
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:22,959
Fine

959
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:26,255
Let's show her how scary it can be
when three women team up

960
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:27,997
Let's go

961
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,132
- Go!
- Let's go

962
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:30,433
- Go
- Let's go

963
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,169
We finally caught her

964
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,806
Just watch how I handle this, okay?

965
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,885
Seriously
How could she scam me?

966
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,087
Why isn't she opening the door?

967
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:53,923
Excuse me!

968
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,125
I'm sorry

969
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,395
Would you like to come in first?

970
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,794
The baby is finally asleep

971
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,030
I'm sorry

972
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,733
I received a call from the police

973
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,036
But I really didn't mean
to do it on purpose

974
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,007
I kept thinking that I should reply,

975
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,409
but then I fell asleep

976
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:52,081
In the evening,
I was too busy looking after the kids

977
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,518
It wasn't easy for me to text you

978
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:03,793
(There's also "Mom Time" where
moms can chat on the second-hand platform)

979
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,397
(It's when the kids take a nap)

980
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,001
(They can only send messages
during that time)

981
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:16,673
(She was too tired that she dozed off
and missed the timing)

982
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,108
(That's why she couldn't reply to the text)

983
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,479
You should've just said so

984
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,447
(Hana, who was determined
to catch the scammer,)

985
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,615
(cleaned the house of
a family with three kids)

986
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,919
(even though she's heavily pregnant)

987
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,426
You didn't have to do this

988
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,928
It's all right, we have this covered

989
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:12,795
It's fine

990
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:14,997
Thank you

991
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,377
- Did you buy a lot?
- Yes

992
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:29,846
(And)

993
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,715
(She even got groceries for them)

994
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,593
(And she kept blaming her hormones)

995
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,564
(She said that we'd understand her
once we got pregnant)

996
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,716
Wow, it feels so refreshing

997
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,651
I slept so well

998
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,454
That's weird

999
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,456
Why did I sleep so well?

1000
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,725
I feel too good

1001
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,234
Jay! Wake up!

1002
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,170
Jay! You need to go to kindergarten!

1003
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,005
Eun-gyu!

1004
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,811
Eun-gyu! Did you go to work already?

1005
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:38,815
Jay

1006
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,660
[Sorry Not Sorry]

1007
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:21,989
What's going on?
Why does the cafe look so empty?

1008
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,293
So, they created a new group chat

1009
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,596
It means they have a new target

1010
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:27,730
What does that mean?

1011
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,500
I'm sorry
I think it's because of me

1012
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,269
I'm disappointed

1013
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:37,006
I thought you would help Song-yi

1014
01:04:37,008 --> 01:04:38,005
How was I supposed to do that?

1015
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,643
Are you here to see Song-yi?

1016
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,811
I bet you don't know

1017
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,413
That your eyes are blazing

1018
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,715
Do you have feelings for Song-yi?
