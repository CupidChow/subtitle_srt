(Filming with child actors took place under the supervision of guardians and in a safe environment)

4
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,875
I want to...

5
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,684
kill him

6
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:53,574
He ruined my life
What could possibly stop me?

7
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,383
Well, there are many options

8
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,222
I want it to be as painful as possible

9
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,759
But you seem to be mistaken

10
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,361
Pardon?

11
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,563
Are you aware of what we do here?

12
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,540
You're an errand service center, right?

13
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,127
Well...

14
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,204
We're a start-up that just started
our business

15
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,989
(Errand Service Center)
(Based on trust and faith)

16
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:25,851
We named ourselves "Errand Service"
to be witty

17
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,904
but we're in charge of

18
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,023
arranging housekeepers,

19
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,868
cleaning, and childcare services

20
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:38,560
Wait, then by "errand," you mean...

21
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,681
But listening to your story...

22
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,745
Wow, that wretched bastard

23
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:48,355
I fully understand why you want to kill him

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,536
But then...

25
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,211
That request will cost
several Crores of won

26
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,466
Several Crore?

27
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:59,037
I'm flat broke after my divorce

28
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:02,573
With the loans I've taken out because
of him and our house, I'm already...

29
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:09,056
So, let's live in goodwill

30
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,176
If that's the case

31
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:21,071
we're looking for housekeepers
and cleaning staff

32
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,217
How much is the hourly wage?

33
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:36,483
[Sorry Not Sorry]

34
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,130
(Are you back on the market? Who cares?)
(I'm getting remarried!)

35
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,980
(Yes, let's admit it)

36
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:03,080
(I'm a divorcée)

37
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:08,378
(An ambiguous divorcée, that is
I'm legally single but not socially)

38
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:12,956
(My life has always been like this)

39
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,246
(I can't believe it)

40
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,807
(It's not your fault)

41
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,844
(Be confident)

42
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,978
(That's not even a flaw these days)

43
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,683
(I know)

44
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:35,266
(But honestly, they can only say such things
because it's none of their business)

45
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,309
(Where did it all go wrong?)

46
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,883
(Marriage is reality)

47
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:43,902
(But I was too innocent)

48
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,176
(And only thought of love...)

49
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:44,089
(This was once my newlywed house)

50
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,616
(I currently live here alone)

51
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,617
You startled me!

52
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,095
What the...

53
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:03,714
What's going on?

54
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,703
You startled me!

55
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,999
Why is it so hard to reach you?

56
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,184
Huh?

57
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,320
(Ji Eun-gyu: Are you coming home
late today?)

58
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:17,320
Hey, this is a question you'd ask a
family member who lives with you

59
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:20,316
You can't send me this message when we're
seeing each other in three or four years!

60
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,949
I was in a bit of a hurry

61
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:25,693
Wait, but why are you here in Korea
instead of America right now?

62
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,453
What about work?

63
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,289
And what's all this luggage?

64
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,791
I'll explain inside

65
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,660
Let's go home, Jay

66
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,997
(This is my younger sister Eun-gyu)

67
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,299
(She's a single mother)

68
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,292
(We're not both divorcées)

69
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,531
(Because Eun-gyu was never married)

70
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,924
(5 years ago)

71
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,592
That's how it turned out
It's a son

72
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,419
I named him Jay

73
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,729
Sperm...

74
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:56,354
Wait, do you want to hear about
the dad's profile?

75
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,262
- Why, you! Hey!
- The one I chose from the cryobank...

76
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,517
Hey, you crazy girl!

77
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:01,966
What? Son?

78
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,411
Return to Korea immediately!

79
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,186
- Calm down! Calm down, dad
- Did you know about it?

80
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,443
Mom, I had no idea!

81
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,045
No, I'll go there, Song-yi!

82
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,743
Ji Eun-gyu, stay right there!
I'm coming!

83
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:12,714
Hey, you crazy girl!

84
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,559
Honey!

85
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:17,010
(Unlike me, who is ambiguous, my sister
is a wacko, without a doubt)

86
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,688
(And she made me a nephew via a cryobank)

87
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:26,625
Hi

88
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,014
You should say hello to your aunt

89
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,074
Please let us stay with you for a while

90
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,706
Shoes over here

91
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:09,987
This is nice

92
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:10,924
It's a lovely house

93
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,028
The two of you can use the main room
It's over there

94
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:17,266
All right, then

95
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,923
Thank you

96
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,741
Mommy!

97
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,041
You must be nuts

98
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:46,011
Why do you still have this?

99
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,428
Do you regret it?
Why aren't you discarding this?

100
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:53,044
You've yet to learn about
the recycling culture in Korea

101
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,152
Just imagine placing that box in a plaza

102
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,104
where all of your neighbors walk past

103
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,676
People even glimpse at fliers piled up
at a supermarket

104
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:05,612
And this is clearly a wedding invitation
with a fancy ribbon

105
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,546
and it even has mom and dad's names
and my name on it!

106
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,443
At least, like...

107
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,677
Give the envelopes out for free

108
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:12,727
I mean...

109
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,046
That frame?

110
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,841
Large-size waste needs to be placed
outside with a sticker on it

111
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,800
That means it has to sit outside
for a few days

112
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,794
That's pretty much like announcing
to the neighborhood that I'm divorced

113
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,751
Who cares?

114
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:30,728
What?

115
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,860
Right, I get it
Let's get him to bed first

116
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,079
Come on
Time for bed, Jay

117
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,378
Okay

118
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,215
Well done

119
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:54,391
Is Jay sleeping?

120
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,412
Yes

121
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,448
Wait, so what happened to you?

122
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:01,537
There was a bit of an accident

123
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,678
I won't be here for too long
I'll also pay for the living expenses

124
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,224
But it's a secret from mom and dad for now

125
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,864
You crazy, crazy girl

126
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,593
What have you done again?

127
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,715
Mom will go ballistic if she finds out

128
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,462
And I'm working from tomorrow

129
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,187
Huh?

130
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,779
Shush!

131
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,772
You'll wake Jay up

132
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,420
Have you returned to Korea for good?

133
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:27,918
Who knows?

134
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,482
Anyway, I've got everything sorted

135
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,007
so can you just take Jay
to kindergarten tomorrow?

136
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:38,135
You're driving me nuts

137
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,999
This is so frustrating

138
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,970
Until when?

139
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,773
New York?

140
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:29,583
Yes

141
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,947
As in the actual "New York"?
Not the bakery?

142
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,234
Yes, that's what I heard

143
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,228
You know it yourself

144
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:40,421
It isn't easy to join Noble Kindergarten
between semesters

145
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:45,296
But then, he's from New York,
so he's totally... How should I put it?

146
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,650
Yeah, he's an original

147
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,492
An American-born who was raised in America

148
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,347
That's why the principal accepted him

149
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,031
- Oh my goodness
- Huh?

150
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,242
"Native"

151
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,911
Your kid attends an English kindergarten,
so you should know some English, too

152
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,033
Is it not "Original?"

153
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,805
Negative, negative

154
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,207
The bus is here

155
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:12,204
Good morning
How are you?

156
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,361
Have a good day

157
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,807
All right, let's get on the bus

158
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,750
- Bye
- Bye

159
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,940
I love you, Shannon
Have a good day

160
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:22,951
Shannon!

161
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,691
I love you

162
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,153
Mom will be cheering for you

163
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:29,862
See you later

164
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:30,804
Yes, goodbye

165
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,135
Shannon!

to children like this)

00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:54,919
Choi Hana was once my one-and-only
best friend

328
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,375
- You crazy wench
- Choi Hana!

329
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,348
(An ex-best friend whom I cut ties with,
to be exact)

330
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,479
(I can't believe I came across her here)

331
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:07,134
Excuse me

332
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:08,821
What's the matter?

333
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:10,511
I said I'd go outside

334
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:11,913
Oh?

335
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:15,347
Oh my!

336
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,818
Are you okay?

337
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:30,733
What's wrong with her?

338
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,053
Seriously, what's wrong with her?

339
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:54,894
I didn't know Choi Hana got married

340
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,447
She met a competent man just like herself
and was living here

341
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,416
(Warning! Do not park your baby's car
in the common area)

342
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:41,925
- You're here
- Yes

343
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,303
You!

344
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:45,511
What happened? Did you work out?

345
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:49,042
I came back from my part-time job

346
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,313
Part-time job?

347
00:25:50,703 --> 00:25:51,784
What part-time job?

348
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,148
Uh... Well...

349
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,890
Because of my loan interest...

350
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,017
Oh my...

351
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:03,151
Wait, what's wrong with your arm?

352
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:05,256
I'm okay

353
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:07,322
No, what's the matter? Let me see it

354
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:09,782
- It's okay, it's nothing
- You're driving me crazy

355
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,853
Where did you get injured?

356
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:17,680
Jay

357
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,241
Are you comforting me?

358
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,397
Thank you

359
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:26,718
How did you get injured? Huh?

360
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:29,639
You're old enough to know better!

361
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:31,776
Get inside
Let's go inside and get ointment on that

362
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,038
It hurts

363
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:34,158
Go inside

364
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:38,711
You'll get injured if you're clumsy
Do you understand, Jay?

365
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:44,220
Ugh, you idiot, moron, fool

366
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,320
Are you nuts?

367
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:49,404
I know

368
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:52,208
What's the point of receiving this house
as alimony?

369
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,037
With all that mortgage loan...

370
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,708
Didn't you do the calculations?

371
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,187
Even from a mathematical approach...

372
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:01,193
I know!

373
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:04,780
But once this house is sold,
I'll repay the loan

374
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:06,368
move out, and then...

375
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:13,414
Hey, go and sleep

376
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:15,397
Seoul is pretty far, isn't it?

377
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,950
You should live in Seoul
if you're that competent...

378
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,059
That's enough

379
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,451
So, how much did you earn today?

380
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,557
Forget it! I'll deal with it

381
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:30,486
Song-yi

382
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:37,251
Living expenses plus half of the
monthly loan interest

383
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,368
I'll pay you that

384
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:44,887
Huh?

385
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,698
What do you say? Are you in?

386
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,072
No

387
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,401
It's too big a sum

388
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,132
Who said I'll give it to you for free?

389
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:02,040
In return, reduce your part-time job
and look after Jay

390
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,347
Just say the word, boss

391
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,978
Shall I organize the bedding for you?

392
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:23,330
You need to go to work tomorrow

393
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:01,869
Hey, get ready for work

394
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,253
Okay

395
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:37,865
(Like so, I started living like
a Cheonpo Mom)

396
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,193
(That I had never lived before,
thanks to Eun-gyu and Jay)

397
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,061
Jay, tidy up your toys

398
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:53,036
Jay, let's eat

399
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,200
Okay

400
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:04,107
(Although, it was never peaceful)

401
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:07,816
Oh my!

402
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,609
What the

403
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:12,972
Does this even make sense?

404
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,244
Darn it, it was like this last time as well
Which house is doing this?

405
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,015
Jay, that's dirty!
It's toilet water, it's dirty

406
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,900
Hey, prevent Jay from going inside

407
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:22,293
I'll call the management office

408
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,737
This is driving me nuts! Song-yi!

409
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:27,592
Our toilet is foaming, and it's going wild

410
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:29,047
- We need to wash up
- Do you know how much this is...

411
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:30,575
- We can't do anything or go to work
- Get out! Song-yi!

412
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,102
Because the toilet is foaming

413
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,924
- The toilet is a downright mess
- This is crazy, Song-yi!

414
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,442
- We can't tidy this up ourselves, sir
- No, no

415
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,242
Look at this

416
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:42,113
Can you please check which house
is responsible for this?

417
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,358
(NOBLE KIDS)

418
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,443
(I'm here at last)

419
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:56,903
(The most flustering moment these days)

420
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:57,963
(is when I must meet new people)

421
00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:58,665
Excuse me...

422
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,197
(And introduce myself)

423
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,055
(I have no plans to get to know
that person)

424
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,063
(and I don't even know if I'll
see them frequently or not)

425
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,452
Hello

426
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:12,337
I'm Jay's aunt
I'm just here to pick him up

427
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,238
I see!

428
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:16,717
(End of conversation)
(This would be perfect)

429
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,708
(But unlike myself, conversations
with mothers must go as follows)

430
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:21,858
You must be Jay's aunt!

431
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,080
You're so sweet

432
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:23,961
Which class is he in?

433
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,018
Oh, really?

434
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:29,237
But then, are you married?

435
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:31,662
(Just because I can't be bothered)

436
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:32,975
(Q. Are you married?)

437
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,648
Yes!

438
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:37,177
- (If I answer so)
- Then, you must be similar to us

439
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:39,885
- (I'm likely to see her frequently)
- We should get along

440
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,256
(Then, from my husband to childcare, etc.)

441
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:44,919
(I don't want to go that far lying)

442
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,765
(Q. Are you married?)

443
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,991
No

444
00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:50,212
(But this, too, is a lie)

445
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:52,913
I was married

446
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:54,047
(Divorce)
but I got divorced

447
00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:58,753
(But to say this)

448
00:31:58,758 --> 00:31:59,972
(Do I have to?)

449
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,742
(How would I deal with this?)

450
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:02,939
It's okay

451
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:04,335
(Was it too much information?)

452
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:06,338
(I need to consider Jay's position)

453
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:08,123
Excuse me...

454
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:11,567
You're the newcomer, Jay's mother, right?

455
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:12,350
Hello

456
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,140
Hello, Seung-hee's mother

457
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:18,387
(Yeah, let's not over think it
and be honest)

458
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,757
Actually, I'm...

459
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:24,896
Song-yi?

460
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,253
You're Song-yi, right?

461
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,283
Oh my!

462
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,628
It's me, Hana, Choi Hana!

463
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:35,984
Yeah...

464
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,173
Does your child also attend here?

465
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,182
(Okay, let's say it with confidence!)

466
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:47,740
(No! I'm here to pick up my nephew,
and I'm...)

467
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:50,230
(Am I a divorcée or single?)

468
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:53,541
Mommy!

469
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:01,065
You must be Song-yi's son

470
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,985
You're so good-looking

471
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,722
- How fascinating!
- Wait, that's...

472
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:07,253
Mommy!

473
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,619
Sia, Teo!

474
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,975
Goodness me, how beautiful

475
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,654
Goodness me

476
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,681
Wait, were they in the same class?

477
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:19,284
What a coincidence!

478
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,734
Goodness me
Did you have fun today?

479
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:23,487
Are you happy mommy is here?

480
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,875
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

481
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:28,767
Are the two of you acquainted
with each other?

482
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,525
Sia's mom and Jay's mom?

483
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,253
Yes, we're from the same
middle and high schools

484
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:37,535
Alums!

485
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,914
What? Alums?

486
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,449
Oh my! I see!

487
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,792
What's the point of being an alumnus?

488
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:45,490
Not all alums are close

489
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:50,317
We were super close

490
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,700
We were best friends

491
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,286
Right, Jay's mom?

492
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,905
(Me...)

493
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:58,237
(Jay's mom?)

494
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:14,660
(Confident? As if)

495
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:18,902
(Living in the leading apartment with
children in an expensive kindergarten)

496
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,951
(And she even has three children)

497
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,956
(She must be so happy)

498
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,576
(And to spill my current situation
before her...)

499
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,432
(I couldn't possibly say it)

500
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,148
(If I come across her)

501
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:34,580
(I wanted to show her I was doing well)

502
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:37,804
(Just like running into an ex-boyfriend)

503
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,662
(Dressed up nicely)

504
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:44,579
(And holding hands with a fine man)

505
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:55,834
(Choi Hana)

506
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,364
"Best friends?" That rolled off her tongue
when we'd ghosted each other for ten years

507
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:03,903
Choi Hana, you just amaze me

508
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:07,919
But then, what should I do?

509
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:09,528
What if everyone thinks I'm a mother?

510
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:14,660
What's the matter?

511
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,125
Jay, let's go home now

512
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,087
No

513
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,620
Let's go
Let's go home!

514
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:30,985
No! I want to go

515
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:34,357
Okay

516
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:36,720
But we're going after two rounds, okay?

517
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:51,533
Jay

518
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,255
But why did you say such a thing earlier?

519
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:55,888
What do you mean?

520
00:35:57,107 --> 00:36:00,125
Why did you call me "Mommy" earlier?

521
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:02,627
I don't know

522
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,932
Do you think I'll cut you slack
if you're that adorable?

523
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:10,742
Your lie put me in a sticky situation

524
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:16,127
You shouldn't lie

525
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,037
Why?

526
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:24,582
Because it might hurt others later

527
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:29,105
Did it hurt?

528
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,329
Excuse me...

529
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,528
I'm sorry but by any chance...

530
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,581
Aren't I right?

531
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,485
What do you mean?

532
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,665
Kindergarten!

533
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,704
Noble Kids!

534
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:50,045
- Yes
- Oh my goodness! Oh my!

535
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:54,669
I also wanted to send my child there

536
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:56,093
but couldn't make it

537
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:59,651
Seung-jun, look
Isn't he cool?

538
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:02,517
Hi, I'm Jay

539
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:06,357
Oh my! Why is he so fluent?

540
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,981
Hey, Jay
How old are you?

541
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,627
I'm older!

542
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:18,279
My goodness
Does he get private lessons?

543
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:20,530
Why is he so good at English?

544
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:24,057
I heard kids take after their mothers

545
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:25,343
so you must be intelligent

546
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:30,943
That's not it
He doesn't take classes...

547
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:34,285
Jay grew up in New York

548
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,661
New York?

549
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:39,586
As in, "New York, dduru dduru..."

550
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,065
That New York?

551
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:43,444
Oh my goodness! That's incredible!

552
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:45,649
That's insane! Oh my!

553
00:37:45,904 --> 00:37:47,121
That's...

554
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,339
I startled you, didn't I?

555
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:51,418
I only just moved here

556
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:53,901
so I needed someone to talk to
Goodness me

557
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,110
Wait, how old are you?

558
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,682
9...

559
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:02,080
Oh, my!

560
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:05,721
I was born in the 80s!

561
00:38:05,726 --> 00:38:08,947
Oh my goodness!
That's seriously amazing!

562
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:15,326
Jay must be good-looking
because he takes after your looks

563
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:17,228
She isn't my...

564
00:38:18,322 --> 00:38:21,445
We have something to do, so we'll get going

565
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,369
Jay's mom, wait...
Let's exchange numbers while we're at it

566
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:26,790
Tell me your number

567
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:28,207
- I'll see you next time
- Wait, your number...

568
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,008
I was almost there

569
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,929
It's so hard to make friends

570
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:46,720
What?

571
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,734
Why did you lie?

572
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:52,124
When did I? That's not true

573
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:56,181
I didn't lie
I just didn't clarify myself

574
00:38:58,158 --> 00:39:00,330
(I should know better
what to teach a child)

575
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,026
No

576
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,637
Don't remember what I said just now
Forget it all

577
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,777
You said it'll hurt others

578
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,903
No, she smiled

579
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,128
No

580
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,225
You shouldn't lie

581
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:18,858
Okay, I won't

582
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:20,720
Promise

583
00:39:22,283 --> 00:39:25,494
Let's never lie again, promise

584
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:26,681
Okay

585
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:34,379
Jay, what do you want for dinner tonight?

586
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,992
Fried chicken?

587
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,242
Then, I'll treat you to fried chicken today

588
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:40,749
Okay

589
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:43,892
Sia

590
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:47,703
Do you remember saying you wanted
to marry daddy as a baby?

591
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,832
No

592
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:49,684
Huh?

593
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,684
Are you not going to marry daddy?

594
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,278
Oh, I don't know!

595
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:57,941
Bae Sia

596
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:01,779
Bae Sia

597
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:06,074
Sia, what about daddy?

598
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:12,608
Honey

599
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,709
I went to pick up the kids
and ran into an old friend today

600
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:20,427
She'll grow up and bring her boyfriend
at this rate, right?

601
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:22,392
We used to be really close

602
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:24,406
I think it's been around ten years

603
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,301
- Are you listening to me?
- Huh?

604
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,105
Did you have a friend here?

605
00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:36,834
You always said you hated
the other mothers...

606
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:43,298
I mean, last time, Ethan's mom pitied you
for being a working mother

607
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:44,709
and whatever, so I...

608
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,852
She's such a joke!

609
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:52,280
There's a friend whom I was
really close to since middle school

610
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:56,500
but we suddenly drifted apart
Do you remember?

611
00:40:58,875 --> 00:40:59,762
Yeah

612
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:02,919
I remember hearing about her

613
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:05,042
But then, it's a little iffy

614
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:09,733
I swear it's unlikely

615
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,535
Why? What is it?

616
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,971
The other mothers are frantically trying
to befriend her

617
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:17,891
I mean, her child is fluent in English

618
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:21,103
Apparently, they lived in New York
or something...

619
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:23,893
Why did she come to Cheonpo
instead of Seoul?

620
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:25,717
But then...

621
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:29,303
Song-yi is terrible at English!

622
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:31,887
She must've found herself a great husband

623
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,258
just like you

624
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:34,305
A husband!

625
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,241
What is going on?

626
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,663
She met a great husband...

627
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:43,678
But would I look too shallow if I suddenly
start contacting her?

628
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:47,684
Hey...

629
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:48,925
Ji Song-yi...

630
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,014
Do you not hear me?

631
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:54,158
Sia

632
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,000
Seriously, I'm so lonely

633
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,236
What kind of game is this?

634
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:19,354
This is...

635
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:23,081
"Close your eyes and stay still" game

636
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:28,675
Liar! This isn't a game!

637
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,047
Wait, just a little bit...
Try staying in bed for a bit more

638
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,761
Okay, let's sleep...

639
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:39,745
This is boring!

640
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,153
I'm so bored!

641
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:55,308
(Song-yi, do you still use
the same number?)

642
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,762
(It's been ages)

643
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:04,994
(It's good to see you again, it was so
hectic earlier, so I couldn't say hello...)

644
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:14,647
Okay

645
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:16,622
What do you want to play?

646
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:22,500
But who is that man?

647
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:23,853
What's wrong with him?

648
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,499
(Everyone said)

649
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,671
(It was a good marriage)

650
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:38,576
(Song-yi's Wedding D-58)

651
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,297
Congratulations, Song-yi

652
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,871
Wow, you look so beautiful

653
00:43:48,444 --> 00:43:50,012
Song-yi is getting married to a nice guy

654
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:53,944
We'd never find a man like this

655
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:55,987
Why? What's wrong with us?

656
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:58,798
Exactly, what's wrong with me?

657
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:05,394
I mean, it's not like you're a competent
woman with professional expertise

658
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,314
working for a conglomerate

659
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:09,978
You're working for chicken feed anyway

660
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:13,777
and you've found someone to rely on

661
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:16,014
Look at her
She's resigning

662
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,783
Excuse me

663
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,291
I'm sorry, but I'm offended

664
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:22,846
I'm going to work again once I move

665
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,801
I'm resigning because our house is in
Cheonpo because of my husband's work

666
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:28,277
Of course, you should be the one to move

667
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:31,134
Because your conglomerate-working husband
will make 100 times more than you

668
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,289
Wait, but then...

669
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,791
Your husband is so handsome

670
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:37,877
Look

671
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:41,288
Yeah, Song-yi is getting married
to a nice guy

672
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:44,443
And they even bought their newlywed house

673
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,815
- Not on rent?
- Not on rent! Yes!

674
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,578
I heard you're already living with him

675
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:51,097
They're all loans

676
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,757
My boyfriend has moved in already,
and I'll move in after the wedding

677
00:44:55,852 --> 00:44:59,822
What gave you the certainty
to get married, Song-yi?

678
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:04,255
I felt I'd be happy living
a trivial everyday life

679
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,015
if I were with him

680
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:14,960
You'd look gorgeous in your wedding dress

681
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:18,268
(Although I was never better
than anyone in my life)

682
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:22,799
(I believed I'd be happy like everyone else
if we were together)

683
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,596
Do you want to receive it?
Okay, okay!

684
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:26,466
I should receive it

685
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:46,357
I miss you

686
00:45:46,362 --> 00:45:48,080
How's the wedding invitation
gathering going?

687
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:49,299
I'm getting off work soon

688
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:52,401
It must be tough since he's been
working overtime lately

689
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:55,633
He'd be surprised to see me here

690
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,904
Why is he living like this?

691
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:04,078
Goodness me

692
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,948
Song-yi!

693
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:48,461
Well, that's...

694
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:50,437
Song, Song-yi

695
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:52,610
Yeah, so we're...
Song-yi, I can explain

696
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:53,953
This, this is...

697
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:58,269
You crazy bastard!
I can tell even if you don't explain

698
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,218
She's your ex-girlfriend!

699
00:47:02,223 --> 00:47:03,384
That's true, but...

700
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:05,768
You crazy bastard!

701
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:07,629
- Wait, that's not it!
- How can you do this to me?

702
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:08,540
Hey!

703
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,685
- Hey!
- I swear that's not it

704
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,341
No, no

705
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:13,999
What do you think you're doing?

706
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:15,280
Song-yi, that's not it

707
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:16,441
I... I swear that's not it

708
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,100
How dare you!

709
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:20,138
Hey, that's not it

710
00:47:30,454 --> 00:47:33,725
I mean, tell me what's going on

711
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,078
Why are you suddenly getting a divorce?

712
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,484
Do you think marriage is a joke?

713
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,684
You said you'd get married,
and now you want a divorce!

714
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:41,958
I mean...

715
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:45,669
I wasn't trying to get married as a joke

716
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:48,304
Hey, Song-yi

717
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,330
That's how it is

718
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,335
Everyone lives like that

719
00:47:54,016 --> 00:47:55,451
You had an argument, didn't you?

720
00:47:57,006 --> 00:48:01,427
But if he isn't a bastard
who cheated on you, live with him

721
00:48:03,455 --> 00:48:06,271
(But mom, he cheated on me)

722
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:07,967
(And I witnessed it)

723
00:48:09,422 --> 00:48:13,013
(Strangely enough, I couldn't
spill the beans)

724
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:17,420
(I'd choose to look crazy to mom and dad)

725
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:19,163
(Than look pitiful)

726
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:21,708
No, we didn't argue

727
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:27,423
I just wanted to start over
before it's too late

728
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,806
Then, you should've decided

729
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:33,685
before I handed out the wedding invitations
to my friends!

730
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,546
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?
You must've lost it!

731
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:39,511
You even registered your marriage
to get a mortgage loan!

732
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,677
If you call off the wedding now,
that's a divorce!

733
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:44,845
Wake up!

734
00:48:45,653 --> 00:48:49,011
No! I looked into it

735
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:53,414
We've yet to get married
and haven't even lived with each other

736
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:57,821
We just registered our marriage
to get a house, so it can be annulled!

737
00:48:57,826 --> 00:49:01,279
I told everyone about your wedding
What are you going to do about this?

738
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:02,518
- If you call off the wedding now...
- Let go, let go of me

739
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,485
Ugh! Wake up, girl!

740
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,665
Have you also gone insane like Eun-gyu?

741
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,512
(The decision I made as an adult
wasn't easy to change)

742
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:11,905
Pardon?

743
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:15,557
Am I still a married woman, then?

744
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:19,135
Yes, regardless of the situation,
you are married

745
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,538
You registered for your marriage because
you had such intentions

746
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,126
You also got a low-interest loan

747
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:25,896
for newlywed couples

748
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,868
We didn't even have our wedding
We only registered our marriage!

749
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,460
And I wasn't the one who suggested it

750
00:49:32,465 --> 00:49:33,808
It was to buy the house, so that bastard...

751
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:37,443
I mean, that person...

752
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:42,077
Yes, but at that point,
you intended to marry him

753
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:43,280
Yes

754
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,917
But he cheated on me!

755
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,509
And that will be very advantageous

756
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:51,364
to you in the lawsuit

757
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:52,971
Because he's significantly liable

758
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:59,871
Okay, so you have clear evidence
that the two were having an affair, right?

759
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:02,116
You know, like a video or a photo

760
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:05,402
Or a voice recording with the consent
of the other party

761
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:07,615
No

762
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:09,306
Pardon?

763
00:50:11,397 --> 00:50:13,230
I couldn't...

764
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:18,016
When I unprecedentedly witnessed
them before my eyes

765
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:21,252
I couldn't believe it

766
00:50:22,864 --> 00:50:26,497
And at first, I hid like a fool
when I saw them

767
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:32,160
Evidence or whatever!
None of that came to mind

768
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:35,633
But then, miss?

769
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,101
You can't approach the law
emotionally like that...

770
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:41,835
I know, but what I'm saying is...

771
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:45,289
Wait, but then

772
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,701
Regardless of everything

773
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:51,530
you could at least give a word of comfort,

774
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:53,170
"It must've been tough," no?

775
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,996
The thing is, I'm someone who gives
realistic help

776
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:02,707
rather than useless emotional consolation

777
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:05,643
For example, swift and neat divorce

778
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:06,548
But then...

779
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:09,347
A reasonable alimony
equivalent to the client's pain

780
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,349
You're right, but!

781
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:12,921
Okay, then, let me summarize for you

782
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:13,680
The annulment of marriage...

783
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:14,819
Mr. Cha

784
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:19,823
You've never been betrayed by someone
you love, have you?

785
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:24,459
Have you ever been hurt?

786
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:28,065
I don't know

787
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,101
See?

788
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:30,979
You don't understand me

789
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:32,866
so how can I talk about myself?

790
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:36,789
Wait, there's no logical connection

791
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,964
between this and that

792
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:40,594
How do you plan to take my side

793
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,819
when you don't even understand me?

794
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:44,933
Come on, filing for a divorce
isn't some kid's joke!

795
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,720
There's no such thing as your side
or my side in this

796
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:47,982
There are sides to it!

797
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:49,277
No?

798
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:52,735
Goodness me

799
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,241
F... Forget it

800
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:04,061
You're not the only law firm available

801
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:06,568
I quit
I'm not entrusting this case to you

802
00:52:09,364 --> 00:52:10,474
Gosh, this tastes disgusting!

803
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,633
Okay, I understand

804
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,118
I'm so sorry to hear that

805
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:17,050
I really want to help you

806
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,102
but I guess there's nothing
I can do about it!

807
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:21,298
If you don't mean it, don't say it

808
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:27,540
That, that...

809
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,818
What a temper

810
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,429
(So I'm)

811
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:49,865
(Guilty of registering my marriage 58 days
ahead of my wedding)

812
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,972
(And therefore, legally divorced)

813
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,454
(And socially ambiguously back on the
market as a single woman)

814
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:08,876
(Interest Payment Guide)

815
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:11,819
(KG Savings Bank interest loans due
for payment) ($2,580)

816
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:15,510
(Ms. Ji, your interest on $5,000,000
in financial loans is 4.28%...)

817
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:43,247
What a relief the screen is intact

818
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:44,510
I don't even have money

819
00:53:46,615 --> 00:53:49,480
(But if I must find one good thing
about this)

820
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:52,869
(I've grown up a little)

821
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:57,292
(No one can substitute for me)

822
00:53:58,089 --> 00:53:59,376
(I must be responsible)

823
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:02,793
(For what I've done)

824
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:16,188
He's a nasty person,
so I'll teach him a lesson

825
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:19,743
How amazing

826
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,858
It's you, isn't it?

827
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,556
Jay, auntie needs to poo-poo

828
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:30,085
Can you play alone for a minute?

829
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,446
Goodness me

830
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:45,721
It's not me

831
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:50,163
What is this sound?

832
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:58,554
Have they seriously gone nuts?

833
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,320
Just who on earth is doing this
at this hour...

834
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:10,974
No, no, no, no!

835
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:12,415
Oh, wait, wait

836
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,590
When am I going to clean this up?

837
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:19,106
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!

838
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:19,764
No, no!

839
00:55:21,024 --> 00:55:22,837
Yeah, you're busted today

840
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:23,541
Where are you going?

841
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:25,044
To the nuisance upstairs!

842
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,404
We've had enough in the morning!
They're really asking for it!

843
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:48,046
Excuse me!

844
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,673
I'm from unit 1604 downstairs

845
00:55:50,678 --> 00:55:52,195
Can you come out for a second?

846
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:56,537
Excuse me?

847
00:55:59,118 --> 00:56:02,108
I mean, our toilet right now...

848
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:17,511
It's you, right?

849
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:19,971
Song-yi!

850
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,269
- It's me
- (Tell me I'm dreaming)

851
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,599
(It's Jin-ho, the rock)

852
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,329
(The person I shared my dark history
with at 21)

853
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,737
(My ex-boyfriend)

854
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:34,479
Song-yi

855
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,670
(From an ex-best friend
to an ex-boyfriend)

856
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:04,534
(Why are they all in Cheonpo?)

857
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,693
[Sorry Not Sorry]

858
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:39,192
(Wait, how did Seok-jun marry
such a beautiful woman?)

859
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:40,909
This is my mommy

860
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:42,710
(Just why on earth is he doing that?)

861
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:43,613
Please!

862
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:45,710
(I said stop parking your baby car in the public space)
Even his handwriting is edgy

863
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:47,619
(I ought to move out quickly or something)

864
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:49,657
Hey, but why are you avoiding me?

865
00:57:49,662 --> 00:57:51,369
Why do you always talk like that?

866
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:54,203
Why do you always pretend you care
and make me unfortunate?

867
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,830
Last time, she didn't talk about herself
at all

868
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:57,709
Is she hiding something?

869
00:57:57,714 --> 00:57:58,711
Hello

870
00:57:58,716 --> 00:58:02,826
I was wondering if we could
meet up separately
