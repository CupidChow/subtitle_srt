1
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,187
I didn't like it

2
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,424
I did it because I didn't like the idea

3
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,527
What are you saying?

4
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,396
I don't want you to move out, Song-yi

5
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,167
I want you to stay here

6
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,204
Why?

7
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,910
Actually,

8
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,780
I don't like expecting things from people

9
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,582
I've always been like that,

10
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,686
and even more so when my marriage turned
out to be different from what I expected

11
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:33,660
It's more hurtful and scary
when my expectations are shattered

12
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,297
But...

13
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,603
Somehow, I keep getting my hopes up

14
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,240
On my way to work in the morning,

15
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,544
when I hear you and Jay's voice,

16
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,584
I know that my uneventful day

17
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,822
will become noisier and more bothersome,

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,862
but I can't wait

19
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,233
because I want to

20
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,369
see you, Song-yi

21
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,413
Mr. Cha, are you saying that

22
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,684
you have feelings for me?

23
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,288
Yes, well...

24
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:40,160
You could say that

25
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,133
Song-yi

26
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,345
(I've thought of Cheonpo)

27
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,749
(as a bus stop,
where I only stay for a while)

28
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:10,023
(Just a temporary bunker for a failure
like me to stay after divorce)

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,960
(Is that why?)

30
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,964
(I've always had this hope that)

31
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:24,671
(the day I leave Cheonpo
will be the day I lighten up again)

32
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,607
(and start a new life)

33
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:48,528
I didn't mean to slam the door
My hands slipped

34
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,796
In case you got it wrong

35
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,900
No, I didn't

36
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:02,175
I was worried I scared you

37
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,045
I don't know if scare is the right word...

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,014
But...

39
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,416
Umm...

40
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,924
I should think about it
a bit more carefully

41
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,894
As you know, I have a lot on my plate

42
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,968
Yes, of course

43
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,906
We're not exactly in the situation

44
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,643
where we can start a relationship
with just romantic feelings

45
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,813
Yes, I totally understand

46
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,855
Okay, then

47
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,958
Good night

48
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,259
You too

49
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,336
(Whatever)

50
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,241
(I didn't want to be tied to Cheonpo)

51
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,250
[Sorry Not Sorry]

52
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,825
Good luck

53
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,460
I'll be fine

54
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,929
I even had twins

55
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,331
Hana

56
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,933
When will you come back to Cheonpo?

57
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,935
After I get out of the
postpartum care center,

58
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,571
I'm going to stay at my mom's
during my maternity leave

59
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,343
Stay healthy until I return from
my leave, okay?

60
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,410
Okay?

61
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,047
Thank you for coming

62
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,516
She really wanted to say bye

63
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,485
Honey, let's go now
We'll be late

64
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,619
Okay

65
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,058
Don't cry while I'm gone

66
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,965
Hana, I'll write to you

67
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,937
Chan-yang, they have wi-fi
at the postpartum care center

68
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,539
It's not like I'm going to jail

69
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:15,742
Oh, right

70
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,243
Congrats, Song-yi

71
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,580
You finally sold the house
you dearly wanted to sell

72
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,319
Don't cut me off just because
you're moving somewhere else

73
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,322
You just take care of yourself

74
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,592
Honey, we really have to get going

75
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,594
There's traffic in Seoul

76
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,195
Okay, fine

77
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,133
I'll text you, let's talk through text

78
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,167
Call me

79
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,301
Bye, Hana

80
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,972
You've been talking all this time
You have more to talk about?

81
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,589
It feels weird

82
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,026
I know, it feels empty

83
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,130
Hana left

84
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:15,501
and you sold your house,
so you're leaving, too

85
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,970
It's not like I'll never see you again
after I move out

86
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,505
I'll come visit you often

87
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,075
Plus, the couple who bought my house
are moving in after two months

88
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,410
That's when they're getting married

89
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,447
I'm not moving right away, so don't worry

90
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,382
Two months

91
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,019
I only have two months left with you

92
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,676
Should we eat out today?

93
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,011
I don't feel like eating

94
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:00,880
Yeah?

95
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,816
Should I cook something?

96
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,185
No

97
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,821
What is it?

98
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,625
Why is my sweet Chan-yang
feeling down today?

99
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,527
Let me guess

100
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,530
Is the overseas shipping delayed?

101
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,498
No

102
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,603
Did your mom cut your allowance
so you can't go shopping?

103
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,476
What could it be, then?

104
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,614
Honey

105
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,250
About us having a baby

106
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,785
Can we make it happen in two months?

107
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,454
What?

108
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,256
Two months?

109
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,392
That's so soon

110
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,226
I know

111
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,962
I want to have a baby in two months

112
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,864
Let's try it
Please?

113
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,369
Why is it not one or three
but specifically two months?

114
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,339
I don't know, I want to have a baby
in two months

115
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,875
I want to become pregnant in two months

116
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,611
Two months!

117
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,347
That's so random...

118
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,950
(Wiz OB/GYN)

119
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,589
If you want quick results,
just as you said,

120
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,827
you must do your homework regularly

121
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,866
How diligently you do your homework

122
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,368
will determine your outcome

123
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:30,970
Okay?

124
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,748
Is Jay sleeping?

125
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,117
He's a chatterbox

126
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,052
Can you get me one, too?

127
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,290
Geez, you can get one yourself

128
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,495
Here

129
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,031
Hey

130
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,734
Have you thought about
where you want to move to?

131
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,538
No, I'm not sure yet

132
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,274
Anything you want to try?

133
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,676
I had a lot of things I wanted to try

134
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,945
But you can't do everything you want

135
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,183
Hey, do you want to
move to New York with me?

136
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,388
New York? All of a sudden?

137
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,224
It's not like New York is just across
the street

138
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:29,228
They have an opening at the branch,
so they're asking me to come back

139
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,432
Was it when you were in college?
You wanted to study abroad

140
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:38,904
I couldn't come to Korea to save up,
but you kept saying you were jealous

141
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,307
Hey, that was ages ago

142
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,909
Why would I go study abroad at this age?

143
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,511
Nah

144
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,880
I don't want to put pressure on you

145
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,883
I really mean it

146
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,988
I'm grateful to you for looking after Jay,

147
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,659
but more often than not, I feel bad for you

148
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,765
My company provides an overseas
language program for employee's families

149
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:10,102
We can send Jay to daycare, and
you can go study English at an academy

150
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,877
But still, that's...

151
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,712
You should start living your own life

152
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,580
What are you planning to do here?

153
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,582
Well...

154
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,118
You're right

155
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:33,092
But going to the States
wasn't part of my plan

156
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,997
I'm not telling you to decide right now

157
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,732
Take your time and think about it

158
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,468
(Me?)

159
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,171
(Move to the States?)

160
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:52,011
(It might be a chance for me
to reset my life)

161
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,417
(But why don't I feel excited?)

162
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,656
Well, it's a shame

163
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,693
Five beers for 10,000 won
at the Cheonpo Supermarket

164
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,464
They won't have anything
this cheap anywhere, right?

165
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,380
Hello

166
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,583
Yes, hi

167
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,485
Good morning

168
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,928
I pooped this morning,
and it looked like a snake!

169
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,029
What?

170
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,033
Oh, I see
Great job

171
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,172
He must've been very proud
He keeps bragging about it

172
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,377
They're still kids, after all

173
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,713
What about you?

174
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,714
What?

175
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,749
What shape was it?

176
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,685
Mine?

177
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,223
Well, uh...

178
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:22,201
Oh, we look like a family
standing here like this!

179
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:23,936
What?

180
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,139
Dad, mom, and baby

181
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,976
- Uncle
- Huh?

182
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,646
You should marry my aunt

183
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,050
He keeps saying nonsense today

184
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,518
What's wrong with you?

185
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:57,469
If you're on your way to
the kindergarten, I can give you a ride

186
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,605
Sure!

187
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,247
We should get in

188
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,821
Wow, is that your car?
That's so cool

189
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,857
Can I ride your car?

190
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,892
Sure, let me open the door for you

191
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,096
- Thank you
- Please

192
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,952
But you won't quit work, right?

193
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:48,988
Sorry?

194
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,091
I mean, if you move

195
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,860
Unless you're going somewhere far away

196
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,798
Actually, I haven't decided yet

197
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,170
Does that mean you might go
somewhere far?

198
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,976
Song, can we not move?

199
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,278
What?

200
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,549
Jay

201
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,553
We're not moving

202
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,823
We're not moving right now

203
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,060
But we are moving someday!

204
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,765
Then, I can no longer see Sia
and play ball games with Teo

205
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,170
I thought you missed your friends
back in New York

206
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,538
I don't want to move!

207
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:45,177
I promised to stay here for a long time
with my friends!

208
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,113
I don't want to go back to New York!

209
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,820
Why did you have to talk about
moving in front of him?

210
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,690
Sorry, I didn't know
he'd react like this...

211
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,726
But are you really going to New York?

212
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,997
No, that's not true
Stop crying

213
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,301
Jay, don't cry

214
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,270
What a mean uncle

215
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,738
Just start the car

216
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,106
Okay

217
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,112
Jay, don't cry

218
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,954
Bye, Jay

219
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,459
Thank you for the ride, bye

220
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,727
Okay, bye

221
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,604
I was going to say that
I'm fine with long-distance,

222
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,042
but New York was totally unexpected

223
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,149
Why did he have to bring up
New York?

224
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,986
That's why we have to be careful
with what we say in front of kids

225
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,922
Song-yi!

226
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,257
Hi

227
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,995
I want orange juice

228
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:10,896
Sure

229
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,866
Huh? But why orange juice?

230
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,437
Oranges are rich in folic acid, which is
good when preparing for pregnancy

231
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,839
Oh, did you start preparing for pregnancy?

232
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,342
Yes, I'm trying to get pregnant
in the next two months

233
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,243
Two months?

234
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,644
Why two months?

235
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,681
It's better to have it quick
while I'm determined

236
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,990
Are you dying, Jin-ho?

237
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,124
No, I'm fine

238
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,460
I'm totally fine

239
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,697
Never mind
I'll get two glasses of orange juice

240
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,900
What do you want to have?

241
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,767
Huh?

242
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,710
Your two glasses of orange juice
and coffee are ready

243
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,281
Can you carry it?

244
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,025
Be careful, please

245
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,263
Oh my gosh

246
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,969
Are they really okay?

247
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:37,116
Mr. Kim, I always write down
the date on a sticker

248
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
and stick it under the cake

249
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,386
You should always check that and follow
the first-in first-out system, okay?

250
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,088
Okay

251
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,926
And turn this light on

252
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,696
Whenever you work at the counter,

253
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,965
I notice that the cakes are all mixed up

254
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,869
If they don't go out in order,
it's too much food waste

255
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,370
Okay

256
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,673
Oh, and this cup!

257
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,511
I told you, if you put the cups like this,
it will collect dust!

258
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,680
You have to put them upside down, okay?

259
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,050
Put them upside down with covers

260
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,619
Okay

261
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:23,395
But why are you so cranky today?

262
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,998
You look a bit angry, too

263
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:30,035
I'm not being cranky
I'm just worried about you

264
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,139
You should be able to do this on your own
when I'm gone

265
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:44,116
You sold your house, haven't you?

266
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,219
Is it obvious?

267
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,658
Of course, it's obvious

268
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:58,330
Is that why you're trying to cut ties now?

269
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,134
With me

270
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,102
and the cafe

271
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,505
Why would I do that?

272
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,507
What's wrong with everyone?

273
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,444
It's not like I'm leaving tomorrow

274
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:18,050
You still love Cheonpo, right?

275
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,956
Even if I do!

276
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,825
It's not like I have to live here forever

277
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,263
The thought of leaving here for good
makes me feel so relieved!

278
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,848
- Dad!
- Sweetheart!

279
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,258
(It's a good neighborhood)

280
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,594
(Cheonpo below heaven,
Cheonpo New Town)

281
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,736
(Come to think of it,
it's hard to find a neighborhood like this)

282
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,705
(There are lots of parks and green spaces,)

283
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,075
(and schools are near the house, so
you can pick up the kids in slippers)

284
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,911
(There are good hidden restaurants)

285
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,880
(and lots of places to go for a drive)

286
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,418
(The tteokbokki at the kid's cafe
was really good, too)

287
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,555
(To be honest, the moms here
are not that bad...)

288
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,458
(Wait, no...)

289
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,994
I have a friend, so I can
get it cheap for you!

290
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,797
You're all I have, Louis' mom

291
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,033
(No! Don't be fooled, Song-yi)

292
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,567
(No!)

293
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,345
(Hana)
(What are you going to do with Mr. Cha?)

294
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,514
I'm following your advice

295
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,283
I'm thinking about it carefully

296
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,119
(What will you do about work?)

297
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,588
Are you going to nitpick on me, too?

298
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,826
(One of my acquaintances started
their own start-up company,)

299
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,961
(and they're looking for someone
to work with)

300
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,731
(I was thinking of recommending you)

301
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,067
I appreciate the thought

302
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,636
But what I'm worried about is...

303
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,106
(Didn't you use to work in the Management
Support Team at your old company?)

304
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,477
(The task seems similar,
and they're paying pretty well)

305
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,348
(If you have to find a house anyway,
you can find one near the company)

306
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,952
(But going overseas
is also a good opportunity)

307
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:40,225
Aren't you at the hospital to deliver
your baby? Why do you have so much energy?

308
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,429
(Can't you see how much I care about you?)

309
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,332
(You're Ddoddo's aunt
Of course, I should do this!)

310
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,535
Do you need coupons for
Chef Story Side Dish?

311
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,271
(Coupons? Why coupons?)

312
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,474
Coffee coupons

313
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,709
I should give this to Chan-yang

314
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:03,849
Two months should be enough to use up the
money I charged for Cheonpo Money, right?

315
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,384
(What are you saying?)

316
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,787
(Anyway, I'm going to recommend you, okay?)

317
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,056
Hey

318
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,970
Bungeoppang coupon

319
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:25,871
(CRB)

320
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,007
- Come on
- Song-yi!

321
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,475
All right

322
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,847
Thank you, Mr. Kim
I really appreciate it

323
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,251
Don't mention it
I'm lucky I got to eat it, too

324
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,452
You should go inside

325
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,288
I come here often,
but she never recognizes me

326
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,159
She remembers you

327
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,994
Stop that

328
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,264
You're so timid

329
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,935
Should I give this to Mr. Kim or Mr. Cha?

330
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,248
Hey

331
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,950
(Song-yi, is Jay home?)

332
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,887
Why are you asking me if Jay's home?

333
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,924
Didn't you say that you'd pick him up?

334
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,791
(Yeah)

335
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,761
(I was a bit late, and Jay's not here)

336
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,796
(I don't know where he is)

337
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,932
(What if Jay got kidnapped?)

338
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,036
What? Call the police for a missing child
right away

339
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,337
I'm coming

340
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,439
Jay!

341
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,740
Jay!

342
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,042
Jay!

343
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:38,844
Where are you?

344
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,047
I'm sorry, have you seen a kid this big?

345
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,151
I'm sorry, have you seen this kid?

346
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,352
No, I haven't

347
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,322
I'm sorry, have you seen a boy
this big pass by?

348
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,257
I'll call you back

349
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,962
I'm sorry, have you seen this kid?

350
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,096
Jay

351
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,934
(Mr. Cha Hyeon-woo)

352
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,438
Mr. Cha, I'm sorry,
but I don't have time for...

353
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:10,742
What?

354
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,179
You're with Jay?

355
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,673
I was fast, right?

356
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,475
You're so slow

357
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,743
Come on

358
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,845
Try to focus, okay?

359
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,592
I won

360
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,029
Let's do it one more time, one more time!

361
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,797
Okay, fine

362
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,233
Hope you're better this time
You should win at least once

363
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,702
Jay!

364
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,408
How could you just run off
without telling anyone?

365
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,243
I was so worried about you

366
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,180
Mommy, it's not that...

367
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,216
What should I do with you, Jay Ji?

368
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,253
Eun-gyu, at least we found him

369
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,158
Thank you so much for staying with Jay

370
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,428
We were so surprised because he disappeared

371
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,032
But I didn't find him

372
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:48,940
Jay came to my office by himself

373
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,642
What? He did?

374
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,110
Yes

375
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,347
He said he wanted my advice on something

376
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,148
And advice?

377
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,587
Jay

378
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,957
Why did you come here? Huh?

379
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,293
It's...

380
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,797
It's okay

381
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,867
Jay, be honest with me

382
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,136
I...

383
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,873
wanted him to stop us from moving

384
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,613
Why would you tell him that?

385
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,216
Ethan told me

386
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:35,720
If something difficult happens,
I should seek a lawyer

387
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:46,231
Mommy, Aunt Song, I don't want to move

388
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,101
Mom, I wanna live here

389
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,604
I don't wanna go back to New York

390
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,209
I don't wanna go anywhere else

391
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,715
Come here

392
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,186
Mommy's sorry

393
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,389
I looked for you everywhere, Jay

394
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,194
Mommy was so worried

395
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,495
Did you have dinner?

396
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,064
(Right)

397
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,168
(Not everyone wanted to leave Cheonpo)

398
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,107
Thank you

399
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,009
No problem
Get home safe

400
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,211
Say "Thank you," Jay

401
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,180
Thank you

402
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,882
Okay, bye

403
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,317
I'll see you at home

404
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,852
Yeah

405
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,763
Thanks

406
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:58,403
My heart sank
after receiving Eun-gyu's call

407
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,209
Well, isn't he cute and remarkable?

408
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,513
He's figuring out what fondness is

409
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:15,220
Jay must've become attached to Cheonpo

410
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,189
I feel bad for
not understanding his feelings

411
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:24,362
I think you truly realize how you feel
when you have to let them go

412
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,666
Because you don't want to regret it

413
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:38,409
Jay must've learned that

414
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,280
I thought he was still a baby

415
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,583
When did he grow up to have those feelings?

416
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,125
I've been feeling that way, too

417
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,276
I better get going

418
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,811
Oh, okay

419
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,613
Get home safe

420
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,131
I'm home

421
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,271
Did you drink?

422
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,874
I wasn't going to drink

423
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,077
But they kept insisting that
I drink just one glass

424
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,047
It's not just one glass

425
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,716
Did you forget what day it was today?

426
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,384
Today?

427
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,157
Our wedding anniversary is next month

428
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:03,294
Your mom's birthday is next, next week

429
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,363
Jin-ho

430
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,533
How could you?

431
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,802
I told you this morning

432
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,904
About what?

433
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,741
It's the day we do the homework
the gynecologist gave us!

434
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,578
Oh, right

435
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,213
Homework!

436
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,781
Right, we need to do our homework

437
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,316
Homework!

438
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,919
Homework, homework!

439
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,934
She's asleep

440
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,671
Chan-yang, we need to do our homework

441
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,241
I'm tired

442
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,509
We have to do it

443
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,078
Get up

444
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,985
Thinking that it's homework

445
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,024
and that I have to do it makes it no fun

446
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,927
But you said that

447
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,596
you wanted a baby, get up

448
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,274
It feels like I'm the only one
stuck in the same place

449
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,878
What?

450
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,620
Everyone...

451
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,624
Everyone is living a great life

452
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,563
Hana works hard and has her own career

453
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,733
Song-yi

454
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,970
She's living her life boldly,
saying whatever she wants to

455
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,206
And she's going to leave soon
now that she sold her house

456
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,644
But

457
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,582
I feel like I'm the only one
stuck in the same place

458
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,553
Chan-yang

459
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,226
What's wrong with me?

460
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:22,333
It feels like everyone else is
moving on all happy

461
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,070
But I'm here all alone

462
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,715
No

463
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,083
Don't cry

464
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,160
Oh my gosh

465
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,396
Did you really make this?

466
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,296
Yes

467
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,400
It was worth waiting
until we closed the store

468
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,671
I can't rely on you forever

469
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,609
So, I took a baking class at night
after closing the cafe

470
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,612
What do you think?
Do you think I could sell them?

471
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,946
Of course!

472
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,517
I thought you were just naively optimistic,

473
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,118
but you were working hard

474
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,656
I didn't even know that
and was hard on you last time

475
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,193
No, it's been a while
since I learned baking

476
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,133
I should've told you earlier

477
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,203
Then, you would've worried less about me

478
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,274
People might take the wrong idea

479
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,676
That a part-timer
is worrying about the owner

480
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,278
Is that so?

481
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,649
You know

482
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,320
I never seem to get the timing right
in my life

483
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,791
Timing?

484
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,864
You know how we used to have
Sports Day back in school?

485
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,035
When you stand in line to run for a relay,

486
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,971
they fire the starting pistol

487
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,342
But I always missed the timing to run,

488
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,611
even after hearing the sound

489
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,147
How come?

490
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,950
You can just start running when you hear it

491
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,020
I was...

492
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:25,890
too nervous

493
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,594
That's impossible

494
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,429
You don't look like the type
who'd get nervous

495
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,332
No, I get nervous, too

496
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:40,104
I just stood there
even after hearing the sound

497
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,975
and started to run a few seconds later
than the other kids

498
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,311
So, no matter how fast I ran the race,
I couldn't surpass them

499
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,749
Why did you just stand there?

500
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,119
I was...

501
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,656
too scared to run

502
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,629
That's why I kept hesitating

503
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,701
If I start late, pretending that
I didn't hear the sound,

504
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,271
I at least have an excuse,
even if I come in last

505
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,805
Confess to her

506
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,608
Don't confess to her

507
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,977
Confess to her

508
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,883
It's okay
I can totally root for your life, Song-yi

509
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,488
What I'm saying is...
Don't worry too much

510
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,793
and just live however you want to

511
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:43,434
But if I come in last
after running my heart out...

512
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,707
Then, what do I do?

513
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,226
Why? Why can't you check right now?

514
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:14,332
You can check the results
when it's implanted

515
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,836
It's not like some ready meal

516
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:22,240
you get it done right away
after tossing it in the microwave

517
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,909
Can't you see it with a microscope?

518
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,146
I understand that you feel anxious

519
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,083
But you should wait patiently

520
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,387
You need to ease your mind

521
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,156
Okay? It's a long race

522
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,504
What?

523
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,475
Why is nothing going my way?

524
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,360
This isn't fun

525
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,366
This isn't fun at all

526
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,254
Mr. Cha, I'm...

527
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,754
Oh, hello

528
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,088
Hi

529
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,728
Song-yi

530
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,101
I've thought about it

531
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,773
Sorry?

532
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,610
Let me do it again

533
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,479
Do what?

534
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,183
What I said that day

535
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,158
After saying that last time,

536
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,996
I've had a lot on my mind

537
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,618
Song-yi, what do I do?

538
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:57,955
What's wrong?

539
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,537
I'm...

540
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:19,210
not sure if it's okay for me
to have a baby

541
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,245
Of course, it's okay

542
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,948
You'll be a good, fun mom

543
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,185
But how come I don't feel that way?

544
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,690
Is it tough trying to get pregnant?

545
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:42,299
Honestly, I don't even remember
why I wanted to get pregnant

546
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,205
When I first said that
I was getting married,

547
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,641
everyone asked me why

548
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,646
They told me that
I was too young to get married

549
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,782
and that it's okay to get married over 35

550
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,785
Everyone stopped me

551
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,857
I know, I took that advice
and didn't get married until 35,

552
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,425
and ended up marrying
a weird guy and got divorced...

553
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,898
It's only right to get married
when you find a decent person

554
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,268
So?

555
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,604
I was so sick and tired

556
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,410
My mom, dad, and my house

557
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,047
I was so sick of it

558
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:33,717
So what if they run a famous
duck restaurant?

559
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,287
I hate duck

560
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,690
That's why I never eat duck

561
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:44,662
Right, your family runs that very famous
duck restaurant chain in Gyeonggi-do

562
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,630
I know that place

563
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,500
I didn't know your family owned that place

564
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:57,541
Actually, I married Jin-ho
because I wanted to run away from home

565
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,379
He's kind, he listens to me well

566
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,316
He does everything I ask him to

567
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:12,089
I liked how everyone pampered me
for getting married early

568
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:21,231
(I felt like a grownup,
getting married and leaving home)

569
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,535
(I felt like I was playing house every day)

570
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,346
(When I just got married,
I was filled with dopamine)

571
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,381
That's enough now

572
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,517
Are you going to keep doing this?

573
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,486
It tickles!

574
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,788
(But it didn't last long)

575
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,727
So boring

576
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,330
(If it weren't for you,)

577
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:58,168
(who knows what would've happened
to me and Jin-ho?)

578
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,474
(I know Jin-ho is a nice person)

579
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,278
(That's why he's working so hard for me)

580
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,719
(Now that I want a baby,
he's following along)

581
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:21,625
(But it starts to feel like homework
and responsibility,)

582
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,696
(and it seems like
he's getting tired of it)

583
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,634
(And it's no fun)

584
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,143
There are people who
desperately want a baby

585
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:45,816
But I just thought
it would be fun to have one

586
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,753
Have a baby who looks like me

587
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:58,595
I don't know if that's a good enough reason
for me to have a baby

588
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,738
Your life is full of drama and dilemmas,

589
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,140
and yet, you still manage to live on

590
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,913
I've grown up in a bubble

591
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,784
Why do I find all these things
so burdensome and challenging?

592
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,224
I should've grown up
outside the bubble like you

593
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:31,929
I shouldn't have grown up in a bubble

594
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,307
You don't have any friends, do you?

595
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,143
I don't

596
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,179
I only have you and Hana

597
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,182
Yeah, I can tell

598
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,319
What? Are you dissing me?

599
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,556
You're quick at catching that
I thought you'd take it as a compliment

600
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,025
Stop joking

601
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,997
So that's why

602
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,299
What do you mean?

603
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:14,905
I told you I'm leaving in two months
So you want to get pregnant before I leave

604
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,009
Yes, I think that's right

605
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,513
I guess that was the reason

606
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:29,720
It would've been really tough
if I hadn't met you and Hana in Cheonpo

607
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,058
I felt like I was the only one
staying in one place

608
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,197
I thought everyone else
was leaving to be happy

609
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,433
while I'm living here
as a failure in Cheonpo

610
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:50,107
I thought I had to leave this place
to escape from the hellish memories

611
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,813
But someone told me

612
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,715
I did it because I didn't like the idea

613
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,987
I don't want you to move out, Song-yi

614
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,758
I want you to stay here

615
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,864
When I heard that,
I suddenly didn't want to move

616
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,610
Where were you?

617
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,881
You didn't even answer my calls
Where have you been?

618
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,418
Oh, honey...

619
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,986
I heard you went to the hospital

620
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,622
What's up with you these days?

621
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,393
I'm sorry

622
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,263
What?

623
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:49,967
I'm sorry

624
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,840
Is something really up?

625
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,575
Is that it?

626
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,379
You've never apologized to me before

627
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:12,990
What?

628
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,560
I just said I'm sorry because I felt bad

629
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,029
Is that wrong?

630
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,268
Did I do something wrong?

631
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:28,872
I can't think of anything

632
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,141
No

633
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,777
Then why are you scaring me?

634
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,881
I just apologized
Why are you getting scared?

635
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:40,984
I don't know

636
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:42,953
I'm just scared

637
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,589
Jin-ho

638
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,091
From now on, you can get mad at me

639
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:52,396
If I act rude, you should tell me off

640
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:58,168
And if I complain and force myself on you,

641
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,671
you don't have to put up with it

642
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:08,378
Just get angry like right now,
and stay by my side forever

643
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,120
Thank you

644
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,692
Are you going to cry?

645
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:35,272
Huh?

646
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,342
- Thank you
- Yes, thank you

647
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,016
Excuse me...

648
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,085
Whoa! Geez!

649
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,554
Why are you so surprised?

650
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,624
You could've just called me
instead of scaring me

651
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,930
That wasn't even something
to be surprised about

652
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,309
What brings you here?

653
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,811
Would you like to drink something?

654
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:16,847
Sure

655
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,386
Regarding...

656
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,256
what I said about doing it again

657
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:28,625
Yes

658
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,928
I've thought about it a lot

659
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,398
But...

660
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:38,368
I think I've rushed a bit

661
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,675
Does that mean...

662
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:00,390
No, it's not your fault

663
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,593
I understand

664
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,630
We have a lot to consider

665
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,800
And nothing's been fixed for me yet

666
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,171
When Eun-gyu suggested going to
New York,

667
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,807
I was tempted by the offer, actually

668
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:37,294
I don't like expecting things from people

669
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:42,566
It's more hurtful and scary
when my expectations are shattered

670
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,469
(He's right)

671
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:51,541
(It's just like what he said, it's more
hurtful when the expectations are broken)

672
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,379
(What did I expect?)

673
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,119
If I go to New York,

674
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,457
I might be able to start a new life,

675
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,162
but I decided to not go

676
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:14,898
Sorry?

677
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,269
I don't want to go too far away

678
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:28,678
I see

679
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:33,917
Song-yi

680
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,085
I like you, too

681
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,492
I don't know what you think,

682
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,065
but I just wanted to tell you this

683
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,904
Well, it just came out

684
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,611
I see

685
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:08,418
What I wanted to say was this

686
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,294
It doesn't matter where you go

687
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,230
Whether it's New York or wherever

688
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,333
Until you feel ready, Song-yi,

689
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,139
I'll wait for you

690
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,879
That's what I was going to tell you

691
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,649
What?

692
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,719
I did a lot of thinking by myself

693
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,189
Did I rush it too much?

694
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:53,029
Maybe I should've taken you
somewhere fancy to confess my feelings

695
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:58,168
Although I lost my turn to you

696
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:05,041
Then, you should've said so

697
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,311
Why did you say it like that?
I took it the wrong way

698
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,250
See? You have a problem
with the way you talk

699
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,019
The way I talk?

700
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,855
Did that cause confusion...

701
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,526
Okay, then, let me say that again

702
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,499
Song-yi,

703
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,736
would you like to go on
a date with me tomorrow?

704
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,606
A date?

705
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:38,775
Yes

706
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,611
Let's eat something nice,

707
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,413
go watch a movie,

708
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,682
and take a walk together

709
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,889
I'd love that

710
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,525
Okay

711
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,295
I'd love that, too

712
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,632
Let's eat something really delicious

713
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,310
Huh? Song-yi

714
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,784
Mr. Kim, I have something to tell you

715
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:22,886
Me?

716
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:24,821
Yes

717
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,129
(Letter of resignation)
(CRB)

718
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,634
I knew it

719
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:40,870
You're quitting

720
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,441
I thought you should hire a new part-timer

721
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,287
I've never received a letter of resignation
from a cafe part-timer before

722
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:01,424
It's my first time writing one

723
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,768
Thank you for hiring me, Mr. Kim

724
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,807
I would've struggled
if I hadn't started working

725
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,212
I got to work, make money,

726
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,849
and didn't have to be stuck at home alone

727
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,517
Come on

728
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,687
I'm the lucky one

729
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,056
I've learned a lot from you

730
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,993
If it weren't for you,

731
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,629
this cafe would've been out of business
by now

732
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:41,998
No way

733
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,535
It won't go out of business because
of the customers who come to see you

734
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,271
Come on, that doesn't last long

735
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:55,578
I'll help out until you find a new
part-timer,

736
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,715
and I'll make sure to teach them properly

737
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,317
Okay

738
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:11,795
Song-yi...

739
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,134
I have feelings for you

740
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:25,775
Right

741
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,045
Right

742
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,017
Huh?

743
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:38,822
Oh

744
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,929
You knew?

745
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,833
I'm not dumb
How can I not know that?

746
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,337
Right

747
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:56,773
But why...

748
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,076
didn't you say anything?

749
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,414
Maybe I was scared, too

750
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,951
To run as soon as I hear
the sound of the starting pistol

751
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:19,262
You know what they say about timing in life

752
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:24,801
Before I came to Cheonpo,
I also believed in timing

753
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,939
I pretended that I didn't know
how you felt about me

754
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,110
because of the timing

755
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,516
Timing?

756
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,786
Yeah, well

757
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,993
I should've opened up
about my feelings sooner

758
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,263
But that's not how things work

759
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,637
It doesn't always

760
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,141
fall into line at the right time

761
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:13,383
Sometimes, you fall in love
with someone slowly

762
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,587
without even realizing it

763
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:38,741
Did you fall in love with someone
without realizing it?

764
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:42,412
Yes

765
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,117
I think so

766
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,194
Welcome

767
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,003
Eyebrows, check

768
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,305
My bangs look perfect

769
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,274
Flawless makeup

770
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:22,378
(Epilogue)

771
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:28,985
Congrats, Song-yi

772
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:35,825
From now on, I'm going to start running
as soon as I hear the starting pistol

773
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,294
Promise?

774
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,864
I promise

775
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,850
I'll accept this

776
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,294
[Sorry Not Sorry]

777
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,927
I must've been crazy
Why did I think he'd be different?

778
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,396
Is something up?
Why is she suddenly ghosting me?

779
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,598
Min-jeong

780
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,867
I don't know what I'm going to do
with my life

781
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,069
Nothing goes my way

782
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:57,039
Can you do me a favor?

783
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,776
Why haven't you returned my calls?
I was looking everywhere for you

784
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,544
Why are you so clueless?

785
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,945
I hate you, Mr. Cha

786
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:07,250
I'm trying my best to talk to you,
Song-yi

787
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,484
I want to hold on to you, Song-yi
