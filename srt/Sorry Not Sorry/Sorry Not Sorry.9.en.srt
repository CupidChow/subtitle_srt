1
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,887
Eun-gyu! Did you go to work already?

2
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,924
Jay

3
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,802
(Ji Eun-gyu)

4
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,338
What's going on?

5
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,406
What?

6
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,242
I didn't wake you up
so you could get more sleep

7
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,744
Where's Jay?

8
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm taking him to kindergarten

9
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,052
Jay, why don't we let Song
take a day off? I'll help you wash up

10
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,754
Okay

11
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,826
Let's wash your face

12
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,217
I'll take him to kindergarten
from time to time

13
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,518
Get some rest

14
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,687
Seriously?

15
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,323
Sheesh, I thought...

16
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,558
I'm Jay's mom, after all

17
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,094
I'll pay more attention to Jay from now on

18
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,930
And can we talk later?

19
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,732
Sure, anytime

20
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,168
But why are you panting?

21
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,739
Why is it so far?

22
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,008
It's just right in front of
our apartment

23
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,211
Do you even know
where the bus picks him up?

24
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,482
I'm just following Jay

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,086
Forget it

26
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:33,853
I'll be there in a minute

27
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,055
No, you don't have to
I found it

28
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,057
It's fine, take a day off

29
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,059
Jay!

30
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:45,999
Oh my

31
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,000
Hi, Jay

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,468
Where's your mom?

33
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,937
She's my mom

34
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,406
Your mom?

35
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,976
Jay, your mom...

36
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,846
Yes

37
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,715
I'm clocking in late today

38
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:03,716
I told Robin

39
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,084
(Mom?)

40
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,821
(What about Jay's mom who runs the cafe?)
Yes, did you check the requirements of

41
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,823
the initial deposit and the account type?

42
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,526
If you're talking about the CFO
of that company, you can trust him

43
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,695
He's also an Ivy League graduate like me

44
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,232
(Ivy League graduate?)

45
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,667
Ethan's mom

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,103
Jay's dad is working in New York

47
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,039
He's an Ivy League graduate

48
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,008
I met him once for tea
at the New York branch

49
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,111
I heard he's the head of some
securities company's New York branch

50
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,546
How much is the private equity fund
he runs?

51
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,781
Did you say it was hundreds of billions?

52
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,583
Hundreds of billions?

53
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,620
Hey, Smith,
I'm out of the office at the moment

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,289
So, my partner will reach out to you

55
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,925
about what we discussed last month

56
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:52,765
[Sorry Not Sorry]

57
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,234
What?

58
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,402
What exactly is happening?

59
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:01,874
I'm so confused right now

60
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:08,348
It seems like she's Jay's mom, too

61
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,918
Based on what she said
and the way she talked

62
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,289
Maybe Jay has two moms

63
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,925
Huh?

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,530
I mean, there are families with two moms
in the US

65
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,701
You're right

66
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,903
I saw it in an American TV series

67
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,373
Two moms or two dads

68
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,173
Exactly!

69
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,980
So...

70
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,316
Then that means...

71
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,717
Jay has

72
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,053
- two moms?
- Two moms?

73
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,656
So those two are a couple?

74
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,260
- That must be it!
- Oh my gosh

75
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,969
Hi, Mr. Kim

76
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,138
You got here just in time

77
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,074
I'm sorry

78
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,944
But then... Is something going on?

79
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,714
Why does the cafe look so empty?

80
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,551
Tell me about it

81
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,820
There are zero customers this morning

82
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,459
Oh, and your friends haven't visited
the cafe lately

83
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,494
My friends?

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,829
Which friends?

85
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,466
Well...

86
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,670
You know, they always dress up
in similar outfits

87
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,805
and have similar vibes...

88
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,242
The Noble Kids moms

89
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,912
They're not exactly my friends

90
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,549
I'll tell them to stop by
when I see them next time

91
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,450
Okay

92
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,755
See you in a minute

93
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,036
(Do you know about the controversy
over the MD Cafe's owner?)

94
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,304
(The rumor already spread in
Noble Kids Kindergarten...)

95
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,539
(Oh... I heard about the owner's
rather unusual personal life)

96
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,891
Who is it, Ms. Choi?

97
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,160
Oh, it's nothing

98
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,928
It's a group chat with kindergarten moms

99
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,165
I put it on silent mode,
but they opened another group chat

100
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,399
I'm suddenly getting notifications

101
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,938
Wait a second

102
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,742
A new group chat means

103
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,211
they have a new target

104
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,951
(I'm just saying, so don't make it obvious
in front of Jay's mom)

105
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,688
(Of course, it's just between us)

106
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,790
(But seriously)

107
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,760
(Did you really see
Jay's mom's girlfriend?)

108
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,095
What is this?

109
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,665
Jay's mom's girlfriend?

110
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,433
(Deleted message)

111
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,037
This is ridiculous

112
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,980
Still, I find it very shocking

113
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,448
Shannon's mom,

114
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,051
do you have prejudice or something?

115
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,354
Gosh, what are you saying?

116
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,389
I don't have any prejudice

117
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,959
I'm very open-minded

118
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,061
I'm totally fine with it

119
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,565
Well, it's pretty common in
TV series and movies these days

120
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,067
We're living in a different world

121
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,070
We shouldn't be so judgmental about it

122
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,539
Well, I'm uncomfortable about it

123
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,174
I don't want to understand them

124
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:34,280
But didn't you study abroad in LA?

125
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,783
I thought people were more open to
things like this in the States

126
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,618
Right?

127
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,557
What does this have to do with
me studying abroad?

128
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,092
Besides, we're in Korea

129
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,296
How long did you stay in LA?

130
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,098
About five years?

131
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,002
Not exactly five years...

132
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,840
5 weeks and...

133
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,844
What I'm saying is...

134
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,313
We can understand it
because we're grown-ups

135
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,714
But what about the kids?

136
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,553
Although it's different these days,
the kids are still too young

137
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,190
What if they have an identity crisis?
They're still little kids

138
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,760
Well...

139
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,528
That's possible...

140
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,563
Or maybe not?

141
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,731
Identity crisis?

142
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,035
I took the words
right out of your mouth, didn't I?

143
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,973
Is that why you wanted to come
to this cafe?

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,875
To avoid Jay's mom?

145
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,043
Louis' mom

146
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,713
You make it sound like
I'm trying to leave Jay's mom out

147
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,252
I just think that for the cafe business

148
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,521
in the Cheonpo area to grow,

149
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,489
the moms shouldn't go to only one cafe

150
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,529
But you said the part-timer
at Jay's mom's cafe is so cute

151
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,698
that you want to be
a regular there for life

152
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,901
When did I say that?

153
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,871
I never said that

154
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,342
- Are you sure?
- Yes

155
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,218
(So)

156
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,154
(that was why)

157
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,460
(it didn't turn into something more
even after we kissed)

158
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,164
(That has never happened before in my life)

159
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,168
(I knew there was a reason)

160
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,311
(She didn't want to hurt me
because I didn't know anything about it)

161
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,586
And here I was, thinking of asking her out

162
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,989
It would've made her feel uncomfortable

163
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,627
(Huh?)

164
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:06,532
(Come to think of it,
she was definitely strange that day)

165
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,814
Can we order fried chicken, please?

166
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,883
Let's eat out

167
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,685
It's Saturday! Please?

168
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,555
Fine! And stop talking like a baby
It doesn't even suit you

169
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,357
Huh? Oh? What?

170
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,192
That's enough

171
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,727
It's so annoying

172
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,534
Who is she?
Why is she acting cute in front of a woman?

173
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,887
You know...

174
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,258
It's okay, Song-yi

175
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,261
Sorry?

176
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,631
I... I had no idea

177
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,333
even after going to Sports Day with Jay

178
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,605
You could've told me honestly

179
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,442
Sorry?

180
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,380
The person you introduced to me
as your younger sister...

181
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,887
I didn't know she was your special person

182
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,425
What are you saying right now?

183
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,329
It's okay

184
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,265
I can totally root for your life, Song-yi

185
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,300
I mean it

186
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,670
So...

187
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,741
What I'm saying is...
Don't worry too much

188
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,614
and just live however you want to

189
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,887
I'm pretty satisfied with my current life

190
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,434
It's just a person liking another person

191
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,039
You can't really do anything about it

192
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,930
(Hana)

193
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,199
Hey

194
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,669
Yes, I'm at the cafe

195
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,005
It's so strange
We don't have any customers today

196
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,679
What?

197
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,050
What are you saying?

198
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,490
Gosh, I knew the moms
in this neighborhood loved to gossip,

199
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,428
but how could they start such a rumor
after your sister took Jay to kindergarten?

200
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,630
They're such drama queens

201
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,065
It's so ridiculous

202
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,000
I was so dumbfounded
when I found out about it

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,235
What are you going to do now?

204
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,937
What can I do?

205
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,708
It's a ridiculous rumor
Won't it subside if I just stay still?

206
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,309
You're going to let it slide?

207
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,713
It's funny to explain such nonsense

208
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,781
What do you want me to do?
Hold a press conference?

209
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,451
They didn't check the facts,

210
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,253
and even created a group chat without you

211
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,821
Think about what they did

212
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,556
You can't let it slide

213
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,159
Okay, so, I totally get it,

214
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,896
but why are you discussing that here?

215
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,767
What's stopping you?
You should teach them a lesson

216
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,004
This is a type of emotional abuse,
you know?

217
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,338
Right, Mr. Cha?

218
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,109
Well, there are parts that I agree with
and parts that I don't

219
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,978
They say you can't judge
a book by its cover

220
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,780
They're so scary

221
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,949
Right, Mr. Cha?

222
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,686
Actually,

223
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,990
I'd like to know why
you're having that conversation here

224
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,926
Why here?

225
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,564
I'll leave with them

226
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,465
Let's go

227
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,134
I'm disappointed

228
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,536
About what?

229
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,173
I thought you would help Song-yi

230
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,509
How was I supposed to do that?

231
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,244
What do you mean how?

232
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,646
Are there any legal options?

233
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,981
Exactly, for defamation

234
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,083
You can help her sue them for defamation
or something like that

235
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,484
You know what I mean

236
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:58,390
Are you saying that
you want to file a lawsuit?

237
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,058
Something like that

238
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,892
Yes

239
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,261
Hold on

240
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,866
No

241
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,274
The consultation fee costs 150,000 won
per hour, it's not free of charge

242
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,142
- No, no
- The clock is ticking

243
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,644
- Mr. Cha
- No, wait, no

244
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,712
No, that's not what I meant

245
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,847
Don't touch the screen
It's one hour

246
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,948
No, don't

247
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,949
It's too expensive

248
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,050
- Come on
- Isn't this a counseling session?

249
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,752
No, no

250
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,386
We're not doing it

251
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,387
Let's go

252
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,205
You should consider filing a lawsuit
if it really bothers you

253
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,041
What?

254
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,378
If that's what you really want,

255
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,214
what your friends said is also an option

256
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,553
I'm not sure

257
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,024
I don't know what I want to do

258
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,795
To be honest, I don't know
how I should clear up the misunderstanding

259
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,367
Maybe it went all wrong from the start

260
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,174
Why did you lie in the first place?

261
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,710
I didn't lie

262
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,113
How should I say it?

263
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,452
I didn't explain it proactively

264
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,691
Whatever the intention,
it became a lie as a result

265
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,896
I had no choice
Jay wanted this

266
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,933
He said he wanted his mom
to pick him up after class

267
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,535
and asked if I could be his mom

268
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,281
Then...

269
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,553
Why don't you ask Jay's opinion first

270
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,155
and then decide what to do next?

271
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,723
Jay?

272
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,058
Yes

273
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:18,397
Whether he still wants his aunt
to be his mom

274
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,767
Since everything started with Jay,

275
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,369
it should end with Jay

276
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,286
(Song-yi, bring the kids
to my workshop and hang out here)

277
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,329
Hey, Song-yi

278
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,864
Hi

279
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,966
Don't you have class today?
Where are the other kids?

280
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,568
Where are the Elousha moms?

281
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,605
They're all sick

282
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,206
I guess it's the flu season

283
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,776
Guys, be careful not to catch the flu

284
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,878
Okay

285
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,847
The flu season?

286
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,317
Is it because of me?

287
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,653
Ms. Ahn

288
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,891
I'm sorry, I think it's because of me

289
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,329
Jay, what do you mean by that?

290
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,266
Ethan told me

291
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,502
His mom told him
not to hang out with me

292
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,638
What? Ethan's mom did?

293
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,342
They said I have two moms

294
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,812
But is that wrong?

295
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,216
This woman...

296
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,918
Is she crazy?

297
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,023
Even in this day and age,
there are moms who tell their kids

298
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,591
not to hang out with their friends?

299
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,527
Why can't we hang out with him?

300
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,728
I don't know

301
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,098
I was going to let it slide,
but she really crossed the line

302
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,535
Song

303
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,337
I'm sorry

304
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,207
What?

305
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,213
I lied that you're my mommy

306
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:19,585
If that's why people hate you...

307
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,286
Jay

308
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,392
That's not true

309
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,697
It's not because of you
It's because they're weird people

310
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,032
So, don't say that, okay?

311
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,671
Don't worry about it

312
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,108
It's the adult's business,
so we'll take care of it

313
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,010
But Song

314
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,381
I'm okay now

315
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,783
You don't have to be my mom anymore

316
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,089
I made lots of friends in Korea

317
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,391
I also have Grandma and Grandpa

318
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,493
I have an aunt, too

319
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,731
I'm not alone anymore, I'm fine

320
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,734
Of course

321
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,403
Jay isn't alone anymore, right?

322
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,872
You're not alone

323
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,142
Jay, you're not alone!

324
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,510
Jay!

325
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,716
This is so touching

326
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,853
Love you, guys

327
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,530
That's right
Hey, Chan-yang

328
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,067
I need your help

329
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,071
I better say something to the moms

330
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,639
I shouldn't let it slide like this

331
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,864
No

332
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,835
You should go with smokey eye makeup
and a tight skirt

333
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,538
Plus, stiletto heels

334
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,041
Hana, she might injure her knees
from wearing high heels

335
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,711
Plus, smokey eye makeup
is so outdated

336
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,747
I know, but Song-yi doesn't usually
go pick up Jay after class

337
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,383
If she's going to make her point
while picking Jay up,

338
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,652
dressing up will work best

339
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,689
The girl wearing smokey eye makeup
has the weakest mentality

340
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:42,194
These days, subtly showing off your wealth

341
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,295
while keeping it natural is the thing

342
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,964
Old-money look?

343
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:46,698
Yeah

344
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,333
Like this?

345
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,703
But the old-money look is
getting a bit old now

346
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,971
The latest trend is

347
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,639
the demure look

348
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,340
What?

349
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,411
Whether it's an old-money or a demure look,
what's the most important?

350
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,013
What completes fashion?
The face

351
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,387
What completes fashion?

352
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,292
Elousha moms will be surprised to see my
face all lifted up

353
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,696
What do you think?
Don't I look confident already?

354
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,864
Okay

355
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,166
The skin's moist enough

356
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,269
What's the most expensive bag you have?

357
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,504
Bag?

358
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:26,905
I don't know

359
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,807
I don't have much of a bag...

360
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,976
Go through Eun-gyu's closet

361
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,545
Handbag is the icing on the cake
of mom's fashion

362
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,922
The bag sure does the magic

363
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,860
What's wrong with her?

364
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,597
Your sister must make a lot of money

365
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,032
That's a super expensive bag

366
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,738
Hey, that bag is all you need

367
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,039
You don't need anything else

368
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,208
Really? Does it suit me?

369
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,009
Yeah

370
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,677
I should ask Eun-gyu if I can use it

371
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,448
But your outfit...

372
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,817
I'll bring clothes for you

373
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,617
- Okay
- Okay

374
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,852
- Yeah?
- Yeah

375
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,719
Well

376
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,692
You can stop now

377
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,531
Hello

378
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,977
Is Song-yi not here yet?

379
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,979
No

380
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,315
She'll be here soon

381
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,784
What brings you here?

382
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,389
To drink coffee, of course

383
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,892
Can I get an iced Americano, please?

384
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,527
Okay

385
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,196
Will you be drinking it here?

386
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,533
No

387
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:08,607
Here you go

388
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,591
Huh?

389
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,093
Aren't you...

390
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,196
Aren't you the one who got that
Brave Citizen Award?

391
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,797
Yes, hello

392
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,299
Hello

393
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,605
Thank you, Mr. Kim

394
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,673
I really appreciate it

395
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,141
You should go inside

396
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,253
So...

397
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,823
Are you here to see Song-yi?

398
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,660
Me? Why?

399
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,096
Well, you looked for Song-yi
as soon as you came in

400
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,498
So I figured

401
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,303
To be exact,

402
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,004
I came here to get coffee,

403
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:17,375
and it happens to be where
Song-yi works

404
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,548
You came all the way here,
but I'm sorry to break the news to you

405
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,817
You're not Song-yi's type

406
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,119
Me?

407
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,157
I never wanted to be Song-yi's type

408
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:37,295
She has a complicated...

409
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,063
I mean,

410
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,532
a very complicated

411
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,936
problem that we can't understand,
which I'm sure you don't know about

412
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,074
You seem to see things
however you want to

413
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,348
Do you have feelings for Song-yi?

414
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,816
Yes
What?

415
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:58,683
No

416
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,485
What are you doing right now?

417
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,587
Then, am I wrong?

418
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,996
I bet you don't know

419
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,366
That your eyes are blazing

420
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,367
I do know that

421
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,535
I have a very fierce gaze,

422
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,970
so I get that a lot

423
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,841
Women find that really uncomfortable

424
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,711
Well, I don't know how close you two are,

425
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,914
but isn't coming to her workplace like this
more uncomfortable?

426
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,631
You can't drink indoors
with the takeaway cup

427
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,034
I'm sorry

428
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,138
but I'd appreciate it
if you drink it outside the store

429
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,374
- Sure
- Yes

430
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,442
I'll do that

431
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,176
Okay

432
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,586
Oh, and about Song-yi

433
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,223
I wasn't sure if I should tell you,
but I think I should

434
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,160
She's very upset about

435
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,529
a groundless rumor
spreading in the neighborhood

436
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,267
Groundless rumor?

437
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,168
Yes

438
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,106
I can't give you any more details

439
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,174
Have a good day

440
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,409
What groundless rumor?

441
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,725
Groundless rumor?

442
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,394
What...

443
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,065
He acts like he knows everything

444
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:54,933
Huh?

445
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,402
Hello, Mr. Cha

446
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,919
What's the occasion?

447
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,222
What do you mean?

448
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,759
You look somewhat...

449
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,334
I'm going to talk to the moms today

450
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,003
Hana and Chan-yang said
I should dress up like this

451
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:32,971
Is it weird?

452
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,809
No, it's not weird

453
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,183
I just...

454
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,729
Just what?

455
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:05,470
I just like your natural look better

456
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,274
What I mean is...

457
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,644
If I had to choose,
I prefer the natural look

458
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,145
I see

459
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,246
Yes

460
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:32,730
Hello

461
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,705
He sounded very supportive of you

462
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,673
Yes

463
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,743
It seems like he's been swayed
by the rumor...

464
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,180
I felt like I needed to get the record
straight, so I gave him a hint

465
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,117
Although it seems like he didn't get it

466
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,661
I'll see you around

467
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,202
What was that?

468
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,872
He likes my natural look?

469
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,476
Is he telling me to go around
looking scruffy?

470
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,878
What a weird personality

471
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:00,818
Jay's mom?

472
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,021
Is that Jay's mom?

473
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,322
Oh my gosh

474
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,730
What brings you here?

475
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,867
It's been a while since you
came to pick the kids up from kindergarten

476
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,402
I know

477
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,404
Jay usually takes the van

478
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,140
Oh, well...

479
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,009
I wanted to pick Jay up

480
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,211
and also chat with you guys

481
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,614
You told me last time

482
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,183
that it's important for moms
to share information

483
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,422
There's a rumor in the neighborhood

484
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,925
that I have a wife

485
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,761
Really?

486
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,331
Oh my gosh, that's unbelievable

487
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,700
Did you know about it?

488
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,468
Huh?

489
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,307
Yes, I did...

490
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,644
Is that why you didn't come to the cafe?

491
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,114
You encouraged a boycott against our cafe
on the Cheonpo online mom community

492
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,850
That's not true

493
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,785
We have nothing to do with the boycott

494
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,389
I have no idea what you're saying

495
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,027
You're so shameless

496
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,164
Aren't you the one who opened
the new group chat, Ethan's mom?

497
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,674
I did

498
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:34,178
But I told them

499
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,515
that we shouldn't be so conservative

500
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:43,688
There are different kinds of people
in this global world

501
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,859
So, we should accept it with an open heart

502
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,828
You said that?

503
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,330
When?

504
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,832
I don't remember

505
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,168
Anyway

506
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,438
I was just worried about the kids,

507
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,573
so I added a few comments

508
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,675
Simply out of concern for the kids

509
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,512
It's only natural since we're moms

510
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,116
What's so wrong about that?

511
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,120
What are you worried about?

512
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,326
Get a life, Ethan's mom

513
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,630
Stop going around talking about
other people's life

514
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,568
What did you say?

515
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,271
Jay's mom

516
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,807
That's a bit harsh

517
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,410
I'm not Jay's mom

518
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,883
I'm Jay's aunt

519
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,724
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier

520
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,297
I came to pick Jay up today
to tell you in person

521
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,304
I got divorced, although I'd like to
say that I've called off the engagement

522
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,939
Also, I don't own the cafe

523
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,110
So, stop encouraging boycotts
on the online mom community

524
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,712
Jay's mom

525
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,882
I mean, Jay's aunt

526
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,319
We really didn't start the boycott

527
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,856
One more thing, my family,
my younger sister Eun-gyu

528
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,959
and I are happy raising Jay together

529
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,094
So, watch what you say about us...

530
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,262
You...

531
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,968
Mommy!

532
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,002
Terrible ladies

533
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,106
- Bye
- See you tomorrow

534
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,008
- See you tomorrow
- Bye

535
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,543
Bye, Teacher

536
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,978
Bye!

537
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,082
Song, I drew my family today

538
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,091
Great job

539
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,702
They must've been shocked
People around us were looking at me

540
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,639
Their jaws dropped

541
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,340
You're exaggerating

542
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,743
Didn't you see it earlier?
Ethan's mom was like...

543
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,677
She was surprised

544
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,212
She kept staring at my bag

545
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,280
Right, right

546
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,716
You're so cool, Song-yi

547
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,285
Did you really tell them that?

548
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,721
So, instead of saying,
"You terrible witches!"

549
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,456
You said, "You terrible ladies"?

550
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,559
Yes, she did...

551
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,061
I can't swear in front of the kindergarten

552
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,301
Song-yi

553
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,836
I think I've changed

554
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,806
When I hugged the kids last time,

555
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,143
I loved how cozy and warm it felt

556
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,445
This is so touching

557
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,480
Love you, guys

558
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,650
And when I see you guys,

559
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,653
it looks like every minute of your life
is far from boring

560
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,289
Maybe...

561
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,592
I should have a kid

562
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,799
Because you're bored?

563
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,000
You want to have a baby?

564
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,368
What's wrong with that?

565
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,037
People say they're so happy
when they have kids

566
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,008
I just want to feel that happiness, too

567
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,243
Hey

568
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,278
Do you think happiness
is all there is to it?

569
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,814
You can't use the bathroom
when you want to,

570
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,316
and you can't even walk in the direction
you want to

571
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,318
You'll completely lose your freedom

572
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,588
People like me who have weak stamina
will have bags under their eyes

573
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,490
I read it somewhere

574
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,860
4-year-old kids with lots of energy
tend to walk about 7km each day

575
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,830
That's good! It'll be like a workout

576
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,498
I think it'll be fun

577
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,936
Do you seriously think that way?

578
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,104
Yes

579
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,172
I got curious

580
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:56,807
A life with a kid

581
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,410
And...

582
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,781
I'm curious about how the baby will
look like if it takes after us

583
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,650
Aren't you a DINK?

584
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,052
I thought you were a DINK, too

585
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,020
Me too

586
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm not

587
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,290
I've never said that I'm a DINK

588
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,373
Hey

589
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,547
Honey

590
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,682
Yeah?

591
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,356
Honey, what should I do?

592
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,757
Honey, I'm...

593
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,859
I'm always ready

594
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,128
I sure am ready!
Just tell me anytime

595
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,031
Should we...

596
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,370
have a baby?

597
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,073
What?

598
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,409
Baby?

599
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:06,711
Yeah

600
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,783
All of a sudden?

601
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,251
Yes

602
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,893
But I thought...

603
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,663
you didn't want to have a baby

604
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,998
That you're scared of being pregnant
and going into labor

605
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,569
That you didn't want to share
my love with the baby

606
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,804
and you're not confident
about raising the kid well

607
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,640
So, although we're not exactly
a DINK couple,

608
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,678
I thought we were not that eager about
having a kid

609
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,249
My thoughts haven't changed
about that stuff

610
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,252
But...

611
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,388
I'm curious

612
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:52,990
About what?

613
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,959
The baby that looks like us

614
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,666
Well...

615
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,737
I bet they'll look beautiful

616
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,067
This is a perfect beer snack

617
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,711
Song-yi

618
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,947
Why didn't you tell me?

619
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,715
Huh? About what?

620
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,751
Jay told me

621
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,352
That something happened at the kindergarten

622
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,689
I asked Hana

623
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,358
and she said there's a weird rumor
about you and me

624
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,562
Is that why you wanted
to borrow my bag?

625
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,097
Oh, that

626
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,236
(Never mind)

627
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,639
(If I tell her honestly,
it will only upset Eun-gyu)

628
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,107
Don't worry

629
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,609
It's been taken care of

630
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,813
Didn't you say you have
something to tell me?

631
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:26,717
Right

632
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,420
I do have something to tell you

633
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:31,956
Should I join you for a drink?

634
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,695
Is it related to Jay?

635
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,303
(Taylor: Please forgive me, Eun-gyu
I miss you)

636
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,114
I have a stomachache

637
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,316
Can we talk later?

638
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,417
What?

639
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,552
Yeah

640
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,872
Taylor?

641
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,510
Is Taylor Jay's dad?

642
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,182
(We all have secrets)

643
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,026
(Some secrets)

644
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,897
(are better shared than kept
because it makes you feel relieved)

645
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,194
I guess she read the message

646
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,566
I was going to tell her

647
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,770
(But some secrets can't be shared
even with your family)

648
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:32,309
(Or, they can't be shared because
they're family)

649
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,646
(A secret that you want to keep
hidden from others)

650
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,415
(because you don't want
anyone to find out)

651
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,382
(Is raising kids really
not worth the effort?)

652
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,884
(Do you think babies are lovely?
Are you happy? For real?)

653
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:14,952
(Do I need to know that happiness?)

654
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:15,919
(How many times a month...)

655
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,090
Mr. Cha

656
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,828
Do you think married couples
should have kids?

657
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,031
I mean, do humans need kids?

658
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,334
I guess there's something special about it,

659
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,470
considering that my sister had
a baby without a husband

660
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,076
Is this about a case?

661
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,746
No, I was just asking

662
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,286
What about...

663
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,655
you?

664
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,725
Did you want to have a kid?

665
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,997
My opinion doesn't matter

666
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,767
I should decide after
discussing it with my wife

667
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,372
If my wife doesn't want to have a kid,

668
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,207
I'm fine with being a DINK

669
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,051
Why?

670
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,656
It's not like the purpose of marriage
is to have kids, right?

671
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,793
Well, that's true

672
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,163
That was unexpected of you

673
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,499
What do you mean?

674
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,268
What about you, then, Song-yi?

675
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,677
I've never thought about it in detail

676
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,583
But if there hadn't been
any special event in my life,

677
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:56,553
I guess I might've had a kid, too

678
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,993
I didn't know my life
would turn out this way

679
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,035
So what?

680
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,372
It's not over for us

681
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,348
Don't you think so?

682
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,752
You never know how life will turn out

683
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,291
Right

684
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,914
Be honest with me
You drift apart with your husband, right?

685
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,950
No

686
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,618
Not really

687
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,154
It's just that the relationship
kind of changes

688
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,357
When we don't have a kid,
it feels like we're still dating

689
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,992
If there's a kid...

690
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:10,828
It's kind of like a camaraderie

691
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:13,997
Camaraderie?

692
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,703
Will that work for me and Jin-ho?

693
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,607
What about you?

694
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,475
Why did you want to have a kid?

695
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,144
What?

696
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,080
I don't know

697
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,182
I just wanted to have a baby

698
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,083
Really?

699
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,651
That's it?

700
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,421
Yes, I wanted to have a kid

701
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,225
I just think it's a human instinct

702
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,327
Well, it is a crazy decision

703
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,930
You can never go back to the life
you had before

704
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,605
But do I have to stay here?
I just came back from work

705
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:58,542
Please stay
It's really important for me

706
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,613
I'm trying to hear from
as many moms as possible

707
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:08,452
Especially you, since you had Jay
from a sperm donor

708
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,493
What about you?

709
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,262
Why did you want a third baby?

710
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,697
Because you became pregnant
and you had no choice?

711
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,266
No

712
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:26,136
At the end of the day,
people have kids because they're lovely

713
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,437
Lovely?

714
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,573
You should have your own kid
Then, you'll know what I mean

715
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:35,279
People say how hard it is to raise
a child, but they all have kids

716
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,016
You can explain how hard it is,

717
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,818
but you can't explain why
you have the baby

718
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,387
That's true

719
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,389
They sure are lovely

720
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,595
What about you?

721
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:54,865
Me?

722
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,935
What about me?
I'm just sitting here quietly

723
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,863
You know

724
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,735
About what I said on Mom's 60th birthday

725
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,978
That there's a guy I used to date
back in the States

726
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,847
That guy

727
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,851
He's...

728
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,424
Never mind

729
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,694
I should go take a shower

730
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,363
Eun-gyu

731
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,274
I want you to know that
I'm very proud of you

732
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,611
You're much of a grown-up than I am

733
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,984
I thought you were so little,
but you grew up and became a mom

734
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:28,725
I think what you chose to do
is very brave

735
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,961
It's not something anyone can do

736
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,267
So cheer up

737
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,775
Thanks

738
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,313
I just thought I was being too selfish

739
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,583
I couldn't even handle it on my own

740
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:58,321
and I'm making things hard
for you and Jay

741
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,658
Thanks to you, I'm living
as Jay's mom in Cheonpo

742
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,396
So, you can tell me

743
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,966
whenever you feel ready

744
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:12,936
Whatever it is

745
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,808
What kind of a relationship is that?

746
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,743
How weird

747
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,280
One man and two women?
That's just not right

748
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,048
They must be crazy

749
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,986
Honey, they must be out of their minds

750
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,223
It's so weird

751
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,357
Stop looking

752
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,292
People who don't know us

753
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,363
will think of us as
that strange couple in a soap opera

754
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,501
Me and my husband
and his ex-girlfriend at an OB/GYN

755
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,303
Chan-yang, are you enjoying this?

756
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,238
Yes

757
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,340
Can you keep it down?

758
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,444
Why are you here?

759
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:29,713
Me?

760
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,548
I'm...

761
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,367

00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,469
(Please?)

763
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,905
(If you come with us,
we might get discounts)

764
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:03,446
(Chan-yang)

765
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:10,387
I see

767
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,731
Please come inside

768
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:22,999
Good luck

(Wiz OB/GYN Director
Jung Ji-yoon)

770
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:37,380
How long have you been married?

771
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:39,716
Three years

772
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,753
Do you have any problems in bed?

773
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,755
Any difficulties with the intercourse?

774
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:49,559
I didn't expect you to ask
questions like that

775
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,331
That was so direct

776
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,801
I...

777
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,407
If you can't tell your doctor
about your sexual relationship

778
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,910
how can I give you advice?

779
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,412
Oh, that's right

780
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,714
Yes, okay

781
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,351
(Saturday, November 30, 2 times
7 pts (28 min), 9 pts (33 min))

(43 min), 9 pts (31 min), 7 pts (29 min))

783
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,054
Honey, did you score them?

784
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:21,591
The most recent one was done today
at 1 a.m.

785
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,827
So, it's about 9 hours ago

786
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,029
While taking a shower
In the heat of the moment

787
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:30,400
Also, we did it twice last Saturday

788
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,836
Once very quickly
and once very romantically

789
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,771
And last month,

790
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,742
we did it on this day, this day,
and this day

791
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,777
And...

792
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,345
I see

793
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,481
You've put in a lot of effort

794
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,620
But have you taken a prenatal test?

795
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,090
A prenatal test?

796
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:59,496
It's a test to check if you're healthy
enough to become pregnant

797
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:03,633
We test the wife's vagina
and the husband's sperm quality

798
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,738
Sperm quality test?

799
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:14,010
Then, let's talk after you take the tests

800
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:16,546
Okay

801
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:30,393
(If I can lift 500kg...)

802
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,063
(It doesn't matter if you can lift 500kg)

803
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,230
(Quit smoking and drinking)

804
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,299
(Are you sure you can lift 500kg?)

805
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,401
(If you have time to write,
go see a doctor)

806
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,911
What are you so happy about?

807
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,647
I don't know

808
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,582
It's kind of fun

809
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,424
Don't cry

810
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,660
- It's all right
- Kim Mi-young, please come in

811
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,931
It's okay, let's get some rest
and try again when you're healthy

812
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,165
It's okay

813
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:12,769
It's okay, honey

814
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:14,838
Let's go

815
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:17,841
It's okay

816
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:31,621
Is it over?

817
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,455
Yes

818
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,624
I asked about freezing my eggs

819
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,525
You?

820
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,329
I need to gather them
before I take the test

821
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,264
Gather?

822
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:43,833
Gather what?

823
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,872
I did it with Chan-yang today,
so I can't take the test

824
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,045
Song-yi

825
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,782
I'm worried about something

826
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:01,418
What if...

827
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,054
What if my sperm are not healthy?

828
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,391
Will my buddies,
I mean, my sperm be all right?

829
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,826
Perhaps you might have
an answer to this

830
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,694
Stop, stop, enough with the counseling

831
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,696
Hey

832
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,932
Go ask the doctor

833
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:20,203
Don't

834
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,738
Don't do that, stop

835
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,385
Having a baby

836
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,591
It must be very important
for some people

837
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:45,361
You know

838
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:50,033
Maybe I've thought of it too easily

839
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,141
You've suddenly become mature

840
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,076

00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,483
Should me and my husband
also consider an IVF?

843
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:13,056
We tried to get pregnant
for a few months

844
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,225
but it wasn't easy

845
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:16,793
Why?

846
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,795
It's just...

847
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,331

849
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,442
So many people are getting divorced

850
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,481
When I first got here, I thought
only newlyweds lived in Cheonpo

851
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,917
I didn't know there were
so many couples going through a divorce

852
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:43,586
Well

853
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:47,590
People usually announce their wedding,
but not their divorce

854
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,961
They probably had no idea back then

855
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:03,840
What about you?

856
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:10,780
Are you thinking of getting married again?

857
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,221
Are you trying to slack off?

858
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,457
No, I've done this much already

859
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,493
It's a short break

860
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,796
Can't we even talk?
We're working in the same room

861
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,466
No

862
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,236
I'll say no to that

863
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,338
I've done it once

864
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,973
I've had enough

865
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,343
I'm done with it

866
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,654

Sorry?

but you could start a relationship

Where do I put the files
that have been organized?

883
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,590
You can put it with the files
at the very top

884
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,167
There are so many of them

885
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,104
Wait, let me help you

886
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:16,739

Who is he having an affair with?

I just can't think of anyone

893
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,360

but I only found his coworkers

You like Song-yi, don't you?

897
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:53,970

and getting all angry
