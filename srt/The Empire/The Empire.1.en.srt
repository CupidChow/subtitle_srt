My manager said I had an offer to be an MC at a book concert.

I thought, "Why would they want an A-list MC like me?"

6
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:16,323
I wondered if selling these books would be enough to cover my fee.

That's what I thought.

So that's why I'm here today.

But after looking at the atmosphere here...

17

and the scale of the press today,

18
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:45,693
this event is bigger than a concert of a top idol group.

20

that he's announcing his presidential candidacy today?

Don't tell me I was the only one who was kept in the dark. Okay.

arbitrary investigation of Jusung is legitimate?

It's not an arbitrary investigation. It's an independent investigation.

Let me ask you again.

105

The vice chairman of Jusung, the target of this investigation,

106

is Prosecutor Han's sister's husband.

In other words, he's her brother-in-law.

As this wasn't an easy decision,

That's a compliment to the professor's taste.

- He's the one who picked it out. - Really?

I have no interest in fashion.

158

I don't have time for it either.

He tells me to dress better and buys me clothes.

160
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,402
And I comply and wear them...

161

because I don't want him to nag me.

00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,202
He coordinates all of my outfits.

163
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:08,013
You have one more charm to add to your list.

164
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:10,812
Are you trying to appeal...

165
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,852
to your students with your charms, not with your class?

166
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:14,982
Didn't you know?

167
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,952
Students don't take his class for the content.

168
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:21,192
We take his class because he's teaching it.

169
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,903
I can understand that. Everyone has similar tastes.

170
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,872
I must consider you a property of the public...

171
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:38,043
as long as it's for the welfare of the people.

172
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,643
I can't let my jealousy get the better of me.

173
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:44,183
I want to have a marriage just like yours, Mother.

174
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,782
I have to prepare for the legal clinic after the concert.

175
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:49,851
So I'll be late.

176
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,423
- Again? - Yes.

177
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:55,192
You're in charge of the case, Professor Na. You're coming, right?

178
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:58,923
Well,

179
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,231
after the concert...

180
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:04,403
Sorry. I can't let you have him tonight.

181
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,672
The ownership is clear here.

182
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:09,202
We can't seem to argue otherwise.

183
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:12,602
They're so happy together.

184
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:17,582
All good.

185
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,752
Look at her, acting so snobby.

186
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:23,753
Goodness.

187
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:27,522
How can a mere senior prosecutor treat...

188
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,592
the senior presidential secretary as if she's better than him?

189
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:32,763
Instead of saying hello to me, she just stood there.

190
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,162
How dare she walk over to her son the moment he beckoned to her?

191
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:36,933
You know she thinks she's a princess.

192
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,902
She basically wants us to get permission for an audience.

193
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,933
Princess, my foot.

194
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,972
She's just acting arrogant because of her dad.

195
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,672
Both of them are going after Jusung...

196
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:48,242
and making a huge scene.

197
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:50,742
And I can't face the president because of that.

198
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,013
The president of the university...

199
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:54,382
and the Prosecutor General can't stop them either, right?

200
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:57,023
That's why this is driving me crazy.

201
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:00,451
Think about it. Her own sister is married to the Jusung family.

202
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:02,292
What is she trying to do right now?

203
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,622
It's because her sister is married to the Jusung family.

204
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,462
What?

205
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,432
A prosecutor who doesn't even go easy...

206
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,263
on her in-laws or her brother-in-law.

207
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:15,773
And the good-looking and smart husband defends her...

208
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,403
in the eye of the law. He's the perfect husband.

209
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:22,112
He's sexy, isn't he?

210
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,683
How's that going to help anyone?

211
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,283
You saw the approval ratings...

212
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,952
for Na Geun Woo as a presidential candidate.

213
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,052
He has no experience in politics.

214
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,451
And he's never shown any interest in candidacy.

215
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,452
But that's the number he got.

216
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,422
The approval ratings can't be held seriously.

217
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,362
It's just a popularity vote.

218
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:38,793
The public has no idea what politics is.

219
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:41,263
Because they're going after the conglomerate, Jusung,

220
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,462
people think that justice is being served...

221
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,731
and they will protect the powerless from injustices.

222
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:47,003
That's what they think.

223
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:50,371
But the public has no idea that once these prosecutors resign,

224
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,742
they do everything to satisfy their greed.

225
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:55,112
In a way, this is for the better...

226
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,212
that they seem perfect and noble.

227
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,053
What do you mean?

228
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,923
That kind of reputation will backfire later...

229
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:06,522
because people will not be so willing...

230
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,692
to forgive the smallest flaws at times like this.

231
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:26,913
(Seoul Symphony Orchestra, The 23rd Concert)

232
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,652
Let me make a call and use the restroom.

233
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:41,851
Is it urgent?

234
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:45,322
Yes. It's for my column. They must have a lot to edit.

235
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:47,952
- You should go call them then. - Sorry.

236
00:16:58,332 --> 00:16:59,403
Hello?

237
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,872
Why did you call me at this number?

238
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,702
I thought you would only have this phone with you now.

239
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,971
Exactly. Why? Is something wrong?

240
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:10,012
They didn't open up the seats on the third floor,

241
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,013
so the restroom on that floor will be empty.

242
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:17,023
- What are you implying? - The women's room.

243
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,022
There's only one women's room on the third floor.

244
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:20,492
I'll wait for you there.

245
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,023
If you don't hurry, you'll miss the second part.

246
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,553
Where are you going?

247
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,053
Isn't it obvious?

248
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,851
Are you going to the bathroom,

249
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,852
full of people, in that dress?

250
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:03,463
I'm saying this out of my affection for you.

251
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:06,023
I must protect your classy image.

252
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:07,592
Use the one on the third floor.

253
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,733
No one is in that restroom.

254
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,402
Is that so? Should I do that then?

255
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,003
I'll go with you then.

256
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,233
- Thanks. - Don't mention it.

257
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:48,601
You see, I just can't believe that you are...

258
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:49,973
Kang Baek's mother.

259
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,172
I swear you look like his older sister.

260
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:55,112
You're putting me on a pedestal.

261
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,713
I mean it.

262
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,753
I didn't know you liked shopping that much.

263
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:09,652
It will be over soon like an interview.

264
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:12,563
I'll be training in the field soon. Get me an outfit.

265
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:13,763
Okay.

266
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:16,132
Come to the legal clinic today.

267
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:18,563
I can't do that.

268
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,432
- Come. - I'll think about it.

269
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:21,703
I said, come.

270
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:27,743
I'll be a little late.

271
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:30,142
That's my man.

272
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,943
- Ma'am, it's almost time. - Oh,

273
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:41,513
okay.

274
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,232
- Older Mi Ja. - Yes?

275
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,132
- Put this on a plate. - Yes, ma'am.

276
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:05,401
- Younger Mi Ja. - Yes?

277
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:07,543
- Have this ready to go. - Yes, ma'am.

278
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,313
- Chef Kim. - Yes?

279
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:15,912
Mother prefers to have her oboktang hot. Don't forget that.

280
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,121
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:19,053
She mentioned carrot juice.

282
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:20,621
Did the carrots arrive from Jeju?

283
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,621
Yes, early in the morning today.

284
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,022
She needs to drink it before breakfast.

285
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,322
Oh, sure. I'll have it ready right away.

286
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,733
Make one more glass for my husband.

287
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:31,431
Serve him a scone...

288
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:33,572
and compote to have with it too.

289
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:34,832
Sure thing.

290
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:00,892
This is the schedule after breakfast.

291
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,572
- Good morning, Mom. - Did you stay up all night again?

292
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:17,283
- Well... - It's going to damage your skin.

293
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,682
- Good morning, kids. - Good morning, Grandma.

294
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,181
Did you have a good night?

295
00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:23,453
Yes, thank you for asking.

296
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:27,392
Grandma, why must we have breakfast this early?

297
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:31,062
Because everyone has to go to work early.

298
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:33,362
But I go to school, not work.

299
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:34,992
And it's way before time.

300
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:37,063
We've got to see each other before going to work.

301
00:23:37,932 --> 00:23:39,733
We can see each other on the weekends.

302
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:42,871
Family members see each other every day.

303
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:44,773
Oh, please.

304
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:48,612
I think it's about time you got used to this, princess.

305
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:50,612
Good morning.

306
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:52,882
- Go on in. - Okay.

307
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:57,852
I'm not late, am I?

308
00:23:58,382 --> 00:23:59,983
- The zipper. - Oh, my.

309
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,662
Goodness, my pumpkins.

310
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:11,162
- Good morning. - Good morning.

311
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:15,631
Mother, your skin looks so fair today.

312
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:16,703
Really?

313
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:19,871
Maybe it's thanks to the herbal skin product you got me last week.

314
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,813
Apply enough. I'll get you more before you run out of it.

315
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:23,983
Thank you.

316
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,342
It seemed effective,

317
00:24:26,513 --> 00:24:28,712
so I was thinking of applying a lot on my neck and hands anyway.

318
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:31,821
Then why don't you apply some on your feet too?

319
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:33,652
I can't do that.

320
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,792
It costs 1,000 dollars per product.

321
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:36,793
Mother.

322
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:39,293
Apply it on your feet too.

323
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,693
Now I'm embarrassed, honey.

324
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,832
Let us pray.

325
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:50,773
"Do not boast about tomorrow,"

326
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:53,942
"for you do not know..."

327
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,872
"what a day may bring forth."

328
00:24:56,713 --> 00:24:58,841
"Let someone else praise you,"

329
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:01,112
"and not your own mouth."

330
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,681
"Let an outsider praise you,"

331
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:06,253
"and not your own lips."

332
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,223
Proverbs 27.

333
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:13,422
Dear Almighty, please let us not be full of arrogance...

334
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:18,932
and protect us so that we can follow your words in life.

335
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:25,203
Thank you for this food you've given us with grace.

336
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:27,513
- Amen. - Amen.

337
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:35,712
"Dear brothers and sisters,"

338
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:38,882
"honor those who are your leaders in the Lord's work."

339
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:43,193
"They work hard among you and give you spiritual guidance."

340
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:47,432
"Show them great respect and wholehearted love..."

341
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:49,292
"because of their work."

342
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:52,463
"And live peacefully with each other."

343
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:58,803
To the place up high

344
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:03,513
I take a step every day

345
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:08,412
All my intentions and efforts

346
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:13,523
I pray every day

347
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,023
- My Lord - Hey!

348
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:20,332
How dare you! Enough is enough.

349
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:22,533
My patience is worn out.

350
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:25,632
Keep it down, will you?

351
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:27,272
Judge Han.

352
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:29,832
Mom, she's a total nutjob.

353
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:32,472
How dare she mess with Jusung? They're our in-laws!

354
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,612
It's not a bad idea because they are our in-laws.

355
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:38,982
No, it's actually better that they are our in-laws.

356
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:40,282
Grandpa.

357
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:41,882
You are a judge after all,

358
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,252
being so inflexible.

359
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,993
I thought our rule was not to talk about business with family.

360
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:48,793
And I think that's only right.

361
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:52,862
Mom, look at how she behaves.

362
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:55,193
Dad.

363
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:57,732
Why did you marry me off into the Jusung family?

364
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,331
It wasn't only for my sake.

365
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:02,732
Judge Han, calm down and sit down first.

366
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,743
Mom. How do you expect me to calm down now?

367
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,371
I came all the way here despite the busy schedule today.

368
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:10,682
Because my in-laws kept giving me the eye.

369
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:12,283
I got chewed out!

370
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:15,953
Sorry. I have no leisure to look after your in-laws.

371
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:20,121
Lucky you. You don't have to mind your in-laws...

372
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:22,321
thanks to your husband who is almost an orphan.

373
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:23,352
Right.

374
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:25,862
He's a perfect guy.

375
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,432
Hold your horses.

376
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:28,931
I know how you feel.

377
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:32,033
But how about taking a deep breath first?

378
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:33,602
This is enough.

379
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:37,203
Don't ask for trouble.

380
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:38,773
Who do you think you are?

381
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:45,882
A prosecutor.

382
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:55,622
Hye Ryul, let's take it easy.

383
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:57,892
Then will you be my white knight?

384
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:02,362
- Go, Han Hye Ryul. - Go, Han Hye Ryul.

385
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:05,332
- Go, Han Hye Ryul. - Go, Han Hye Ryul.

386
00:28:05,662 --> 00:28:08,372
- Go, Han Hye Ryul. - Go, Han Hye Ryul.

387
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:14,612
Dear my seniors, juniors, and colleagues.

388
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,412
I realize something as I get older.

389
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,912
I, Han Hye Ryul,

390
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:23,682
sure am a butcher.

391
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:27,553
- So... - Say no more.

392
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:30,962
You don't know what I will say next.

393
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:33,723
I think I already know, so save it, you brat.

394
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:38,932
Oh, I guess you've been reported right away.

395
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:43,003
This is why people say prosecutors are conglomerates' dogs.

396
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:53,852
Hey.

397
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:56,152
How dare you...

398
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,682
raise your voice at me?

399
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:02,422
And are you acting up because your father has your back?

400
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:06,523
You came right at my weakness.

401
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:09,631
Whatever I do, you want others to see it...

402
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:12,533
as a troublemaker pulling her father's strings, don't you?

403
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:14,901
But I believe you pull his strings...

404
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:16,972
more than I do.

405
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,642
So let's drink and decide.

406
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:22,313
The loser will give in.

407
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,513
Hey.

408
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:30,552
I'm quite experienced in this.

409
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:32,953
It's what made me come this far.

410
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:36,322
Okay.

411
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:41,263
If you win, I'll support you with something very cool.

412
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:44,432
You need a promotion, don't you?

413
00:29:44,902 --> 00:29:47,601
Someone even got a chief prosecutor title with this.

414
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:48,973
A promotion as what, a deputy chief?

415
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:52,572
Okay, all right.

416
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:54,542
Try out for a chief prosecutor title.

417
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,513
I think you can make it.

418
00:29:58,283 --> 00:29:59,283
It's possible.

419
00:29:59,284 --> 00:30:01,152
If drinking this will get me there...

420
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:23,572
Nice!

421
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:27,172
I'll aim all the way up to a prosecutor general title.

422
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:41,152
I won't mess with Jusung.

423
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:43,723
I promise.

424
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:59,242
- Bottoms up. - Bottoms up.

425
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:01,742
- Bottoms up. - Bottoms up.

426
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:03,242
- Bottoms up. - Drink it

427
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:04,812
- All the way - All the way

428
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:06,212
Drink it

429
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:07,752
- All the way - All the way

430
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,952
- Bottoms up. - Bottoms up.

431
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,753
- Bottoms up. - Bottoms up.

432
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:20,831
Let me down.

433
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,262
- This way. - No, I can drink more.

434
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:24,962
- Goodbye. - Gosh.

435
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,732
- Let's go. - Goodbye!

436
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:27,872
- Hey. - Goodness.

437
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:31,641
- Let me down. - Goodness.

438
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,303
I said I...

439
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:36,871
- All right. - Why did you...

440
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:38,783
Everyone, attention.

441
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:41,753
Right this moment.

442
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:43,652
- Right this moment. - Right this moment.

443
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:47,081
I have been called upon by the nation and its people.

444
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:48,522
- I have been called upon... - I have been called upon...

445
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:50,151
- by the nation and its people. - by the nation and its people.

446
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:53,591
I have taken the honor to be a prosecutor of Korea.

447
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,331
- I have taken the honor... - I have taken the honor...

448
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,992
- to be a prosecutor of Korea. - to be a prosecutor of Korea.

449
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:58,732
As a public servant,

450
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,033
I shall uphold justice and human rights.

451
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,002
- As a public servant, - As a public servant,

452
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,071
- I shall uphold... - I shall uphold...

453
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:05,171
- justice and human rights. - justice and human rights.

454
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:09,672
I shall protect my neighbors and community from criminal acts.

455
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:11,581
- I shall protect my neighbors... - I shall protect my neighbors...

456
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:14,753
- and community from criminal acts. - and community from criminal acts.

457
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:16,382
This darn heavy duty...

458
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:19,621
has been given to me.

459
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:20,622
- This darn heavy duty... - This darn heavy duty...

460
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:23,292
- has been given to me. - has been given to me.

461
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:24,391
Let's go!

462
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,362
- Let's go! - Let's go!

463
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:31,632
Yes!

464
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:33,932
Yes!

465
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:42,443
I'm acting up because my father has my back?

466
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:44,813
Hey, it's so...

467
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,953
What's wrong with you all?

468
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,321
Since when did we go by the law...

469
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:55,392
that you're acting so true to the law?

470
00:32:56,723 --> 00:32:58,693
Has anything worked out by the law?

471
00:32:59,763 --> 00:33:02,493
No, and that's why people hire lawyers.

472
00:33:04,203 --> 00:33:06,932
Dear lawyers, let's not be like this.

473
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:09,432
Our purpose is the sales.

474
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:13,303
Have a business mind, not a legal mind.

475
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:25,253
Our university's purpose is simple.

476
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,793
An honorable admission and graduation.

477
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,723
A law school strictly for those qualified.

478
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,161
An alma mater...

479
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:35,993
which makes everyone envious.

480
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:40,102
That is why we rake in scholarships from Jusung Foundation...

481
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:43,533
and provide our professors with the best benefits.

482
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:46,273
But we're second in terms of the bar exam pass rate?

483
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:51,612
Why couldn't you do a better job?

484
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:55,553
The law school of MINGUK UNIVERSITY...

485
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,553
Everyone knows what it is,

486
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,953
but no one actually focuses on the details...

487
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,763
of "The Last Judgment" right here.

488
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:08,091
At the age of 61,

489
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:10,902
Michelangelo spent six years to complete this masterpiece.

490
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:13,303
In 1517,

491
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:16,671
To warn the confusing times and the Christian society...

492
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,943
which was corrupted enough to cause the Protestant Reformation,

493
00:34:19,243 --> 00:34:22,743
Pope Paul III made certain decisions and they're included in this.

494
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,881
It portrays the seriousness of the corruption at that time...

495
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:28,713
as it criticizes the corrupted society.

496
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:32,023
Once again,

497
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:35,293
it was the year 1517.

498
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:39,262
Now after 500 years,

499
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:42,092
has anything changed from then?

500
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:43,662
What do you think?

501
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:48,973
Everyone says history shows development.

502
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:52,642
Technology made surprising changes to human life.

503
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:56,412
But crimes, punishments, and legal irregularities...

504
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,782
haven't changed much from what Josef K faced in the novel,

505
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:03,212
"The Trial" written by Kafka, 100 years ago.

506
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:04,582
Is this too much of a leap to say?

507
00:35:05,682 --> 00:35:06,782
I am...

508
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:09,153
ignorant about the law.

509
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,122
It's true.

510
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:15,331
When I was a judge, there wasn't even once...

511
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:18,602
that everyone agreed to my ruling with satisfaction.

512
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:22,472
Instead, all of them said it was unfair.

513
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:24,472
They wanted to kill me.

514
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:26,302
They called me names.

515
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:31,882
So I looked things up again to see if I made a mistake...

516
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:33,213
in applying the law.

517
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,812
Before we get started, let me tell you something.

518
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:40,082
I mean, to put it professionally, let me "confess" something.

519
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,523
Like I just said, first,

520
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,063
I'm ignorant about the law.

521
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:48,931
So my lectures won't be of practical help...

522
00:35:48,932 --> 00:35:52,532
to law graduate students preparing for their bar exam.

523
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:54,732
"This question comes out frequently."

524
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:57,573
"This was from a mock exam. That was from a bar exam."

525
00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:00,641
I won't be focusing on past exam questions.

526
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:01,642
All right.

527
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:05,343
Get up and leave if you want.

528
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:09,352
Secondly,

529
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:13,023
I'm a feminist.

530
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:20,462
And according to the oldies' beliefs and logic,

531
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:22,532
I'm a communist.

532
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:28,072
Hence, I do not think the law and judges are sacred...

533
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:29,173
at all.

534
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,173
You're cool.

535
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:35,641
We still need fair laws for women,

536
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:39,682
the disabled, the LGBTIQ, and the socially vulnerable.

537
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:43,282
No laws, no judges are sacred...

538
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:45,222
and perfect.

539
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,463
Let me promise you one thing.

540
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:57,802
A way to think like a judicial officer.

541
00:36:58,202 --> 00:37:01,472
In short, a way to think logically with a legal mindset.

542
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,233
As a law student myself,

543
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,273
I'll study and figure it out together with you during my class.

544
00:37:18,952 --> 00:37:21,693
We talked about the conditions of punishment based on...

545
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:23,293
(Conditions of punishment)

546
00:37:28,432 --> 00:37:29,463
Focus!

547
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:35,273
Turn to page 138.

548
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,602
The issue regarding applying the accomplice rule.

549
00:37:39,742 --> 00:37:42,912
This is from the bar exam in 2018 and the mock exams in 2013 and 2017.

550
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:46,081
A separate regulation is applied...

551
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:48,153
to each accomplice if necessary.

552
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:50,281
The accomplice rule...

553
00:37:50,282 --> 00:37:54,422
of the criminal law doesn't apply to inside accomplices.

554
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:56,193
This is important because...

555
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,233
What is he, a professor of Theater and Film?

556
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:13,202
We hold judges sacred for they enforce the law.

557
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:18,412
However, the realists in law say that the judiciary's decision...

558
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,951
is a problem of what the judge...

559
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,052
had for breakfast.

560
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:27,923
In other words, if your sentencing...

561
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,023
happens on the day the judge had a fight with his wife,

562
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,722
you're in bad luck.

563
00:38:46,443 --> 00:38:49,312
Well, since there aren't any court cases yet...

564
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:51,781
- it's realistically impossible. - Hello, professor.

565
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:53,382
I'm reporter Yoon Eun Mi from SBC, who called you...

566
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:54,781
Professor, can I have your autograph?

567
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:56,581
- Can I have your autograph, please? - Wait.

568
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:57,681
Can I have your autograph?

569
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,722
Can I have your autograph, please?

570
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:08,193
Gosh.

571
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:11,261
Can I take a selfie with you?

572
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:14,601
- Can I have your autograph? - I'm reporter Yoon Eun Mi from SBC.

573
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,602
- Excuse me. - I'm sorry.

574
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,471
I told you that I won't do individual interviews.

575
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:21,141
You're putting me in a difficult position if you come like this.

576
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,911
Please. I ask for just a moment of your time.

577
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,043
I'm sorry.

578
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:26,641
- Professor! - What about the photo?

579
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:27,713
- You promised a selfie with us. - Autograph, please.

580
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:29,682
Gosh.

581
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:33,552
Goodness.

582
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:38,823
Then are you saying your wife has control over you?

583
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,991
No, it's not that she has control over me,

584
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:43,963
I want to live as a dependent variable.

585
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:48,101
Goddesses like Aphrodite and Athena have the right to be hailed.

586
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,003
He said Aphrodite and Athena.

587
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:54,043
What kind of woman has control over a man like that?

588
00:39:55,113 --> 00:39:56,512
- What is it to be controlled? - Well...

589
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:00,482
not even imagining being with another woman?

590
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:02,582
I'll only look up to Professor Na Geun Woo.

591
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:07,552
Class preparation is complete.

592
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:14,563
- Ah Jeong. - Yes?

593
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,802
You know I trust you a lot, right?

594
00:40:19,932 --> 00:40:21,532
Just tell me. What is it?

595
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:25,443
Shall I show you something interesting?

596
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,173
Something interesting?

597
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,912
I really trust you.

598
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:31,983
What is it?

599
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,412
This better be good.

600
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,233
He's being controlled by his wife?

601
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:22,293
I watched the TV show.

602
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:26,023
You relate Hye Ryul to Aphrodite and Athena.

603
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:28,662
Then, what am I?

604
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,093
You're my Muse.

605
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:31,963
Muse?

606
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:34,403
You're my Helen.

607
00:42:43,912 --> 00:42:44,912
Remember.

608
00:42:45,383 --> 00:42:48,852
I can become Aegis and Hades.

609
00:42:49,753 --> 00:42:50,813
Don't forget.

610
00:42:51,253 --> 00:42:52,782
I can become a shield.

611
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:55,722
But I can also be the demon that pulls you into the pit fire.

612
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:58,262
I won't forget it.

613
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:31,722
Eventually, for your own good,

614
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:36,863
your mother, your grandmother, and I, made an effort.

615
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,802
It is the Lord's blessing to receive a talent.

616
00:43:41,102 --> 00:43:45,242
It is evil and idle to just keep that talent.

617
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:50,442
You must win more talent with the talent you have.

618
00:43:50,443 --> 00:43:52,582
Only then you could undertake great deeds.

619
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:57,253
Only then, you could enjoy the Lord's joy together.

620
00:43:57,682 --> 00:44:00,152
Chapter 25 of the Gospel of Matthew...

621
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:01,222
Honey.

622
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:05,793
It's late. Are you still studying the gospel?

623
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:09,161
Now, Kang Baek is better in gospels than me.

624
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:10,233
And Kang Ye...

625
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:13,432
And for Kang Ye...

626
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:15,802
You should think about her complexion.

627
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:18,772
You know how important sleep is for a lady's complexion?

628
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:19,843
It is.

629
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:22,173
Look how dry my skin is.

630
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:25,012
Your complexion is so much better than mine.

631
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,012
Is it? That could be right.

632
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:30,781
Gosh. Think about my age.

633
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:33,522
How can I be compared to this high schooler...

634
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:35,391
with a young face. Gosh you.

635
00:44:35,392 --> 00:44:37,622
I really mean it Great-grandma.

636
00:44:39,823 --> 00:44:42,432
What about you Kang Baek? Are there any difficulties with your studies?

637
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:44,492
No. I'm okay.

638
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:47,931
He always gets a scholarship from MINGUK UNIVERSITY law school...

639
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:49,773
where all the talented students gather.

640
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:52,601
Kang Baek, you're great.

641
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,943
Scholarship isn't the big deal.

642
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:57,273
Our Kang Baek is a natural.

643
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:59,843
When I saw his answers the other day,

644
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:01,912
he is the same as Hye Ryul when she was young.

645
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:05,983
His logic is clear and never misses an issue.

646
00:45:06,222 --> 00:45:07,423
Really?

647
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:12,722
Do you want to become a prosecutor like your mother after graduation?

648
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:14,862
Well, I...

649
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:17,963
No. He should become a judge like me.

650
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:21,162
It's about time we have another Supreme Court Justice.

651
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:26,672
The land of paradise can be compared to ten women going out to greet...

652
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:29,613
their husbands each holding a lamp.

653
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:34,043
Gosh.

654
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:36,653
She already left me the facial cream.

655
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:38,052
She did?

656
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:40,483
It wasn't something urgent.

657
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,523
She's always good at taking care of the family.

658
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:50,563
I wonder if she really thinks of me as family.

659
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:53,032
Why? Did something happen?

660
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:55,932
Did Gwang Jeon make a mistake?

661
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:58,972
No, there isn't.

662
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:01,673
It's been years since I came to this house...

663
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:04,883
but I feel like I'm treated like a guest. That's why.

664
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,543
It's nice that she takes care of me.

665
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:11,052
But to this day, she's never discussed...

666
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:13,652
household matters or even the dinner menu with me.

667
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:16,592
That's because I made sure it doesn't happen.

668
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:19,662
To never let my woman go through any complex matters.

669
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,932
Thank you, honey.

670
00:46:25,932 --> 00:46:26,963
Good.

671
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:29,331
Right. Let's apply this together.

672
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:31,202
I'm okay. You go ahead and put it on.

673
00:46:32,003 --> 00:46:33,043
Here.

674
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:36,173
Let's put some on your face...

675
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:39,613
and on your neck as well.

676
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:43,052
And on your hands.

677
00:46:45,782 --> 00:46:46,823
We should put some on your feet.

678
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:48,653
Goodness.

679
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:58,233
You came home late.

680
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:03,202
Course preparation took a long time.

681
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:05,673
I thought you don't have a class tomorrow.

682
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:11,582
I have this special lecture next week.

683
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,012
You look tired. You should go upstairs.

684
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:34,432
You're home.

685
00:47:34,433 --> 00:47:36,772
Yes. It took a while.

686
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:39,101
You must be tired. Take a shower and rest.

687
00:47:39,102 --> 00:47:40,142
Yes.

688
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:41,943
Do you need to work?

689
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,613
Yes, I need to ask Mom something.

690
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:46,113
Okay.

691
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:47,742
Good night.

692
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,332
Here's your coffee.

693
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:57,383
Nice.

694
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:01,552
Think about your health.

695
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:04,292
Mom.

696
00:49:04,293 --> 00:49:06,992
If I don't do this, I'm going to lose my mind.

697
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:09,932
Or I have to kill someone.

698
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:22,142
A cat walked in.

699
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:25,713
Mom. Take a look at this.

700
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:29,213
The seizure is giving me a headache.

701
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:32,253
According to the Supreme court's decision,

702
00:49:32,582 --> 00:49:34,982
the item for seizure written in the warrant...

703
00:49:34,983 --> 00:49:38,363
issued by the judge must be interpreted strictly.

704
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:40,792
We must not settle or make an analogical interpretation...

705
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:43,563
that plays against the confiscated.

706
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:46,063
But if you look here...

707
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:48,632
(SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY wide area investigation unit)

708
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:51,302
I've never been there before.

709
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:53,443
I was home that day.

710
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:55,972
How strange.

711
00:49:56,642 --> 00:49:59,182
Joong Jin. He said he was never there.

712
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:01,343
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake in the investigation?

713
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:03,713
May 8, 8pm.

714
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,823
The crosswalk in front of Jakjeon Station, Gyeyang-gu, Incheon.

715
00:50:08,153 --> 00:50:09,253
Were you there?

716
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:15,023
Oh, right. That day.

717
00:50:15,633 --> 00:50:18,162
My friend suddenly wanted to go out for a drink.

718
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:20,301
I went to a bar nearby.

719
00:50:20,302 --> 00:50:21,562
Who's that friend?

720
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:23,233
May we call him?

721
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:28,141
We had a fight that day and decided never to meet again.

722
00:50:28,142 --> 00:50:30,642
- What about payment? - Payment?

723
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:33,843
He paid for everything.

724
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:47,863
A lie...

725
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:51,363
is like a living thing.

726
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:53,162
Once you feed it,

727
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:55,371
it sees its chance...

728
00:50:55,372 --> 00:50:59,573
and sucks the blood out of you...

729
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:05,313
until you die. It's that gross.

730
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:13,182
Your ex-wife's brother.

731
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:14,681
We've confirmed...

732
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:17,023
his bank account as well.

733
00:51:19,693 --> 00:51:20,793
I...

734
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,332
I'm hungry.

735
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:27,032
I'll tell you after some food.

736
00:51:27,202 --> 00:51:28,932
What a wise decision.

737
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:31,031
Joong Jin.

738
00:51:31,032 --> 00:51:33,641
Get him an extra large ox bone soup.

739
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:35,273
Extra large ox bone soup it is.

740
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:38,912
Let's wrap it up after the meal.

741
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,313
Get me one too.

742
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,253
Get me an extra large ox bone soup.

743
00:51:47,682 --> 00:51:49,253
What brings you here?

744
00:51:50,093 --> 00:51:52,192
It's been years since you graduated university.

745
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,562
Why do you still come to me asking for food?

746
00:51:54,563 --> 00:51:55,891
If you want a free meal,

747
00:51:55,892 --> 00:51:58,932
go meet your successful seniors.

748
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,362
Don't you know how much I get?

749
00:52:00,363 --> 00:52:03,202
Don't be like that. I need comfort.

750
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:06,943
I got scolded big time after getting rejected today.

751
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:11,313
Then go home and enjoy your parents' hearty meal.

752
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:14,181
Why are you looking for ox bone soup here?

753
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:17,012
I already have a lot on my mind.

754
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:18,823
Get lost.

755
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:22,523
How can you say that to a reporter?

756
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:25,523
You'll regret kicking me out.

757
00:52:26,662 --> 00:52:29,593
I brought solid information.

758
00:52:33,432 --> 00:52:34,432
What's that?

759
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,542
You said it's solid.

760
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:40,642
Come on.

761
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:44,312
Can't you trust people?

762
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:46,141
It's not that I can't trust people.

763
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:48,012
But you aren't exactly reliable.

764
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:49,912
Show me what you have first.

765
00:52:50,282 --> 00:52:53,452
The presidential candidate preference survey result is out.

766
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:56,221
Na Geun Woo is clawing his way up.

767
00:52:56,222 --> 00:52:57,693
Very fast.

768
00:52:58,452 --> 00:53:00,392
- Is that all? - No way.

769
00:53:00,892 --> 00:53:02,892
There's a new person.

770
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:05,963
- A new person? - It's unbelievable.

771
00:53:06,202 --> 00:53:07,301
It must've bothered him so much.

772
00:53:07,302 --> 00:53:08,402
They're having an internal investigation.

773
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:10,702
They want to root her out before she gets any bigger.

774
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:14,343
- Internal investigation? - Police intelligence agency.

775
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:16,472
Who's is it?

776
00:53:17,372 --> 00:53:19,641
I thought it was all for a show when she said she's going after Jusung,

777
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:21,113
but this must've been what they were after.

778
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:24,012
Na Geun Woo's wife.

779
00:53:26,722 --> 00:53:27,852
Han Hye Ryul.

780
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:30,912
(The Empire)

781
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:14,681
(Thanks to Ko Gun Han for his special appearance.)

782
00:56:14,682 --> 00:56:16,523
I announce I'll run for the office.

783
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:18,652
Han Hye Ryul, that wench.

784
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:20,891
They're my in-laws. What will that say about us?

785
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:22,492
It's up to Hye Ryul.

786
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:25,233
I suppose she is scary.

787
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:26,801
Are you determined to do this?

788
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:30,032
Do you have ambition to become the president or what?

789
00:56:30,173 --> 00:56:32,272
Any dirt on Han Hye Ryul?

790
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:35,872
How's the Christmas Fund going?

791
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:37,411
Empty them.

792
00:56:37,412 --> 00:56:39,812
I dug into him meeting B.

793
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,012
And who's that?

794
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:42,613
You love me, right?
