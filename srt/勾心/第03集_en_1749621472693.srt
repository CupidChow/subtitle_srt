1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Tha next day

2
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,300
The End

3
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Episode 1

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,300
I'm begging you.

5
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Don't do this to me.

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,300
I'm begging you.

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,300
I'm wrong.

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm begging you.

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,300
Why did you stop talking?

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Didn't we agree just now?

11
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
You're laughing at me?

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,300
You're happy to see me through?

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,300
How can you cry so much?

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,300
Don't care about me.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Don't! I'm begging you.

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm begging you.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,300
I'm wrong.

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,300
I'm wrong.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,300
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
You must hate others.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Don't care about me.

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,300
I'm wrong.

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Don't do this to me.

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm wrong.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
I'm wrong.

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Don't do this to me.

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
I'm wrong.

28
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
I'm wrong.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
I'm wrong.

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
I'm wrong.

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm wrong.

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm wrong.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
Coming.

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Hello.

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
I'm your fairy, Pei Song Yuan.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Wake up.

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
You always bring beautiful people here.

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
This book is the most beautiful one.

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
I know you like it.

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Your brother, Qin Heng,

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
is getting married with Guan Xin.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
The new family is very busy recently.

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Why are you free?

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Although I'm lucky,

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,300
I'm not a family with them.

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm not qualified to

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
attend the engagement last time.

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
You're so hard-working in Qin's family.

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
You always help me.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm also grateful to you

51
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
for being such a good nurse.

52
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Please.

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,300
Thank you.

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
We grew up together.

55
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
You're my sister.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
And my sister.

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Thank you for your kind words.

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Oh, right.

59
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
A'Nong is here.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
He still doesn't want to see anyone?

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
He's getting better now.

62
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
But he still refuses to meet

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
or to talk to anyone.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
He said

65
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
he's forgotten

66
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
the painful past.

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Actually,

69
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
you can try to let him go

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
just like him.

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
A'Nong can let go,

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
but I can't.

73
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm not qualified.

74
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
I have all the responsibility

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
that A'Nong has to take.

76
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,300
For so many years,

77
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,300
I've been living

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
to find out the truth

79
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
and let the officials know the truth.

80
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
So,

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
how can I forget?

82
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
If you have to do this,

83
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
I can help you.

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
You've helped me enough.

85
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
I don't want to

86
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,300
make you fall into this trap.

87
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
But...

88
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Hello?

89
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Time is running out.

90
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
When are you going to start?

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,300
If you keep delaying

92
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
and don't plan to work together,

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
we'll be out of work.

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
If you let me imitate

95
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Ma Qing Shan,

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
I'll have to see the truth.

97
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Why didn't you say that earlier?

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
That's the old thing.

99
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Just watch and imitate.

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
How is it?

101
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
No white bird is trying to get in the way.

102
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
I heard that

103
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
there's a place called

104
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
the Royal House of Gold.

105
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
It's a home-cooked place.

106
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
It's not just a one-off.

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
The Royal House of Gold

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
is very old.

109
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
No one has caught it.

110
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
It's my collection room.

111
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
You can have a look.

112
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
What should we do?

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Shhh.

114
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
Go.

115
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
No, no.

116
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Go.

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
No.

118
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Don't talk.

119
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
In the world,

120
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
there are so many

121
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
people who can have

122
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Ma Qing Shan's true love.

123
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Only Guan Dong can do that.

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
I've been

125
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
searching for these years.

126
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Take a good look.

127
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
I'll help you

128
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
with your work.

129
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Come on.

130
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
You're so good at it.

131
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,300
You're so good at it.

132
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Although you're busy with college,

133
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,300
you can't get a good grade.

134
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Yes.

135
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
He liked this one the most.

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Is it Guan Dong's wife?

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Yes.

138
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
It seems

139
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
that the same is

140
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,300
his eyes.

141
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Why is he so late?

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
It's all because of this blood.

143
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Help me out.

145
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Help me out.

146
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
This darkness

147
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
has been gone

148
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
once and again.

149
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Ma Qing,

150
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm also in his care.

151
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Help me out.

154
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
What's wrong?

155
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
It's late.

156
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Let's go back.

157
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
They're gone.

158
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
How about we go out first?

159
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
I'm scared to death.

160
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
I've told you many times.

161
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
You can't enter my funeral.

162
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
No.

163
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
You can only bring women here.

164
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
I can't.

165
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't worry.

166
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
I can't burn your treasures.

167
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
You're still...

168
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Guan Dong.

169
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
I asked Guan Huai to come to see me.

170
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
I want to get a job in the painting world.

171
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
I remember

172
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
you didn't get involved in the exhibition.

173
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Yes.

174
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
I didn't do well before.

175
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
I let Guan Dong down.

176
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
I heard that you like

177
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Ma Qing Shan's works.

178
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I can imitate her painting

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
and create a painting.

180
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
There are many people who imitate her.

181
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Why do you think so?

182
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
I can use my feet to draw.

183
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Miss Xiao, you're quite a talker.

184
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
I'll know

185
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
if I'm not too proud

186
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
or if Guan Dong is a poet.

187
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
It's been two days.

188
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
I should be disappointed.

189
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
I should be disappointed.

190
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
You said

191
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
you didn't pay attention to

192
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
the painting of my father.

193
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
You bought this?

194
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Take it back.

195
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
What kind of painting is this?

196
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
It doesn't matter if it's good or not.

197
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
What matters is

198
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
I want to use his paintings.

199
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Your father is a family.

200
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
He needs to be honest

201
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
and not only use his paintings,

202
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
but also the materials

203
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
to be used in various styles.

204
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
You're so honest.

205
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
You're very good at art.

206
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:50,700
I just know some

207
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
This...

208
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Hey, guys.

209
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Can't you just say it out loud?

210
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm a real-life old shopkeeper.

211
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Look at this.

212
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Look at this.

213
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
And this.

214
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
It's not fake.

215
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Come on, take a look.

216
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Why is my father so careless?

217
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I'm a famous shopkeeper.

218
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
You broke it like this

219
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
because of such a good thing?

220
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
No.

221
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
You didn't get the money.

222
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
You still blame me.

223
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
What do you mean I didn't get the money?

224
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
You broke my bowl.

225
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
My painting is so beautiful.

226
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
That's the reputation of the Ming Dynasty.

227
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
That's the reputation.

228
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
It can cost 12 million in the world.

229
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Don't be so mean.

230
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Don't be so mean.

231
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Interesting.

232
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm the one who broke it.

233
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Don't you know who I am?

234
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Boss.

235
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Look at this.

237
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
We'll pay you 500 yuan.

238
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
It's a little over.

239
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Okay?

240
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
After all,

241
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
everyone is not good at painting.

242
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Right?

243
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
500?

244
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm telling you.

245
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I have high blood pressure.

246
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
I have a heart disease.

247
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
I have a heart failure.

248
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Don't give me a chance.

249
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
8 million.

250
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
I can't get a single cent.

251
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I'm telling you.

252
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
He said it's only 500.

253
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
He's only 500.

254
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Don't pretend to be sick.

255
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Your skin is so pale.

256
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
It's obviously the stock of the people's union.

257
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
You don't have 8 million at all.

258
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Bullshit.

259
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Come on, everyone.

260
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Everyone, please come to the neighborhood.

261
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Big brothers, big sisters,

262
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
old friends.

263
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Everyone come and take a look.

264
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Someone bullied the teacher.

265
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
They said

266
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
I don't even have a bag

267
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
when I add all the things here.

268
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
How about this?

269
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
I'll show you a room.

270
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
This is it.

271
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Look.

272
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Do you know what this is?

273
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
This is a friend from Asia

274
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
who is from Asia.

275
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
You are as stubborn as this bowl.

276
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
It's all a magnet.

277
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
A magnet?

278
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Listen carefully.

279
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Can it be a magnet?

280
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
If it's a magnet,

281
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
I'll push it down the wall.

282
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
It's not easy to make a fool of yourself.

283
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Go to the hospital and see if you're sick.

284
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
It's really a magnet.

285
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Look, look, look.

286
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
This room is so real.

287
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
You blacksmith.

288
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
You're on the floor.

289
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Blacksmith, blacksmith.

290
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
It's called blacksmith.

291
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
They are blacksmith.

292
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Brothers, come out.

293
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Blacksmith, blacksmith.

294
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
What are you looking at?

295
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Go.

296
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Be quick.

297
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Don't run.

298
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Brothers,

299
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
this big blacksmith

300
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
is going to kill me.

301
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
He's quite tall.

302
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
What are you going to do?

303
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Go.

304
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Go after him.

305
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Stop.

306
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Stop.

307
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Get out of the way.

308
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Hold it.

309
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
Don't run.

310
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
What's wrong?

311
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
What are you looking at?

312
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
What's so funny?

313
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Brothers,

314
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
there's nothing funny about me.

315
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Look,

316
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
there's a rainbow behind us.

317
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
What are you doing?

318
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
You know me.

319
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Isn't this a wash car?

320
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Look at the dirty car.

321
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Luckily, the police came in time today.

322
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
You said that the old liar

323
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
was doing something too fake.

324
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
What's the difference between this and Mingqiang?

325
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
You just said that today.

326
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
Aren't you afraid that I'll be wrong?

327
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
No one can treat me like a real treasure.

328
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
I'm not a real treasure.

329
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm a real treasure.

330
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm not a real treasure.

331
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm not a real treasure.

332
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm not a real treasure.

333
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
What are you doing?

334
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
I think you're quite dirty.

335
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm here to help you wash.

336
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Guan Huai,

337
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
don't move.

338
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Don't move.

339
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Don't move.

340
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Don't move.

341
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
I believe that

342
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
even if you're wrong,

343
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm willing to accept it.

344
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
I'm willing to accept it.

345
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm not a real treasure.

346
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm not a real treasure.

347
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm not a real treasure.

348
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
I'm not a real treasure.

349
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm not a real treasure.

350
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm not a real treasure.

351
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm not a real treasure.

352
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
I'm not a real treasure.

353
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm not a real treasure.

354
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm not a real treasure.

355
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm not a real treasure.

356
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
I'm not a real treasure.

357
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm not a real treasure.

358
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
I'm not a real treasure.

359
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
I'm not a real treasure.

360
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I'm not a real treasure.

361
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm not a real treasure.

362
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
I'm not a real treasure.

363
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
I'm not a real treasure.

364
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm not a real treasure.

365
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I'm not a real treasure.

366
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I'm not a real treasure.

367
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm not a real treasure.

368
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
I'm not a real treasure.

369
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I'm not a real treasure.

370
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm not a real treasure.

371
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
I'm not a real treasure.

372
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I'm not a real treasure.

373
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Why don't we go our separate ways?

374
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Why don't we go our separate ways?

375
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,300
A mother who must leave her child in her mother's embrace.

376
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm afraid that my face will become a failure

377
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I will break the pieces of the ground

378
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,300
You said that the story is often fair

379
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
I can't even draw the line

380
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm not afraid of the dark, but I'm trying to hide it

381
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
I cry and pretend to be warm

382
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,300
You laugh and turn around and say goodbye

383
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,300
A vague flower garden

384
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,300
The wind blows and the sky is full of flowers

385
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
I said that I would find you

386
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,300
I said that I would find you

387
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Your shadow is all over the sky

388
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm all over the sky

389
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,300
You said that the story is often fair

390
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,300
I can't even draw the line

391
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:15,300
I'm not afraid of the dark, but I'm trying to hide it

392
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,300
I cry and pretend to be warm

393
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,300
You laugh and turn around and say goodbye

394
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,300
A vague flower garden

395
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,300
The wind blows and the sky is full of flowers

396
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,300
I said that I would find you
