1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Except…

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,640
Meng Yan

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,240
Episode 49

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
What's so mysterious?

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,720
And the eyes of the dream.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,480
Don't worry.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,920
I won't sell you.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,840
It's a surprise.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,440
I'll be there soon.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,760
What surprise?

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,720
Stop.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,720
I'm here.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,800
This is the personal painting I made for you.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,320
It's a painting of my own.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
I'll give you a copy.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
I'll give you a copy.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I'll give you a copy.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
I'll give you a copy.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
I'll give you a copy.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll give you a copy.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
I'll give you a copy.

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I'll give you a copy.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
I'll give you a copy.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,320
I can't see your lost eyes.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
How is it?

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,320
The exhibitionist Guan Huai.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
There are two exhibitionists.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
That...

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
The one who invited himself.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
And his little work.

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Qin Zhen.

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Congratulations.

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Thank you.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
You're welcome.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
You're welcome.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Are you blaming us for not inviting yourself?

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
How could I?

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm also grateful that you're here.

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
I should be the last one

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
to know about this exhibition.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
I even forgot

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,720
where to put these paintings.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
The cause of this can't be found out.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
You're the Second.

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
That can't be found.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Moving on later.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Give it to me.

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,120
There's another special situation.

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,720
Our exhibition is working really hard now.

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
What working hard?

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,000
the

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,840
cheeks

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,320
this way is pretty unique

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,920
The coffin is pretty held

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
It's gone, isn't it?

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,700
With a redシ

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
After that accident,

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,720
I took painting as a means of revenge and tools.

59
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,720
All these years, my dream has been fulfilled.

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,720
My original heart has long been untouched.

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,720
At this moment, I finally remember

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
why I took the painting

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
because I love it.

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
I'll draw it too.

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Guan Huan, be careful.

66
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm wearing white clothes.

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
What are you looking at, sister?

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Anyway, if you wear clothes,

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
you'll get dirty.

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm not a painter.

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Don't touch me.

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Why can't I?

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Look, we're all painters now.

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Do you have a memory?

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Guan Huan, you're so stubborn.

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I can't tell you,

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
come here.

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm not a little girl.

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Come here.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Guan Huan.

81
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm telling you.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Don't run.

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Catch me.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Don't run.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Don't touch me.

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Don't run.

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Don't run.

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Sister,

89
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
you can't let go of your hand.

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Look at you.

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
You're so shy.

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
You're going to say that I'm shy.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Look, I still have a meeting.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
How can I go?

95
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Don't worry.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I've arranged a hotel downstairs.

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I'll go with you.

98
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
I'll go with you.

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Don't worry.

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I've arranged a hotel downstairs.

101
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Can I make you embarrassed?

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Go downstairs.

103
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
You're so young.

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Come here.

105
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
You're happy today?

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
The exhibition is my dream when I was a kid.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
I didn't expect

108
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I could make it today.

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
It's been a long time since you were happy.

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Since that incident,

111
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
it's been a long time.

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Is it because of Guanghuai?

113
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Xingyi,

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
are you heartbroken?

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I know who he is.

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I won't like my own enemy.

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Why are you in such a hurry?

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Although the exhibition is over,

119
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
I've prepared a surprise for you.

120
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Please.

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
After growing up,

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I want to build a colorful little room.

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Dad said

124
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
it would be sweet in the room.

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
OK.

126
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Thank you.

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
How was it?

128
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
You know

129
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I've eaten a lot of sweet-sour soup

130
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
when I prepared this.

131
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Although

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I can't make sweet-sour pork with water,

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
the taste of sweet-sour pork is good.

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
But the candy is not bad.

135
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Don't look at these things.

136
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
But it has its own sound.

137
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Listen.

138
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
When you were a kid, you really thought about something.

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
But it's okay.

140
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
As long as you dare to think,

141
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I can do anything.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Why?

143
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
What? Why?

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Why do you want to do this?

145
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Why are you so good to me?

146
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Why are you so vicious?

147
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Just treat me as a good thing.

148
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Okay?

149
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
There is no free food in this world.

150
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I don't believe you are so vicious.

151
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
You know me well.

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,720
But I really just want you to be happy.

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
But I also want to make some good things.

154
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
If you think I did well,

155
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
please accept my offer.

156
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,760
How manyzes can be resumed?

157
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,760
How many kidney patients can I have that day?

158
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Maybe I'm right in my heart.

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm not afraid of the future

160
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm not afraid of the future

161
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm not afraid of the future

162
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm not afraid of the future

163
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm not afraid of the future

164
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm not afraid of the future

165
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm not afraid of the future

166
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm not afraid of the future

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm not afraid of the future

168
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm not afraid of the future

169
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm not afraid of the future

170
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm not afraid of the future

171
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm not afraid of the future

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm not afraid of the future

173
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,220
There's no need to be there

174
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,220
that day

175
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,220
Maybe I already

176
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
have you Grörd

177
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,220
in my heart

178
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,220
Actually, I can't talk about

179
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,220
between us

180
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
and hope that

181
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,220
we will meet next time

182
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,220
In which you notice

183
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,700
I found you were by my side

184
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,900
I can't see your heart

185
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,500
Can you still see me?

186
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,900
Did you do something to her?

187
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,540
I know who she is

188
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,780
I will never like my own hatred

189
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,300
I will never like my own hatred

190
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,300
I will never like my own hatred

191
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,100
That day

192
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,220
I saw her

193
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,140
I was in my heart

194
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,380
I forgot you

195
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,380
Actually, there's no need to say our time

196
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,300
I hope we can meet again one day

197
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,180
I used to think through the information and the diary

198
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,500
I already know you very well

199
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,340
But now

200
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,980
I find I have no idea about you

201
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,620
Maybe I should be closer to you

202
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,860
and closer to you

203
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,020
to see your true face

204
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,100
I should meet you again

205
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,820
Wonderful

206
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,300
I've handled dad's history

207
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,540
I should know that

208
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I'm a man of my word

209
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm a man of my word

210
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm a man of my word

211
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
I'm a man of my word

212
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I'm a man of my word

213
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm a man of my word

214
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm a man of my word

215
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I'm a man of my word

216
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm a man of my word

217
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
I'm a man of my word

218
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm a man of my word

219
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm a man of my word

220
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm a man of my word

221
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm a man of my word

222
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,400
Thoop

223
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Thoop

224
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,800
cornering to a empty world

225
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:36,800
How should love really be

226
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

227
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

228
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

229
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

230
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

231
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

232
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

233
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

234
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

235
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

236
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

237
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

238
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

239
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful

240
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I'll just be a little bit more careful
