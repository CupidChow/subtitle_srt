1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hurry up, don't move.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Be quiet.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Brother.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Don't worry.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Guan Hai's goods will be fine.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These are the goods.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's wrong?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you self-employed?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're standing still.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you say it again,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you won't be able to pretend to be a good man.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is the vase Boss Wang ordered.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's broken by the dragon.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it because the dragon has to fight back?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is art.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The dragon is so painful.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sister.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The End

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Episode 1

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My father's new city

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
was the national painting house of the Yuhu family in the year.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Cheng Laoshan.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That summer,

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
my father who was always busy outside

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
suddenly came back.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Dad.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you ready to eat?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Dad, I miss you so much.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I miss you too.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm going to a far place tomorrow

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to help others draw.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I promise you.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This time,

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can make enough money.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Then I'll buy you a big house.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then I'll keep with you.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then we'll never be apart.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Never.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's eat together.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The next morning,

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
my father left.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I didn't expect

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that my sister would secretly get into the back of the car

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and leave with my father.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Since then,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
they've been so shameless.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
They're late.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Jinye,

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
your father and sister have news.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Where are they?

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your father was tricked into a fake factory.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Your sister was rescued by the police.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But your father...

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
he's dead.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
After my sister's rescue,

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
he never said a word.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I read the diary

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he wrote in the factory.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a big day today.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm cold and hungry.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But the bad guy said

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
he can't eat

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
after the brushwork is done.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My father was beaten.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He must be very painful.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm also very painful.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's so bad.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There's a beautiful red butterfly on his waist.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's so beautiful.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why didn't he fly away?

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All the suspects in the fake factory

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
were caught.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's no sign of the bad guy

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in the diary.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The police said

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
he doesn't exist.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But A'Meng won't lie.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The diary in the letter

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
won't lie either.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've investigated it secretly.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All the clues are only for the officials.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is Kunshan Sea

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the real behind the scenes of the fake factory?

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How did my father die

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in the factory?

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The key to the truth

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
is that painting.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Before my father died,

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the last painting in the factory

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
was the painting of the horse-drawn mountain

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
with a hundred seconds of pure soil.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's good to drink when the boss is married.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Xiaoqin.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Uncle Li.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
After the engagement,

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
my uncle is waiting to drink with you.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
After the wedding,

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Guanghai's business

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
is not in the management.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Women

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
are always in the business.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why do they always go to the business?

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
After the wedding,

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
they will give birth to a child.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your father is waiting to give birth to a grandson.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Your brother is not young anymore.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
In the future,

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
he will be in charge of the company.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you don't want to argue with your brother,

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
please take care of him.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The soldier is here.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know you.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are the most young gold medalist in the hundredth award.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm curious.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I didn't expect you to be interested in painting

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and your fiancÃ©.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm not interested in Mr. Qin.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's you.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The executive director of Guanghai Group.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm concerned.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I like to open the window and talk.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You are talking nonsense.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Does Mr. Guan really want to marry that man?

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have paid a lot for Guanghai.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But once you get married,

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
will Guanghai still have your position?

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I believe

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you won't be willing

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and won't be willing

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to give everything you have

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to the public.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The news is clear.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it has nothing to do with you.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can help you.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If a flower-hearted man like Mr. Qin

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
makes a fuss about

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the peach-colored flying-blossom in Dinghui Yan,

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
will the marriage be successful?

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's making a joke.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The official's face is not bright.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The official's face is in the official's eyes,

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but he doesn't care about his future.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You help me.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What's your benefit?

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If you spend a little money,

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you can make a big trouble.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
To Mr. Guan,

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
he's very smooth.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The flying-blossom behind is my dad's office.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Qin Heng's rest room

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is the first room on the right corner

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
of the second floor of the flying-blossom.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yun,

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
our daughter is getting married today.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you are still here,

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you will be very happy.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And your favorite painting.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's been so many years.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I finally found the right painter.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I believe I can finish it soon.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yun,

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I promise you that

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I won't let you down.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sorry, Mr. Guan.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Before you solve the marriage,

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have something more important to do.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I heard that the official has a underground funeral.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The white bird is in the spring.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Maybe it's right there.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The person's face is Mega-spectri questioning it has been a long time.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He's asking me did you find her out?

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Look at him!

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Look at it!

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Look at it!

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Look at it!

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Just do whatever you like.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you stay here,

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will kill you.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,080
Who will pay for the payment in this world?

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,080
Okay,

186
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,880
then leave me alone.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
Goodbye.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Get out!

189
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,200
What are you doing here?

190
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,640
What else can I do?

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
Where's the girl I just met

192
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
who's signing here?

193
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,880
Will you knock on our door next time?

194
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,120
You bastard!

195
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,360
Girl,

196
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,240
let's go somewhere else.

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
This is your sister's engagement banquet.

198
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,040
Stop staring at me.

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,880
Get out!

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
I'll contact you next time.

201
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm leaving.

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,120
I'm leaving.

203
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm leaving.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm leaving.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm leaving.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm leaving.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm leaving.

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm leaving.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm leaving.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
Guan Huai's appearance

211
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
completely disrupted my plan.

212
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
I also rushed to

213
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
complete the cooperation I was concerned about.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,460
Song loves you

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,200
only if you beg us for help.

216
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,400
Don't tell me you love me.

217
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I love you so much.

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,080
But in Track ä¸é,

219
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
I only run towards you.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
This is such a bitly knock.

221
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,440
Don't just make noise with that.

222
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
They got mine, too.

223
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Look.

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm still hardworking.

225
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
It's easy for me to do anything.

226
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
It's about to begin.

227
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,720
What should I do to escape?

228
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,720
I'm afraid that my face

229
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,720
will become a failure

230
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,720
and I'll be broken into pieces.

231
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
You said that it's better to stop the movie

232
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,720
than to go to the end

233
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,720
and I'm still trying to stay young.

234
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,720
I'm afraid that my face

235
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,720
