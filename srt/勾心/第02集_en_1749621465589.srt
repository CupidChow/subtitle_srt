1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,580
New

2
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,840
Okay?

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
I went out to have fun.

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,580
I have Nevada.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,920
I only give it a few kisses.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,120
I often throw throwing proposals too.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,080
For that,

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,820
I will choose what to buy.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,600
Santa說,

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't know what I have to buy.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,480
I can't buy progressing games too.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,740
Santa.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,540
Santa said…

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,540
I'm going home.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,540
You can fold, you can fold,

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,540
you can just fold.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,340
You drew this one, right?

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,940
You drew it quite well.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,140
I just need something.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,340
I need a tree.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,740
Raise your hand.

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,740
Come here.

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,740
You're just a tree.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,540
I'll give you some color.

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Xinyi.

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,740
It's really you.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,740
I thought I was mistaken.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,140
You're so sweet, Xun.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Guanghai is a good person.

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,140
Even the most famous Xinyi

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,740
is here to get a job.

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,740
But I heard that

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
you never drew a painting

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
ever since you won the award.

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
I'm not sure.

36
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
I'm just a little bit worried.

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,740
I never drew a painting.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
I didn't expect you to be so interested

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
in my graduation.

40
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,740
Who cares about you?

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Stop practicing.

42
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Mr. Guan is here.

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Look.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Sorry for the wait.

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,740
You're all the masters of the industry.

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Thank you for coming.

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,740
I've been getting a new painting recently.

48
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
This is my master's work.

49
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Why is it in Guanshan Sea?

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,740
I heard that the artist is from Chaoyun Town.

51
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,740
I'd like to ask you, master.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
Who is his artist?

53
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Or

54
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
who knows this painting?

55
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
This is me.

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I drew it.

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,740
There are two artists in this painting.

58
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,740
If you don't believe me,

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,740
I can give you a hint now.

60
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,740
What's this?

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
What's this?

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Mr. Guan,

63
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
the line is here.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,740
Mr. Guan, the line is here.

65
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Xuenmei,

66
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,740
do you dare?

67
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,740
He's been out of the work for a year.

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
According to his personality,

69
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
it's impossible to stop for so long.

70
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Unless

71
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
he doesn't want to paint,

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
but can't.

73
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
I can't paint.

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
I can't do it.

75
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Mr. Guan,

76
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
You like to bring tea with you?

78
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,740
What's your name?

79
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Xu Ru.

80
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,740
What's going on with Xu Ru?

81
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
He's messed up our plan.

82
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,740
I tried my best to draw the new painting.

83
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
I sent it to the old man

84
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,740
and he came to Chaoyun Town to find it.

85
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
But the result was that

86
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Cheng Youjin killed him.

87
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
He used all my plans.

88
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
It's hard to imitate the new painting.

89
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Is Xu Ru good at drawing?

90
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
I don't know if he's good at drawing.

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
He's good at seducing people.

92
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
He's always learning my mom's tricks

93
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
and making the old man lose his mind.

94
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Who is he?

95
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Who else?

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
He cares about me.

97
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Since the game has started,

98
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
no matter who wants to mess with me,

99
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
or wants to enter the game,

100
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,740
I have to follow my plan.

101
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Look, there's a stamp.

102
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,740
Hey, you're playing alone?

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
If you want to play with me,

104
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
you have to be alone.

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Fine. Let's play together.

106
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
One ball is ten thousand.

107
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
What do you think?

108
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
You're so stingy.

109
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
What if you lose?

110
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
If I lose one ball,

111
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
I'll take off my clothes.

112
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Fine.

113
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
Good job.

114
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Good job.

115
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
No more.

116
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Who is he?

117
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
What's he doing?

118
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
I'm just trying to be sure.

119
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Who is he?

120
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Who is he?

121
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Who are you?

122
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
Why do you want to play with me?

123
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,740
You have so many money.

124
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
I...

125
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
You're cheating.

126
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Stop it.

127
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
What are you looking at?

128
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Look at your eyes.

129
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Stop it.

130
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
Let's go.

131
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Stop it.

132
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Why did you take off your clothes

133
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
and help men?

134
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
I think it's interesting.

135
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
You're called Xinyi, right?

136
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
You went to the old man's meeting two days ago.

137
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Do you want to be a painter?

138
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I do,

139
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
but I haven't passed the exam.

140
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
What's this?

141
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
I'm his son.

142
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
I'll help you to do it.

143
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
It's just a few words.

144
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
You're so kind.

145
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Of course not.

146
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
I'm a official.

147
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740
Do you think I'm being shy

148
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
to give people a ride?

149
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
If I hadn't misunderstood that old man,

150
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
and got involved in my sister's son-in-law,

151
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
I would have been a public office.

152
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
I just want you to help me

153
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
to make your dad happy.

154
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
You can't make your son happy.

155
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm an outsider.

156
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
How can I make him happy?

157
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
If you like Ma Qingshan,

158
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
if you take his style and draw a picture,

159
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
I guarantee you that you'll be able to make him happy.

160
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
I can't help you.

161
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
I can't draw now.

162
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
I've checked the information online.

163
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
You're under too much pressure.

164
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
I'll take you out to relax.

165
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
You want to work with me?

166
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Of course.

167
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
I've seen your painting.

168
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
You're still the youngest gold medalist

169
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
in the Bajia award, right?

170
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
With your ability,

171
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
it's definitely not a problem to get the old man.

172
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
How is it now?

173
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Look.

174
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
The environment, the scenery.

175
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
Do you have any inspiration?

176
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
It seems a bit.

177
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
I have inspiration.

178
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Hurry up and draw.

179
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,740
You don't have a paper, do you?

180
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
This one.

181
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,740
You can draw it as you like.

182
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
Just draw it.

183
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
I'm so cold.

184
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
I'm so hungry too.

185
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
But that bad egg said

186
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
that he doesn't like brush today.

187
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
So he can't eat.

188
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
It's so dark.

189
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
I miss my dad so much.

190
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,740
The bad egg put the pigment on me.

191
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,740
He said he drew a picture on me.

192
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm so hungry.

193
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
I'm so hungry.

194
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm so hungry.

195
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm so hungry.

196
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
I'm so hungry.

197
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm so hungry.

198
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm so hungry.

199
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
I'm so hungry.

200
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,740
I'm so hungry.

201
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
I'm so hungry.

202
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm so hungry.

203
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm so hungry.

204
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm so hungry.

205
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm so hungry.

206
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

207
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm missing you a little bit in my chest.

208
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm hiding my eyes.

209
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I don't care about anything.

210
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Even if the shadow is reflected in the light.

211
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,740
The world is falling into the lie.

212
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,740
What should I do to escape?

213
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,740
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

214
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,740
I broke a piece of the piece.

215
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,740
You said that time is always changing.

216
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Why don't you draw the line?

217
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
I'm so warm.

218
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,740
I'm trying to be more.

219
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I'm crying.

220
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
I'm so cold.

221
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,740
You smile and say goodbye.

222
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,740
A lonely scene.

223
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,740
I'm missing you a lot.

224
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,740
The world is falling into the lie.

225
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,740
What should I do to escape?

226
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

227
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,740
I broke a piece of the piece.

228
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
You said that time is always changing.

229
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Why don't you draw the line?

230
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm so warm.

231
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I'm trying to be more.

232
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm crying.

233
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
I'm so cold.

234
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,740
You smile and say goodbye.

235
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,740
A lonely scene.

236
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,740
I'm missing you a lot.

237
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
I'm so cold.

238
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
You smile and say goodbye.

239
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,740
A lonely scene.

240
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:59,740
I broke a piece of the piece.

241
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,740
You said that time is always changing.

242
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Why don't you draw the line?

243
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
I'm so warm.

244
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,740
I'm trying to be more.

245
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm crying.

246
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
I'm so cold.

247
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,740
You smile and say goodbye.

248
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,740
A lonely scene.

249
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,740
I'm missing you a lot.
