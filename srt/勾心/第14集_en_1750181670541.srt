Eternal Love of Dream

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,600
Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,040
A heroine?

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,200
You want to see a platform?

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,540
Hello to you.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,780
What are you looking for?

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,340
Xingcheng and my mom already know each other.

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,360
What do you ask me for? Go!

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,260
This is Xingcheng's seal.

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,740
You didn't know

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,220
what happenedしました in the last life.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,140
You know it.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,420
You know the whole thing.

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,540
Thank God there was fate

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,540
that Xin Zheng went to make money.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,700
You promised him the house.

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,780
You already geed him.

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,500
All things are in vain.

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,020
None of his—

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,300
If he is very capable,

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,980
he is SEO.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,300
If he makes money

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,460
and makes money,

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,660
what bad could he be?

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,580
But Xin Cheng doesn't know

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,540
that you fathered him.

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,380
Why don't you cheat him then?

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,240
Cheat!?

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,140
You all cheated me.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,860
If he didn't commit suicide,

31
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,540
if he didn't steal my money,

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,740
I could have tied him up.

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,060
Yes.

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,100
I've already kept an eye on him.

35
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,300
Because he's your mother's senior,

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,620
because he can adjust to the beauty,

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,500
because he can make a white bird-like picture.

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,500
If he doesn't have the ability,

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,300
can I look at him?

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,100
My mother and he

41
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,700
are not just brothers and sisters, right?

42
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Kunshan Sea,

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,220
what are you afraid of?

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,100
Afraid?

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,860
What's there to be afraid of?

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,100
Your mother and her

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,620
were talking to the same master.

48
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,420
Xuncheng likes your mother,

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,860
but he didn't even dare to let go.

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,100
He can't do anything except painting.

51
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,900
The only one who can match your mother

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
is me.

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,660
You...

54
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,380
He doesn't really love you.

55
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,900
You know it.

56
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,300
So you don't have to break your heart.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,860
Am I right?

58
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,300
You don't love him.

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,180
You said you love him or miss him.

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,020
But

61
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,860
your mother didn't want you to suffer,

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,060
so she took him home at any time.

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,460
What is he in your eyes?

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
It's Xun Zhang.

65
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660
It's Jiang Bei.

66
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,260
It's not him.

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,100
It's the proof that you've made it.

68
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
It's all

69
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
your secret.

70
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
Yes.

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,020
Yun is the most beautiful one

72
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,220
in all my secret.

73
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,780
I love to protect him and hope for him.

74
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
If possible,

75
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,620
I hope he can be brave

76
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,020
like all the other people in the world.

77
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,380
How can you use his blood to make Xin Cheng work?

78
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,740
He's a man!

79
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,340
No one cares about his blood.

80
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,060
I'll use this method

81
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,980
to make him go to the front again with Xin Cheng.

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
What's the problem?

83
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,740
Daddy and았어요

84
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,340
still own this process.

85
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,200
Daddy was Compassionate Foul

86
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:20,780
and Minister of Con swab

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,100
and he knew who I am.

88
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Xiyi. Xiyi.

89
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,100
You're so mean to him.

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,100
How can you do this? How can you do this? How can you do this?

91
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Dad. Dad. I'm sorry.

92
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,100
No. No. I'm sorry.

93
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

94
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Xiyi.

95
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Xiyi. Xiyi.

96
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Xiyi. Xiyi.

97
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
He's a monster.

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Xiyi.

99
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Dad.

100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Are you afraid of being a ghost?

101
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Come out. Okay?

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
It's my fault.

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

104
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Have fun.

105
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
You knew I was Xingcheng's daughter.

106
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,100
You want to get close to me, right?

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
You knew I couldn't talk.

108
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I can't be your love.

109
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Are you crazy?

110
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
I'm not worth being caught by you.

111
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Are you proud of me?

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Xiyi.

113
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Please listen to me.

114
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
What's this?

115
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Are you going to lie to me with the emperor?

116
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I thought I was the player in this game.

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,100
So I'm your toy all the time.

118
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Don't say that. Aren't you a toy?

119
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Let me go. Let me go.

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Let me go.

121
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
I don't want to be angry.

122
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Do you want it?

123
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Xiaoxia can have a piece of meat.

124
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Guan Huai.

125
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
I feel you're evil.

126
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:19,100
One day, I'll prove that I love you.

127
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
I love you.

128
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,100
You're not worth being caught by the emperor.

129
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Get lost.

130
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Let's go, let's go.

131
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
I didn't expect that you'd be so quick,

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
so you've decided to meet me at the meeting.

133
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Xiao Heng.

134
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Thank you.

135
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,340
is my business.

136
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,860
I'll do my best to help you out.

137
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,980
But you are not aware of what one of

138
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,540
thewaremen said

139
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,660
before he didn't want to market

140
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,940
the learn-how.

141
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,940
He spent so many efforts

142
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,900
wisdomfully information.

143
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,020
However,

144
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,300
the time is short.

145
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,500
Only five days.

146
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,300
Five days?

147
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,940
That's enough.

148
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,780
конф Monte s

149
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,740
t has only some five days.

150
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
I don't know anything about you.

151
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
By the way,

152
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I heard that you have a secret house in Bo's Mansion.

153
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,740
It's all made by Ma Qingshan.

154
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Don't you want to have a secret house

155
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
and a treasure in the town?

156
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Didn't you say that it's something that's been passed down by the people?

157
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
You're not going to believe it?

158
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,740
There are some things in this world that are only about the necessary.

159
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
As for how to handle it,

160
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
it's all up to you.

161
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
As long as you say something,

162
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
I will do my best to help you.

163
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Okay.

164
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
I still want to say something.

165
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
As long as you can do it,

166
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
I can agree to whatever conditions you want.

167
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Mr. Kun.

168
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
I'll leave now.

169
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm leaving.

170
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
This is really hard to do.

171
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
I found the computer that Guan Xin is looking for.

172
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Other than the business in Guanghai,

173
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
nothing else.

174
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
That old man is always cautious.

175
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,740
Guan Xin is just the tool to manage Guan Hai.

176
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
He did those dirty things.

177
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Of course he can't let him know.

178
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Qinghe has already knocked down the construction meeting of the White Bird Town.

179
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
They will not let this opportunity go.

180
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
They will hold a handover at the construction meeting.

181
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
We have to get Guan Shanhai's trust as soon as possible.

182
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,740
So that we can enter the construction meeting.

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,740
That old man is already investigating Xin Yi's real identity.

184
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,740
If he really finds out anything, he will be in danger.

185
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Then we have to hurry up.

186
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
If you really say so,

187
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,740
Guan Shanhai will use the product to exchange the real money at the construction meeting.

188
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,740
Then he will definitely find Xin Yi to draw that product.

189
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,740
What should he do?

190
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Isn't it just a fake painting?

191
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Who can't do it?

192
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Is it him?

193
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,740
At first, our goal was to find the golden house of Guan Shanhai

194
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
and the White Bird Town that was painted by Xin Cheng.

195
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,740
That's why we pushed Xin Yi to Guan Shanhai's side step by step.

196
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
Guan Shanhai is very good at painting.

197
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
He will definitely find someone to continue painting.

198
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
And Xin Yi is the best person to draw.

199
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
But now Guan Shanhai has found the truth.

200
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,740
If he is fake, it doesn't matter to him.

201
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
What do you mean?

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Xin Yi is in a bad state now.

203
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,740
He is not suitable to participate in the later learning project.

204
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I will find someone to replace him.

205
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Before the construction meeting,

206
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Guan Shanhai will continue to complete that painting.

207
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
As long as he chooses our person,

208
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,740
we can still draw the golden house and the White Bird Town.

209
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
Why did you suddenly change the plan?

210
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Did you and Xin Yi hide something from me?

211
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
That's what I said.

212
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
I will continue to find the suitable person.

213
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Why do we have to make a plan at this age?

214
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,740
If we find the person who painted the golden house and the White Bird Town,

215
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,740
not only you and me,

216
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
but Xin Yi has been here for so many years.

217
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Does Guan Shanhai really have the wooden house of the construction?

218
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
How did he die in the construction?

219
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,740
He needs a truth.

220
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
I will find these answers for him.

221
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Do you trust him?

222
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
The last thing I regret is to cooperate with you.

223
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
I regret that you are here.

224
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,740
I will use my time to make you leave.

225
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
I will use him.

226
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
What about you?

227
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,740
You said that you are doing this for him.

228
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
You have no selfish intention.

229
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
Why did you cooperate with me?

230
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
It's because of the relationship between Qin Jia and Guan Shanhai.

231
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
And your good brother Qin Hao

232
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
helped Guan Shanhai to hold a construction meeting.

233
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Once these Chuwen is exposed,

234
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
they both are doing this for the sake of the construction.

235
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
To be honest, you did this

236
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
for the sake of the Qin family and Qin Hao.

237
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
You didn't help him, I did.

238
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
From now on,

239
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,740
you don't need to care about his matters.

240
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
I am trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

241

The death spell will stop with Diana.

Diana needs my word.

285
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Diana needs my word.

286
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
her word begins by jazz.

287
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740

qiplant

291
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
Montana

292
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
We're friend, aren't we.

293
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
It's so awkward.

294
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
I'm bored, really bored.

295
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,740
I'm afraid that my face will become a failure

296
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,740
I'm broken into a piece of land

297
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,740
I'm broken into a piece of land

298
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,740
I'm broken into a piece of land

299
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I'm broken into a piece of land

300
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,740
I'm broken into a piece of land

301
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,740
You said that the story is a lie

302
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm like a needle in the hole

303
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,740
I'm so slow, but I'm trying to be more serious

304
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,740
I'm crying, pretending that I'm innocent

305
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,740
You look at me, turn around, and say goodbye

306
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,740
A dreamlike flower garden

307
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,740
The sea is full of blue sky

308
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
I'm missing you

309
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,740
I said I'd find you

310
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm not going to see you for a long time

311
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Your shadow is gone

312
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm far away

313
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,740
You said that the story is a lie

314
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,740
I'm so slow, but I'm trying to be more serious

315
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,740
I'm crying, pretending that I'm innocent

316
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,740
You look at me, turn around, and say goodbye

317
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,740
