1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
What kind of concert was this.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:15,640
It's my say, at least that it was a bitこう Martin Luther Day.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,520
Like a lot, like, we'd probably say a heart形 lo of space, but we've done it.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,060
It着急.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,240
Obviously like it's being like this.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,740
Gradually we were able to do it.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:40,880
laughter

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:52,540
Subs by

9
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,540
Hey, this is my future wife.

10
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,740
Come, come, come. Let's sit together.

11
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,740
You two go back first. Wait for my call.

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,740
Why is the audience here today?

13
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,740
I heard that the editor is making a secret show for you.

14
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,740
I forgot to tell you. Don't care about my face.

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,740
She is a useless person.

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,740
Just find a reason to do it.

17
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,740
Let's see if there is any problem. If there is no problem, just sign it.

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
What do you mean?

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,740
Didn't Qin Shen tell you that I want to get off the wedding?

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
What? Are you angry?

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Let's talk about something.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
Don't just talk about the wedding.

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,740
I didn't agree to this. You and my dad made it.

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,740
I thought that if we could get together, I would be fine.

25
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,740
But then I thought that I didn't have that much.

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,740
The engagement is over.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Isn't it too late?

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,740
To be honest, you don't like me.

29
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
I didn't like you.

30
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
But you are like our family.

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,740
You have many choices.

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,740
I promise that we will play together after the wedding.

33
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,740
If you want to stay in Guanhai, as long as your dad agrees.

34
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
I don't care.

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,740
I'm sorry. I don't want to play with you at all.

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,740
And don't take my dad as a pressure. It's useless.

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,740
Fine. I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,740
Let's talk about the wine you have in front of you.

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Mr. Guan.

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Please.

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,740
This is not a good idea.

42
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,740
When business is done, you will be upset.

43
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,740
When business is done, you will be upset.

44
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,740
Can you sign it?

45
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
I'm asking you.

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Can you sign it?

47
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Who is it?

48
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Hello. This is the traffic police.

49
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Your car is broken because of the accident.

50
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
Please come to the side.

51
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Let him go.

52
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
I don't need the money.

53
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Because your car is broken.

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,740
If you don't come, we will steal your car.

55
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Wait.

56
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Come on.

57
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
Mr. Guan.

58
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Mr. Guan.

59
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
Wait for me.

60
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,740
You are still so quiet.

61
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Where is he?

62
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
What if...

63
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
What if...

64
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
What if you...

65
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Mr. Guan, you are drunk.

66
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
Why do you appear in my dream every night

67
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,740
after that?

68
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
What's your intention?

69
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Mr. Guan.

70
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Mr. Guan.

71
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Mr. Guan.

72
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Mr. Guan.

73
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
Do you know who I am?

74
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
I know.

75
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
You are a spirit.

76
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Why can't you let go of me?

77
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Mr. Guan.

78
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Mr. Guan.

79
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,740
I found something left by my father.

80
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,740
But I didn't find any clues about him and Mrs. Ming.

81
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm afraid this story will only be known when the truth comes out.

82
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
Why did you do that?

83
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,740
I didn't know you were so stupid.

84
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
What?

85
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,740
You were drunk last night.

86
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I...

87
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Are you blaming me?

88
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
No.

89
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
I don't mean that.

90
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
I mean...

91
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,740
I'm sorry last night.

92
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
You don't have to apologize.

93
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
I was the one who was the first one to be active.

94
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
I thought you would be angry.

95
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Why would I be angry?

96
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Are you unhappy yesterday?

97
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
No.

98
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
Didn't you say

99
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
you didn't allow yourself to be wrong?

100
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Maybe after meeting you,

101
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
you were angry at me for being late.

102
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
You're right.

104
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,740
I did call the rules to be the best.

105
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
I didn't allow myself to be wrong.

106
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
But I found that

107
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,740
I seem to have neglected my real desire.

108
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
We are both wrong.

109
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Maybe we are beautiful.

110
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Your brother is a bastard.

111
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
But you're not.

112
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
I like you.

113
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
See you.

114
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
This is my new blood.

115
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Try it.

116
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
The tea is so refreshing.

117
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
It's really good.

118
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
But the Qin family

119
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
may not be able to drink

120
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
the official's son's tea.

121
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
What do you mean?

122
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
You don't know, right?

123
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,740
The official asked me

124
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
to marry him.

125
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
This kid.

126
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
He doesn't even talk to me about it.

127
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
But

128
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,740
the marriage is a bit complicated.

129
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
It's normal for a girl

130
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
to be a bit more emotional.

131
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
I'll ask him

132
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,740
if he wants to find a sister.

133
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Uncle,

134
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
you don't know

135
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
the status of the Qin family in the business.

136
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Once this news is out,

137
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,740
the business and the stock market

138
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
will be affected.

139
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Don't worry.

140
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
We are in the same boat.

141
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
We still have a chance

142
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
to work together.

143
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Since Uncle said that,

144
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
I'm relieved.

145
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
By the way,

146
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
I know you've always liked

147
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
Ma Qingshan.

148
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
You've been looking for

149
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
the white bird,

150
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Zhang Chuntu.

151
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
So I've been sending people

152
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
to pay attention to this picture.

153
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
This time,

154
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
I have good news.

155
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Are you sure it's the white bird, Zhang Chuntu?

156
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Yes.

157
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
This picture

158
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
is now in a woman's house

159
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
in the country.

160
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Grandpa said it was passed down.

161
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
I've been looking for him for a long time.

162
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
I've lost his news.

163
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
I've said it's lost.

164
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
That woman's house

165
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
is relatively low.

166
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
She's never willing to

167
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
reveal her name and appearance.

168
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
The work she's collecting

169
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
is just a personal observation.

170
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
She's never been able to change it.

171
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
If it's true,

172
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
how much money is it?

173
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Take it.

174
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
I've asked her before.

175
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
She said

176
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
it's a precious thing.

177
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
She's not willing to give it back.

178
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
But

179
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
I think you should take a look.

180
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
I can sign it from the bottom of my heart.

181
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,740
I'll make a small private contract.

182
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,740
If this thing can be done,

183
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I'll agree to whatever you ask.

184
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
We're family members.

186
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I just want to get married early with Guan Xin.

187
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Don't worry.

188
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Guan Zhen's matter

189
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
is still not in his hands.

190
