Go!

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,020
This is its protection.

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Xingyi.

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Xingyi!

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,460
I want to go back!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,460
Sister!

17
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,460
I want to go back!

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,460
I want to go back!

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,460
I want to go back!

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,460
Xin Yue!

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460
Xin Yue!

22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,460
The world that I have been wandering about

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,460
How should I escape from this?

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,460
I'll kill you if you say so!

25
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,460
I'll go back to the old days

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,460
Xin Yue!

27
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,460
I'll go back to the old days

28
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,460
Xin Yue!

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,460
I'll go back to the old days

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,460
You said that the story is always the same

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,460
It's better to know the end of the story

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,460
Whether I'm clear or not

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,460
Is this the end

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,460
I cry and cry and cry

35
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,460
You laugh and cry and I laugh again

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,460
You cry and cry and cry again

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:43,460
I'm afraid that the future is the end

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
I cry and cry again

39
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460
I'll go back to the old days

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,460
The world that I have been wandering about

41
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,460
How should I escape from this?

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
Xin Yue!

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Xin Yue!

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,460
I'll go back to the old days

45
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,460
I'll go back to the old days

46
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,460
You said that the story is always the same

47
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,460
It's better to know the end of the story

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
Whether I'm clear or not

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Is this the end

50
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,460
I cry and cry and cry again

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,460
You laugh and cry and cry again

52
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,460
You cry and cry again

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,460
I'm afraid that the future is the end

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,460
I cry and cry again

55
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
Xin Yue!

56
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Xin Yue!

57
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
Xin Yue!

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
I'll take off my clothes in the month

59
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Otherwise, I'll fall asleep easily

60
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Did you hear that?

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
I'm leaving

62
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
It hurts so much

63
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
Well

64
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
If you're tired

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
I'll take off your clothes

66
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,460
No

67
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
What?

68
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
No

69
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
I won't take off your clothes

70
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,460
You're burning up

71
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
You

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Do you know what you're doing?

73
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,460
You're so stupid

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Don't worry

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
I won't take your advantage

76
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
You said that I'm so useless

77
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
I'm giving you a hard time

78
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
You're so annoying every day

79
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm sorry

80
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
It hurts

81
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
Don't move

82
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
Get some water

83
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
You're the one who caught my eye first

84
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
I'm sorry

85
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
How's the gold?

86
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,460
I want to polish it

87
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,460
When I have the strength to polish it

88
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
I'll put it on the painting

89
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
It's not easy

90
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
But I don't have much time

91
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,460
I know

92
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
I'll be quick

93
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Your sister is very capable

94
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
She can help you

95
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
That painting

96
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
has a special red color

97
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
I haven't found the same one

98
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
until now

99
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm so sorry

100
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
I haven't found the same one

101
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,460
I asked my sister to find the original material

102
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,460
I'm going to pick it myself

103
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,460
Have you ever heard of a red

104
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
called the beauty pig?

105
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,460
It's said that it's a red

106
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
that's unique to Ma Qingshan

107
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,460
But no one else

108
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
can pick this red color

109
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Ma Qingshan is 20 years old

110
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
It's called the beauty pig

111
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Do you know how to adjust it?

112
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm a little bit old

113
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
I don't have the ability to adjust it

114
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm just a little bit old

115
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
Beauty pig, beauty pig

116
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,460
is used by the beauty

117
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Mr. Guan

118
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
Are you kidding me?

119
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Those wild animals from Ma Qingshan

120
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
love to be wild

121
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,460
Let's not talk about

122
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,460
whether there is a beauty pig

123
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Even if there is

124
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
it must have been passed down

125
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
If

126
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
I find a way to adjust it

127
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
I'll let it go

128
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Are you willing to

129
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
write a novel?

130
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
This painting

131
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,460
is the best one

132
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
You're so annoying

133
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
What the hell are you doing?

134
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
You dare to disturb my attention?

135
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,460
Brother

136
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm just looking for a job

137
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Don't think I don't know

138
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
what your idea is

139
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,460
Your mother seduced my father

140
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
You want to seduce me again

141
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,460
and I'm not married

142
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
So you can't even get a divorce

143
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Sorry, brother

144
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm sorry

145
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
I'm not interested in your sister-in-law

146
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
Even if you're interested

147
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Guan Xin won't like you

148
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Your mother can't even get married

149
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
even if she dies

150
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
If you didn't have

151
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
the blood of your father

152
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
I wouldn't have

153
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
the chance to see you

154
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Remember

155
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
As long as I'm here

156
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
you

157
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
will never

158
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
think of getting involved

159
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm not going to let you go

160
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
I'm not going to let you go

161
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm not going to let you go

162
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
I'm not going to let you go

163
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,460
I'm not going to let you go

164
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm not going to let you go

165
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm not going to let you go

166
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
I'm not going to let you go

167
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm not going to let you go

168
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
I'm not going to let you go

169
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
I'm not going to let you go

170
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm not going to let you go

171
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
I'm not going to let you go

172
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
I'm not going to let you go

173
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
I'm not going to let you go

174
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
I'm not going to let you go

175
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
I'm not going to let you go

176
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,460
I'm not going to let you go

177
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
I'm not going to let you go

178
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
I'm not going to let you go

179
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
I'm not going to let you go

180
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
I'm not going to let you go

181
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,460
I'm not going to let you go

182
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Luckily, I didn't lose my mind

183
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
If I had left at that time

184
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
I would have been in danger

185
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,460
What would have happened to them?

186
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Xin Yi, it's time to eat

187
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,460
You didn't know how to catch me last night

188
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I didn't even quit my job last night

189
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
I quit my job at 5 o'clock

190
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,460
I washed your clothes this morning

191
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
and bought you food

192
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,460
You said that there are such good sweet-talk girls

193
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
You said that there are such good sweet-talk girls

194
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
You went up there to find them

195
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
I'm going

196
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Can you take care of that sweet-talk girl?

197
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
If you can't find her, then you can find me

198
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Xin Yi, you want the gold?

199
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
I need it

200
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,460
I've already found other substitute

201
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,460
The pearl is only suitable for the gold

202
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Nothing else can replace it

203
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,460
Even the color of the necklace is so beautiful

204
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,460
It's so beautiful and so beautiful

205
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,460
What?

206
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,460
Are you teaching me how to do things now?

207
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,460
Yes, you are very hardworking

208
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
and very talented

209
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,460
But there are some things

210
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
that you don't know at all

211
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,460
in front of your choice

212
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,460
For example, you are wearing heavy rain

213
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
I can choose this thing

214
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
that I found on the mountain

215
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,460
For example, the one you like, Cheng Rao Shanren

216
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
spent most of his life

217
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Finally, you chose to walk closer

218
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,460
Why?

219
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Because he chose to be a good person

220
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
He didn't do anything wrong, he was cheated

221
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
Who knows?

222
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Maybe he was still willing to do the fake

223
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,460
But he was also very good at the factory

224
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Otherwise, he would have been caught

225
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,460
I can imagine that he was really good at that

226
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Shut up!

227
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,460
Xinyi, you dare to hit me?

228
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,460
