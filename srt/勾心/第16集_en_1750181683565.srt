The End

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Episode 1

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
My dad is right.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,640
What's so exciting about this?

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,640
He believes you the most.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I heard that you also cleaned the mess in the factory.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Master, you know that Guan Dong doesn't like to mention the past.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Yes, yes, yes.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
The fastest, the fastest.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
You know that.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm just a thief.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Stop the car.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Brother Shilou, do you want to go to my repair shop?

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Have you searched here?

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
How could he hide me here?

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Dali, let's go.

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Dali, let's go.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Brother Shilou, he hates me.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
How could he hide me here?

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Let's see.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I just want to see.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Go on.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Go.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Okay.

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Dali, let's go.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Look.

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
These are the parts that I usually use to repair cars.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
What's this?

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Isn't this the material?

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
You don't know this.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,640
I learned some Chinese to make fun of my dad.

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
But I'm not that good at it.

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Come on.

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Open it.

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Open it.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,640
These are the things that I usually use to repair cars.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Here you are, Brother Shilou.

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Look at the cars and the price of the cars.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
My price.

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Let my brothers be careful.

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
I have everything here.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Come on.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
You're making me come to pay for the car.

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
This guy.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
He didn't put my things in the car.

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Young Master,

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
you've been against my dad since you came back from the factory.

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Why are you changing your attitude recently?

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
You know nothing about it.

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
You love to make noodles.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
No matter how my dad and I quarreled,

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
it's all the same to the father-in-law.

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
You even broke the bones and even the tendon.

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
How can you break it?

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I heard that you're close to the daughter of Xingcheng.

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
You're so shameless.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Don't mention it, Brother Shilou.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
That woman has a few talents.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,640
She always takes the gun in front of me.

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I saw her with some strength at first,

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
so I just let it go.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Now she's gone.

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
She's still pretending to be tall.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
She can't touch me or touch me.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
I don't want to give up.

72
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Tell me.

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Can I still divorce her?

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Can I still give up?

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
No matter how beautiful she is, she's a woman.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
I know her well.

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Tell me.

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Is she a man?

79
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
As long as she has money,

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
she can't just grab a big board.

81
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Fine.

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Dali, let's go.

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Yes.

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Let's go to the next place.

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Let's go.

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Let's go.

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I used to think that you had a bad temper.

88
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
But you want to separate me.

89
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Now it seems that your purpose is not so simple.

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,640
When did you

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,640
get along with that new one?

92
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
You're pretending.

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
You're pretending.

95
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
You're pretending.

96
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Are you angry?

97
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Come on.

98
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Hit me.

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Hit me?

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Look at you.

101
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm warning you.

102
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
From now on,

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
keep your tail and keep your eyes on me.

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
There's something missing.

105
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Leave Guanhai immediately.

106
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I don't care about your life or death.

107
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
But don't be so hard on me.

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm the secretary of the director.

109
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
You don't have to go to my place.

110
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Guanxi,

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
you're already a man.

112
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
You have a temper.

113
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
What can he do if he loves me?

114
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
After marriage,

115
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,640
I still have to give my heart.

116
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Then you have to take a step by step.

117
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Unlike some people,

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
you can only sit and eat.

119
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Qin Jia is just a crazy man.

120
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,640
The debt of the few hundred million is not enough.

121
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
You want to marry Guanxi,

122
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
don't you want to drag Guan Jiayin down?

123
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
How do you know that?

124
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
There's no wall that doesn't have a breakthrough.

125
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Brother,

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
you're like that ghost's mother.

127
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
You'll be everywhere.

128
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
You'll be everywhere.

129
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
I said, don't mention my mother.

130
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm lying.

131
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
That shameless little girl

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
secretly gave birth to you

133
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
to see Qin Jia's door.

134
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Fortunately, God opened her eyes.

135
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
But she made a short wish.

136
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Otherwise,

137
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
she wouldn't die in the hospital,

138
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
but would die in my hands.

139
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Oh, right.

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Your mother still

141
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
went to Qin Jia in the hospital.

142
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Her bones

143
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
were in the head of Qin Jia.

144
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Did you think of your mother

145
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
when you were in the toilet?

146
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Brother,

147
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
you're too early.

148
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
I'll save you.

149
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Why are you so greedy today?

150
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Qin Heng,

151
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
did you find trouble again?

152
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Sometimes,

160
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I feel

161
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
I shouldn't have appeared in this world.

162
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Qin Heng,

163
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
did you say something to yourself?

164
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
When my mother was young,

165
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
she was pretty,

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
and she was in a good mood.

167
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
She wanted to join

168
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
my father.

169
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
After she met my father,

170
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
she wanted to break me

171
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
and secretly gave birth to me

172
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
to take Qin Jia.

173
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I was the tool

174
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
that my mother used to use.

175
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
But she was really good to me.

176
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Even if I had a plan,

177
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
she didn't care about me.

178
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Instead, she learned

179
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
to be her brother.

180
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
She worked hard to live her life.

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
She tried to give me

182
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
the best possible opportunity.

183
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Until the last moment of her life,

184
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
she kneeled on the bed

185
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
and asked me to give birth to her.

186
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
She gave me a baby.

187
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
But I was not good at all

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
at Qin Jia.

189
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Qin Jia is my nightmare.

190
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Didn't you have a choice before?

191
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Now,

192
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
you can get out of nightmare.

193
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
They don't love you.

194
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
You must love yourself more.

195
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
What about you?

196
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
What's your choice?

197
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Qin Heng

198
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
has been so hurry to get married to you.

199
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Qin Heng has been so hurry to get married to you.

200
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,040
I want to take the official's hand

201
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
and fill his debt.

202
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
Are you willing to go to Tianzhi's grave?

203
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,800
Qin's family has debt issues.

204
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
This is Qin's secret.

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Why did you tell me?

206
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,240
Because I don't want to be cheated.

207
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,320
Have you ever cheated on me?

208
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Happy birthday to you.

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,640
Happy birthday to you.

210
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,080
Happy birthday to you.

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
Happy birthday to you.

212
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,360
Happy birthday to you.

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,160
No, today is your birthday.

214
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,000
I prepared strawberry cake for you.

215
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,520
You don't like sour food.

216
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,360
The strawberries I prepared are sweet.

217
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm sure you like them.

218
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
No, let's have a cake

219
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,400
after we blow the candles.

220
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,360
No.

221
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,320
No, I prepared a delicious cake for you.

222
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Why are you here?

223
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Why are you here?

224
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,760
Where is No?

225
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,480
The cake is sweet.

226
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,200
It's sweet.

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,440
I'll ask you one last time.

228
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,040
Where is No?

229
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
The big one is here.

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,760
Be careful.

231
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
Where is No?

232
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Just follow me.

233
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
I'll take you to see him.

234
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,000
How did you find No?

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
It's possible.

236
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,960
You and Qin Shen's contact

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
are just a matter of time.

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,440
Why are you here?

239
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,560
Don't touch him.

240
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,480
Don't worry.

241
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,360
I know him.

242
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,760
He's better than you.

243
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Is this the way to leave the court?

244
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
Where are you taking me?

245
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Stop.

246
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,120
Don't make a scene.

247
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Let me down.

248
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,920
Stop.

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Don't make a scene.

250
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,480
Stop.

251
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
What are you doing?

252
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,480
To be continued

253
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,760
Then I'll find Xiaaitaiやün הח usage.

254
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,840
What do you want to know?

255
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,700
You can directly come to ask me.

256
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,200
I...

257
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,360
don't know.

258
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,140
No matter what you explain,

259
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,300
it's meaningless.

260
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,740
You're a good hiding place.

261
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,300
It's good that I can relax you completely.

262
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,740
Even if there are a few moments

263
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,460
that tell me that you have a problem,

264
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,900
I still choose to believe you.

265
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,820
I thought we were connected.

266
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,700
But actually,

267
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,700
everything is a lie.

268
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,100
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,820
I have to do something.

270
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Since it's like this,

271
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,260
you don't have to apologize to me.

272
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm the one who lost the game.

273
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,860
You shouldn't have lied to me.

274
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,380
Hurry up.

275
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,420
I really never wanted to kill you.

276
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,820
I'm trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

277
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,820
I'm missing you a little bit in my chest.

278
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I'm hiding in my eyes.

279
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I don't care about anything.

280
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Even if the light of the starry night is gone.

281
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,820
The world is falling into the lie.

282
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,820
What should I do to escape?

283
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,820
I'm afraid that the face will turn into a lost face.

284
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,820
It will break the pieces of the ground.

285
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
You said that time is a lie.

286
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,820
It's better to go to the end.

287
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,820
I'm trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

288
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm crying and I'm sad.

289
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,820
You laugh and I'm sad.

290
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
A moment of mutual respect.

291
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,820
The blue sky is left behind.

292
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,820
The world is falling into the lie.

293
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,820
What should I do to escape?

294
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,820
I'm afraid that the face will turn into a lost face.

295
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,820
It will break the pieces of the ground.

296
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
You said that time is a lie.

297
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,820
It's better to go to the end.

298
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

299
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm crying and I'm sad.

300
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
You laugh and I'm sad.

301
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,820
A moment of mutual respect.

302
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,820
The blue sky is left behind.

303
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,820
I'm trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

304
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Your face will turn into a lost face.

305
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,820
You said that time is a lie.

306
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,820
It's better to go to the end.

307
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,820
I'm trying to use this color to hypnotize you.

308
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,820
I'm crying and I'm sad.

309
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,820
You laugh and I'm sad.

310
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,820
A moment of mutual respect.

311
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,820
The blue sky is left behind.
