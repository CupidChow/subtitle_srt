1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,940
Thank you for here.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Stop running away

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,160
Where are they all

4
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,140
Governor you can't just die

5
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,300
Don't stand there and run away

6
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,480
Brother,leave here

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,980
Just leave already

8
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,080
Come back

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
They are chasing us

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,280
I really can't get away with them

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,380
Leave from this place

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,080
Now,leave

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,980
Leave

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,600
No!

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
I'll come back and save you.

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,160
I promise.

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,560
Zeng He, run!

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,880
Chase him!

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
Don't come back!

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,800
Chase him!

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
Don't let him run!

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,600
Yes!

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,000
You're so rude!

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Don't run!

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,760
I told you not to run!

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,560
Lian'an!

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,160
You're a big shot!

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,320
Anu!

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,840
Dad!

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,440
What are you doing?

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,480
He's a kid!

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,360
A kid?

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,240
You're a kid now.

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
How dare you run away from that kid?

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,320
You're so dead!

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,520
If you dare to touch us again,

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
I'll kill you!

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,960
Anu, did you see that?

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,280
Don't be afraid.

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,520
We'll be home soon.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,720
Anu!

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
That kid is a thief!

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,960
We've been looking for him all night.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
You're a bunch of scum!

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
He must be hiding in the mountain.

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,920
Yes.

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,320
I don't believe he can get away

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,680
by killing me.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,520
And,

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,320
I've told you

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
about this.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
You can't let Brother Peng know about this!

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,760
Who?

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
What can't I know?

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,200
Why are you here, Brother Peng?

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,520
You're all useless!

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,480
You're all useless!

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Brother,

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,720
what's wrong?

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
Why are you so angry?

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,640
Someone called the police in the factory.

63
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,080
You didn't even notice!

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,000
We're all useless.

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
Brother Peng, it's impossible!

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
He's not that quick!

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,680
Xingcheng,

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
what do you think of me?

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I've been feeding you all day long.

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,920
I treat you like my brother.

71
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Look at me.

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,480
You're so stubborn.

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,680
Dad! Dad!

75
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
A few days ago,

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
you said you were going to the typhoon.

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,160
My brothers didn't notice.

78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
You were so sneaky.

79
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
What did you say to that woman?

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
What did you say?

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
Dad!

82
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,360
Come here!

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,840
Dad!

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,200
Dad!

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,480
Dad!

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Thank goodness.

87
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm not a hero.

88
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,280
Or you'd be the one who got me.

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm begging you!

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,440
Don't hit Dad!

91
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,960
All right?

92
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,080
Don't hit me.

93
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Go!

94
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,120
Don't get in his way.

95
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Don't hit me!

96
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,000
Go.

97
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,320
Dad!

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,440
No!

99
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,320
Dad!

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,320
Dad!

101
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,160
Dad!

102
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,520
Dad!

103
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,800
Dad!

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Dad!

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
No!

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,680
No!

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
No!

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
No!

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
No!

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
No!

111
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
No!

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
No!

113
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Anong was hit so hard

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
that she had a coma

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,680
and mistook her for me.

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
You promised her.

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Why didn't you go back and save her?

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I was dragged out of that hole.

119
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
And my father sent someone to chase me.

120
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I was hiding and running in the mountains.

121
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
I couldn't tell the direction.

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
After two days,

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
I passed out.

124
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I was unconscious.

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
I woke up three days later.

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Shi Touge saved me.

127
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
He told me

128
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
the police destroyed the factory

129
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
and saved everyone.

130
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
You're the son of Guan Shanhai.

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Why did you fall into that factory?

132
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Because...

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Because the factory gave your father

134
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
the blood of Hua Hua.

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
It's my mother's blood.

136
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Read the divorce agreement.

137
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Sign it if you have no problem.

138
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Ayu,

139
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
why are you so anxious?

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
We made a deal.

141
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
I'll give you blood.

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
You'll agree to divorce.

143
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Are you not curious

144
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
what I did with your blood?

145
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Does it work?

146
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Have you ever said a word of truth?

147
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
From the day you approached me,

148
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
everything was a lie

149
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
you had carefully designed.

150
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
It doesn't matter.

151
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Ayu,

152
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
you just need to know that I love you.

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
You... you don't love me.

154
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
You love yourself.

155
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Guan Shanhai,

156
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I don't care what you want to do.

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
It has nothing to do with me.

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I just want to divorce now.

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I did all this for you.

160
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I made a gift with your blood.

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
When you see that gift,

162
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
you'll be happy.

163
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
At that time, you'll understand

164
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
that I'm the only one in the world who loves you the most.

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
You're not a dog.

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Only I can give you the whole world.

167
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Let me go.

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Ayu.

169
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Guan Shanhai took my mother's blood.

170
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
I can only follow the clues.

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,340
I chased the

172
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
I just want to know

173
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
what gift Guan Shanhai gave my mother.

174
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
I only found out later

175
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
that painting.

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
What kind of gift is this?

177
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
It's just Guan Shanhai himself.

178
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
He wants to satisfy his selfishness.

179
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
He likes the painting of the white bird on Mount Maqing.

180
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
But he can't find the truth.

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
So he wants to make a fake one.

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
He wants to fill his heart with desire.

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Even that paint

184
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
is my mother's blood.

185
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Then

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,680
if all this is true,

187
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
why did you fake Anu?

188
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Where is my sister?

189
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Anu

190
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
died a long time ago.

191
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
What?

192
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
What I said is true.

193
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
That bad guy bullied me.

194
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Why no one believes me?

195
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
It's him. It's him.

196
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
He bullied my father.

197
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
He bullied me.

198
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
There's a butterfly on his waist.

199
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Anu, I miss you.

200
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Anu

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
After Anu came back from the factory,

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
he was in a bad state.

203
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
He kept talking about

204
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
that bad guy in the diary.

205
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
But no one believed him.

206
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
It happened so suddenly.

207
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
We were afraid you couldn't accept it.

208
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
So we hid the dead body.

209
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
When he went to the lake,

210
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
where was I at that time?

211
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Why didn't I stay with him?

212
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Where was I?

213
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
You were still young at that time.

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
You were busy with your father's business.

215
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
It's normal to be careless.

216
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Plus,

217
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
we hid the dead body.

218
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
It's my fault.

219
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Don't blame yourself.

220
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
The ward in the Liao family doesn't exist.

221
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
The ward doesn't like to see people.

222
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
And the ward doesn't like to talk.

223
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
It's been a long time.

224
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
It's hard for you to kill the bad guys.

225
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Xinyue,

226
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I know.

228
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Even if there are thousands of reasons,

229
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
it's all lies.

230
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Although it's a lie,

231
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
but because of Anong,

232
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
it gave me a lot of comfort.

233
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
It's him

234
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
who allowed me to go all the way.

235
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
I hate your lies.

236
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
But I'm grateful for your lies.

237
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
I don't understand.

238
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
You've been working on the game for so long.

239
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Why do you want to take my chess piece

240
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
from the chessboard?

241
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
I know you want to find out the truth.

242
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
You want to get back the painting of father.

243
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
But Guan Shanhai already knows

244
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
what you really are.

245
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
He's not capable.

246
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
He can't be removed from the game.

247
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
He can't be removed from the game.

248
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm not a tiger.

249
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm a tiger.

250
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
How can I see the truth

251
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
if I don't play?

252
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
You haven't slept all day.

253
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Take a break.

254
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
It's okay.

255
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
It's no use being so anxious.

256
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
He doesn't contact you now.

257
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Give him some time to calm down.

258
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
He must be angry with me.

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
If I'm bullied by you,

260
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
I'll kill you.

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
He's angry.

262
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
It means he cares.

263
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
When we were kids,

264
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
we were very close.

265
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
We were separated by a wall.

266
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
We were always running around

267
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
in the streets.

268
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
We were always running around

269
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
with our cats and dogs.

270
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I remember we played house-to-house.

271
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
He was the mother.

272
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
I was the father.

273
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
The stray dog on the street

274
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
was our mother.

275
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Why are you looking at me?

276
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Are you afraid I'll get jealous?

277
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
You know that.

278
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
You just treat her as your sister.

279
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
No.

280
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I like her.

281
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
You like her?

282
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
When your mother died,

283
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
you were forced to enter the Qin family.

284
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
You were always ignored

285
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
and ignored by others.

286
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
You lived with no dignity

287
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
and no sense of existence.

288
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Later, when Xin Yi's family was in trouble,

289
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
you made yourself

290
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
the savior of her.

291
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
You found satisfaction

292
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
and value in her.

293
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
You proved that you were needed.

294
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
A poor person

295
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
saved another poor person.

296
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
You told me it was love.

297
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
If it was true love,

298
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
none of those things would happen between us.

299
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
You don't understand.

300
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
You didn't understand yourself.

301
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
I'm sorry.

304
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
The End
