seung suggests

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Stop hitting him.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop hitting him.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Stop hitting him.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Stop hitting him.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hate crying the most.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're trying to save me now.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm in a bad mood.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He's the best when he smiles.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't laugh at me.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you're happy, stop hitting him.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Smile.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How can you laugh at me?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can't be happy.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Smile.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Smile.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Stop laughing.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 19

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Senior, let me go to the post office.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're a good judge.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not that easy to do it.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I heard that you've been close to Guan Huai recently.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What? You want to fly to the top as a phoenix?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Too bad, Guan's son is not a good choice.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Some people want to be in the water.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Senior, are you introducing me to the top?

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My shoes are dirty.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I'm clean.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm here to be an assistant.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My assistant is going to wipe my shoes.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you willing to do that?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you're not willing, you can leave.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is Jianji, one of the most equally beautiful ski resort in this world.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We can't really swim here.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,240
We can

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
be friends.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,720
I didn't mean to.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,760
Xue.

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
Interesting.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
Xinyi.

44
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Sorry.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
I didn't mean to.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,880
You...

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Xue.

48
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Don't worry about it.

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
I won't quit.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,280
Did you really quit?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Let's walk and see.

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
Last time I tried

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,360
to beat up my painting,

54
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,920
he Control showed

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,680
that I can't paint anymore.

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,800
Though he medieval

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I've already made myself a home.

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,600
The white bird picture that father drew

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
is very likely to be hidden in the golden house.

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,760
If you want to find the golden house,

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,920
find that painting,

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
you must get the trust of Guan Shan Hai.

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
And Xu Rui's half-dollars

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
must be removed as soon as possible.

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Who?

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,740
I already gathered back your pity.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,720
Come here and kill me!

68
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,240
That's pretty good.

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,160
Feel free to ask for me.

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Now that your feet have reached your feet,

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
遊看我的心.

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,720
On the other hand,

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,420
cast aside already and have time

74
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,980
to get revenge.

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Instead of Dong Ping's remnants

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,680
and a little sister-in-law.

77
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,160
Zhu Shikong.

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,600
I work as a priestess today.

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,480
Robbery?

80
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,280
Of course!

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,360
Very ordinary!

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
You think I'm a priestess?

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,480
Xiao!

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,880
I dare not.

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
I dare not, Grandpa.

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Grandpa, I'm wrong.

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm wrong.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
I dare not.

89
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,080
I'm wrong.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,320
He's not your little brother.

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,480
Let me see you

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
turn around.

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,440
I'll bite your eyes.

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
Lure the young stick.

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:26,560
Xiao happened to

96
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
sleep here

97
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
You didn't see anything just now, did you?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,880
From the first time I saw you,

100
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,680
I knew you weren't a good person.

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,200
Are you afraid that I shouldn't see anything?

102
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
It's not what you think.

103
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,760
This...

104
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Wu Chi!

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
Keep going.

106
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,920
I'll treat you straight.

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
I'll treat her straight.

108
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,240
Heart.

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,680
ariamente sacrificed himself to give national leadership

110
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,660
and hold his monaska

111
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,460
for ten thousand years.

112
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,440
TheOffence

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,820
Please solved.

114
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,940
Purchase the embraced financial report.

115
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,300
I've got to see it before I leave.

116
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,340
Tonight, I'm removingtrend ingotstrygn.

117
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,340
Inter uprising together with Care manual on Anxia.

118
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,260
This is my secret.

119
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,380
Mr. Guan,

120
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,860
this is my solution.

121
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,100
Qin's business is so big.

122
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,620
It's not as good as falling into the trap.

123
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,260
Mr. Guan, please don't make me worry.

124
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,660
You know that

125
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,940
Qin's business is so big,

126
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,940
you can't fool me.

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,300
Sorry, I'm being too harsh.

128
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,340
You might not believe me.

129
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,500
Actually, I've been following you.

130
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,300
When you were 17,

131
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,620
you were able to get into the top English school.

132
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
After graduation,

133
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,900
you've been studying in the Wall Street and Singapore.

134
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,700
After you entered Guanghai,

135
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,700
you started from the base level.

136
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,700
You've been doing this for three years,

137
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,020
and you're still in this position.

138
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,900
Others might think that

139
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,660
you're the father of Guanghai.

140
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,140
But I know that

141
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,780
you're the one who can get back

142
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,140
the memories of Guanghai.

143
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,820
You know better than me.

144
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,500
You're also very nice.

145
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,780
I can't get into the trap.

146
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,140
So I can only get out of it.

147
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,340
My goal is you.

148
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
So I hope

149
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,340
I can learn from you

150
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,260
in a place near you.

151
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,420
Being my secretary

152
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,140
is not as crazy as you think.

153
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,900
Although it's a temporary position,

154
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,820
it's hard to do my job.

155
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,540
No problem.

156
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,020
I'm the least afraid of it.

157
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,540
Does Qin Jiang know that you're here?

158
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,220
They don't care about me.

159
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,940
So I don't need to know.

160
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,820
Do you have any problems

161
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,940
with your term of term?

162
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,940
No problem.

163
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,340
I can get into the job now.

164
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,940
Sister Xue.

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,860
I've been here for a few days.

166
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,820
Should I arrange some work for me?

167
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,740
I'm not worried

168
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
if I don't work with money.

169
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,780
I can't hold it back.

170
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,500
I was quite proud of it.

171
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,180
If you have to keep it secret,

172
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,940
I'm afraid that

173
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,260
Sister Xue won't tell boring questions.

174
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,540
You want to suppress me?

175
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
OK.

176
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,460
I need some kind of an excuse.

177
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,580
I've heard that

178
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,180
in the highland, there's a kind of scarf,

179
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,780
anarchist businesses can be adjusted.

180
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Then please help me find the assistant.

181
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Xinyi!

182
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
Xinyi!

183
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
Xinyi!

184
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm here!

185
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Xinyi!

186
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I'm here!

187
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Are you okay? Get up!

188
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Can you still walk?

189
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm fine. I just broke my nose.

190
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Why did I say that? Are you stupid?

191
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
Why did Xu Ruo ask you to go with him?

192
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
You're in such a big trouble. Are you going to die here?

193
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,780
He's like a housekeeper to me.

194
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
If I don't do this,

195
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
I can't get to work properly.

196
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Work is important. Life is important.

197
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
You're wearing this?

198
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Forget it.

199
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Get up!

200
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,780
Get up!

201
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,780
I'm not going to give you any more training.

202
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Be careful.

203
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,780
Are you okay?

204
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
Are you okay?

205
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
Hold this for me.

206
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
I'll go up first.

207
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
No, no!

208
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
Get down!

209
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,780
It's raining heavily.

210
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780
We'll all get stuck here.

211
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
You step on me and go up.

212
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
What about you?

213
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Go up first.

214
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Pull me up.

215
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Sister!

216
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
The rain here is heavy.

217
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Everything will get wet soon.

218
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
No one will know what happened here.

219
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,780
What did you hear?

220
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
The rain is so heavy.

221
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
Sister, you must help me.

222
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
I'm sorry.

227
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
I'm sorry.
