00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,140
Alright.

00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,020
Available at internet.co.nl

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,280
When my heart fl قال It was enough

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,720
pharmacy

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,840
Are you alright?

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Try it again.

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,440
I don't like women.

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
What are you doing?

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,920
Mr. Guan.

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,840
Xin Yi.

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
Xin Yi didn't find the materials I wanted.

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,920
I need someone else to replace me.

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,240
Xin Yi.

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,800
Apologize to Xu Ru.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Guan.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
I refuse.

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,880
Don't make things worse.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
Who is the fool?

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,760
Xin Yi was caught by a fish last night.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,640
She finally found the materials.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,600
She was caught on her feet.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
I asked Xin Yi to come to Qiyuan.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
I didn't come to be a maid for her.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,760
Isn't that what the assistant does?

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,120
If you can't bear it, you can leave.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,800
Isn't the assistant a human being?

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,400
Isn't the assistant a criminal?

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
You're a non-assistant assistant.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
You're not the only one affected.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,080
You have a relationship with Guan Nuo and Guan Hai.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,720
What are you?

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
You're not qualified to teach me.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,840
Enough.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,080
My dad asked you to come here to make paintings.

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,920
He didn't want you to fight.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,240
If this is spread to my dad's ears,

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,680
you'll take everything away.

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,880
You're not a impulsive person.

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,680
Did Xu Ru tell you something?

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,880
I don't care how he gave me the job.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,160
But I can't bear to insult my dad.

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,560
I know.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Your family is your limit.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,440
Why do you care about the assistant?

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
You...

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,120
You don't want me to take her in?

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,680
I said that

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,040
I can only go on my own.

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,520
I don't want you to get into my relationship with Guan Jia.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,600
Don't worry.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,240
I did all this for myself.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,000
With my current status and status,

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
Qin Jia will definitely not care about my death.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
There's a relationship between Guan Jia and Qin Jia.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,080
I can learn some business from Guan Xin.

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
With your ability,

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,280
even if you don't depend on Qin Jia,

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
you will definitely succeed.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Xin Yi.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,000
Hands up, Xin Yi.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,880
What are you doing?

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
It's not because of you.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,600
I was in a hurry to find you yesterday.

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,960
I didn't even close the door.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,160
That's because I was a mess.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
I couldn't help myself.

67
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,880
So...

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
You have to be responsible for me.

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,800
What's the matter with your family?

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,160
I live in a new family.

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
I'm not a new person.

72
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,840
I live in a new family.

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,000
What's the relationship with you?

74
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,320
She didn't even talk to me.

75
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,240
What do you want to do?

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
The whole city is a hotel.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
If you don't have money,

78
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll pay you.

79
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,000
You want to be a manager?

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
Fine.

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,760
Give me a hundred thousand dollars.

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll see if I can do it.

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,200
If you don't have money,

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,640
then shut up.

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
What's the relationship with Xin Yi?

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,160
I can't let you be a manager.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,200
I want to be with her.

88
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,880
We grew up together.

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
Besides,

90
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,280
you don't want a man to be famous.

91
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,160
He wants you.

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
I didn't have any good ideas.

93
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,880
You've been talking about it here for a long time.

94
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,320
I really thought you were her boyfriend.

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't have any good ideas.

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
What do you want?

97
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,840
You have good ideas.

98
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,080
But you don't have any.

99
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
I...

100
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Say it again.

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Say it again.

102
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
It's not me.

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720
He pushed me.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
Qin Shen, go back first.

105
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I'll handle this.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
It's obvious.

107
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
I know how to handle it.

108
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,640
Fine.

109
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,840
Call me if you need anything.

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,520
Take care.

111
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,080
Be careful.

112
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,880
Look at him.

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
He's too violent.

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
You should have told him earlier.

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
He pushed me.

116
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,120
Who told you to do it?

117
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Say it.

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,200
What do you want?

119
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
My pants are so dirty.

120
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,040
I think your arm is really nice.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,880
How about this?

122
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,280
I'll give you 500 yuan a month.

123
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,320
I'll take care of the laundry and cook.

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
You won't do it.

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,960
When you're done with the laundry,

126
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
go back.

127
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,440
It's good.

128
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
But my wound is not healed.

129
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
Someone's crime is serious.

130
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

131
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,280
What do you mean?

132
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,880
I'm a dog.

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,840
I'm a chicken.

134
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,920
I'll get back.

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,520
Xu Ru.

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
You have a good taste.

137
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
I don't know what you're thinking.

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,720
If you don't want to be taken away by him,

139
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,880
don't let my dad down.

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Xu Ru.

141
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
You're jealous of me.

142
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,160
It's just to cover up your failure and incompetence.

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,280
I won't say.

144
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I'll tell you.

145
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I'll tell you.

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll tell you.

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,840
I'll tell you.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll tell you.

149
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I'll tell you.

150
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll tell you.

151
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I'll tell you.

152
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
I'll tell you.

153
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
I'll tell you.

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,400
I can't tell you.

155
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,720
I won't tell you.

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,320
I won't tell you.

157
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,680
Beauty is a pig.

158
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,920
Beauty is a pig.

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,040
What's used is beauty.

160
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,080
Would you like to write a poem first?

161
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,560
Sorry.

162
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,560
encourageCan you?

163
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
почему?

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,600
Woke you?

165
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,120
Can I...

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,240
Can I die?

167
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,040
Quickly get out.

168
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,600
Revenge.

169
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,720
Maybe I already made you shoot me first.

170
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
Why are you still vowels these words?

171
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,500
Besides,

172
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,940
when will I need your backup?

173
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,340
In our plan,

174
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,960
you are not following the same course with Xin Yi.

175
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,180
That plan

176
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,340
haven'tもしou cheff變 про который.

177
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,320
So,

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
it's over.

179
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,160
Frankly speaking,

180
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,020
we all exchanged one 진짜 所以網道 someone else telling you

181
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,180
an important information.

182
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,600
It seems that Xin Yi has a Blue Heart Guide.

183
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,540
He cannot get in goods.

184
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,680
But I found out that I can help her to relieve her anger.

185
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,680
So I must stay with her and wait for her to die.

186
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Impossible.

187
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Qing Yi wouldn't let me go.

188
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,680
You are just her friend.

189
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Why would she tell you?

190
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,680
You are so stubborn.

191
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Xin Yi is different from you.

193
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
She loves me.

194
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
She can't love me.

195
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Why are there so many drafts?

197
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
I've never drawn before.

198
00:09:48,680 --> 00:10:07,680
She seems to want to make a special red.

199
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Guan.

200
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,680
You still want me to go home after drinking this much?

201
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Actually, you don't have to help me with the interview.

202
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I've seen a lot of these.

203
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I saw you exchange the food for hot milk two days ago.

204
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
I know you must be angry.

205
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,680
If you want to drink, you must be uncomfortable.

206
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
You are very thoughtful.

207
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Of course.

208
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
You are already engaged.

209
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Why are you still looking for me?

210
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm looking for Guan Zi.

211
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
You still care about this?

212
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Who doesn't care?

213
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
That's Mr. Guan from Guan Hai Group.

214
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm sorry for being so careless.

215
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Mr. Guan?

216
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
He's just a nice person.

217
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Even if he works hard,

218
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
and does his job well,

219
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm afraid he still wants to marry her.

220
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
When he comes to my family,

221
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,680
he still has to wash clothes and cook for me.

222
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
He's a little bit of a stranger.

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Mr. Guan is so beautiful.

224
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
You are also willing to marry him?

225
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
How beautiful.

226
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
What's so beautiful about him?

227
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
He's always so busy.

228
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680
He doesn't have any feelings for me.

229
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
If it weren't for my kindness,

230
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
who else would want it?

231
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Don't listen.

232
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Don't look.

233
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Sit down.

234
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Sit down.

235
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Who's that?

236
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Are you crazy?

237
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
To protect me,

238
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Xu Ru is really heart-broken.

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
She's been back to the garden all night.

240
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
This is...

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Bai Niang Zheng Chuan Tu.

242
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
What's this?

243
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
I don't know.

244
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm not sure.

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I don't know.

246
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680

I don't know.

252
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
I don't know.

253
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Mr. Guan is drawing a poem

254
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
just to draw this painting.

255
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
No!

256
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Why still no?

257
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Why must you have a person in your house?

258
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Who's there?

259
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Who are you?

260
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Who are you?

261
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm not sure.

262
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
I don't know.

263
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680

Okay?

365
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Not after.

366
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Okay.

367
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Can you listen?

368
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Yes, sir.
