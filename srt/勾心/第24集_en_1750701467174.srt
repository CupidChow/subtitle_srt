00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
conclusion

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
If you didn't meet each other in the factory,

3
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
there wouldn't be the following events.

4
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,920
Maybe I can get this painting

5
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
and love him.

6
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,760
Tianyu.

7
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,480
Tianyi.

8
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
I've done so much.

9
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
Nothing is left.

10
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,400
In the factory,

11
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,240
nothing is left.

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,720
We met each other.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,360
seventime

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Xinyi.

15
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,400
Poison.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The person in the factory that year...

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's me.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Go to hell!

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mom!

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let me out!

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In this world,

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
there is no Anu.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
My name is

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Xin Yi Nu.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That summer,

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the person who got on the car of my father

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
was me.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In that factory,

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the person who experienced all the pain was me.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The person who knew Guan Huai and the person who knew Xiao Yi was also me.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
After returning from the factory,

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I had a serious mental problem.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was saved and returned.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But since then,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Xin Yi Nu became two people.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sister Xin Yi

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and sister Anu.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I became Sister Xin Yi

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and let sister Anu

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
bear all the pain and nightmares.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Only in this way,

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I had the courage to move forward.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Only then, I could complete

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Xin Yi and Anu's revenge.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was saved.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was saved.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was saved.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was saved.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was saved.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I was saved.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was saved.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was saved.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I was saved.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was saved.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was saved.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was saved.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was saved.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I was saved.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Anu,

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
let's go to the big city, okay?

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello?

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The doctor said that she had a separation identity disorder.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This kind of psychological disease is likely to be lost.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But this has been going on for so long.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know if she's still alive.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know if she's still alive.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know if she's still alive.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know if she's still alive.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know if she's still alive.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's been so long since she heard about this.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In her heart,

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Xin Yi and Anu are two people.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Her subconscious is still protecting herself.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we have to keep playing the game with her.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But lies are lies.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There will always be a day when she is exposed.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When will that game be over?

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When she's ready.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When she's ready,

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
we'll help her find herself.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,920
siehtsees

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are my best friend.

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Now,

85
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
you are by my side.

86
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,280
Zhila.

87
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,280
I know you love me.

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,800
But I have to face

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,440
many things alone.

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,720
Let's go.

91
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,000
Go!

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Three days later

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,300
This is not working.

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,580
They only give any dont tell to let me know.

95
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,840
I got tricked and standards

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
You're making me tired.

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm going to Southeast Asia to fight the wind.

98
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
It's you again.

99
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
You still have the face to see me.

100
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
You're a heartless bastard.

101
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
The Qin family is not sorry for you.

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
It's your little third mother

103
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
who took you back to the Qin family.

104
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
She treated you like a dog.

105
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
But in the end,

106
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
you joined the outsiders to punish me.

107
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
I never thought of going to the Qin family.

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I don't care about your family.

109
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
You speak well.

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
When did you treat me like a human?

111
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
When I was a human?

112
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
You're not good enough.

113
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Your mother is a bitch.

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
You're a bastard.

115
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I get it now.

116
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
You're in the Qin family

117
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
and you're pretending to be a fool in front of your father.

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
You're so careless.

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
You want to mess with the Qin family.

120
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
You want to hurt me.

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
You did what you did.

122
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
You're not going to do it.

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
You're being punished by God.

124
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
You're all doing it.

125
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
What does it have to do with me?

126
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You bastard.

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Let me go.

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Stop fighting.

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Let me go.

130
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Let me go.

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
You bastard.

132
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Let me go.

133
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
You're the punishment for your father.

134
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Mom.

135
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Mom.

136
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Look who I brought.

137
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
She's Anu.

138
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Your senior's daughter.

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Maybe

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
she'll be your daughter-in-law in the future.

141
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Please bless me

142
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
to learn from her.

143
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Madam Mingyu.

144
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Madam Mingyu.

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I heard from my father that you're a gentle, smart and talented person.

146
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I've always wanted to meet you.

147
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
I finally have a chance today.

148
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Mom.

149
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
You're free.

150
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
The company has officially declared bankruptcy.

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
The chairman, Jie Heng, was suspected of participating in illegal activities

152
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
and was suspended from the company.

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
The chairman of the company, Guan Shanhai,

154
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
was suspected of being under the influence of the former chairman

155
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
and was investigated for a case.

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
The artist's painting used in Guanhai

157
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
was deliberately hurt the most recently.

158
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
No need.

159
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
No matter who he is,

160
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
he's the most important person in the world.

161
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm not going to let you go.

162
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm not going to let you go.

163
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
No matter who he is,

164
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
he has to pay for his mistakes.

165
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
We're here.

166
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
It seems we're early.

167
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
The exhibition will start in an hour.

168
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Let's go.

169
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Let's go.

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I used to be too weak

171
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
and didn't have the courage to face the pain.

172
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I could only choose to escape.

173
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
But now,

174
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
I can face the past with a calm mind

175
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
and embrace my wounds with a calm mind.

176
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
All this time,

177
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
I've been looking for the truth

178
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
and I've been looking for my true self.

179
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Fortunately,

180
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I did it.

181
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Your exhibition

182
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
is much more interesting than the one I gave you.

183
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Congratulations.

184
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
You've fulfilled your dream.

185
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
My dream

186
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
was already fulfilled in that forest.

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
I told you before

188
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
that when all this is over,

189
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
I have something to tell you.

190
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I know

191
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
what you want to tell me.

192
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,840
I've been thinking about you all day.

193
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I don't need to tell you

194
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,840
that I hope we'll meet again one day.

195
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
They're here again.

196
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Leave them alone.

197
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
It's an hour away from the exhibition.

198
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,840
The world has fallen into absurdity

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,840
How should I compromise?

205
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm afraid that my face

206
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
will become a test

207
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,840
and break into pieces

208
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,840
You said that the story would eventually turn upside down

209
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Why don't we make it a clear line?

210
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm not at peace

211
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,840
but I'm trying to change the subject

212
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm crying and I'm holding my hands

213
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,840
You're smiling and turning around

214
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,840
A blurry scene

215
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
The deep sea becomes blue sky

216
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,840
The night is left

217
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,840
The world has fallen into absurdity

218
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,840
How should I compromise?

219
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I'm afraid that my face

220
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,840
will become a test

221
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,840
and break into pieces

222
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,840
You said that the story would eventually turn upside down

223
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Why don't we make it a clear line?

224
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
I'm not at peace

225
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,840
but I'm trying to change the subject

226
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm crying and I'm holding my hands

227
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,840
You're smiling and turning around

228
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,840
A blurry scene

229
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,840
The deep sea becomes blue sky

230
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
The night is left

231
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm afraid that my face

232
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,840
will become a test

233
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Your back is full of tears

234
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,840
but it's a lie

235
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,840
You said that the story would eventually turn upside down

236
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Why don't we make it a clear line?

237
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
I'm not at peace

238
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,840
but I'm trying to change the subject

239
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I'm crying and I'm holding my hands

240
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,840
You're smiling and turning around

241
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,840
A blurry scene

242
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
The deep sea becomes blue sky

243
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
The night is left

244
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
The End
