1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Holy It is 2021 growers

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 1

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's still the day after we go home.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So many days.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ji Yi, are you okay?

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You just sat down like that? You didn't even explain?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm fine.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The person who sent you the message last time

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
asked you to save me was him.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I thought you already guessed it.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you saying that I'm good at acting?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or that we're not close?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's because you always keep your word.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who keeps it word?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've been away for so many days.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've never seen a pile of enthusiasm.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The official's eldest daughter is concerned.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She's leaving the official house.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She's leaving the family with her family.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The family's uncle and aunt are so close.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They're so mean.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You want to drag me out?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You said you don't have anyone to be my brother-in-law.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't just want to be my brother-in-law.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You want me to be your brother-in-law?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think you're not that kind of person.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You want to be my brother-in-law now?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Enough. Stop kidding me.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where have you been these days?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're dead.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's just a misunderstanding.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Things are all over now.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sitting here today

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to prove that I know your plan and purpose.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Guang Huan,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
no matter what happens in the future,

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you don't have to hide it from me anymore.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We're family. You can trust me.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're right.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm just a coward.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want to admit it.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I've always known that there's a conflict between my parents.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I also know that my mother wants to leave.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I'm too strong.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I really want to get her recognition.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I chose to avoid the problem.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I didn't expect that

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I would only be able to solve the problem.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I feel sorry for my mother.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I feel sorry for myself.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I think it through.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't want to be the perfect daughter of the director.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I just want to be concerned.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Zhu Fan,

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Zhu Fan,

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
what are you doing?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's have a toast.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're all on the same boat.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's late.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Xin Yi,

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
actually,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can explain everything to you.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Guang Huan already told me everything.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He's not the person in the diary.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been gone for a long time.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
For so many years,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you've been working for me.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Do you hate me?

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will be mad at you and blame you.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But I won't hate you.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As a friend,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
you've done this for me.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I should be grateful to you.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Friend?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're looking for the value

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and satisfaction from him.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's why you're proven that you're needed.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A pitiful person

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
is the only one who's pitiful.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tell me this is love.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't want to be your friend.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're so smart.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Have you never guessed it?

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I like you.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't like you.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's the same feeling.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because we're the same kind of people.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I know what it feels like

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to really like someone.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
When you don't want to kiss him,

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
it's the beginning of your heart.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Xin Yi,

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
come and have a look.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've got my hands dirty.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What if I get a cold?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I told you to let me wash it.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Here.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Give it to me.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You wash it.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll let you do it.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's okay.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Stop it.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I miss them.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I miss them too.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's make a public road for them.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The meeting is about to start.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They haven't found it yet.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you want to draw my paintings?

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mr. Guan,

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we've asked Young Master Zhao

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to find the address.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He didn't find the heart.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You mean Guan Huai lied to you?

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Who said I lied to him?

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mr. Shi Tou,

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
don't push me.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Look who's here.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This woman is so good at running like a dog.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I caught her when I was chasing Zhu Guang Zhen.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let go of me.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You said you were going all the way.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Can you change your words?

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're going to make me do it, right?

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't force me to do it.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Guan Huai.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Guan Huai.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You didn't tell me

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
about Zhu Guang Zhen before.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The head of the company

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
said he was going to change

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Zhu Guang Zhen.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What can I do?

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I lost my phone.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Dad, I lost my phone

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
because I was chasing him.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Look at my hand.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's gone.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a broken dress.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a business.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let go of me.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Xin Yi.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't worry.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I won't hurt you.

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just want the beauty's formula

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to help me.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No way.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're dead.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Xin Yi.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm not going to make you suffer.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You've been doing business for money.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We're in a bad mood.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why are you making this up?

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What do you want the beauty to do?

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want to be a beauty.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you want the beauty to do?

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you want to keep painting the leaf?

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Maybe

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
sometimes it's fake.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's possible that it's real.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mr. Guan.

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Stop talking nonsense.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll just have to get my hands on it.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's not necessary.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't have to bother me.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll do it.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll do it.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll do it

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
with his new old man.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm leaving.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let go of me.

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let go of me.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let go of me.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let go of me.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let go of me.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let go of me.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We're in a bad mood.

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's the point of you?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't waste my money.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't drink and eat.

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you doing?

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm just joking.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Get out of my way.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't touch me.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I advise you to save some strength.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You'll be in trouble later.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Get out of my way.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's someone outside.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There's someone.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Dear Xiao.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dear Xiao.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Listen to me.

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll be gentle.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I've long wanted to taste your taste.

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Xin Yi.

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You finally got my hand.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want to see

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
whether it's your mouth or my tongue.

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let go of me.

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're a thief.

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I...

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Are you okay?

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How are you?

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm fine.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You...

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why did you go out so early?

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm begging you.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm begging you.

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you worth it now?

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm telling you.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If you don't give me a painting,

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
you'll be punished by me.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll draw.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll draw.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I promise you.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll draw for you.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're still lying, right?

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're injured.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What else do you want to draw?

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I...

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I said,

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll draw for you.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to draw for you.

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't be too hard on me.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's useless to keep her.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll draw for you.

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

234
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
One hour.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The stall is lit.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's because

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
it's too late to start painting.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Alright.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
lousy work.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,900
iffsb!

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Gosh.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Forgive me.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't even take a photo of your painting!

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's only one more part you'd like to take with me.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why should we create 1.5 Jeans?

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Your Majesty.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is also a safety consideration.

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Uncle, this is Mrs. Lan Ke.

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The collector of White Bird's True Love.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Mr. Guan, Jiüya.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hello.

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'd like to thank you for providing us with this piece of water and protection

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to show us the true love of White Bird's True Love.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
My greatest wish in this life

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is to be able to read the true love of White Bird's True Love.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'd like to thank Mrs. Lan for letting me have a chance to see it.

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're so polite.

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't want to let my family be confused

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and to be able to see the true love of White Bird together with you.

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is my honor.

262
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Then please take Mrs. Lan to see us.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay, come. This way, please.

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It seems that Guan Dong really likes this painting.

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This painting

267
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is my wife's favorite painting in her life.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What a pity.

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
She left without seeing it.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Everyone has regrets.

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So we should cherish the present

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and find every chance.

273
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't know why.

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't know why.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know why.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know why.

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This painting feels very depressing to me.

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's so hard to control.

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because they broke the cage.

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We are still in the cage.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You're right.

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This painting is like

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the gate of the two worlds.

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Look.

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They worked so hard to get freedom.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And we are still trapped in it.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
White Bird's True Love

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
shows the extraordinary painting of Ma Qing Shan.

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And it also has the meaning of the past.

290
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I didn't expect that Ma Qing Shan

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
is still the last place.

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There is a saying in our school.

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Some people think that

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
all the paintings of Ma Qing Shan

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
are his wife's pen.

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He has all the paintings of his wife

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and has achieved his beautiful reputation.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And White Bird's True Love

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is also his pen.

300
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's because his wife

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
died of illness after painting this painting.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No matter which one of them

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
is not afraid to step on the top of the throne.

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In that era,

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
women's appearance is not a good thing.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ma Qing Shan's poetry

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
not only protected her wife,

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but also took this opportunity to save herself.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
She is a smart person.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Some people like to mess around

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
without thinking about it.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's just a guess.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's true and false.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Look at this beautiful pig.

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's the essence of this painting.

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But because the way it is made

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
is too complicated,

318
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
it has long lost its shape.

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Many people want to stop this painting

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and leave it on this step.

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So the beautiful pig

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
is the defensive label of this painting.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a pity that the meeting will only take five days.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So we have to take this opportunity

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to learn from it,

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to see this play clearly,

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and to feel its charm.

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm afraid that

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't take it.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm afraid that

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
my face

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
will become a failure.

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I will break the pieces of the piece.

334
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You said that

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it's better to stop the painting

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and leave it on this step.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm afraid that

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't take it.

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm afraid that

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
my face

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
will become a failure.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm afraid that

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
my face will become a failure.

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm afraid that

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
my face will become a failure.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm afraid that

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
my face will become a failure.

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm afraid that

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
my face will become a failure.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm afraid that

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
my face will become a failure.

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm afraid that

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
my face will become a failure.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:08,000
My life has

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
faded away forever

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And it is too late to know

357
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,500
I want to see a dreamless garden

358
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,800
The deep sea is full of blue sky

359
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,200
I want to see you

360
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
I want to see you

361
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
I want to see you

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,300
I want to see you

363
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,400
I want to see you

364
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Your shadow is dry

365
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,600
But I only have eyes

366
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,100
You said that the story is always fair

367
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Why don't you take the flower to the border

368
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,900
I am warm and gentle

369
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,400
All this is a promise

370
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,600
I cry and pretend to be in front of the world

371
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,300
You look at the world through the window

372
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,800
A wild face

373
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,000
The deep sea is full of blue sky

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,700
I want to see you
