1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
it's

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,540
your

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,880
home

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,400
d

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,360
no

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,360
The Love of My Life

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Episode 1

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Miss!

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Miss!

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Are you called Xin Yi?

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
What's your name?

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
My name is Fang Jun.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm a national love lover.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
I know you.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
I was a national love lover.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
I knew you.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
That white-collar you drew was very popular.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I thought it was a master's drawing

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
that was a bit old.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I saw the photo of the author.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I was shocked.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
I was a little girl.

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Do you think I can meet you

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,360
in such a small place in Chu Guang Town?

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Don't worry.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
No, no, no.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
By the way,

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
how long are you going to stay in Chu Guang Town?

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
It's like this.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Aren't we going to

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
the birth of the Empress of Chu Guang?

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Chu Guang Town and I

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
were always together.

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
So she asked me

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
to draw a statue for Chu Guang.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
To be honest,

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
I've already drawn most of them.

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Those eyes.

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
I almost felt

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
I was drawing them.

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
So I wanted to ask

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
if Miss Xin Yi had time

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
to show me the drawing.

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
She's busy.

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
She's busy.

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
If you don't mind,

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
I'd like to share it with you.

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
That's great!

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Then,

50
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
tomorrow at 8 a.m.,

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
we'll meet at the door of the temple in the city center.

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Okay.

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Thank you.

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Let's go.

55
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Why did you have to promise that man?

56
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Didn't I tell you

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
that we're here to avoid the wind?

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
What if there's any trouble?

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't know what to avoid.

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
I don't know what trouble

61
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
would cause.

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
You can't be so reliable.

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
You're not even injured.

64
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
What are you talking about?

65
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
When I wrote the letter,

66
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
my left hand was also very steady.

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Don't think I don't know

68
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
what you're thinking.

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm not thinking about it.

70
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm thinking about it.

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm thinking about it.

72
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm thinking about it.

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm thinking about it.

74
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
I don't know what you're thinking.

75
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Don't worry.

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
I don't want to run away.

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Open it.

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
I'll come back tomorrow.

79
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I'll come back tomorrow.

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I told you

81
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
that the key is not in the way.

82
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Put the things down.

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
The key?

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Give me the key!

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
What are you doing?

86
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Say it again.

87
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Give me the key!

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Put the knife down and save it.

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Don't touch me.

90
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Put it down.

91
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
What are you doing?

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Give it to me.

93
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Give me the key!

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Give it back to me!

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
To prevent you from escaping,

96
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
this thing is like a duck.

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
You'll give it back tomorrow.

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
You'd better say it right.

99
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
You disappointed me so much.

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I said

101
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I won't get married.

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
You did this

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
to make yourself a murderer.

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
And you even embarrassed the officials.

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
The Qin family owed a lot of money.

106
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
They made it clear

107
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
that they wanted to kill the officials.

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Why did you

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
insist on this marriage?

110
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
You're not a person

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
who can make a mistake.

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
The reason why you didn't

113
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
kick the Qin family out

114
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
is because Qin Heng is useful.

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
I won't

116
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
follow your plan anymore.

117
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
I'll find the answer myself.

118
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
I won't

119
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
follow your plan anymore.

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Go!

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
You all go!

122
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
You're not a official!

123
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
You're not doing anything!

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
You're here to see me?

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
I know I shouldn't

126
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
be here.

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
And I shouldn't be in the house.

128
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
But I lost my mind.

129
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I just

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
went to the Guan family to talk about it.

131
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Does this matter to Guan family?

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I don't know.

133
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I don't know.

134
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I don't know.

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
I don't know.

136
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I don't know.

137
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I don't know.

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,360
You, Guan Huai, Xin Yi.

139
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
What are you three doing?

140
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
What role did my father

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
play in the game?

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
If you don't want to tell me,

143
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I can't provide any help.

144
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
I don't want to be

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
an unknowing worker.

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
What if

147
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
this matter

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
hurts Guan family

149
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
and your father?

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Where can I

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
clean up

152
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
my father's house

153
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
after all this hard work?

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Besides,

155
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Guan family has been

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
taking care of it since then.

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I only have

158
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
a place to rest

159
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
and I can let this

160
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
uncle rest.

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Lady Zhuguang

162
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
is the real god of Zhuguang Town.

163
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Every year,

164
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I will make a big effort

165
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
to pray for Lady Zhuguang

166
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
to be blessed with a good and good life.

167
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
If you need any help,

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
just tell me.

169
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Xin Yi,

170
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
actually, that god of the temple

171
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
has been well-drawn.

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
I saw you yesterday

173
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
in a difficult situation.

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
That's why I said it on purpose.

175
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Xin Yi,

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I'll say it again.

177
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
I saw the man

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
who was with you yesterday.

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Your hands are tied together.

180
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
But don't worry.

181
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
I said yesterday

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
that I and Lady Zhuguang

183
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
are old acquaintances.

184
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
So, if you have any problems,

185
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
just tell me.

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
He is my friend.

187
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
We are playing around.

188
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Thank you, uncle Fang.

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
I was scared

190
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
by the rain.

191
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Xin Yi, you don't know

192
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
that if I can't see you

193
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
this morning,

194
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
I might call the police.

195
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Uncle Fang,

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
can you lend me your phone number?

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I forgot my phone.

198
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Sure.

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Thank you.

200
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Thank you.

201
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Here.

202
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Thank you.

203
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Fang Xin.

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Fang Xin.

205
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
You're here.

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Come and help me.

207
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Xin Yi, I'll go there.

208
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I'll be back later.

209
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
I'll see you later.

210
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Thank you.

211
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Thank you, uncle Fang.

212
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
It's okay.

213
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Hello.

214
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
This is the hospital in the Chouyuan.

215
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Hello.

216
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Is the patient

217
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
from the 1231 ward back?

218
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm his sister.

219
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
When I went to the hospital

220
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I found that he was taken away.

221
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Did he come back now?

222
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Do you know where he went?

223
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
1231?

224
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Yes.

225
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
We didn't have this hospital in the hospital.

226
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
No?

227
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
How is that possible?

228
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
It's the patient's name

229
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
called Xin Long.

230
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Please check it again.

231
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
We don't have

232
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
the patient called Xin Long.

233
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Did you make a mistake?

234
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
I...

235
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Zelen, please contact us again.

236
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
I...

237
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
How can I make a mistake?

238
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Hello?

239
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
After the fight,

240
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Xin Yi has been avoiding the chase of the officer.

241
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
So she has been staying here.

242
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Is it possible that Xin Yi

243
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
thinks that this is not safe?

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
So she wants to hide somewhere else?

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
No.

246
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Her father is looking for her.

247
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Besides,

248
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
she can't contact me.

249
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
It's not a good idea

250
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
to wait for her.

251
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Call the police.

252
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
I know

253
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
that many people will be involved.

254
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
But the safety of Xin Yi

255
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
is the most important thing.

256
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm sorry.

257
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Hello, Mr. Qin.

258
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
I'm Xin Yi.

259
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Xin Yi,

260
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
where are you now?

261
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Are you safe?

262
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm fine.

263
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm in Zhu Guang Town.

264
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Zhu Guang Town?

265
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
That place is very remote.

266
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Why are you going there?

267
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Guan Huai brought me here.

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Wait there.

269
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I'll pick you up.

270
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Mr. Qin,

271
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I just called the hospital.

272
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
They said that there is no

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
An Long's patient.

274
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
And there is no An Long's patient.

275
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Did they do something wrong?

276
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
What's going on?

277
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
But Chaoyun Town

278
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
is just a hospital.

279
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
It's not wrong.

280
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Xin Yi,

281
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
listen to me.

282
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Xing Shen.

283
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Where is my sister?

284
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Xin Yi,

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
it's a long story.

286
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
How about this?

287
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I'll pick you up.

288
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
And I'll explain it to you.

289
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
You just have to tell me

290
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
that these days,

291
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
who am I

292
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
meeting in the hospital?

293
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Guan Huai.

294
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
ET

295
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,640
I miss you so much

296
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
My eyes are so blind

297
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
I don't want to see everything

298
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm afraid of the dark

299
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Why are you here?

300
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Where is A'Nong?

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
As long as you follow me,

302
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I'll take you to see her.

303
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,360
I fell into the world of absurdity

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
What should I do?

305
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
That woman

306
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
has a few colors on her own

307
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
She always takes the gun in front of me

308
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
At first, I saw some strength, so I just let it go

309
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Now my hands are exhausted

310
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
and I'm still here to be loyal

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I can't touch it or touch it every day

312
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I don't want to do it

313
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
You said that the story is always fair

314
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm like a knife, I draw the line

315
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm so hard to touch

316
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Her hand is injured, she can't hold it

317
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Her boat is not for painting

318
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I cry, but I'm still here

319
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,360
You just let me be here

320
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,360
A blinded light

321
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I miss you so much

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
From the first time I met you,

323
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
I knew that you were not a good person

324
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
This is the personal painting I made for you

325
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
How is it?

326
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
The color is bright and the color is white

327
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,360
I'm afraid to let the face

328
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
be swollen

329
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Although the candy is not that heavy,

330
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
the candy is not bad

331
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
You know that I'm ready for this

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
I must eat it

333
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
You said that the story is always fair

334
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
If you think I did well,

335
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I'll kiss you

336
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm so hard to touch

337
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm so hard to touch

338
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
You know that I'm ready for this

339
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I cry, but I'm still here

340
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
You just let me be here

341
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
I don't know what I'm doing

342
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't want to do it

343
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
You just let me be here

344
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm so hard to touch

345
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Her hand is injured, she can't hold it

346
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Her boat is not for painting

347
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm so hard to touch

348
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Her boat is not for painting

349
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm so hard to touch

350
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
You just let me be here

351
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I don't want to do it

352
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
You just let me be here

353
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I don't want to do it

354
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,360
You said that the story is always fair

355
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
If you think I did well,

356
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I'll kiss you

357
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm so hard to touch

358
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I'm so hard to touch

359
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
You just let me be here

360
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I cry, but I'm still here

361
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,360
You just let me be here

362
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
I don't want to do it

363
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm so hard to touch

364
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
You just let me be here

365
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
I want to hug you

366
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I want to hug you

367
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Xingyi.

368
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Xingyi.

369
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
What are you doing?

370
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Guanhuai, you're not tired every day.

371
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
What am I doing?

372
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Stop talking nonsense.

373
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
You're my sister, right?

374
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
You've been pretending to be Anu.

375
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Guanhuai, you deserve to die.

376
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
When did you know?

377
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
I should have known long ago.

378
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
I should have seen it clearly.

379
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
But not like now.

380
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
You made me feel so bad.

381
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
This time,

382
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I will never trust you.

383
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,360
I try to use this color to hypnotize you.

384
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm a little bit lost in the chest.

385
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,360
My eyes are shaking.

386
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
I don't care about anything.

387
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Even if the shadow is reflected.

388
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I fell into the world of panic.

389
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,360
What should I do to escape?

390
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

391
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I broke a piece of piece of piece.

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
You said that you would always be a pervert.

393
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I should have known long ago.

394
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm a little bit lost in the chest.

395
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

396
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
You're laughing at me.

397
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Now I see a blinded face.

398
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:05,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

399
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm a little bit lost in the chest.

400
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,360
What should I do to escape?

401
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

402
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,360
I broke a piece of piece.

403
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,360
You said that you would always be a pervert.

404
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,360
I should have known long ago.

405
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

406
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

407
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,360
You're laughing at me.

408
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Now I see a blinded face.

409
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

410
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:36,360
You broke a piece of piece.

411
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You said that you would always be a pervert.

412
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,360
I should have known long ago.

413
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

414
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.

415
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,360
You're laughing at me.

416
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Now I see a blinded face.

417
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm afraid that my face will become a lost face.
