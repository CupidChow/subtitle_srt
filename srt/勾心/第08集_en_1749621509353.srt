1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
👹

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You really have a big guts.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If I didn't pull that elevator, how would you have planned to go out?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I just want to know what the point of the cave is.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Did you see it?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I was busy pulling the elevator. How would I know?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You were standing behind and watching for a long time. Didn't you see it?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're blind.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But I guessed it.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mount Guan is a work of Ma Jing Shan, a painter who makes the art of art.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That old man has nothing to do with it.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He likes Ma Jing Shan.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There's a unique color of Ma Jing Shan.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's called Beauty Pig.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I know.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But the way he adjusts it has long been lost.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A dozen years ago, the old man found a painter and drew a painting for him.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That painting was used by the Beauty Pig.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That painter also successfully made it.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's said that it was used by human blood.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What happened next?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The person died.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Beauty Pig's way of making it disappeared.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The so-called Beauty Pig

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
may be the blood made by Ma Jing Shan

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to make it famous.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That painter can adjust the beauty pig

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
or maybe he used some things we don't know.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's no such thing in the world.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That old man will believe it.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The white bird was still alive.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It didn't finish yet.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
His father passed away.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now the painter in Guanshan Sea

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
is to complete that painting.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But Xu Rong can't make it.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
As long as I can find the way to make the beauty pig,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Xu Rong can be replaced.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A-足

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Father and great-grandfather

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are these photos being torn like this?

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why without me?

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If it wasn't for me, if it wasn't for me, Anong wouldn't have...

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I shouldn't have been here. I shouldn't have been here.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I shouldn't have been here.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I apologize for what happened to my brother.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's none of your business.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I'm used to it.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've heard it more than he has ever heard.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't understand.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is it because I'm a woman?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So no matter how hard I try, I can't get my child married.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've been a woman for so many years.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if I've been fighting for so many years, I've done everything for Guan Hai.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But in my dad's eyes, I'm always a stranger to a married woman.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Boss Guan is more traditional.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He doesn't care about you.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It doesn't mean that others won't.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Who is it?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You?

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What Qin Heng said is right. I'm just a boring woman.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've done everything for Guan Hai.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't have time to love anyone.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Of course, no one is here to love me.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why don't you try it?

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Try to love me.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm not a woman.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm a woman.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm a woman.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm a woman.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm a woman.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm a woman.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm a woman.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm trying to love someone.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm a woman.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm a woman.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm a woman.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm a woman.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm a woman.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm a woman.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm a woman.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm a woman.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm a woman.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm a woman.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm a woman.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yun.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I brought the kids to see you.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yun.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is your favorite weapon.

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I brought it for you today.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let her go with you.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Who's going to kill my mom?

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you doing?

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mom left little things.

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you love me, you can give me.

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can't touch her.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're the least suitable for her.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you really want to treat your mom,

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you won't let her down.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You'll become a man.

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yun and I don't have a son like you.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Fine.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't have a father like you.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Guan Huan.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What are you doing here?

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I heard today is Mrs. Ming Yun's birthday.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm just here to deliver the flowers.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is not the place you should come.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't take this thing to mean bad to me.

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Guan Dong.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's the guest I invited.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why are you so rude?

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Guan Dong.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Guan Dong.

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't be angry.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't know if they'll mind.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I shouldn't have come.

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why did you let him come?

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You wanted my mom to see

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that you found a substitute for him.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And you.

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You want to set up Guan Shan Hai.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You want to torture me?

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you think there's someone like that?

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So happy.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So happy.

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What my mom did the worst in her life

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
was to marry you.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I love you.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I love you too.

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I know what I did wrong.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I can't find a suitable husband.

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How did your father do it?

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Who?

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sister, it's me who's not looking at you.

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's me who's not looking at you.

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's me who's left the god.

145
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Your birthday is almost gone. I'll pay it to you.

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No need to pay.

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Sister, don't misunderstand.

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Since the last time I was hit by Huai Ge,

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've never followed you.

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This time, I just met you.

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm going to disappear right now.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You were the one who stole the koi from the jade stone.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Sister, I really know I was wrong.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Since Huai Ge taught me last time,

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I still feel the pain.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sister, I swear to god that I'll change my mind and be a good person.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I won't be in your house any more.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, okay, you can go.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't expect that I really misunderstood him.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Huai Ge.

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Huai Ge.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Huai Ge.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Huai Ge.

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Huai Ge.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Huai Ge.

167
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Where have you been? Why did you drink so much?

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's wrong with you?

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Huai Ge.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Huai Ge.

171
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let me put you in.

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't leave.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mom.

175
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm really sorry.

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I really really miss you.

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Guan Huai,

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I... I can't take care of you.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So you're crying too.

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I thought you wouldn't be able to handle someone like you.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I...

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's okay. It's okay.
