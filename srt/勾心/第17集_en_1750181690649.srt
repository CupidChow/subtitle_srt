00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
...

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 1

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Episode 2

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's go.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Go to bed.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We have to go.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You still want to go?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You didn't take me to see Anong.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's your idea?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't worry.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
As long as you listen to me,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't hurt her.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We'll have a rest these days.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We'll be there in the evening.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Guan Huai!

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Stop it.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I've been driving for a day.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's go.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's all.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Just a little bit.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Just a little bit.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What are you doing with your clothes off?

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You said

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have to take a shower.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't touch me.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not going.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are you touching me?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm so sorry.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you so cold?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm cold.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then...

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me untie you.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You just ran away.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why did you call me?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello?

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where is your husband?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He left the city last night.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I went after him.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't tell you in time.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where is he now?

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Shi Tan Zhen.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll be right there.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What do you mean?

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can't avoid

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the delay of Shi Tou's phone positioning.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then you want to take me to Shi Tan Zhen?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm lying.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll go to Zhuguang Town.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you tired?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm telling you.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There may be no hotel in the back.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's no hotel in the village.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Get out of here.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't touch me.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You used to smile

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and smile at me.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're so mean now.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I like you too.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're so mean.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I should have

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
stabbed him

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
last night.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you have another chance,

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
don't be so soft.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, I won't touch you.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go to sleep.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm tired.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Get out of here.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You just need to promise me to sleep.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Go.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't be so serious.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My wound is getting better.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You should go to Guan Shan Hai.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I just hope you'll be fine.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I hope so.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Xin Yi.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Xin Yi.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Where are you?

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can hide him

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
in the sea and corner.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't be found by me.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I won't let you go.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't be so polite.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Xin Yi.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where are you?

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hello.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you remember me?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm on the roadside.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm on this phone.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Come over and pick it up.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Xin Yi.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Uncle.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Take some noodles.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm not hungry.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Can you drink water?

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can't drink all day.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You want to be a god?

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Take care.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Do you know what you're doing?

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You...

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you know what you're doing?

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're not allowed to do it?

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not allowed to do it.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What's the key?

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I already lost it.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You can't solve it.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Actually

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I haven't had enough.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How about a cup of tea?

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Alright, I'll say something.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Today is a good day.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I must drink with you.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You should call me Qing Jia Gong.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We don't have a daughter.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We wish to marry Xin Xin.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We wish to have a daughter.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I want to have Xiao Heng call me dad.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Alright, cheers.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Get lost.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't worry.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Come on, Xin Xin.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Cheers.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Mom, dad.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Today is a family day.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you here?

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right, it's a family day.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I should be here.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I should be here

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
as a brother

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to wish you a happy marriage.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm coming.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Sit down.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sorry, I'll go to the dressing room.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mom, you should go to the dressing room

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
with Uncle Guan.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Have a talk.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have nothing to talk to you.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't want to talk to you

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
about Qin Xin.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you mean?

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How is it?

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Did you take a good picture?

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I knew you had a problem with that man.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You were so close.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I didn't expect

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that we would be together.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Mr. Guan is so manly.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He really has a plan.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You are showing me these pictures

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
to make me feel happy.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I just want to tell you

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that if you don't want to expose these ugly people

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
you should give me all the shares

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that you have in your hands.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You don't want to

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ruin the image

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that you have been pretending to be

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
for so many years.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And Wei Gongfu's brother.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He has been

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
a bad guy for so many years.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I like to take pictures of my left face

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
when I'm not doing anything.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Guan Xin.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Guan Xin.

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll expose you?

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What are you doing?

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Guan Xin.

191
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What is your relationship?

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We are not.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What is your relationship?

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's the relationship you see.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Xin Xin.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She is Qin Heng's brother.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You...

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You are so shameless.

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It has nothing to do with her.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll take care of it.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yan Ke, you are like a mother to me.

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You are shameless.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's the relationship that Qin Heng has been seducing.

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
She has no interest in the Qin family.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
She has to kick Qin out of the family

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
so that the family can be destroyed.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's my fault.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm kidding.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Uncle, don't say that.

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Guan Xin is just a fool.

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm willing to forgive her.

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We can't be together.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You are a big deal.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't need your forgiveness.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I won't marry you.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Look at this.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why did you bring me here?

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Zhu Guangzheng is far away.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
My dad can't get in.

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You've been staying here for two days.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You are crazy.

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You want to take me away from Shanghai?

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What are you going to say now?

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Whether you believe it or not,

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I've never thought about hurting you.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Miss, Miss.

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Miss, write a Qifu script.

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
After writing this,

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
hang it on your body.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Zhu Guangzheng will help you to realize your dream.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's very simple.

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Write one.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you still believe this?

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Can't I?

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, you can.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wait a minute.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Your right hand is not ready yet.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's inconvenient.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then write on your left hand.

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll help you.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What do you want to write?

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Zhou Anou.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Peace and happiness.

247
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Your left hand is not ready yet.

248
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,200
lyricated by

249
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,080
Why does my left hand

250
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
Even such a loyal character

251
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
It is clear that one can still be a wraith

252
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,780
I try to drunk more

253
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:20,080
What should I do to escape?

254
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm afraid that my face will become a failure

255
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Break a piece of the piece of paper

256
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,580
You say that story is short and short

257
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,980
I'll draw a絡 traps

258
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,580
Other than anxiety, all people are just praises

259
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,080
I lean towards the danger

260
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,580
Look for the past reality

261
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,080
An innocent clown

262
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,580
I have to go seesaw

263
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,960
Fall down the cliff

264
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,140
Into this spinning world

265
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,800
What to do more
