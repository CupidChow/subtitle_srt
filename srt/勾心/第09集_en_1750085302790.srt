1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
This was Kurehi Shiva who we've seen for a couple years from now.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:18,840
Within 24 years we saw some nostalgia with this个冒 persons form above

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,340
Mixing our layer with heavy cut

4
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,360
Ar sen.

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,940
Thanks for watching!

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,140
You too!

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:01:12,720
This is

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,680
I'm not afraid.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm going to find a painter

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
as you want.

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,760
But I don't even know

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
what you're drawing.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,640
What are you doing

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,040
all these years?

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,440
You don't need to know

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,560
that it's none of your business.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,480
Sometimes I really think

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,520
I don't know you.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't know the key.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,920
Guaiqing,

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,000
you have the ability to use your brain,

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,440
but you're a woman.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,040
I don't want you to be too tired.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,440
You're getting married soon.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,040
You don't need to worry about

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
something.

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,960
Dad,

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
have you ever loved your mom?

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,120
In this world,

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,320
no one loves her more than I do.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,280
What about her?

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,880
I don't think she's happy

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,360
with you.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Mom.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,880
Who gave you the guts?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
If I hadn't found the key,

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
I would have been dead.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,560
Did I do anything wrong?

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Did I do anything wrong?

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,040
You're right.

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Okay.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,200
You're right.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
Then you must

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
see your mom in your life.

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,280
Mom.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
Mom.

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,040
Where are you?

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,640
Mom.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,200
Let's go home, okay?

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,600
Mom.

51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,880
Mom.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,000
Mom.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,360
This is my mom's favorite meal.

54
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,440
Why is it burned like this?

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,000
It's burned in the sea.

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,000
Others think it's very strong.

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
But it can be played.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
It's played by itself.

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
It's not a good thing.

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,840
Is this fan

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
important to you?

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,440
It's been with my mom for a long time.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,600
She cherishes it.

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
I didn't expect it to be like this.

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,080
Xin Ye.

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Can you fix it for me?

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
Understand?

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,520
It freed you and broken in都ie.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,320
Who drew this fan?

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,160
What?

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,840
My mom had this fan before my mom got married?

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,080
Anything wrong with it?

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,160
This is her favorite piece.

74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,760
White,

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
like a beautiful pearl.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:29,420
...

77
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,420
Then we can find the secret of the Beauty Bead.

78
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,420
The Beauty Bead

79
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
Don't panic.

80
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
What are you doing?

81
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
You don't understand.

82
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
This is called the beauty bead.

83
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
You are my brother.

84
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
I am a car repairer.

85
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,420
It's normal to repair the fan.

86
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
I am the owner of Guanhai.

87
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
Some people can't help me.

88
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
I have to stay here.

89
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
Are you free?

90
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Don't you help me?

91
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Why do you come here?

92
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
To work.

93
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
I can't help you.

94
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
I need to cook.

95
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
It's time to eat lunch.

96
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Don't worry.

97
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
I won't starve to death.

98
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Xin Yi.

99
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Thank you for this time.

100
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
You are welcome.

101
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
You can trust me.

102
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
You can give me such an important thing.

103
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
It's my honor.

104
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
Xin Yi.

105
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
You are capable.

106
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
But you are just a blind man.

107
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
You are too strong.

108
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
I am not.

109
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
Xin Yi is just a fan of me.

110
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
What should I do?

111
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
I will help you.

112
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
It seems that

113
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
if I want to take the lead,

114
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
it's not possible.

115
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
What?

116
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
You are so fast.

117
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
You are so determined.

118
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
He is never my person.

119
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
I don't believe in this.

120
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
But I believe in it now.

121
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
I do think

122
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
you are not stupid.

123
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
You are looking for a stepmother.

124
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
I am not stupid.

125
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
I am just looking for a stepmother.

126
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
That fan

127
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
has been around for more than 20 years.

128
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
But it has been protected well.

129
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
I think

130
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Mrs. Ming Yun should have a stable future.

131
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
That fan is a work of the Cheng Rao Mountain people.

132
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
My mother loves her work.

133
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
It's normal.

134
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
But when she painted this fan,

135
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
she didn't show up.

136
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
I don't know

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
where Mrs. Ming Yun got it from.

138
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
My mother never said

139
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
about the origin of this fan.

140
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
But she was born in a luxury family.

141
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,420
She likes to collect and design products.

142
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Maybe she has seen it sometimes.

143
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
She likes it.

144
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
So she bought it.

145
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
I heard that

146
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,420
Mrs. Ming Yun is a very good collector

147
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,420
and a keyboardist.

148
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Especially the work of Ma Qingshan.

149
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
Guan Dong started to contact

150
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
the national painting

151
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
to make people happy.

152
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
What is it?

153
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Because my wife likes to paint.

154
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
And because my wife loves to paint

155
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,420
and likes Ma Qingshan.

156
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
She is a dog.

157
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
She is a busy girl

158
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
who didn't graduate

159
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,420
from school.

160
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
She loves to learn art.

161
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
She always plays outside

162
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
and loves my mother's hobby.

163
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
She loves to paint and paint.

164
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
I'm just afraid

165
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
that people will know

166
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
that she married my mother

167
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
for money.

168
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Because of money?

169
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
I think Guan Dong's taste and talent

170
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,420
are similar to the local people.

171
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
And Mrs. Ming Yun

172
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
is a very good collector.

173
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
She is a very good collector.

174
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,420
She is a very good collector.

175
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
She is a very good collector.

176
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
She is a very good collector.

177
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
She is a very good collector.

178
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
Guan Huai, have a meal.

179
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,420
I said something wrong.

180
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Don't you know her?

181
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Do you want me to help you?

182
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
You don't know

183
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
what happened that year.

184
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
What are you talking about?

185
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
You are afraid.

186
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
You are afraid.

187
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Why do you still

188
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
pretend to be deaf

189
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
and keep on acting?

190
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,420
I really don't understand.

191
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Because I am her daughter.

192
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
She is afraid that we will be a daughter?

193
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
I tell you.

194
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
You are just her tool.

195
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
You can use it

196
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
when you need it.

197
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
You don't need it.

198
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
You can send it out.

199
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
You are wrong.

200
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
I want you to help me

201
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
to make a decision.

202
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,420
I will go back to my home

203
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
and clean the house.

204
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
What should I do next?

205
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
According to the original painting,

206
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,420
the painting on the village will be

207
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
restored to the original shape.

208
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
If you want to hide it,

209
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,420
I suggest you

210
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,420
put the whole fan on it.

211
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
It will not damage it again.

212
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Fine.

213
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
I will listen to you.

214
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
I have read many news before.

215
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
They say that the official family is warm and harmonious.

216
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
They are very envious.

217
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Are you so interested in our family?

218
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Everyone likes it.

219
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Fine.

220
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
It is hard to say.

221
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
15 years ago,

222
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
my family was still warm and harmonious.

223
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
My mother was not gone yet.

224
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
She is a good father

225
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,420
and husband in Guan Shanhai.

226
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
After my mother left,

227
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
the official family was gone.

228
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
She can't pretend for the rest of her life.

229
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
One day,

230
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
I will tear her mask

231
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
and show everyone

232
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
her real mask.

233
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
What about you?

234
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Me?

235
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
What is your real mask?

236
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Haven't you seen it clearly?

237
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
I can't see it clearly.

238
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Then I will cross the street again.

239
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
The closer I get,

240
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
the clearer you see.

241
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I am sleepy.

242
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Go to sleep.

243
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,420
I only feel that I have returned to my hometown.

244
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
I am so worried about you.

245
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Xin Cheng.

246
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Why did my father

247
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
write such a poem on

248
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,420
the fan of Mrs. Ming Yun?

249
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
What is their relationship?

250
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Mrs. Ming Yun.

251
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
The mountain is falling.

252
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Everything is gone.

253
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,420
Even the light of the shadow is falling.

254
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,420
The world is falling into the lie.

255
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,420
What should I do to escape?

256
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,420
I am afraid that my face

257
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
will become a lost face

258
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,420
and break the pieces of the piece.

259
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,420
You said that I should stop

260
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
and turn around.

261
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
I should go to the street

262
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,420
and see if I can

263
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,420
see the light of the world.

264
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,420
I am so worried about you.

265
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,420
You said that I should stop

266
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,420
and turn around.

267
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,420
I should go to the street

268
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,420
and see if I can see the light of the world.

269
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,420
The world is falling into the lie.

270
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,420
What should I do to escape?

271
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,420
I am afraid that my face

272
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,420
will become a lost face

273
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,420
and break the pieces of the piece.

274
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
You said that I should stop

275
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,420
and turn around.

276
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,420
I should go to the street

277
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,420
and see if I can

278
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,420
see the light of the world.

279
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,420
I am so worried about you.

280
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,420
You said that I should stop

I should go to the street

283
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,420
and see if I can

284
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,420
see the light of the world.

285
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,420
I am so worried about you.

286
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,420

You said that I should stop

292
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,420
and turn around.

293

I should go to the street

and see if I can

301
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,420
