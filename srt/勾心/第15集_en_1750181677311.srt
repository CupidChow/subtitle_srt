.(Music.)

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,740
The End

3
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,740
Episode 14

4
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,740
I knew that you would invite me to have tea.

5
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,740
You're as smart as your father.

6
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,740
I should have guessed that

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,740
except for the daughter of Xincheng,

8
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
no one can be as good as her.

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,740
No one can be better than her.

10
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,740
It seems that you already know.

11
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,740
My father and I are old friends.

12
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,740
He used to draw for me.

13
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,740
Then you don't mind that I'm a woman, right?

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
Of course.

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
If you tell me your identity earlier,

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
there's no need to be so formal.

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
You are the most qualified one

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,740
to be able to complete your father's work.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,740
When can I start?

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
Tomorrow.

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,740
No.

22
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
No.

23
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
I can't see you today.

24
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Tomorrow,

25
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,740
I can see my father's painting.

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Your birthday is coming.

27
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
When everything is over,

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
I'll celebrate your birthday.

29
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,740
The boat is on the dock.

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Get on the boat.

31
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Mr. Guan,

32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
we need to get on the boat to draw.

33
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,740
It's not very convenient to get on the boat.

34
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,740
The waves are endless these days.

35
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,740
The sea is calm.

36
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,740
The most important thing is safety.

37
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
No one can disturb us.

38
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
After the painting is done,

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,740
the boat will return to its original path.

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Is the golden house on the boat?

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Dad,

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,740
there's something wrong.

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
What are you doing here?

44
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
I'm going back.

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
He's injured.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
He can't hold the pen.

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
He didn't get on the boat to draw.

48
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
The boat is not for the painting.

49
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,740
Guan Huai,

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,740
our emotional problems can be solved in private.

51
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Don't play with this kind of joke.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Mr. Guan, it's late.

53
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Let's go.

54
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
If you don't believe me,

55
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
you can search for the recording location

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
on his body.

57
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
Take me to the airport.

58
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Be careful.

59
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
Ji Yi, get in the car.

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,740
Chase him.

61
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Come back.

62
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Get in the car.

63
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Yes.

64
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
Yes.

65
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Chase them.

66
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
You guys go straight.

67
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
I'll go this way.

68
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Dad,

69
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,740
I've been chasing you.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
The other officers are still falling.

72
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Guan Huai,

73
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
you're my son.

74
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
But to be honest,

75
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
sometimes I'm really worried about you.

76
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm not worried about you.

77
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
I'm worried about you.

78
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
I'm worried about you.

79
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
I'm worried about you.

80
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
I'm worried about you.

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
To be honest,

82
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
sometimes I'm really worried about you.

83
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Dad,

84
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,740
I was the one who was in the mess.

85
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
I was the one who was in the mess.

86
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
I was still young and immature.

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
I didn't know how to think.

88
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I've done a lot

89
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
of things that hurt Dad.

90
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
I know I was wrong.

91
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
What are you talking about?

92
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Dad,

93
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
I've never suffered.

94
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I've been thinking about it for so many years.

95
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Those people who have no money and no family

96
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
are even worse than dogs on the road.

97
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
If I had known,

98
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Guan Han

99
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,740
and all the officials would be mine.

100
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
I was so close to my heart

101
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
that I saw his ability.

102
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
I wanted to bring him to dad

103
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
and make him happy.

104
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
I really didn't expect that.

105
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
This woman has no good intentions.

106
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Dad,

107
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
I've really done a lot of things.

108
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
I'm begging you.

109
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
I'm begging you.

110
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm begging you.

111
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
I'm begging you.

112
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Give me a chance to die.

113
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
If you can still make me your son,

114
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
what...

115
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
What did you say I should do?

116
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
You can do anything.

117
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Anything.

118
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Bring back Xin Yi.

119
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Bring her back.

120
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
She... She's already gone.

121
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
She can't be painted.

122
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,740
I'll find a better one for dad.

123
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
I only want her.

124
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
Why are you here?

125
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
My house has been exposed.

126
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
Now I can only go back to my home.

127
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Then why don't you go to my house?

128
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
The most dangerous place

129
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
is the safest place.

130
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
They won't know

131
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
that I'll hide in the repair shop.

132
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
And

133
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
I know that his key is always here.

134
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
I've received news today that you're in danger.

135
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
I asked you to pick up the key.

136
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I can't wait to get out of here.

137
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
I'll go and catch up with you.

138
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
But I didn't expect

139
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
that something bad happened.

140
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Who sent you the news?

141
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Have you ever sent this number?

142
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
I've sent it.

143
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
It's Xu Ni Hao.

144
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Xu Ni Hao?

145
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Don't worry.

146
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
I'll keep investigating this matter.

147
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
By the way,

148
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
what happened to you and Guang Huai?

149
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Why did you turn around?

150
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
From the beginning, he knew who I was.

151
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
He approached me

152
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,740
just to use me to paint for Guan Shan Hai.

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Now that I've got hurt,

154
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
he just betrayed me

155
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
and took Guan Shan Hai's trust.

156
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
You got hurt?

157
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Where?

158
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Why didn't you tell me?

159
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
The situation at that time

160
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
was getting worse and worse.

161
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
And

162
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
I didn't want you to worry about me.

163
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
This is your painting.

164
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
You've been here all this time.

165
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Do you know that?

166
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
It's worth it.

167
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I never regret it.

168
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Don't worry.

169
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
I'm fine.

170
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
I'll recover soon.

171
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Although there's a situation with Guang Huai,

172
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
I think things are still going to change.

173
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Guan Shan Hai can not trust me.

174
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,740
But he won't give up on that painting.

175
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
He won't give up on the beauty.

176
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Xin Yi,

177
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
I know you don't want me to be involved

178
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
and I don't want to worry about you.

179
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
I don't want to worry about you.

180
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
But I'm already in the situation.

181
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
And

182
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
I have my own selfishness.

183
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
I'll be with you

184
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
on the way.

185
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Dad.

186
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
What do you mean by this book?

187
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
I'll leave it to Guang Huai.

188
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
The company

189
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
will let Mr. Guo take care of it first.

190
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
You don't have to do anything now.

191
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Just prepare for the wedding.

192
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Dad,

193
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I don't want to get married.

194
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
I don't want to get married.

195
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
I don't want to get married.

196
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
I don't want to get married.

197
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
I don't want to get married.

198
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I don't want to get married.

199
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Dad,

200
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
I don't want to get married.

201
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
You're already so old.

202
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Don't be silly.

203
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm serious.

204
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I've been wanting to tell you

205
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
that I don't like love.

206
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I want to get married.

207
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
You've been obedient since you were a kid.

208
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Why don't you know how to be more mature?

209
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Do I even know

210
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
who I like?

211
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Since I was a kid,

212
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
I've been doing whatever I want.

213
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
I've always been the best

214
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
and I've always been the best.

215
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
I've always been the best.

216
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
I've always been the best.

217
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Even if that's the case,

218
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
you're still not satisfied.

219
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,740
I understand

220
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
that because I'm a daughter,

221
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
I can never get a full-fledged love.

222
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
My biggest value

223
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
is to sell myself

224
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
to the government

225
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
to get the benefits of the family.

226
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
But you've found the wrong buyer.

227
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
The new family is in trouble.

228
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm not getting married.

229
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
I'm just a buyer who's a loser.

230
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
Enough!

231
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Do you know that your secret is true?

232
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
She ruined all my plans.

233
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
You're free to think about it.

234
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Why don't you take care of the people you love?

235
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Guan Hui.

236
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,740
You're not here to fight me, are you?

237
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Why are you here?

238
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
You're quite generous.

239
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
What's the matter?

240
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
You're not even going to pay for the new clothes.

241
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
What the hell are you doing?

242
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
I'm helping her.

243
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

244
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Have you ever thought

245
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
if she's the one who's in trouble,

246
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
could she do anything to stop her?

247
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Guan Shanhai isn't a kind person.

248
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
She's lost her power in the sea.

249
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
She can't even save the god.

250
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Then you're like Guan Shanhai's father.

251
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
What are you doing, Master?

252
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Yes.

253
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
I'm going back to Guan's family.

254
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
So what's the connection

255
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
between the death of others and me?

256
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
You're a god.

257
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
I'm born like this.

258
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,740
You can hide her in the sea.

259
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Don't be fooled by me.

260
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Or else, don't blame me for being rude.

261
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Guan Wei!

262
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Dad, I really can't find her.

263
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
You're so capable.

264
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
I've turned Chaoyun Town into a temple.

265
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
I still can't find her.

266
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
Did she leave Chaoyun Town?

267
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,740
The train station has sent people to watch her.

268
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
She can't escape.

269
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
The arrow will break the knot.

270
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
I'll give you three days.

271
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
You must find her.

272
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Dad,

273
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
I think

274
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
we shouldn't make too much trouble.

275
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
If we don't, we'll be in trouble.

276
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Dad, I know an old painter.

277
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
He's more than a newbie.

278
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
He can't make a beautiful pig.

279
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
But he can make a big difference.

280
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
I'll send someone to...

281
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
I said I only want a newbie.

282
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Mr. Guan,

283
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Young Master.

284
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Brother Chideg,

285
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
which phoenix has brought you out?

286
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
He's back.

287
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
I asked Shi Tou to come back to you.

288
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Dad, I'm fine.

289
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Shi Tou is usually very busy.

290
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Why do you ask him to work overtime?

291
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
As long as Guan Dong doesn't mind,

292
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
I'll take care of him.

293
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
Young people are unreliable.

294
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
I hope you can help him more.

295
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,740
I only want to help you.

296
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,740
After you find the newbie,

297
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
if he's good enough to cooperate,

298
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
if he doesn't,

299
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
go.

300
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
I understand.
