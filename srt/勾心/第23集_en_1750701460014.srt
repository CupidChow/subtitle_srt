m

3
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,740
do

4
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,740
I heard from Mr. Guan that your father wanted to ask for a peace.

5
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,740
What?

6
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,740
You know that Guan Huai returned to the Guan family

7
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,740
and got the importance of Mr. Guan.

8
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,740
You can't hold it anymore?

9
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Yes.

10
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,740
Are you willing to give him a chance?

11
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,740
I don't deserve any pity.

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,740
It seems that our Mr. Guan won't ask for help.

13
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,740
I was too impulsive before.

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,740
For the sake of the two families,

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
you don't remember the past.

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,740
Don't argue with me.

17
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,740
Why do you think

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,740
I would want a shirky shoe that has a green hat?

19
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
You are full of words.

20
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,740
I don't think you deserve it.

21
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,740
You are full of words.

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,740
You can't even count the hats on my head.

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,740
Your shoe is broken into pieces.

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,740
How dare you talk to me about it?

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,740
At least I'm different from you.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
I'm not as dirty as you.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Who are you looking for?

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,740
Why do you have to be with that bastard?

29
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,740
Don't you want the shares of the Guan family?

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,740
After marriage,

31
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,740
I will transfer all the shares to you.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,740
I can also pay off the debts of the Qin family.

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,740
Are you serious?

34
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,740
You really want to do it?

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
Kneel down.

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Let me see your sincerity.

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
You and I show sincerity.

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Let me kneel down.

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
Kneel down.

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Kneel down.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Hands up.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,740
We are family now.

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,740
From now on, mine is yours.

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,740
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
Drink a glass of wine to celebrate.

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
During the online meeting,

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
Mr. Kuan doesn't allow you to drink.

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
I know

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
you must have hidden the wine.

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,740
I didn't expect that a person

51
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
could fall twice in one place.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,740
I don't know if it's simple or stupid.

53
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
You want to withdraw the money in advance?

54
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,740
Mrs. Lan, didn't we agree in advance?

55
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,740
The meeting will last five days.

56
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
How can we cancel it in a short time?

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Mr. Kuan,

58
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,740
I'm really sorry.

59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,740
There is a reason for that.

60
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
The hidden goods must be withdrawn before six o'clock.

61
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Mrs. Lan,

62
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
we can talk about it.

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
We like to talk about the country.

64
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
I want to communicate with you.

65
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,740
And it's not safe to withdraw the money in such a short time.

66
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
No need.

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
I made the contract first.

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,740
I will pay the deposit according to the contract.

69
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Goodbye.

70
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Mrs. Lan,

71
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
if you have any conditions, just ask me.

72
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
Mrs. Lan, Mrs. Lan.

73
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
He's really determined.

74
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
What should we do next?

75
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,740
I'm really trying to make him do that.

76
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
Peter.

77
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,740
There is still time before six o'clock in the afternoon.

78
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,740
You prepare to act in advance.

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm afraid it's too late.

80
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
It's a few days earlier than our original plan.

81
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Our people haven't reached the real thing yet.

82
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
We don't have enough people.

83
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
And Xin Yi,

84
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
is she done?

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
How's the progress?

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Almost.

87
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
We still need to complete the last detail.

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,740
Good.

89
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
You know Lan and Sheng Yu Lan.

90
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Xin Yi,

91
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
you don't lose your father.

92
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,740
I'm also doing his last work for my father.

93
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
Put this painting

94
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
and the exhibition hall's one together.

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
It's exactly the same.

96
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Who can tell the difference?

97
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Can the rest of the parts

98
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
be completed before sunset?

99
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Why did you change it suddenly?

100
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
The plan has changed.

101
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
It must be completed before six o'clock this afternoon.

102
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Dad.

103
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Lan Ke suddenly started to move things.

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
They're going to withdraw.

105
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
I don't know if he made a mistake.

106
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
It's a mess.

107
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
We have to plan ahead of schedule.

108
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
But then

109
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
it's too late to do the workshop and deal with it.

110
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
I suspect

111
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Lan Ke must have noticed something.

112
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
If we miss this opportunity...

113
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
It's going to be a day of dusk.

114
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Guan Huai,

115
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
you and Shi Tou will act together later.

116
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Don't let me down again this time.

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Lan Ke has sent people

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
to pack the painting of the White Bird and the Spring.

119
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
They will use the goods train to transport the Lian Shui Town.

120
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
After arriving at the airport,

121
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,740
they will board the train and leave the city.

122
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
There are people in their team.

123
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
It's convenient for us

124
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
to make a move on the way out of town.

125
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
I'm going to go to the city.

126
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
I'm going to go to the city.

127
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
I'm going to go to the city.

128
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm going to go to the city.

129
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
I'm going to go to the city.

130
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
I've prepared a car.

131
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
From the outside to the car park,

132
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
it's like the two birds that transport the truth.

133
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
By then,

134
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,740
you will drive this car

135
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
and put the new painting

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
behind the car.

137
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
There will be a intersection

138
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
on the hillside.

139
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
You will exchange

140
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
at this intersection.

141
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Mr. Huo, I'm here.

142
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Brother Qing.

143
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Put it here.

144
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
What a beautiful pearl.

145
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
It's a picture of a bird caught in the night.

146
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
I, Guan Shanhai, am so happy

147
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
to have this painting.

148
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Others may not see it,

149
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
but they can't ignore

150
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Mr. Guan's words.

151
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
You deliberately drew the deepest part of the painting

152
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
with blue and gold.

153
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Such a secret painting,

154
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
as long as you look carefully,

155
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
you can still see the difference between the times.

156
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
How could it be blue and gold?

157
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
It should be green and gold.

158
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Mr. Guan is really sharp.

159
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
He can see my flaws every time.

160
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
This is a fake.

161
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Where is the real thing?

162
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
The real thing was taken away by Mrs. Lan.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
It should be on the plane.

164
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
How could it be?

165
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
I drove the car that sent the real thing.

166
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
After changing the car,

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
no one touched it again.

168
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
How could it be a fake?

169
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Brother Shi Tou,

170
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
is it possible that

171
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
the painting you started to move

172
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
is a fake?

173
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
And the one I moved on the car

174
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
is the real pearl of the white bird.

175
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Thanks to our mutual understanding,

176
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I can successfully

177
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
send the real thing to the airport.

178
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
There are already people like me in the car team.

179
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
How did you do it?

180
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,740
I informed Mrs. Lan in advance.

181
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Tell her all your plans.

182
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
We have all the evidence

183
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
of what you did.

184
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
We have already called the police.

185
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
The police will be here soon.

186
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
No wonder she left the house in advance.

187
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Why did you do this?

188
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
What's the use of doing this to you?

189
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Dad,

190
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
we don't want you to make another mistake.

191
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Mistake?

192
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
What mistake did I make?

193
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I just want the painting of the white bird.

194
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
This is not only my obsession,

195
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
but also your mother's favorite thing.

196
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
Is it wrong for me to do this?

197
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
What I want is

198
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
as long as it exists in this world,

199
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
it can only be mine.

200
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Dad,

201
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
this painting is also mine.

202
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Gu Wenxiang,

203
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
since the beginning,

204
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
you have always wanted this painting.

205
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
How can you still fight for my mother's life?

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
That covers your own personal feelings.

207
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
What she wants

208
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
is never the painting of the white bird.

209
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
What she wants is to leave you.

210
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
It's freedom.

211
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
It's you.

212
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
You trapped her with your fake, disgusting love.

213
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
You forced her to die.

214
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
Why did mom kill herself?

215
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Why?

216
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Yun,

217
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
this is the gift I gave you.

218
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
This is not mine.

219
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
It's not for me.

220
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,740
This is a gift for you to satisfy your desire.

221
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
How could it be?

222
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,740
We all like Ma Qingshan very much.

223
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
You forgot.

224
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,740
We were in love because of Ma Qingshan.

225
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,740
You also want to see the white bird picture?

226
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,740
I have fulfilled your wish.

227
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,740
Ma Qingshan

228
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,740
The factory you made up for my senior

229
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,740
is to complete this painting, right?

230
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Ten years.

231
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,740
I have been looking for this white bird picture.

232
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,740
But I didn't find it.

233
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Maybe it is not in this world.

234
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,740
So I asked the factory to imitate this painting.

235
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Your senior will pick a beautiful pearl and ask for help.

236
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Look, that red one.

237
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,740
It is made of your blood.

238
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Isn't it very beautiful?

239
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Only a beautiful person like you can make such a beautiful pearl.

240
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
My senior.

241
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Where is he now?

242
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
Where is he?

243
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Where is he?

244
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
He had an accident in the factory.

245
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
It is a pity that if he were still alive,

246
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,740
this painting would have been completed long ago.

247
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Guanshan.

248
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,740
You are too scary.

249
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Do you still have a heart?

250
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
It's okay, Yun.

251
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,740
I will find the painter and complete this painting.

252
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,740
You promised me.

253
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,740
I will give you blood, you will divorce me.

254
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Yun.

255
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I love you.

256
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Why do you want to leave?

257
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,740
I will not let you go.

258
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
We will be together forever.

259
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I love you.

260
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I love you.

261
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Guan Dong.

262
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Guan Dong.

263
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
I really don't understand.

264
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
I love him so much.

265
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Why did he do this?

266
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
Why did he use death to leave me?

267
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,740
Yun, you are too stupid.

268
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Dad.

269
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I hit this punch for my mother.

270
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,740
You are still so stubborn.

271
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,740
You built the factory to imitate this painting.

272
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,740
I have nothing to do with that factory.

273
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,740
I am just their client.

274
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
I wanted to paint.

275
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
That factory did not have a suitable painter.

276
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
I recommended your father.

277
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,740
I didn't expect your father to be deceived by them.

278
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,740
The factory's power was already under surveillance.

279
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,740
When the capital was destroyed, they transferred the painting to me.

280
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,740
I am the victim.

281
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I paid half of the price.

282
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,740
You are not the mastermind of the factory.

283
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,740
But you are the most evil accomplice.

284
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
What are you doing?

285
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
No.

286
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,740
Stop.

287
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,740
This is my father's last mistake.

288
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
It is also his most hateful act.

289
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,740
It is also the nightmare of Mrs. Ming Yu.

290
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
It should not exist.

291
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Stop.

292
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Stop.

293
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Dad.

294
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
Stop.

295
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Dad, please.

296
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
Wake up.

297
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
I am sorry.

298
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
I am sorry.

299
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
I am sorry.

300
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
I am sorry.

301
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
I am sorry.

302
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
I am sorry.

303
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
I am sorry.

304
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
I am sorry.

305
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
I am sorry.

306
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
I am sorry.

307
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
I am sorry.

308
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
I am sorry.

309
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
I am sorry.

310
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
I am sorry.

311
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I am sorry.

312
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
I am sorry.

313
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
I am sorry.

314
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
I am sorry.

315
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
I am sorry.

316
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,740
I am sorry.

317
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
I am sorry.

318
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
I am sorry.

319
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
I am sorry.

320
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
I am sorry.

321
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I am sorry.

322
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,740
I am sorry.

323
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
I am sorry.

324
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
I am sorry.

325
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
I am sorry.

326
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
I am sorry.

327
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I am sorry.

328
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
I am sorry.

329
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
I am sorry.

330
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
I am sorry.

331
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
I am sorry.

332
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I am sorry.

333
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
I am sorry.

334
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
I am sorry.

335
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
I am sorry.

336
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
I am sorry.

337
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
I am sorry.

338
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
I am sorry.

339
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
I am sorry.

340
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
I am sorry.

341
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
I am sorry.

342
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
I am sorry.

343
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
I am sorry.

344
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
I am sorry.

345
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
I am sorry.

346
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
I am sorry.

347
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I am sorry.

348
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
I am sorry.

349
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
I am sorry.

350
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
I am sorry.

351
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
I am sorry.
