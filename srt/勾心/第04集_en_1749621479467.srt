Episode 1

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,980
Run! Let you run!

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Run! Let you run!

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Let you run!

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Oh, my god!

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,980
Come on, Nong.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,980
Let me wipe your shoes clean.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,980
You know what?

22
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,980
This is the end of the run.

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,980
No matter how strong the bed is,

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
it can't fly out.

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,980
Come on, run!

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,980
The sky is falling.

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,980
The two mountains are falling.

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
The two birds are flying.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
The two birds are flying.

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,980
The two birds are flying.

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,980
The two birds are flying.

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Hello, Master Liao.

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
Are you home?

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
I've contacted you before.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
I'd like to ask you to draw a picture.

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
Okay, I'll come over now.

37
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
Kuan Dong?

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,980
I don't know how you draw.

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
I don't mind if we stay here.

40
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Junior Sister, I'm looking forward to your drawing.

41
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,980
People often say that time can cure everything,

42
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,980
but he can't cure me.

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Instead, he's the poison that has caused me to become a sick person.

44
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,980
As long as I'm away from home,

45
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,980
I'll remember the pain and despair

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,980
that my sister and father had experienced.

47
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,980
Dad! Dad!

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
Dad!

49
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
Dad!

50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Dad!

51
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Dad!

52
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Dad!

53
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,980
Calm down.

54
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
These are all illusions.

55
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,980
This is the only chance.

56
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,980
I must catch them.

57
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,980
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,980
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,980
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,980
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Give me a hand.

86
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Keep it here.

87
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
Keep it here.

88
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Call Jin Heng.

89
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
I'm waiting for Hi-Fi.

90
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
I...

91
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Manager Guan.

92
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,980
It's planned last time for footage.

93
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,980
I need a refund.

94
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Okay.

95
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Okay.

96
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980
One, two, three.

97
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,980
Well 수 Leafu wasдя.

98
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
So why...

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
You are...

100
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Oh.

101
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
I'm Qin Heng's brother, Qin Shen.

102
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Is he in need of anything?

103
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,980
So I asked him to come over to accompany you.

104
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,980
You are the fourth child of Qin's family who returned warmly.

105
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
As far as I know,

106
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
your brothers are like fire.

107
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Qin Heng will never let you see me.

108
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,980
He should be in some woman's bed

109
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
and hasn't woken up yet, right?

110
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
That's right.

111
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
He didn't think about coming over.

112
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,980
But I don't think it's good to be the main character

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
and come to accompany you.

114
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
I don't want to be affected by him

115
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
because of our family's harmony.

116
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
So if there's anything I can do,

117
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
I'll do my best.

118
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Then please tell him

119
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
that I'm going to cancel the engagement.

120
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
I can talk about the conditions.

121
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Let him come over to me after he's done thinking.

122
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
I'm afraid that you can't agree to it.

123
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Okay.

124
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Please leave a way to contact your secretary.

125
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
My secretary resigned.

126
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
You can contact me directly.

127
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Mr. Guan, the ring is ready.

128
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Do you want to try it?

129
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
The beautiful thing is always innocent.

130
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
The ring is very heavy.

131
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,980
Do I look familiar to you?

132
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
Okay, one more.

133
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Okay, one more.

134
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Okay.

135
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Okay.

136
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Okay.

137
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Okay.

138
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Okay.

139
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Okay, one more.

140
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
I don't need beautiful things.

141
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Ma Qingshan has never painted Yu Jing.

142
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Although I'm just a model,

143
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I still tried it.

144
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Even if I get this painting,

145
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
no one can tell the difference.

146
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Others can't tell,

147
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
but they can't escape from Mr. Guan's eyes.

148
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,980
You choose to use blue and blue

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
in the deepest part of the purple flower.

150
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Instead of using gold.

151
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
If you look carefully,

152
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
you can still see the difference in age.

153
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
He can paint.

154
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Why did he suddenly show up?

155
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
He didn't even take the window.

156
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Xinyi, what are you doing?

157
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
What a pity.

158
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
I've found the right painting.

159
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,980
You're late.

160
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Mr. Guan, you misunderstood.

161
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
I'm not going to fight with you.

162
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
I want to learn something.

163
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
If possible,

164
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
I'll be your assistant.

165
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
I don't need your help.

166
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Xinyi,

167
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
you don't need to

168
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
use your level.

169
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
But I have a good chance.

170
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
And like Mr. Guan,

171
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
I can really appreciate my work.

172
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
You're ambitious.

173
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I like it.

174
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Tomorrow, you'll go to Qiyuan.

175
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
You can work with Xu Ru.

176
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

177
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Mr. Guan,

178
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
you're the best.

179
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
I didn't get the wrong person.

180
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
You're good at 3D, 5D.

181
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
So, you got that old man?

182
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
You just blown your breath.

183
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
I bought it on the street.

184
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Come have fun.

185
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
I wanted to see

186
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
if I could do anything.

187
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I didn't expect this old man to come to the construction.

188
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
This painting is really good.

189
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
This painting is much better than the old one.

190
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
I like it.

191
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
It's for me.

192
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
Yan Ping.

193
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
You shouldn't be here.

194
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Yan Ping.

195
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
Yan Ping.

196
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
You shouldn't be here.

197
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Episode 7

198
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
The situation she is in now is good.

199
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,980
It's normal to write a letter to you last time.

200
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Now she is afraid of light and people.

201
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,980
You can just take a look at her.

202
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Don't be mad at her.

203
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Thank you.

204
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
No.

205
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
No.

206
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
I'm here to see you.

207
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
No.

208
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I've received the letter you wrote to me.

209
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,980
You asked me why I haven't painted for you for so long.

210
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Actually,

211
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,980
I couldn't paint because of some reasons.

212
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,980
But now,

213
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,980
I've found a way out.

214
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,980
The one who can't get the pen is her.

215
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,980
The one who can make me paint is her.

216
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,980
The one who can make you hate the most

217
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,980
can make you feel proud.

218
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
It's so funny.

219
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
But, No, don't worry.

220
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,980
I can finish this painting soon.

221
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,980
I'll take you home, okay?

222
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
No.

223
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
No.

224
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I want to hug you.

225
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
No.

226
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
No.

227
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,980
The light of the shadow of the storm

228
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,980
has entered the world of panic.

229
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,980
What should I do to escape from it?

230
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,980
I'm afraid that my face

231
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,980
will become a lost face.

232
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,980
I'll break the pieces of the ground.

233
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
You said that I shouldn't make a mistake.

234
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,980
I should draw the line of the world.

235
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
I'm confused.

236
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,980
I'm trying to be more serious.

237
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
I'm crying.

238
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm sad.

239
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
You laugh.

240
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,980
I'm sad.

241
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,980
The light of a few years ago

242
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,980
has become Gradually덜irable .

243
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,320
Still afraid of painted faces

244
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,940
It became a disappointed face

245
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,980
the needed time ot follow

246
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,780
I'll say this stories is across that book

247
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,080
In these fearless party

248
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,680
i can't predict how bad will be

249
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,520
This might be the loss

250
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,580
Climb the stairs to our castle
