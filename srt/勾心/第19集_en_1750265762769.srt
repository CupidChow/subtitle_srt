1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Number 1

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I knew it.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You would know it sooner or later.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You didn't expect it to be like this.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yin Yi.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will tell you.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The End

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He has been wandering around.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I saw him, but I didn't see him.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When I bought those silk,

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I saw his head.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I caught him right away.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What a bad boy.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you know where this is?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I... I just passed by.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I... I...

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The End

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You didn't know it.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to help you.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is the third underground of the outside world.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's the use of holding a gun?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You didn't even get a chance to get a gun.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll show you what I can do.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Go!

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Kill him.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's of no use.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Brother Wang.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's going on?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I just got a job.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll get him.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Brother.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Brother. Are you okay?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm fine.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm dead.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You were also caught by them, right?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They are all bad guys.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's a little girl.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why is she here?

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My name is A'Nong.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was caught by my father.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Those bad guys

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
let my father draw and can't finish it.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I can't leave.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe I'll die.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Brother.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Your butterfly is injured.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let me help you.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I hope it'll heal soon.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brother.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why is there blood?

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you looking at?

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Get out.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You should see your father.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You should behave better.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you okay?

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm fine with Li Jian.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll be back soon.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A'Nong.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Did they bully you?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Are you okay?

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
My family

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
is good to their daughter.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have each other every day.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the problem?

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't think about those bad guys.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I take care of your daughter.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You draw good things.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What did the boss say to the beauty?

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The beauty that the boss said to the pig

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
must use human blood.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think the blood

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you sent secretly is useless.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The beauty said it's useless.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't need it.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's not the problem you don't need.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The boss decided to ask the client.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The client is the boss.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're a coward.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you can't use human blood,

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll kill him.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll kill him now.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Go.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You've been playing with your heart.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We've agreed.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When will you draw?

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When will I put Li and Li's baby in?

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let go.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let go.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't take her away.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let go.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
An Du.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
An Du.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
An Du.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Come here.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Dad.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Come here.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't be afraid.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Dad.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Dad.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Dad.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
An Du.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Get out.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dad.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Stop.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't let Li and Li get away.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
See how I'll die.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Uncle, don't care about me.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I told you.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're laughing at me.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You should say you're doing well.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How can you cry?

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I said stop.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Stop crying.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let me go.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I said stop.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're a coward.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I said stop crying.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I said stop.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please, help me.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Please.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I said stop crying.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Please, help me.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
An Du.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
An Du.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Brother.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Brother.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm here.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Brother.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Brother, please help me.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
An Du.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Brother is here.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Brother, please help me.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've been here for a long time.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't be afraid.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Brother.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Please help me.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Brother.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please help me, brother.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Brother.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Brother.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm so scared.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Brother.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Brother.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Brother, I'm so scared.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Brother.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Brother.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Brother.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Brother.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Brother.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Dad said

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
if we help them draw a painting

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
we can go home.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're so lucky.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're a good boy.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You drew this in your house, right?

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It looks like you drew something.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You missed a tree.

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Come.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Stand up.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Stand up.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Raise your hand.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're a little tree.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll give you a color.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's hot.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Stand up.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're a little tree.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can't move before the sun sets.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You...

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A'Nong.

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You were hurt again

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
when you were born, right?

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go with brother.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That bad boy said I was a little tree.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't go.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't be afraid.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll take you to the west.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
A'Nong is a little tree.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If not, it's a house.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The house is full of sun for the little tree.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Can you?

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Brother.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brother.

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Where are you going?

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll take you to see something.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Come.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Brother.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is the hole you dug in the middle of the night.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's a trap.

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not good.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Brother, you want to escape?

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll take you to the escape.

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
After we escape,

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
we'll go to the police.

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then we'll come back to save dad, okay?

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go, sister.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You two are in the same boat again.

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You two are together all day.

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you doing?

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Brother.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I feel like I'm in the factory.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't know how many things I eat and how many lives I do.

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You dare to steal things?

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Brother.

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't fight with me.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
A'Nong, let's go.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's go.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Let's go.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's go.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Brother.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Brother, please stop.

228
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Brother, please stop fighting.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Please stop.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Brother.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's go.

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I hate crying the most.

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't look at me.

235
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I feel better.

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A'Nong, don't cry.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Smile for me.

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I feel better.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's stop fighting.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You...

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
How can you be happy when you laugh?

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Smile.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Smile for me.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Smile.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Smile is not happy enough.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Smile.

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Enough.

248
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Stop fighting.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Brother.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Brother.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Brother, are you okay?

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A'Nong, don't cry.

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Why?

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
A'Nong, don't cry.

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Brother, I will take you out.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Brother.

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Brother.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Brother.

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Brother.

260
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Brother.

261
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Brother.
