00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Episode 3

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,680
I said you should stay in the hospital for a few days

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,840
and then check it properly.

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
It won't work.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
You have to come back soon.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,880
The wound is healed.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,080
The anti-inflammatory is also healed.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,040
Is there anything else you need to check?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,880
It's just that

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,680
the spot where the body is buried is a bit special.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,160
It might hurt the nerves.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,160
After three months,

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,400
we'll have to check it again

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,760
once again.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,480
Where are you going?

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
To find Xu Ru.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,440
Guan Huai.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,680
Don't be so impulsive.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,160
Xu Ru has been kicked out.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,120
Only I can do this for your father.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,240
If you make things worse,

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,800
he will give up on me

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
when he knows that I have a problem.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,080
No.

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
It's all over.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,880
Are you still thinking about this?

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,320
If I didn't show up in time,

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
would you hurt your hand?

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,640
It's your fate.

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
I know.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
But I can't do this now.

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,720
Then let me ask you.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,760
What if your hand can't be painted?

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,080
What will you do?

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
Sadness and sadness

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
are the things that will happen later.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,760
Now it's more important than this.

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,520
When everything is over,

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,280
I will find him personally.

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
I will find him personally.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,040
But I can't be a fool

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,240
to be a fool to be a fool to be a fool to be a fool to be a fool.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,520
Guan Huai.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,400
You have everything you want.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,520
You have to do everything you want, right?

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Xie Yi.

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,440
You are so cold to yourself.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840
I did.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,040
What does it do for a man?

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
I've maintain so much study,

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
so I will do everything that I want.

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,600
Feel free to go back to work

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,280
and let me know if you need a new teacher.

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,640
Right?

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
You have 봤 you own salary.

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,640
Do you have anything to think of?

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,880
You have even read the book.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
For some reason,

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,800
you just want this.

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,440
Better?

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,480
Year wrapped up with my head.

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,440
OK.

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,520
Right.

66
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,760
Come on.

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,920
I need to graduate from the university.

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
Jared,

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
I have just passed my dream was to spend your days

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Anyway, he's very busy.

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Don't play hard to get.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
He doesn't need you to do this for him.

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Don't forget the formalities.

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Some people want to help him but they don't have the chance.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
They'll give you a chance.

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay, let's talk about the formalities.

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Xin Yi is a very good painter.

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
She wants to find the place where Huang Jingwu is.

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
And she has a painting of her father.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
She was found by Guan Shanghai.

81
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
No wonder Guan Shanghai stopped Qi Yuan's work.

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Did he make Xin Yi a burden?

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Xin Yi is useful to him.

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
He can't bear to do it now.

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
He's just a newbie.

86
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
So he's cold.

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
So you've been around him all day.

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
He's been taking such a big risk.

89
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
You know that.

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
How is he close to him?

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
He doesn't believe anyone.

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
His heart is already sealed.

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
That's why we can only help him in this way.

94
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Even if he's too strong,

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
I'll still have to make a wish.

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I cooked porridge for you.

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
It should be just right.

98
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I forgot to ask you.

99
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Why did you appear in Qi Yuan's painting?

100
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Did you follow me?

101
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
You're so ugly.

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Why did I follow you?

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
I was watching Xu Lu.

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Why?

105
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
I was always tired of seeing him and Guan Shanghai.

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I suspect they have a leg.

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
So I wanted to come out and make a wish.

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Forget it.

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
I didn't want to hear anything from you.

110
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
We're in love.

111
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Okay.

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
The porridge is almost cold.

113
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Have a sip.

114
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
I don't want to drink.

115
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
I cooked for three hours.

116
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
I also added some dates,

117
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
and some walnuts.

118
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I told you I don't want to drink.

119
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
You...

120
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I remember you said

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
that you don't have a woman's habit.

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Don't be so anxious.

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
I'm not hungry.

124
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Qian Yi.

125
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Why are you here?

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
What? You're not welcome.

127
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
How could I?

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Here you are.

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Thank you.

130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
By the way,

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I received a message that

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Xu Lu was fired.

133
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
His work was suspended.

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
I found that Guan Shanghai

135
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
asked Xu Lu to draw it.

136
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
It was the white bird picture

137
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
that my father drew.

138
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
But he didn't have the most important skill.

139
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
So I went to draw it for him.

140
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
I didn't expect that Guan Shanghai

141
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
would find out.

142
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
You're too risky.

143
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Guan Shanghai is not a kind person.

144
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
I did something to you.

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Don't worry.

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
I'm the only one who can help him.

147
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
He won't move me.

148
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Although the work is suspended,

149
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I believe

150
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
he will come to me.

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
I'll support you

152
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
no matter what you do.

153
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
But...

154
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Can you tell me in advance?

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Don't make me worry.

156
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Xin Yi, are you at home?

157
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Why are you here?

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Don't let him find out about us.

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I'll hide in the room.

160
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Coming.

161
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
What are you doing?

162
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Your sister is here.

163
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I'll hide.

164
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Is there anything wrong with Guan?

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I came to talk to you about the cooperation.

166
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,080
I found your ability to be far away from Xu Ru.

167
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Because of Guan Hua's problem,

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,080
we may have some misunderstandings.

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
So I hope this time

170
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
we can give each other a chance to cooperate.

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
There are many more painters in this world

172
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
than my original painting.

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Without Xu Ru,

174
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
you can still find another one.

175
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Why do you say that it's me?

176
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Are you sure that

177
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
you will be satisfied with me?

178
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
There are many excellent painters.

179
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,080
But there are few who can imitate Ma Qin Shan.

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
My father only likes Ma Qin Shan.

181
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
He only wants to imitate his works.

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Since I have a master who can imitate Ma Qin Shan,

183
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,080
why do I have to be far away from him?

184
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Before Guan Hua suspected me,

185
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I was with your brother.

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
This time,

187
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
you are not afraid that we will be together?

188
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm not sure.

189
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I don't know what kind of condition Guan Hua gave you.

190
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
But no matter what condition,

191
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I will be open to you.

192
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
I will give you what he can give you.

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I will give you what he can't give you.

194
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Think about it.

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
I have an appointment with the client.

196
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
I will go first.

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
A beautiful soldier.

198
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
I like it too.

199
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm sorry to pick up the bathroom.

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
It's over there.

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Mr. Guan.

202
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Who is it?

203
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Who is inside?

204
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm looking for you.

205
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Where is Xi Dao?

206
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Guan Hua.

207
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
It doesn't look like there is only one person.

208
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Guan Hua.

209
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Why are you so perverted?

210
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
I told you I'm Xi Dao.

211
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Get out.

212
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Only you?

213
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
What if I'm not?

214
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Do I have to marry someone?

215
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm lying here.

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Can you give me some privacy?

217
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
You are so unruly.

218
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
You ran in front of me when you were a kid.

219
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Now you are talking to me.

220
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Big sister.

221
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm 30 years old this year.

222
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm 34 years old.

223
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
You are my brother when you are 30 years old.

224
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Okay.

225
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Big sister.

226
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Mr. Guan.

227
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
I forgot to tell you that there is someone in the bathroom.

228
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
There is a single washroom outside.

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
I'll take you there.

230
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Yes.

231
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
The big one outside.

232
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
The thief one.

233
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
It's okay. I've already washed it.

234
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Thank you.

235
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Big brother.

236
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Can you come down?

237
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
They are all gone.

238
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
The cat should be in the roof.

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Put it here.

240
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
These are all his little drawings.

241
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
My drawing exhibition.

242
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,080
My dream is to be able to

243
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
draw my own personal drawing exhibition

244
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
just like my dad.

245
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Mr. Guan.

246
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Mr. Guan.

247
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I've already left.

248
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Why are you in my office?

249
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
I thought you wouldn't watch these.

250
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Why can't I watch these?

251
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
I'm a man.

252
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm a man.

253
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm a man.

254
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm a man.

255
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
I'm a man.

256
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
I'm a man.

257
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm a man.

258
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Mr. Guan.

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Mr. Guan.

260
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Mr. Guan.

261
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Mr. Guan.

262
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Mr. Guan.

263
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Mr. Guan.

264
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Mr. Guan.

265
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Mr. Guan is really not here.

266
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Get lost.

267
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Mr. Guan.

268
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Mr. Guan.

269
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Mr. Guan.

270
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Mr. Guan.

271
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I know you're here.

272
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
I told you.

273
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm not going back.

274
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Mr. Guan.

275
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Mr. Guan.

276
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Is he really not here?

277
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
He's really not here.

278
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
It's quite early today.

279
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Please come in.

280
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Mr. Guan.

281
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Mr. Guan.

283
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Mr. Guan.

284
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Mr. Guan.

285
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Mr. Guan.

286
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Mr. Guan.

287
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Mr. Guan.
