1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,380
the

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,960
DE prison

3
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,780
De those who would be

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:52,140
not

5
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,140
Why are you here?

6
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,540
Let's go home.

7
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,300
No need.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,060
I called my assistant.

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,900
He'll pick me up soon.

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,140
Do you want to see

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
who you're calling?

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,980
Sorry.

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,460
I made a mistake.

14
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,740
I'll call him again.

15
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,540
It's okay.

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,820
Don't bother him.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,100
Let's go home.

18
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,900
Okay.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,020
You're not my assistant anymore.

20
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,860
I don't need to call him.

21
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,060
I don't care if he's your assistant.

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,460
As long as it's you,

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,820
I'll come back.

24
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,940
Stop the car.

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,980
Sure.

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,460
What is it?

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Look at the tenderness you gave me

28
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,380
I can't see the loneliness you made

29
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,380
Every time you smile, the rainbow will appear in the sky

30
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,380
When the world is more than one, you are the axis of time

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,380
You use that pure heart to define the world

32
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,380
Just like the time when I held you

33
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,380
I confessed to Xinyi

34
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,380
Don't look back, the romance in the moonlight

35
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
She must not agree

36
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,380
The flowers blooming

37
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,380
The eyes of Mr. Guan are not only beautiful, but also poisonous

38
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
My world

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
Actually

40
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,380
Just like this, the innocent

41
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
I said the same thing to you yesterday

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,380
But I didn't believe it at first

43
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,380
Then I saw her with Guanhuai

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,380
They were playing with the washing bowls together

45
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,380
The first thing I thought of was you

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
I thought

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
Mr. Guan would not have done it on purpose

48
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,380
You were still arranging me in your heart

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
What's wrong?

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Congratulations, Qin Shan

51
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,380
When the world is more than one, you are the axis of time

52
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:00,380
You use that pure heart to define the world

53
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,380
Today I went to dinner with my friends

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,380
They asked me what I was going to do next

55
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,380
I said I would withdraw from Guanhai

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
I will do it myself

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
Then why did you tell me?

58
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
I want to try

59
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,380
Then what about Guan?

60
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
Who are you doing this time?

61
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
You

62
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
The flowers blooming are you

63
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Warm my world

64
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Just like this, holding you

65
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Never let go

66
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Give you all of me

67
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,380
No matter where you are

68
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,380
I'm ready to go

69
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,380
The Golden House

70
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,380
The Golden House we've been looking for

71
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
It's actually hidden here

72
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
If it weren't for that painting

73
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
Guan Shanhai would never let us in

74
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,380
He confiscated all our letters

75
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,380
And installed a signal detector in the house

76
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
We can't get in or out of here

77
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
We can't get in touch with Qin Shan

78
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,380
Does he know our location?

79
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
I haven't had time to send it to him

80
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
But I've been sharing the location with him

81
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
He should know the area

82
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Guan Shanhai came prepared

83
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,380
Just to transfer Mrs. Lan's true skills

84
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
In this case

85
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
We can only take the opportunity

86
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
We can't let him succeed

87
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,380
This is your father's unfinished work

88
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,380
I finally saw him

89
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
You've seen Lan Ke today

90
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,380
He's not a good maid

91
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
All the details in this painting

92
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
Must be exactly the same as Zhen Ji

93
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
I believe you have this ability

94
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm sorry

95
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
I'm sorry

96
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,380
I'm sorry

97
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
I'm sorry

98
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
I'm sorry

99
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,380
I'm sorry

100
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
I'm sorry

101
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
I'm sorry

102
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,380
I'm sorry

103
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
I'm sorry

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
I'm sorry

105
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm sorry

106
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm sorry

107
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
I'm sorry

108
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
I'm sorry

109
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
I'm sorry

110
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm sorry

111
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm sorry

112
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,380
I'm sorry

113
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
I'm sorry

114
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm sorry

115
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
I'm sorry

116
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
I'm sorry

117
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
I'm sorry

118
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
I'm sorry

119
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,380
I'm sorry

120
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
I'm sorry

121
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
I'm sorry

122
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
I'm sorry

123
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm sorry

124
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
I'm sorry

125
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
I'm sorry

126
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
I'm sorry

127
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
I'm sorry

128
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm sorry

129
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,380
I'm sorry

130
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
Take a break

131
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Have dinner first

132
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Too short

133
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm afraid I can't make it

134
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,500
You should eat, too.

136
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,020
Here, I'll feed you.

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,980
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

138
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,460
Let me give you a hand.

139
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
You can do it later.

140
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,100
Is it good?

141
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,300
Have another one.

142
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,020
Okay.

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,180
Xingyi,

144
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,420
after all this is over,

145
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,660
I have something to tell you.

146
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,780
When did you learn to make a prediction?

147
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,700
It's just a feeling.

148
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,340
You can look forward to it.

149
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
Xingyi,

150
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,340
are you going to eat it or not?

151
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,380
Don't play the game of the final test.

152
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,700
You'll be punished if you eat it.

153
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,020
I said I don't eat the scallions.

154
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,220
I'm giving you a face, right?

155
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,820
You're not eating it, but you're picking it up.

156
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
Do you think this is your home?

157
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,060
Shut up.

158
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,220
He's the painter I hired.

159
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
You're being polite.

160
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,140
Yeah.

161
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,780
It's a small thing.

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,980
Don't be so rude.

163
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,940
Pick the scallions up on the side.

164
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,340
You're good at painting.

165
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,620
You're not only good-looking,

166
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,940
but also very good at painting.

167
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,620
Let me go after I'm done.

168
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Don't worry.

169
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,340
After I'm done,

170
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,540
I'll send you down the mountain.

171
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,780
How do you plan to adjust the Beauty Bead?

172
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,060
This is my secret recipe.

173
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,020
It's not a secret.

174
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,500
When it's colored,

175
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,660
I hope it can be used for cleaning.

176
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,260
It's beautiful.

177
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,260
It's very clear.

178
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,460
When did the Beauty Bead become your secret recipe?

179
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,100
Since you want to cooperate, don't hide it.

180
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,900
Otherwise, I thought you were playing tricks.

181
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,860
In my current situation,

182
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,300
what can I do?

183
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,780
I just don't want to be disturbed

184
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
by some strange people when I'm painting.

185
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,300
What else do you need?

186
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,820
I'll ask someone to prepare it for you.

187
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,580
For example...

188
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,340
No need.

189
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,820
I'll prepare it for you.

190
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,980
Alright.

191
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,380
Lately,

192
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,100
no one will disturb us.

193
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,940
At times I'll only pay attention to my promise

194
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,860
that you will give me

195
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,180
all your paintings.

196
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,760
I want you to look my Cream Summoner's

197
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
The signal is cut off.

198
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
My dad's few exhibition halls are not in the Lingshui Town you mentioned.

199
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
There seems to be no clue here.

200
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
But this Lingshui Town,

201
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
why is it so familiar?

202
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Found it.

203
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Yun Zhen Hall.

204
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's in the Lingshui Town you mentioned.

205
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
This is the property of my mother.

206
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,760
No wonder I didn't notice the property under the name.

207
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Did you remember what I told you?

208
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Yes.

209
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Go to work.

210
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Good morning, Brother Shi Tou.

211
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
It's hot.

212
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
You supervise the security work.

213
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Are you tired?

214
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Mr. Wan values this exhibition very much.

215
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
There must be no mistake.

216
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I understand.

217
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Just tell me where I can use it.

218
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Just keep your eyes on Xinyi.

219
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Let her be sure to exchange it on time.

220
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
This is the first floor of the exhibition hall.

221
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
What is the second floor?

222
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I haven't been there yet.

223
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
The female guest living on the second floor.

224
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Mrs. Lan, too?

225
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
You care about Mrs. Lan very much.

226
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
No.

227
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Just ask.

228
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Didn't you see it here last time?

229
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
I thought she went back.

230
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Mr. Wan said

231
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
no one can disturb the guests on the second floor.

232
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
And you can't go up without a card.

233
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
I understand.

234
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Don't wake up the spirit.

235
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
This is the fourth house.

236
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
You can't enter.

237
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Who is this?

238
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Who?

239
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Do you know who I am?

240
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
This is my mother's yard.

241
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Why can't I enter?

242
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Sister.

243
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
What are you doing here?

244
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Dad.

245
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
I was too impulsive before.

246
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

248
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
You're right.

249
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
I was too young.

250
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
I was too willful.

251
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
So I didn't understand your two-heartedness.

252
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I thought it through.

253
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
I will marry Qin Heng.

254
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
How did you find this place?

255
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Mom took me here when I was a kid.

256
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
So I have some impression.

257
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
I was thinking of coming here to relax.

258
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
At that time, mom said

259
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
the wedding will be held here when I get married.

260
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Since you're here,

261
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
you should have fun for a few days.

262
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
After the wedding,

263
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I will arrange the wedding.

264
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
This wedding is very important.

265
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Stay here quietly.

266
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Don't cause any trouble.

267
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
I understand, dad.

268
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Have some tea.

269
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Divide the paper into three layers.

270
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Color them in each layer.

271
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Red as the base.

272
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Red as the center.

273
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Red as the top.

274
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Red as the bottom.

275
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Red as the top.

276
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Three different red spots.

277
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
it will show

278
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
the most unique

279
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Jewel in the world.

280
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,760
How should I compromise?

281
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,760
I'm afraid that my love has become a trial

282
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,760
And I've broken a piece of the puzzle

283
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You say that the story will eventually turn upside down

284
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,760
I'd rather be a real man and draw a line

285
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm not at peace, but I'm trying to change my mind

286
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm crying, I'm trying to say good-bye

287
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
You're smiling, you're trying to say goodbye

288
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,760
A vague picture, the deep sea is full of blue sky

289
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,760
The night is falling

290
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I'm falling into an absurd world

291
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,760
How should I compromise?

292
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm afraid that my love has become a trial

293
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,760
And I've broken a piece of the puzzle

294
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,760
You say that the story will eventually turn upside down

295
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I'd rather be a real man and draw a line

296
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:57,760
I'm not at peace, but I'm trying to change my mind

297
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I'm crying, I'm trying to say good-bye

298
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,760
You're smiling, you're trying to say goodbye

299
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,760
A vague picture, the deep sea is full of blue sky

300
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
The night is falling

301
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm falling into an absurd world

302
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Your back is falling, but it's a long night

303
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,760
You say that the story will eventually turn upside down

304
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I'd rather be a real man and draw a line

305
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,760
I'm not at peace, but I'm trying to change my mind

306
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,760
I'm crying, I'm trying to say good-bye

307
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,760
You're smiling, you're trying to say goodbye

308
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,760
A vague picture, the deep sea is full of blue sky

309
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,760
The night is falling
