1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,340
time finally

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The End

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 1

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Mr. Guan, why are you so anxious?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm not ready yet.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This month, we must complete the 100 Birds and Spring.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's hard to do this.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's even harder to do it in the original painting.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not ready for this.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No way.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's change.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Guan, I didn't mean that.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Can you give me some more time to finish the painting?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can figure out a way.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The color is so smooth.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The color is as red as blood.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No one can stop me.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where are you painting?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You've moved.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not done yet.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not done yet.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not done yet.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not done yet.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not done yet.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not done yet.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not done yet.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not done yet.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Didn't you say you were not done yet?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Tomorrow,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll go to the original painting tomorrow.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As long as you can finish the work,

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll give you

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the painting

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
no matter what.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But if...

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I want you to be the first person to be a painter.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I won't let you down.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Get ready.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll send someone to pick you up tomorrow.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I didn't paint this.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Who is it?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's me.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Xue,

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
take a closer look.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're secretly studying in the painting every night.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it this red?

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The person who was in the garden that night

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
was you.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How did you know?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do you think I'll tell you?

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The person I should tell

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is Guan Dong.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Xue,

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you won't let me down this time.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You'll let me down too.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xin Yi,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
why did you have to tell me?

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I told you before.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I won't let you down

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
for this work.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's the point in you?

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can make a beauty book sooner or later.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I believe

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that your ability

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
will be improved by one day.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But Guan Dong said

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
that the painting will be completed within a month.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Guan Dong

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
seems to be unable to wait for you.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And, Xue, don't forget.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've never been with you.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You've been fighting with me.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How did your gold medal come?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How did your work opportunity come?

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You stole my work

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and won the award.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now you're taking my words and getting the opportunity.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Xu Ru,

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
everything you have

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is stolen from me.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Tell me,

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
if Guan Dong knows about this,

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
what will he do?

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xin Yi,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
can't I beg you this time?

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Xin Yi,

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I promise this is the last time.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Please help me this time.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay?

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't work harder than God.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not as good as you.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I just want fame.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want money.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can't even see it.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then just let me go.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I promise this is the last time.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
From now on,

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll quit my job in China.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can't I?

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Xin Yi,

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you're

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
a bad person to me.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Get up.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What else do you want me to do?

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
As long as I can do it.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We're the same age.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't help you.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well,

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
after you're done,

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you'll be able to get the award

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
for the national painting

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
for stealing my work.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What do you think?

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What about my reputation?

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When you become Mrs. Guan,

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is it important?

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Besides,

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Guan Dong cares about you

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and doesn't care about you.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The most important thing

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
he cares about

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
is to complete that painting.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, I promise.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're really smart.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Guan Dong said he'd take you to somewhere tomorrow.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He just said he'd pick me up.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll go for you tomorrow.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll finish that painting

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
with your identity.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's getting cold.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's a mountain on the sea.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Guan Dong was happy to tell me

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that he'd go to Mount Jin

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to draw a boat.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So Guan Dong drew a boat.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Guan Dong went to the boat

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and went to the sea.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Guan Dong was slow and fast.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Guan Dong said,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it's a big boat.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Guan Dong added a few strokes.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Suddenly,

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the wind blew up.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The sea was full of waves.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Guan Dong was afraid of the big rocks.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He said, the wind is enough.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But he didn't care about the cold.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The wind was stronger.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The sea was laughing.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The boat was turning.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Guan Dong also went to the sea.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
All the people who were greedy

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
would pay their own price for their greed.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll find the mountain of Guan's mountain.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll let it sink into the sea.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The Date RIGHT Online

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,160
Li Offi, Li Gucker on July 21, 싱可作

160
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,940
I wish I could settle Laotian's case for a gorgeous wife.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,720
Xin Yi has found a way to adjust the beauty.

163
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Where's Xu Ru?

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
I sent someone to watch her.

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
She was busy with the magic.

166
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,560
She couldn't even get a piece of it.

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,800
The painting that Gu An Shan is looking for Xu Ru

168
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,600
must be the true path of the birds.

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,160
The painting will be used to describe the beauty.

170
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Xin Yi has mastered the technique of beauty.

171
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
Old man will find it sooner or later.

172
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,320
We can use it to find the location of the golden house.

173
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,000
The painting of the birds

174
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
must be in it.

175
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
I can understand what Xin Yi wants.

176
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
Because it's his father's work.

177
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,360
What about you?

178
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,320
Why are you so persistent?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The painting of the birds

180
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
Because it's my mother's work.

181
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,000
Qin Heng has found the true path of the painting.

182
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,440
He is contacting the collector.

183
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,320
I think Gu An Shan will know soon.

184
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,640
What do you think he will do?

185
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,680
He won't give up on the painting.

186
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
Why do you want to make me blow the air?

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,360
Do you want to hear me blow the air for you?

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,760
Don't talk. I've already started.

189
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
With this recording,

190
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
I can do it alone.

191
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,640
That black car will come to my house at 8 o'clock.

192
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I've asked him.

193
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,520
Gu An Du is not here tomorrow.

194
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,400
Be careful.

195
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,080
Don't let others find out.

196
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,520
Who's writing this painting?

197
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,360
Of course I wrote it.

198
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
Didn't you know it?

199
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,720
You dared to speak.

200
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,000
I was very happy then.

201
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
I didn't suspect you.

202
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,240
I thought it over carefully.

203
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,040
If you really filtered the firewood,

204
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
you would also run to my April marriage.

205
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,400
Actually, not in his power.

206
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,400
I was Empress' mother.

207
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,600
Didn't torture even her time gone by.

208
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
It's not a delay, but a delay.

209
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
You drew it, right?

210
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Why didn't you come to me at the first time?

211
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
And you still play this trick with Xu Ru?

212
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
What's your purpose?

213
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Because Guan Dong doesn't trust me.

214
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Because of my relationship with Guan Huai.

215
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
You know that my level is higher than Xu Ru's,

216
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
but you still chose him.

217
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I hope I can help him when I meet Kun Nan.

218
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You don't trust me.

219
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Don't worry about me touching that flower.

220
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
You're a smart person,

221
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
but you won't be a good friend for others.

222
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Tell me.

223
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
What's good for you, Xu Ru?

224
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Xue Jie once copied my drawing and participated in the competition.

225
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
And won the award.

226
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
This has always been my new disease.

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
He promised me that if I help him this time,

228
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
he'll be able to...

229
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
You're lying!

230
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I didn't copy you!

231
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
So, the blinded bird that copied your drawing

232
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
is your drawing?

233
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
That's my drawing in college.

234
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Guan Dong!

235
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Guan Dong, don't trust him!

236
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I drew that flower!

237
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Guan Dong!

238
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
You don't have to come here again.

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Guan Dong!

240
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
You also like me, right?

241
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
We've been in love for so long.

242
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Can you give me another chance?

243
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Don't you want a beautiful pig?

244
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
A beautiful pig can only be made with human blood.

245
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
You use my blood.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Can I write it first?

247
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
As long as Guan Dong opens his mouth,

248
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
there are people who want to write it.

249
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Why do you need yours?

250
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
A person who is greedy for lies and greedy for glory

251
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
is not afraid to steal Guan Dong's painting.

252
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I thought you were like him before.

253
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
But he's not that kind of person.

254
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
He's a liar.

255
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
After all, he's just a liar.

256
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
We're working.

257
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
You don't have to come to Qi Yuan this time.

258
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Guan Dong!

259
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Xie Yi!

260
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
What's the matter with you, Xie Yi?

261
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Xie Yi, why did you lie to me?

262
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Why did you betray me?

263
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
You liar!

264
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
The matter has been settled.

265
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Guan Shan has already made up his mind.

266
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
How can I help you?

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I haven't asked you yet.

268
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
How could he be in the car?

269
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Didn't you tell me

270
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
he wouldn't be here?

271
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
How would I know

272
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
why he would be in the car?

273
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
It's you.

274
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
If it wasn't for you,

275
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
why would Guan Shan Han not want me?

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
It's you who ruined my life!

277
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
The result of today's marriage is you.

278
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It's you who ruined my life.

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
It's you who ruined my life.

280
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
It's you who ruined my life.

281
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
It's you who ruined my life.

282
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
It's you who ruined my life.

283
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Do you think that if you drive me away,

284
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Guan Shan Han will believe you?

285
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't dream about it!

286
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Tell you that

287
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
my life is your tomorrow!

288
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
That's not certain.

289
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
After all, I'm different from you.

290
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I have the thing that he wants the most.

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
The thing that he wants.

292
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Xing Yi, don't say that.

294
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Xing Yi, don't say that.

295
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Don't say that.

296
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

297
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

298
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

299
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

300
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

301
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't know who's going to kill me!

302
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
The End
