Su Yeol, are you going to stay lost

00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
No.

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,160
I don't know how I suddenly ended up here.

13
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,320
Don't you remember?

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
You got stabbed.

15

Stabbed?

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,840
Right, yes.

17
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,600
I did.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Jeong Yun Ho.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
He killed my father.

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,320
I remembered everything.
I didn't kill him.

21
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,920
You're right. It wasn't you.

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,600
So you remembered it too?

23
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Yes.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,760
It was Jeong Yun Ho, that scumbag.
He killed your father.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,040
Let's go.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,440
Let's go catch Jeong Yun Ho.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,760
But what about me?

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,120
Do you not remember my part of the story?

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,000
What? Your part of the story?
What do you mean?

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
You...

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
This is

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,680
the first memory I have of myself.

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,760
I...

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,000
killed someone.

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,600
But you... Why would you do that?

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
Who did you kill?

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,080
Let's kill them for each other.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Your dad and my dad.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,079
Why don't we do it for each other?

40
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,040
What?

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,960
We'd be returning to the same misery
if we were to go back.

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
Let's just get rid of that misery.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,040
That's what you want too, right?

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,200
Jae Hui, you're stronger than you think.

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,240
You can do it.

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
(No.)

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
No way.

48
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
That can't be.

49

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
But your feelings, never.

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,880
My feelings?

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
How I felt at that moment...

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
I remember it more clearly now.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
That intense urge

55
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
to kill that scumbag
standing right in front of me.

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,920
I made you a murderer.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,600
Shut it. That can't be.

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,840
Even if I'm gone,

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,880
you will catch Jeong Yun Ho, right?

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Shut it, you idiot.

61
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,960
I'm sorry,

62
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,080
Ryu Su Yeol.

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
Will you please shut your mouth?

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,320
Su Yeol.

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Are you all right?

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,760
Darn it. What happened?

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Well, you suffered a stab wound.

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,320
But thankfully, it's not too serious.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
The doctor said you can go home
when you wake up.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
I didn't call your family on purpose.

71
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,360
I figured your mother would be
very worried if she found out.

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,640
Well, anything on Jeong Hun yet?

73
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
We're still trying to track him down.

74
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,640
Park Seong Gwan is being questioned
at the moment.

75
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,600
As for Gi So Yeon...
She hasn't regained consciousness yet.

76
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
By the way, Su Yeol.

77
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
Who is K?

78
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,440
-What?
-You kept calling that name in your sleep.

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,280
"K".

80
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
(K?)

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,240
(He came to see me
in the middle of the night.)

82
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
He was here for a while,
looking tormented. Then he left.

83
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,120
(Patient File)

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,680
He always talked about saving the world.

85
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,400
And what? He killed someone?

86
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,720
-It makes no sense.
-Really?

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,200
I think I get it, to a certain degree.

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,760
You get it?

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,280
You, of all people, can't say that.

90
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,320
I know that K is a bit of a nutcase.

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
But he'd never kill anyone, you know?

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,920
I suppose he wanted to save you,

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
not the world.

94
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,840
-What did you say?
-What created K in the first place?

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,600
The personality that the young Ryu Su Yeol
created to protect himself.

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,280
That's K.

97
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,160
And he probably did anything
and everything to protect you.

98
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,040
So,

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
you think

100
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,200
K even killed someone to protect me?

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Well, that's for you to find out.

102
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,520
You know, K...

103
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,120
He won't suddenly
disappear for good, right?

104
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
You said a while back

105
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,120
that he won't disappear suddenly.

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,720
It's not too sudden, is it?

107
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,840
Both you and K have changed a lot.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,280
You... Where have you been?

109
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,680
I went up there alone and...

110
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
-I've been here the whole time.
-Where?

111
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,200
Right by your side.

112
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Look at you, Su Yeol. You can handle
these things pretty well on your own now.

113
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Then is he

114
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
really gone?

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Okay. Now that K is gone,

116
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,320
I guess this is it for us.

117
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,120
Every encounter
inevitably leads to a parting.

118
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,559
This is where we say goodbye.

119

Jeong Yun Ho.

120
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
What if this was all part of his plan?

121
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,760
He knows that I suffered from amnesia.

122
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
So what if

123
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,480
he's deliberately making me doubt
and suspect myself nonstop?

124
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,120
At first, it was me.
Now, it's K, my alter ego.

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,200
He's deliberately distorting your memories
so you can't trust yourself?

126
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,520
Actually, it's a common gaslighting technique.

127
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,600
What will you do now?

128
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,480
If this really is his plan,

129
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,920
I should let him know

130
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,360
that he's messing with the wrong person.

131
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Then you'll be very busy
for a while, right?

132
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
To show you my support,

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll generously waive your fee, so...

134
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll be back, so keep your phone on.

135
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
You'll be back?

136
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,280
Why?

Well, too much time has passed.

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,880
I'm not sure if it can be done,
unless the real culprit gets caught.

142
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,320
A retrial won't be granted easily.

143
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,840
Can you think of a way?

144
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,880
This case is very important to me.

145
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll do my best to catch the culprit
as soon as possible.

146
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,960
You know, with retrials,

147
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,240
it's rare to get good results.

148
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,520
Right, I'm aware.

149
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,560

-Oh, hello.
-I heard you came to visit.

Why is your mother here again?

152
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,280
She opened her psychic business here.

153
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,840
-You heard the background music earlier.
-I see.

154
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
This is leftover fruit from the ritual.

155
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,840
Have some. It's very sweet. Try one.

then the two became one again.

Let's talk in my office.

169
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
Hang on. Are you going through a breakup?

170
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
That's my mom's specialty.

171
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,800
I knew the two of us were destined
to meet. I mean, look at this.

172
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,560
Mom. What should we do, then?

173
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,480
Don't charge him. Don't bother
with a discount. Give him a free reading.

174
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,800
-Deal.
-Okay, sounds good.

175
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,680
-She won't charge you.
-Let's go.

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
-Let's go to my office.
-No, it's okay.

177
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
Come on.

178
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,640
It's this way.

179
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,040
Go and see what she says.

180
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,960
Take good care of him, Mom! Good luck.

181
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
I've never done this before.

182
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
Oh, boy.

183
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,120
Gosh, what do I do now? This is bad.

184
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
You made a wise decision.

185
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,840
Korea is a small country.

186
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
You can't hide forever.

187
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,840
For the sake of your business.

188
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,600
Let's keep it short.

189
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,560
Just find someone
who's willing to pay us well.

190
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,920
If it was strictly about the quality
of your products,

191
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
I'd be able to find
many prospective buyers.

192
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,560
What's the problem?

193
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,320
As you know, everyone in this industry
is holding hard feelings against you guys,

194
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,160
and there were some incidents too.

195
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,040
A murder, even.

196
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
The cops are looking for them
with their eyes peeled,

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,640
so we can't distribute everything as is.

198
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,760
If we have to repackage everything
and do it from scratch,

199
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,280
you can't expect anyone
to pay the full price.

200
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
So you want to cut the price?

201
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,760
A person who's running away
can't take everything, right?

202
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,360
I believe
I've taken good enough care of you.

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,680
You said you didn't have time.

204
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,200
From what I know, many people here
are trying to track you down.

205
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
Shouldn't we just get rid of everything

206
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,560
even if we have to cut the price a little?

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,760
So we can get things sorted out quickly.

208
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
Who's the girl that took our drug
and killed someone?

209
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,480
She's just an ordinary girl.
I don't think she bought it herself.

210
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
The police are also trying
to find the person who gave it to her.

211
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,080
With the police cracking down
on all the dealers,

212
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
it mustn't have been easy to get it.

213
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,400
But this person specifically chose
and used our product?

214
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,400
I need to see who it is.

215
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,400
Who knows?

216
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,440
Someone could be pulling a trick on us
to cut the price.

217
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,920
We need to cover our bases, you know.

218
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
(Munyang Police Agency)

219
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,240
Hey, Andrei showed up?

220
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes. The witnesses' statements match.

221
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,120
Jeez, I was wondering
why he was so quiet. This is a big one.

222
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,360
The victim is a drug dealer
who buys wholesale-level units.

223
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,240
He met him a bunch of times,
which tells me that

224
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,960
he's probably thinking of
selling the business and leaving Korea.

225
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,560
Right, I'm not surprised.
It must be uncomfortable.

226
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,960
He knows we've put out an APB on him.

227
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll handle Andrei for the time being.

228
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,600
What? By yourself?

229
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,840
No way. It's too dangerous.

230
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,360
That's rich coming from someone
who got stabbed.

231
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,160
Don't worry about anything else.

232
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,600
Just find Jeong Hun.

233
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,880
We must catch Jeong Yun Ho.

234
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Thanks, Lee Hui Gyeom.

235
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,480
Jeez, look at the mess you're in.

236
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,880
I don't want you anywhere near the bar
from now on.

237
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,760
You came all the way here,
and that's what you say?

238
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,080
I told you to just let her go, didn't I?

239
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,640
Did you look into it?

240
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
Look into what?

241
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Do you really want to do that to a kid?

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,040
A kid, my foot. That lunatic...

243
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,480
He threatened me with a knife.

244
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
But the stuff I heard
during my police interview

245
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,720
makes me think that there's definitely
something between So Yeon and that kid.

246
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
Jeez, you idiot.

247
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,280
I have some guys looking for him.

248
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,920
They're illegal immigrants,
so they were cheap. Three million won.

249
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
Three million?

250
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
Hey.

251
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,920
Make sure they find him until I get out.

252
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,560
I must take care of that jerk myself.

253
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,080
What will happen to Park Seong Gwan?

254
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Gyeong Tae.

255
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,840
(Munyang General Hospital)

256
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,800
If someone does that to my daughter,

257
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,440
I will kill that person.

258
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
What? What is it?

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,920
Why? Did you see someone?

260
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
-Sim Jeong Hun.
-Jeong Hun?

261
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,839
Yes, I think I saw Jeong Hun just now.

262
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,240
He's dead, so I feel bad, but...

263
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
Frankly, I shouldn't even feel bad.

264
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,240
Su Hun was a total scumbag.

265
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,400
He didn't even come
to his father's funeral.

266
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,200
Then he showed up drunk

267
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,840
and caused a scene, demanding that
we give him all the condolence money.

268
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,760
Gosh.

269
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
Jeong Hun doesn't have any friends,

270
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,040
so we're struggling to find out
where he could be.

271
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,160
Did you keep in touch
with Jeong Hun at all?

272
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,240
No. He probably doesn't even know
where we live now.

273
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
After my brother
and sister-in-law ended up like that,

274
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,840
I invited Jeong Hun over for dinner
a few times because I felt bad for him.

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
But every time, Su Hun somehow found out

276
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,400
and caused a scene, demanding money.

277
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,400
So it's been a long time
since I cut off all contact with him.

278
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,320
I'm sure it's the same
for all the other relatives.

279
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,920
Darn it. What now?

280
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Sir, what took you so long?

281
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,000
-Please help me.
-Peekaboo.

282
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,400
You jerk.

283
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,280
Hey! We could've fallen. Why did you jump?

284
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,800
-Don't come near me.
-Didn't you miss me?

285
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,520
I missed you so much!

286
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
Darn it.

287
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
You little...

288
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,400
Hey, you punk. K!

289
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
Where have you been?

290
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,800
I can't believe you went AWOL on me!
You little...

291
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,480
You fool.

292
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,040
What's your problem?

293
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,440
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,400
I mistook you for someone else.

295
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,040
-My goodness.
-I'm sorry.

296
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Jeez.

297
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,120
Gosh, what is this?

298
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,400
Am I lovesick or what?

299
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,360
Darn it, seriously.

300
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,920
-A little more on this side.
-More?

301
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,120
What else?

302
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
Lose the hair. Go bald.

303
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,560
You said he was in his 40s.

304
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,760
Jeez. You're clueless, aren't you?

305
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
Hey, my friend is already going bald.

306
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,240
-Oh, no.
-Hurry up.

307
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,520
-From the forehead and up.
-Like this?

308
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,920
Yes, perfect.
This is what my friend looks like.

309
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,200
-His hair looks just like this.
-Poor him.

Hey, Gyeong Tae.

312
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,120
Captain, I got a call
from the hospital earlier.

313
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,360
Someone called and asked
how Gi So Yeon was doing.

314
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
(-It was a young man.)
-What?

315
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
He hung up upon being asked who he was.

316
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,240
I looked into it, and the call was placed
from a payphone

317
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,800
in Samgyeong-dong, where Jeong Hun lives.

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
-Listen to me.
-Yes, man!

320
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,960
-I know. Shut up.
-Look, listen to me.

321
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,280
-It's nothing. Are you kidding me?
-No, listen.

322
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,560
-You, man!
-I can't believe this.

323
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,360
-It's nothing!
-What about this, then?

324
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
You're too loud. Come on. Shut up.

325
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800
Darn it.

326
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,480
This is too much.

327
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,520
Who are you guys?

328
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,640
Hey, quiet! Be quiet.

329
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
Be quiet.

330
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
Korean. Speak Korean.

331
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,760
Can you speak Korean?

332
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,320
Korean? Yes!

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,960
-I'm learning Korean.
-Okay, go on.

334
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,360
We're all friends.

335
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,640
Right?

336
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,480
Be quiet! Shut up.

337
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,040
Yes, shut your trap.

338
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
Friends, my foot. Why am I your friend?

339
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,960
Hold on.

340
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
I'm... Korean police.

341
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,080
You know what "police" means, right?

342
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,400
-Police?
-Relax.

343
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,720
Hey, see this?

344
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,840
What's this in English?

345
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,520
Anyway, here. Take it.

346
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,840
Put it on. Just one.

347
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,120
Good. Hey, you too!

348
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,480
Now, your phones. Hand them over.

349
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,400
Here.

350
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,880
-Go in.
-Why...

351
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,200
-In!
-Okay.

352
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,360
-Okay.
-Go in.

353
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,360
Quiet. Keep your mouths shut.

354
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
Don't even say a word, okay?

355
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
Who are these punks?

356
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
Yes, hello.

357
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm calling to file a report.

358
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm at 45-gil, Samgyeong-ro, Samgyeong-gu.

359
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,200
-A break-in. Yes.
-Hey!

360
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,000
Who is this rat now?

361
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,920
Who are you? What? Hey!

362
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,120
What the... You're that guy, aren't you?

363
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,280
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

364
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,680
-I'm not!
-You're not what?

365
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,400
I don't know you.

366
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,680
We've never met before.

367
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,880
Look at you.
Your Korean is as fluent as ever.

368
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,160
Hold on. I thought you were deported.

369
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,600
After getting pummeled at the store...

370
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,880
Are you done playing?

371
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,480
I want to play some more.

372
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,560
Don't laugh!

373
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,720
-Don't tell me what to do!
-Hey!

374
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,600
I was just beginning
to pull myself together.

375
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,600
You... Why did you have to show up
out of the blue?

376
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,480
Why must you show up again
and remind me of him? You jerk!

377
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,040
Why must you do this to me? Just why?

378
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
Sir, I have to support my wife and kids.

379
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,040
Please forgive me just this once.

380
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,960
Then what the heck are you doing here?

381
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,080
Go back to your country and live properly!
You little...

382
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,600
Darn it.

383
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,240
You jerk! You just wait.

384
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,960
Every encounter is an act of providence.

385
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,960
We will meet again if it's meant to be.

386
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,480
Don't push me!

387
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
(Police)

388
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,720
I understand why he's so angry.

389
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,280
After being deported, he was sent to jail
in his homeland. Then he escaped

390
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,480
and only managed to reenter the country
illegally three days ago. My goodness.

391
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,800
-Take it easy.
-You too.

392
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,240
Hey, Gyeong Tae. Doesn't Jeong Hun work
at a Chinese restaurant in this area?

393
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,480
(Gukban)

394
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,400
Darn it.

395
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,040
(Gukban)

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,000
Shoot.

397
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,040
(Gukban)

398
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,880
You woke up.

399
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,040
I'm okay.

400
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,080
(CCTV in Operation)

401
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920
It's just a minor cut.

402
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,800
How did you know I'd be here?

403
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
I am a cop, after all.

404
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,680
Let's go, buddy.

405
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
Well, I guess I'm a bit too old
to be your buddy.

406
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,440
Jeong Hun.

407
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,480
If you stop here,

408
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,320
you can completely turn your life around,
for the better.

409
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,040
You won't believe me,

410
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,800
but I went through something similar
in the past.

411
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,960
So?

412
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Are you saying
I should escape the misery by myself?

413
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,240
And ditch her, just like that?

414
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,720
I'll help So Yeon too.

415
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,760
I know that you guys didn't come up
with this plan.

416
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,280
Someone else put you up to this, right?

417
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,880
Just tell me who that person is.

418
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,160
I'll take care of the rest.

419
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,400
But you

420
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,360
couldn't even save Baek Young Joo.

421
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
You're right.

422
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,280
But you see,

423
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,160
I really want to protect you.

424
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,360
I mean it.

425
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Can I

426
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,160
really trust you?

427
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,240
Can you really save her?

428
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,360
Now, tell me.

429
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,760
Who put you up to this?

430
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,760
Who is it?

431
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,280
Stay right here. Don't move.

432
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
(Gukban)

433
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,680
(Jae Hui.)

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,120
Jeong Yun Ho?

435
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,640
(You know, Jeong Hun...)

436
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
(Doesn't he remind you of yourself?)

437
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,480
You scumbag.
What did you do to these kids?

438
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,120
(Now, do you remember)

439
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,400
(how special it is? This thing we share.)

440
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,680
You psycho.

441
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,080
(Jae Hui, you haven't changed one bit.)

442
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,200
(You look terrified,)

443
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,800
(just like you did back then.)

444
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,440
Where are you?

445
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,960
Come out. Show yourself, you jerk!

446
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
Darn it.

447
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
(Gukban)

448
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Jeong Hun.

449
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Jeong Hun!

450
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
Sim Jeong Hun!

451
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,120
(Taxi)

452
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,760
Park Seong Gwan.

453
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
What is this about?

454
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,840
I heard you're under investigation
for allegedly assaulting Gi So Yeon.

455
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,200
What about it?

456
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,880
There is a good chance that
Sim Jeong Hun will find you again.

457
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,800
We'll protect you for the time being.

458
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,160
Jeez, I must say...

459
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,360
This is ridiculous.

460
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,360
The jerk who should get locked up
is roaming freely,

461
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,880
yet you want to follow me around
to surveil me.

462
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
Darn it!

463
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,440
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

464
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,640
It's not like we became cops
to protect dirtbags like you, you know?

465
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,200
-What?
-Sir.

466
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,560
We're doing our best to apprehend
Sim Jeong Hun as quickly as possible.

467
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,560
Try not to go to places
for the time being and--

468
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,240
Who are you to tell me what not to do?

469
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,080
It's none of your business!

470
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,840
And

471
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,280
you'd better

472
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,040
catch that kid very soon.

473
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,920
If I catch him before you do,
I'll break his spine in half.

474
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,960
Hey!

475
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,040
Jeez, you startled me.

476
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,480
Someone can't even move
after getting beaten up by you.

477
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,280
How about I make sure you can't
go anywhere after this very moment?

478
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,560
Shut your trap and go inside.

479
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,480
Just pray that we'll find Jeong Hun soon.

480
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
If I see you out and about,

481
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,840
I will break your spine in half!

482
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,520
I'll flip you before I fold you in half.

483
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

484
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,120
I mean, yes. Okay.

(Munyang Police Agency)

486
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,760
I will ask you one last time.

487
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,120
Who hired this jerk to tail Sim Jeong Hun?

488
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,920
Are you trying to be a loyal friend?

489
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,760
Fine.

490
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,960

you recently expanded your business

00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,200
and renovated the entire space.

492
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,560
-We'll just shut it down then, okay?
-What?

493
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,760
Come on. Don't be like that.

494
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,160
Of course, it was Park Seong Gwan.
Who else?

495
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,400
He can't control his temper.

496
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,200
He beat up a woman
and wants to catch this kid.

497
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,080
He's a total scumbag.

498
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,560
That scumbag practically begged me,
so I had no choice.

499
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,680
What does that make you?
You're not a scumbag?

500
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,520
-Is it ready yet?
-Three more seconds.

501
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,440
It's ready.

502
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,680
Gosh, I was starving.

503
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,960
It's hot!

504
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Jeez.

505
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,440
It's so hot.

506
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
Yes, all clear...

507
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
We got the warrant on Park Seong Gwan.
Arrest him.

508
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,640
Okay, got it.

509
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,440
-Hey, let's go.
-Okay.

510
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,160
My gosh,
he already finished the whole thing.

511
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,560
Even so. He told them it was me?
That moron.

512
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,480
Park Seong Gwan.

513
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,440
Park Seong Gwan.

514
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,840
Hey, Park Seong Gwan!

515
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,720
Hey, stay right there.

516
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,400
If you jump from that height, you'll die!

517
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,800
Gyeong Tae! Over here!

518
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,960
Park Seong Gwan!

519
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,440
If you jump, you'll die.
Hey, it's dangerous!

520
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,960
Calm down. Hey!

521
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,760
-Hey!
-Hey, don't!

522
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,239
-Hey!
-You punk. Park Seong Gwan!

523
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,520
Hey!

524
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,000
If I catch you, you're dead meat.
Gyeong Tae, over here!

525
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,840
-Darn it!
-That little...

526
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
Darn it!

527
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,199
Morons.

528
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,480
Jeong Hun took Park Seong Gwan?

529
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,199
(Yes. According to the situation room,
they're headed to Munmi-dong.)

530
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,880
Munmi-dong? Why?

531
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,280
(Captain.)

532
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,400
(Gi So Yeon is at the hospital
in Munmi-dong.)

533
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,200
Hey. This time,
it doesn't look like a trap.

534
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,840
Hurry, okay?

535
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,040
(Munyang General Hospital)

536
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
You're here.

537
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,920
Are you sure they're not in the building?

538
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,840
Yes, there's no trace of them
entering the building.

539
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,160
We were told by the situation room
that they came this way.

540
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Hey, let's spread out and look for them.

541
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,880
Check behind the building too.

542
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,320
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, call us.

543
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,000
Darn it. Where did they go?

544
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
-Spare me.
-Why? Why should I spare you?

545
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,240
Why are you doing this to me?

546
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,320
Why the heck are you doing this to me?

547
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,120
How did she wrong you?

548
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,240
What did she even do?

549
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,040
Let's put an end to this.

550
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Jeong Hun!

551
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,880
Stop! Don't come any closer!

552
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,560
This is wrong.

553
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
This will only bring more misery,
Jeong Hun!

554
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
Enough of your nonsense.

555
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,440
There is nothing you can do.

556
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,120
Park Seong Gwan will be arrested.

557
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,720
He'll be arrested and pay for what he did!

558
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,960
-It's too late.
-What?

559
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,920
Now, this scumbag has to die
for her to live!

560
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
(X has invited you to chat.)

561
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,880
(Hun: The cops are after me
and that jerk.)

562
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,200
(X: Do you think it'll be too hard?)

563
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,480
(X: Then I'll save her)

564
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,240
(so she can be free, forever.)

565
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,960
Stop.

566
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,960
Stop. Stop, you punk!

567
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,480
Let go!

568
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,040
Please...

569
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,960
If I fail again,

570
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,760
that woman will die.

571
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
He's watching me.

-Su Yeol!
-Hey.

576
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
Su Yeol! Are they here?

577
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,000
-Take care of this and follow me.
-Okay.

578
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,680
-Hey.
-Jeong Hun.

579
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
Are you all right, Jeong Hun?

580
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,000
-Hey.
-I'll...

581
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,680
-I'll go.
-Okay!

582
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,920
Are you okay?

583
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,880
Gyeong Tae.

584
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,800
Check Gi So Yeon's condition
and request backup.

585

-Captain, what's going on?
-It's Jeong Yun Ho.

(Convenience Store, This Way)

588
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,440
Is it you? Are you Jeong Yun Ho?

589
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,480
Dad!

590
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,880
Dad.

591
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,880
Why are you being like this?

592
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
Why?

593
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,720
Why are you being like this?
Have you forgotten everything?

594
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,600
All right.

595
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
It's okay. I'll help you remember.
It's all right.

596
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
-It's okay, Jae Hui.
-Don't kill me.

597
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,560
Don't kill me...

598
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,240
Don't kill me.

599
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,720
Now, do you remember?

600
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
You got rid of my dad for me.

601
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,200
That scumbag... You wanted your dad gone,

602
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,640
so you got rid of my dad first.
You remember, right?

603
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,440
Jae Hui, open your eyes.

604
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,080
Open your eyes!

605
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,120
(You remember now, right?)

606
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,840
Right? You got rid of my dad for me.

607
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,760
Don't kill me.

608
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,080
Please, don't kill me. Please.

609
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,800
You remember everything.

610
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,560
Jae Hui, I know you remember everything.
Think!

611
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,320
Look at me, Jae Hui.

612
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,480
This isn't how it was supposed to be.
Try to remember.

613

I know you remember everything, Jae Hui!

Think!

How is he supposed to remember
what he didn't do? You jerk.

616
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,120
Do you suddenly remember doing things
that never happened

617
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,600
if someone insists that you did them?

618
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,840
If I keep insisting
that you pooped when you didn't,

619
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,280
do you suddenly remember doing it?
You psycho!

620
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,680
Hey, why are you being like this?

621

You little...

622
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,160
Does bossing around a kid

623
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,320
make you feel powerful?

624
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,920
Does killing people

625
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,080
make you feel powerful?

626
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,040
You're just...

627
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,640

It wasn't you.

630
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,240
You didn't kill anyone.

631
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,720
You saved me.

All right. Let me introduce myself again.

I am

635

Su Yeol's hero, no one else's.

636

I am Su Yeol's action star.

There's life and death in this world.

As I am born again today,

641
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,200
I will kill you.

642
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,400
You're Jeong Yun Ho?

643
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,440
You're laughing?

644
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,120
Go ahead. Answer it.

645
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,680

(Jae Hui. You're not alone, right?)

651
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,960
(You haven't changed a bit.)

652
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,480
(You're still the same.)

653
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,920
(You're the same boy
I met those years ago.)

654
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,160
(I'm waiting for you.)

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,200
(We will meet soon.)

656
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,960
(Munyang Police Agency)

657
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,000
Jeong Hun,
you're really not going to say anything?

658
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,920
Su Yeol.

659
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,760
They want us to send Jeong Hun to
Juvenile Protection Education Institution.

660
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
Why don't we eat first?

661
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,080
You should have called first.
I would've cooked more food then.

662
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,800
I would have brought meat.

663
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,040
Why the fuss?
We can just eat the food we have at home.

664
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
Where have I seen this guy?

665
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,240
I know.

666
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,200
When Su Yeol first came to us,

667
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,160
he had the same vibe and bruises
that covered up his handsome face.

668
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,280
He resembles Su Yeol
when he was young, right?

669
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,640
Just eat.

670
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,240
Where did you get hurt like that?

671
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,040
Goodness.
You didn't even apply any ointment.

672
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,640
Wait.

673
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,560
Mom, just eat. I'll go look for it.
You won't be able to find it anyway.

674
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,680
Hey, I can find the ointment.

675
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,800
You're unbelievable. You're treating me
like an Alzheimer's patient.

676
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,800
But you do have it.

677
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,040
-Come on.
-What?

678
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,360
I organized your medicine cabinet.
If you mess it up, you can't find it.

679
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,640
You little...

680
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,880
Do you want to bet? Come here.

681
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,160
Bet? When you lose,
you really have to pay up.

682
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,040
-You keep just making bets.
-When did I lose?

683
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,560
My name used to be In Jae Hui

684
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
until I was 13.

685
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,440
My father, whom I lived with until then,

686
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,400
was busy beating me up every single day.

687
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,280
After my father died,
I had no place to go.

688
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,680
And those chatty people took me in.

689
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,800
Only then, I finally had a real family.

690
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,840
Right now,
I cherish them more than my life.

691
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,160
I really hate to be
one of those old people who give advice.

692
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,680
So I rarely talk about this.

693
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,960
But in this world,
there are a lot more good people

694
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,040
than you think.

695
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,360
Eat up.

696
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,960
My mom is a great cook.

697
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,720
I found someone
who's willing to pay the price.

698
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,640
Let's sell it off as we planned.

699
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,560
And that jerk we talked about?

700
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,000
I don't think it was our regular client.

701
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,160
And the drug didn't come
from the clubs either.

702
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,320
Maybe,

703
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,720
that kid just got lucky.

704
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,920
So she killed her father
with the drug she found by chance

705
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,800
and got caught by the police
for using our stuff.

706
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,200
And she somehow escaped
and killed herself in front of the police?

707
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,840
I've never seen
these many coincidences line up like this.

708
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,040
If we lose this opportunity,

709
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,720
we might not get to leave.

710
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,480
You.

711
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,200
You don't want to leave.

712
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,800
You have it easy, man.

713
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,120
You startled me.

714
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,640
How can you doze off right now?

715
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,120
-Seriously.
-What?

716
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,360
Did you find anything?

717
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,760
Gosh. Who do you think I am?

718
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,200
Go on. Tell me.

719
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,800
Should I tell you or not?

720
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,960
Read the room, will you?

721
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,520
Some people were looking
into a ferry to Russia.

722
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,120
Two seats.

723
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,120
Two seats? Not one?

724
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,800
Who's this?

725
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,840
Probably the passenger for the other seat.

726
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
You know, the drugs from Russia? The Eye.

727
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,600
Russians called it the Eye of the Dragon.

728
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,240
-Eye of the Dragon?
-This woman goes by Boss Yong.

729
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,480
Yong, as in the dragon.

730
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:00,960
(Eyes Candy)

731
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,240
The Eye.
(Eyes Candy)

732
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,720
(Eyes Candy)

733
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,960
"Eyes Candy"?
(Eyes Candy)

734
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,480
(Eyes Candy)

735
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,760
(Eyes Candy)

736
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,320
(Eyes Candy)

737
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,720
(It had to be our stuff.)

738
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,960
(It was to lure the cop
that caught Kim Gye Sik.)

739
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,080
And who told you to do that?

740
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,520
(Our ferry will depart soon.)

741
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,880
Do you think you can get here on time?

742
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,520
I don't have much time.

743
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,800
Your head is next,
not your fingers this time.

744
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,440
Who was it?

745
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,360
Who told you to do that?

746
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,120
Goodbye.

747
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
(Andrei.)

748
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,080
Andrei.

749
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,040
You're quite a fighter too, aren't you?

750
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,200
Andrei!

751
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,400
There are always surprises in life.

752
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,800
I bet you didn't see it coming either.

753
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,960
How you would end up dead
in a dump like this.

754
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,520
How did you end up dead here?

755
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,280
Who are you?

756
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,600
What do you want?

757
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,240
Here's a thing about me.

758
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,320
I really hate it
when my plans get disrupted.

759
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,520
And you weren't part of my plan.

760
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,960
Where are you?

761
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,360
Where are you?

762
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,360
(Andrei.)

763
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,240
(-Answer me.)
-Go without me.

764
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,760
Where are you?

765
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,960
Yun Ho.

766
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,240
Where's Andrei?

767
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,360
-Who are you after?
-What?

768
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,840
Answer me.

769
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,000
Who are you chasing?

770
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,200
Hey.

771
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,920
Hey.

772
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,960
Hey. Stop right there! Darn it.

773
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,240
Stop right there!

774
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,480
Darn it.

775
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,120
Hey, stop!

776
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,360
(Police Line, Do Not Cross)

777
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,480
Hui Gyeom, are you all right?

778
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,200
I heard. She goes by Boss Yong?

779
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,240
Are you hurt?

780
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,720
Who do you think did it?

781
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,760
Someone who could kill both of them.

782
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,440
(Answer me.)

783
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,200
Who are you after?

784
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,040
The jerk we're after.

785
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,120
Jeong Yun Ho?

786
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,360
-Mom, I'm leaving.
-Okay. Hold on.

787
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,800
Goodness.

788
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,120
Lighten up. You'll chase away your luck.

789
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Okay.

790
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,560
Why did you pack food?

791
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,840
It's for that boy
you brought home the other day.

792
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,280
He seemed to like my side dishes.
So I packed some for him.

793
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,320
He can have food there, right?

794
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,520
Go on.

795
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,840
-See you later.
-Okay.

796
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,920
(Visiting Room)

797
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,000
I didn't come here to ask questions today.

798
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,280
My mom packed some side dishes you liked.

799
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,200
She wanted you to eat.
That's why I'm here.

800
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,680
If you don't want to talk, then don't.

801
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,920
It'd be nice to hear you talk, though.

802
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,480
I'll wait.

803
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,960
Talk to me when you are ready.

804
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,560
I won't force you.

805
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,840
She really packed only side dishes.

806
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,400
My mom has been forgetful lately.

807
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,200
What do you say? Do you still
want to try the side dishes?

808
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,200
Su Yeol.

809
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,400
What are you going to do now?

810
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,280
About Jeong Yun Ho.

811
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,520
Isn't it obvious?

812
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,320
I must catch him no matter what.

813
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,200
But he knows about me.

814
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,920
So what?

815
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,200
He'll try to use that against you.

816
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,280
So what?

817
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,440
Isn't it time
that you got rid of me for good?

818
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,120
I think I know why

819
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,000
he's doing this to me.

820
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,720
He's enjoying this.

821
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,880
While watching me.

822
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,600
From the beginning,
I thought it was like some sort of game.

823
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,960
It's like he invited you
to this horrible game.

824
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,960
To beat him,

825
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,640
I have no choice
but to play this crazy game, right?

826
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,360
Will you be okay?

827
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,720
Dr. Sin.

828
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,200
You told me before
that you would help me. Right?

829
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,160
If I can help in any way, I will.

830
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,520
I have

831
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,480
a split personality.

832
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,720
Did you already know?

833
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,600
Yes, I had my suspicions.

834
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,520
I really need to treat it now.

835
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,320
Can you help me?

836
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
Sure.

837
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,480
-I'll see you at your next appointment.
-Okay.

838
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,920
(Conference Room)

839
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,040
(When I saw)

840
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,600
(Baek Young Joo at the shelter,)

841
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,600
she was

842
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,840
(crying.)

843
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,640
Why was she crying?

844
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,560
(Because)

845
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,680
(he was in front of her.)

846
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,200
Even if she wanted to stop,

847
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,800
she couldn't.

848
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,520
"He"?

849
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,720
Sin Ju Hyeok?

850
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,880
In Jae Hui.

851
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,320
You opened your eyes.

852
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,200
You have beautiful eyes.

853
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,360
You have beautiful eyes.

854
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,200
Jae Hui, you're stronger than you think.

855
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,480
You can do it.

856
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,520
I'm sure that
you're a lot stronger than you think.

857
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,840
Believe in yourself.

858
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,520
(You haven't changed a bit either.)

859
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,960
(You're still the same.)

860
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,600
(Jeong Yun Ho.)

861
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,200
(Bad, Evil, Crazy)

862
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,000
(Bad and Crazy)

863
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,240
We should prove
that jerk is a psychopathic murderer.

864
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,920
If it's okay with you,
can I talk to K first today?

865
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,080
The therapy files.

866
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,040
(What if he kept records
of every session he gave so far?)

867
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,080
Excuse me.

868
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,880
She cremated Andrei's body.

869
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,880
I want to catch him as much as you do.

870
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,400
I understand everything.

871
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,880
Just remember this one thing.

872
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,040
This is how Sin Ju Hyeok
has been provoking the kids.

873
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,440
You crazy jerk!

874
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,560
(And when will this game end?)

875
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,360
(Heart Mender)
(And when will this game end?)

876
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,000
(And when will this game end?)

877
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,080
(To Seong Bok Jun, From Jeong Yun Ho)
(And when will this game end?)

878
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,160
(To Seong Bok Jun, From Jeong Yun Ho)

879
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,040
Will it ever end?
(To Seong Bok Jun, From Jeong Yun Ho)

880
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,840
Will it ever end?

881
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,000
(I'll let him drag me into misery.)
