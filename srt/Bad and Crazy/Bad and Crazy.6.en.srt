Will you write a novel about it
and become a best-selling author?

-Me?

42

Kim Gye Sik is a total psycho.

43

It'd be too dangerous
to get Jae Seon and Gyeong Tae involved.

(Munyang Love Rehabilitation Center)

162
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
This man never received treatment here?

163
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,920
That's correct. He's not our patient.

164
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,440
Hold on, that man...

165
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,720
Maybe he is Woo Hyeok Jin's friend.

166
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,360
Woo Hyeok Jin? Who is that?

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,960
Excuse me. We need help.

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
Help!

169
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,360
Did Sim Sang Ho visit him often?

170
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
No, he didn't really visit him.

171
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,160
He always managed to find Hyeok Jin.

172
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,360
Every time Hyeok Jin escaped,
he found him and brought him back.

173
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,000
Hyeok Jin continued to escape,
but he never gave up.

174
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,280
So they must've had
a special relationship.

175
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,200
And he must feel indebted to Sim Sang Ho.

176
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
That's right.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,280
That man, Woo Hyeok Jin.
Do you have a photo of him?

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,080
(You might be able to find him
at the junkyard)

179
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
(near the reservoir.)

180
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,320
(Once, Hyeok Jin was found there
passed out,)

181
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,920
(and we rescued him.)

182
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I can't really see well
even with this thing.

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,840
Darn it.

184
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
They all look scruffy.

185
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,600
Let's move in.

186
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,680
-Move in?
-Yes.

187
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
-Where? You mean, there?
-Yes.

188
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Hey, we don't even know
whether or not he's there now.

189
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
What if we move in now,
and Kim Gye Sik finds out?

190
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,520
Then what? Just stay here?

191
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
Darn you.

192
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,080
Hey, remember Jeong Il Su's minions?

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,080
I bet they're all here.

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't you remember?

195
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,720
We beat them up and threw them around.

196
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,240
If they see us now,
they'll recognize us right away.

197
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,800
What? We'll die
if we mess with the wrong druggies?

198
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,440
Who was the one that said it?

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
You're a druggie too.

200
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
What?

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,400
Su Yeol.

202
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,640
Are you not addicted yet?

203
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
-Why you little...
-Hush.

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,720
Darn it.

205
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Hey, hang on.

206
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
Addicted, druggies...

207
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes, that's it.

208
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,520
You got it.

209
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,640
This fits me perfectly.

210
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,360
Nice, sunglasses.

211
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
Who are you?

212
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,880
Hey, that looks good on you.

213
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,040
Swag.

214
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Well, I'll be off then.

215
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,280
No, let's swap again.

216
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Thanks, bye.

217
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,520
Just wear it, you twerp. Look at you.

218
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
It suits you.

219
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,320
Hey, I'm very squeamish.

220
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
You're such a weakling.

221
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Hey! Take it off. I'll do it.

222
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,440
Good grief.

223
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,920
Okay, you do it.

224
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,160
You jerk.

225
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,680
You are me, and I am you.
So it means I'm doing it anyway!

226
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,000
Did you realize that just now? Idiot.

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
Are you all right, Su Yeol?

228
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Oh, boy.

229
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,440
Jeez. What the heck did you eat?

230
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
(Establish Law and Order

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,920
-Can you see this?
-Yes. I can see it very well, Mr. Nam.
(Attorney Nam Eun Seok)

232
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,480
-Can you see this?
-Yes. I can see it very well, Mr. Nam.

233
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,000
Good. Until recently, I worked
at the Southern Prosecutors' Office.

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,880
I just opened my own practice,
and Superintendent Ryu is my first client.

235
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,320
Since it's my very first case,
I'll do my utmost.

236
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
Just a moment, please.

237
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,440
Hi, Mom.

238
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,320
The sofa? I exchanged it
with a different model. Why?

239
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,600
No, don't. If you return it,
we'll have nowhere to sit.

240
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,400
Just accept the delivery. All right.

241
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm setting up my office at the moment.
Where was I?

242
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
Right. I'll do my very best,
so don't worry too much.

243
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,320
Okay, I won't.

244
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,240
So the thing is,

245
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,080
in order for me to be acquitted,

246
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,400
I need to find evidence or a witness
who can help me prove my innocence...

247
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Hi, Mom.

248
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,040
Of course, it's the new office smell.

249
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,480
It's a brand new office.
What do you expect?

250
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
You know, if you... Where did I put it?
In the corner.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
There's the air purifier!

252
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
No, I'm not angry.

253
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm working now, okay? Bye.

254
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,280
What's the matter with her?

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,960
My apologies. She faints
when I don't answer her calls right away.

256
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,960
Anyway, I'm looking out for you.

257
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,240
And you're considered innocent
until proven guilty.

258
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Once my office is all set up,
we'll talk about things one by one.

259
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Sure.

260
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
Anyhow, based on the current situation,

261
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,040
they'll most likely keep me detained
while investigating...

262
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Go on.

263
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
-You should answer it.
-No, it's okay.

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
-Answer it.
-Okay.

265
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,880
Yes, hi.

266
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,800
How would I know where the rag is?

267
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,960
Mom! See the coat rack in the corner?

268
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,640
Do you see the clothes on that thing?
My clothes. They're all rags. Use them.

269
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Use those, please.

270
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,880
No! They are rags, so just use them.
I have to go. Bye.

271
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
I told you! I'm working right now.

272
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm not angry. It's just that...

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
My mom is too caring.

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,440
So, Superintendent Ryu
is your first client?

275
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,200
Yes, we're close.

276
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
Okay.

277
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,160
-It's hot in here. Is it always like this?
-Ryu Su Yeol, that jerk...

278
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,560
Turn on the AC! Is there no AC here?

279
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,960
Don't be nervous.

280
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,640
I'm right here for you.

281
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,760
Shut your mouth.

282
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Hey.

283
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,920
Me?

284
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,400
Oh, boy.

285
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,480
Let me see your arm.

286
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Sorry?

287
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,960
What are you doing?

288
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
Hand it over.

289
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,720
What? Hand what over?

290
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,920
You need to pay me
if you want to get your fix, moron.

291
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, take it easy.

292
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,119
Hey!

293
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,599
What did you do to my arm?

294
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,680
Su Yeol, you never come prepared.

295
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
(I poked it with a needle.)

296
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,839
Hey, you bled quite a bit earlier.
Aren't you dizzy now?

297
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,280
You little...

298
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,040
I can't believe you did that.

299
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,040
-Don't move.
-Darn it.

300
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,280
-Here, I found it.
-Darn you.

301
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,960
-You jerks!
-It's the Eye!

302
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Let me see.

303
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,000
Hey.

304
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,760
Hey. It's your first time here, isn't it?

305
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
You shouldn't come here alone.

306
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,320
Consider this your hazing.

307
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
Gosh, your head must hurt like crazy now.

308
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Are you okay?
At least you're not bleeding.

309
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Hold on.

310
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,640
I feel like
I've seen him somewhere before.

311
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
Why does he look so familiar?

312
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
If you know this guy,
that means he's a cop.

313
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,760
Take that and get lost.

314
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120
Jeez, that punk.

315
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Wait, hold on.

316
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,160
Maybe this punk
is really hiding something.

317
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
A real addict would never
give away drugs so easily.

318
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,120
Hold on.

319
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,680
Is he really a cop?

320
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,760
Shoot this up.

321
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,120
Do it right here.

322
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,840
-Hey.
-Do it!

323
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,480
-Hey.
-You've done it once.

324
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,120
Just go for it.

325
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,040
What the heck are you saying?

326
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,600
Then what? Get killed by these dirtbags?

327
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,280
Just do it and get it over with
so these guys will leave us alone.

328
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
Why don't you shoot up, then? You jerk.

329
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,400
You said I could count on you!
You nutcase.

330
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
This punk...

331
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,600
He's lost it. Let's go, guys.

332
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,600
He is a junkie.

333
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,640
Gosh, my head...

334
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,920
My head hurts.

335
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
Don't ever forget, Su Yeol.

336
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,960
I saved you, yet again.

337
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,320
Shut your mouth!

338
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Gosh, it really hurts.

339
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
That little...

340
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,320
Mr. Woo Hyeok Jin?

341
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,160
You are Woo Hyeok Jin, right?

342
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,320
Hey. You know Sim Sang Ho, don't you?

343
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,800
Sang Ho?

344
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,160
Yes, that's right.

345
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,960
I told you! That punk is a cop.

346
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,400
-Get him!
-Get him.

347
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,120
Hey!

348
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Come here.

349
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,480
You piece of... You're dead meat.

350
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
Darn you!

351
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,520
-Hey, this way!
-Go!

352
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,760
Hey! Just get back here, idiot.

353
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,480
What is the matter with that weirdo?

354
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,880
Su Yeol! Run! Go!

355
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,240
-Come on. Run!
-Why? What's going on?

356
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
Hey, run!

357
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,560
-Over there!
-Get him!

358
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:32,640
(Heart Mender)

359
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
Yes, I'm leaving now.
(Heart Mender)

360
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,760
Yes, I'm leaving now.

361
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,120
Sure thing. I have the cash ready.

362
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,080
Jjakgwi is still there, right?

363
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,120
I see. Agwi is there too?

364
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
That's great.

365
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,120
Those jerks.
Today, I'll do whatever it takes to...

366
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,040
(Heart Mender)
Those jerks.
Today, I'll do whatever it takes to...

367
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,920
Hold on.

368
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:50,920
(Lease Inquiries)

369
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Darn it. Who pooped here?
(Lease Inquiries)

370
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,280
Darn it. Who pooped here?

371
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,200
Clean up after yourself! Good grief.

372
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,040
-My gosh!
-Move. Out of my way!

373
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,520
-What's your problem?
-Go! Move.

374
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,720
Hurry! He's heavy!

375
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,120
-Hang on a second.
-Jeez, hurry!

376
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,880
What do you want? Who are you?

377
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,320
You're probably surprised and confused,
but don't be alarmed.
(Heart Mender)

378
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,160
You're probably surprised and confused,
but don't be alarmed.

379
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
I'm Ryu Su Yeol in Munyang Police Agency's
Anti-Corruption Unit.

380
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,560
Mr. Woo Hyeok Jin.

381
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm going to ask you
a few questions, okay?

382
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,240
Mr. Woo Hyeok Jin! Well...

383
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,960
You know Sim Sang Ho, right?

384
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,640
Your friend, Sim Sang Ho.

385
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,160
I heard he helped you a lot.

386
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,600
Goodness.

387
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,800
Forget it.
Let me just ask you this one thing, then.

388
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,440
By any chance,
did you call me about two months ago?

389
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,360
You see, I made a mistake.

390
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
It's related to Sim Sang Ho.
And I want to catch the real culprit.

391
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,680
There's a detective in the Narcotics Unit,

392
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
and he's a total psycho.

393
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,960
I have reasons to believe that
he framed Sim Sang Ho for murder.

394
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,320
Sang Ho didn't kill anyone.

395
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
Right? Sim Sang Ho was murdered.

396
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,040
And he's being wrongfully accused
of murder now, right?

397
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
-Woo Hyeok Jin!
-I didn't...

398
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,560
I heard he was very good to you.

399
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
He did so much for you
and tried his best to save you.

400
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,480
You were grateful to him,
so you probably wanted to clear his name.

401
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,760
-Isn't that why you called me?
-No! You got it all wrong.

402
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,560
I did not

403
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,160
call you.

404
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,800
And I...

405
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
I killed Sang Ho, okay?

406
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,040
-What... What did you say?
-Darn it!

407
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,600
I said, I killed him!

408
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,840
-Boss!
-What?

409
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
-Sang Ho is gone.
-Sang Ho?

410
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,160
Who is Sang Ho?

411
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,040
Sang Ho went to report us.

412
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
To tell a detective in the Narcotics Unit
that the cops are in on this too.

413
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,240
He went to meet with him!

414
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
I had no choice! I wanted to live!

415
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,440
So please...

416
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Don't talk to me about that idiot, okay?

417
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,920
I killed him.

418
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,480
Darn it!

419
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,760
-I killed that moron!
-Hey, what's wrong with him?

420
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,400
-Hey!
-My goodness.

421
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,560
-My gosh.
-How many times must I tell you?

422
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,560
I killed him!

423
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,880
I killed him!

424
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
It's okay.

425
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,760
Okay, all right.

426
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,280
That was
a typical drug-induced psychotic episode.

427
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,480
Sometimes, they think they see
thousands of bugs crawling on their skin.

428
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,400
If he doesn't quit drugs,

429
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
he will die.

430
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't think
there's anything we can do for him.

431
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,320
First, let's make sure
he can get some real rest.

432
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,320
He needs absolute rest.

433
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Both this man and I.

434
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
-Okay.
-Good.

435
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,960
Well, get some rest then.

436
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,280
Call me when he wakes up.

437
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,440
What?

438
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,920
You'll leave him here?

439
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,440
Wait, Mr. Ryu.

440
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
Hey, Ryu Su Yeol!

441
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,960
Darn it.

442
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,640
Was it a complete waste of time?

443
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,520
Did you not hear him say
that Sim Sang Ho didn't kill anyone?

444
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,760
(Heart Mender)
Did you not hear him say
that Sim Sang Ho didn't kill anyone?

445
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,880
I'll keep digging.
I'm sure we'll find something.

446
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,840
He's so charismatic.

447
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
(Evidence)

448
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,800
Gosh, I'm so full.

449
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,880
What? You said you didn't want to eat.

450
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,240
I know, but I suddenly got hungry.

451
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,440
Really?

452
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
It smells so good.

453
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,240
Hey, I've been a regular here for years.

454
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,520
The bread is soft,
and the veggies are always so fresh.

455
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,680
Look.

456
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,800
This makes such a hearty meal.
It's to die for.

457
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,360
Do you want a bite?

458
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,840
No, it's okay.
You didn't even have dinner.

459
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Right. I'm starving.

460
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
What?

461
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,600
It's nothing.
I was just reminded of my childhood.

462
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,920
Back then,

463
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,120
my wish was to try a sandwich like that

464
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,040
because my family was poor.

465
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,480
We lived on instant noodles.
And even now...

466
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,680
-It's okay, sir.
-Just eat it.

467
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,200
-I can just eat the noodles.
-I love instant noodles.

468
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,600
Eat up.

469
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,200
Thank you.

470
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,880
This is cold.

471
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
The bread is soft,
and the veggies are so fresh.

472
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,960
This would make such a hearty meal.

473
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800
That little...

474
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,080
(Evidence)

475
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,560
Sir, it doesn't look like Heo Jong Gu

476
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,120
took any of Inspector Lee's belongings
to his place,

477
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,200
which means he took care of it somewhere,
before he got home.

478
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
(Evidence)
which means he took care of it somewhere,
before he got home.

479
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,960
But considering the time and his route,

480
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,520
I don't think he made a stop anywhere.

481
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,520
Right.

482
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,840
-His car!
-His car!

483
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,360
(Police)

484
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,920
Lee Hui Gyeom and Heo Jong Gu
showed up together

485
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,960
and said they'd kill me
if I didn't do as they said.

486
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,200
As you know, I'm an ex-con
who has no power.

487
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,200
So what can I do?

488
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
I mean, they're cops.

489
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,040
I had no choice but to obey their orders.

490
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,160
Ending the interview.

491
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
Just do exactly what you did now.

492
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,160
Make no mistakes
in front of the prosecutors.

493
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,120
And make sure you emphasize the part
about Hui Gyeom.

494
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,800
Of course, sure thing.

495
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,560
Wait, Captain.

496
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,560
It may be no big deal, but I think
I should tell you just in case.

497
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,360
My boys came to see me this morning.

498
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,840
They told me

499
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,280
that Ryu Su Yeol showed up
at the junkyard again last night.

500
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
What?

501
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,600
Apparently,
he took one of the boys with him,

502
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,800
but he happens to be...

503
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,240
He's the one who told me that
one of the junkies went to rat us out

504
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
to a detective in the Narcotics Unit.

505
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,400
A detective in the Narcotics Unit? Who?

506
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,280
-Tak Min Su?
-Yes, Tak Min Su.

507
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,520
-You think it's no big deal?
-Sorry?

508
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,040
This means you may not be able
to blame the drugs anymore.

509
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
You may end up rotting in jail forever.

510
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
That's not a big deal to you?

511
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,440
Aren't there women who work for you
in the detention center?

512
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes, sir. Of course.

513
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,440
Hey.

514
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,240
You little...

515
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,000
Let go! Let go of me!

516
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,640
Hey!

517
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,160
Darn you...

518
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,280
What do you want? Who are you?

519
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,800
Be quiet.

520
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,440
Superintendent Ryu. What brings you here?

521
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
Let's talk.

522
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,360
(Captain Kim Gye Sik)

523
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,480
Sure.

524
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,680
About Hui Gyeom... What happened?

525
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,520
She didn't do anything. Why...

526
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
Right?

527
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,880
It's a rough place.

528
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,440
We want to get her out
as soon as possible,

529
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,880
but it's hard

530
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,120
because of the irrefutable statements
and evidence against her.

531
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Look, Captain Kim.

532
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,800
Hui Gyeom...

533
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,600
She still admires you.

534
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,480
She's counting on you.

535
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,520
So why did you do that?

536
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
I thought we were working together.
We had a great plan.

537
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,760
Why must you dig up Min Su's case
all of a sudden?

538
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,600
What? You think you can use it
to take me down?

539
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
But seeing how you barged in here
like this,

540
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm guessing the punk you took
wasn't so useful.

541
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,000
Superintendent Ryu Su Yeol.

542
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,520
From now on, if you suddenly
think of something you want to do,

543
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
don't do it, whatever it may be.

544
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,480
If you take one step closer to me,
I'll have to do the same.

545
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,160
Then if we end up
bumping into each other...

546
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,720
Someone close to you
who has nothing to do with this

547
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,680
could get hurt or die.

548
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Hey.

549
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,960
Well, I trust that
you'll continue to cooperate,

550
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,400
Superintendent Ryu.

551
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,800
Wait.

552
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Who's the one
that should be scared now? Me?

553
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,480
Or you?

554
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
Had you killed Hui Gyeom,

555
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,880
I would've lost it, and you wouldn't
have been able to handle it,

556
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,880
so all you could do was
scare me a little and leave it at that.

557
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,600
In any case, you did launch
a counterattack right away,

558
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,720
which means

559
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,440
I wasn't completely wrong
about the Tak Min Su case after all.

560
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,920
That was you too, wasn't it?

561
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,400
(Police)

562
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,960
Yes, it's me.
(Police)

563
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,520
What's going on with Woo Hyeok Jin?
Is he awake?

564
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,640
No, he's still asleep.

565
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,400
But how much longer
do you need me to look after this guy?

566
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,920
Call me as soon as he wakes up, okay?

567
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,400
Darn it. I must find something, anything.

568
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,920
(This was Heo Jong Gu's last destination.)

569
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,920
(And his family has declined
to collect his car.)

570
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,960
(Heo Jong Gu's car must still be here.)

571
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,679
-Is this the right place?
-Yes, sir.

572
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,560
-Hey, isn't that Heo Jong Gu's car?
-Yes, it is.

573
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,239
-You're sure, right?
-Yes, I'm sure of it.

574
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,679
Darn it.

575
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
So what went missing
from Hui Gyeom's place?

576
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,080
Some jewelry and...

577
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,520
Right, her gold medal from
the National Sports Festival is also gone.

578
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,960
They take anything that has any value,
so I doubt they're still here.

579
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,320
Sir!

580
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,560
My wallet!

581
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,639
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Gyeong Tae!

582
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,440
It's okay! Don't go after him.
It's dangerous!

583
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,320
Hey! Stop!

584
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Darn it.

585
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Hey!

586
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,040
-Where is he?
-Hey!

587
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,920
I said I would cooperate. Can you just...

588
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,480
-What is this?
-Be quiet.

589
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,960
-Sir!
-Hey.

590
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,880
Just let him take my wallet.
Are you all right?

591
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,400
Are you okay?

592
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
(The 86th National Sports Festival)

593
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
I found Inspector Lee's gold medal.

594
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,720
Is it really Hui Gyeom's?

595
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
-Jeez.
-Hey!

596
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,880
Sir!

597
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
-Hey!
-Darn it!

598
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,360
Hey!

599
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,840
Hui Gyeom! We did it!

600
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,760
Hey, kiddo. You're our lucky charm.

601
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,920
Hey, where did you steal this?

602
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,920
I didn't steal it. I found it.

603
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,240
You found it? Where?

604
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,160
Inside that car.

605
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,480
I swear, I really didn't steal it.

606
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,840
This proves that Heo Jong Gu was the one
who broke into her place.

607
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,040
Hui Gyeom can get out now!

608
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Anyone can see that he probably planted
the drugs at her place when he was there.

609
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,240
With this, I believe
we can help her avoid getting arrested.

610
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Of course! She'll be released right away.

611
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,240
Hey, you. Give me back my wallet.

612
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Where did it go?

613
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,600
What the heck are you talking about?
You took it earlier.

614
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,040
-Maybe here?
-Where is it?

615
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,440
Sir! What are you doing?

616
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,840
Sir, are you suspecting me now?

617
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,160
I wanted to check just in case.

618
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,560
Just in case I took it?

619
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,560
It's not like my wallet
can walk away on its own.

620
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,000
-Did you take it?
-No, I didn't. Sir!

control my heart.

You can try all you want,

but you and Hui Gyeom can't be together.

628

Want to know why?
She absolutely hates me, that's why.

00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Right? I wonder why it's so heavy.

641
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,320
What?

642
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,200
Watch.

643
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,160
Look at you playing dumb again.

-I said to keep your attitude consistent.
-Right, you did.

656
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,080
I clearly warned you not to mess with me.

657
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,760
Why pull a prank on someone in lockup?

658
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,160
Well, it wasn't a prank.
I was just worried about you.

659
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,920
It wasn't a prank. I was worried.

660
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,440
I was worried about you. That's all.
Get in.

661
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,160
By the way, how did you find my medal?

662
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,920
That was all Jae Seon and Gyeong Tae.

663
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,800
Thanks, all of you.

664
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,520
You should have some tofu first.

665
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,560
Do you want some tofu?

666
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,480
No, thanks.

667
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,680
First, I'm going to find out

668
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,360
who gave the order to hurt me
while I was in lockup.

669
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,120
What?

670
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
They didn't go all the way,

671
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,560
so whoever gave the order
had no intention of killing me.

672
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,960
From the get-go,
the goal was to threaten me.

673
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,920
But they didn't say anything to me,

674
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,680
so I'm guessing I'm not the target.

675
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,240
You like soft tofu, right?

676
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
There's a good place nearby.
The food there is delicious.

677
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,240
I told you. I don't feel like eating now.

678
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,760
Were you trying to change the subject?

679
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
You're acting like you know something.

680
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,480
Can't you just pretend
you didn't notice it and just let it go?

681
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,520
What is it?

682
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
What's this thing
that I'm not supposed to know?

683
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,520
Just say it.

684
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Listen to me carefully, okay?

685
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,040
Don't get too worked up.
And try not to be shocked.

686
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,120
About the Heo Jong Gu case,
someone's behind it.

687
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,280
Someone you know very well.

688
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,560
Captain Kim Gye Sik.

689
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
Who?

690
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,640
Heo Jong Gu was working under Kim Gye Sik.

691
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,240
Jeong Chan Gi too.

692
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,680
They protected drug dealers
in return for--

693
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,960
Wait, hold on.

694
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,120
Are you saying
my teammates killed Gyeong Jun?

695
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,920
And Captain Kim framed me?
My captain, of all people?

696
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,520
Darn it.

697
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,640
How could you talk such nonsense?

698
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,000
I think he also had something to do
with Inspector Tak Min Su's case.

699
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,560
(Hangukgwan)

700
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Rest up.

701
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,040
Hi, is Woo Hyeok Jin okay?

702
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,040
Mr. Ryu, he's gone.

703
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,240
What? What are you talking about?

704
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Wait for me. I'm coming.
Don't go anywhere!

705
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,040
Darn it. Hello?

706
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,320
(It's me, Woo Hyeok Jin.)

707
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,360
Yes.

708
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Mr. Woo, where are you?

709
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
(The false accusation against Sang Ho.)

710
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,640
Do you think we can prove his innocence

711
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,200
if we find the person who called you?

712
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,720
(You're sure he has some kind of evidence
that can clear Sang Ho's name, right?)

713
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,520
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

714
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,680
(Do you think I can repay Sang Ho)

715
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,520
at least a little bit
by proving his innocence for him?

716
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,920
No, wait. It's dangerous,
so let's talk in person. Okay?

717
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,440
(I think I know who it is.
The man who called you.)

718
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,600
(-Let me check and call you back.)
-No, let's meet up and...

719
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,760
Hello?

720
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,560
Mr. Woo!

721
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,840
Darn it.

722
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,960
It was you, wasn't it?

723
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,160
You called Ryu Su Yeol

724
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,480
and told him that
Sang Ho didn't kill anyone, right?

725
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,320
-Boss!
-What?

726
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,400
What is it?

727
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,520
Sang Ho went to report us.

728
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,240
To tell a detective in the Narcotics Unit
that the cops are in on this too.

729
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,200
He went to meet with him!

730
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,240
Darn it.

to find out more.)

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,560
(But frankly,
an autopsy may not even be necessary.)

736
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,200
He could barely walk on his own.
And he had no money on him.

737
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,360
He came all the way here,
shot himself up, and died?

738
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Sorry?

739
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
How did you get my number?

740
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,880

Is it because of Hui Gyeom's release?

No, sir. I didn't sleep well last night.

Yes, sir.

That junkie didn't talk
even until he breathed his last.

00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,880
You're sure he has some kind of evidence

800
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,240
(that can clear Sang Ho's name, right?)

801
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,080
Woo Hyeok Jin. Why did you kill him?

802
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,880
What?

803
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,880
You're the one who called me
two months ago, right?

804
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,920
What's this nonsense about?

805
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,360
There are only two people
Woo Hyeok Jin called after leaving to meet

806
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,000
with the person who called me.

807
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,520
Me and you.

808
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,640
Why? Did you have a little bit
of a guilty conscience back then?

809
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,640
Then why did you get rid of Hyeok Jin?

810
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,160
Because you're scared of Kim Gye Sik?

811
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,760
-Is that why you killed him?
-That punk...

812
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,680
-I didn't kill him.
-Then,

813
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,000
were you the one who called me?

814
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,240
What do you want?

815
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,760
Make your choice.

816
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,160
You said you had something to give me.

817
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,320
Evidence that can prove
Sim Sang Ho's innocence.

818
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,840
Hand that over, and turn yourself in.

819
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,960
Or...

820
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
go to Kim Gye Sik and tell him everything.

821
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,320
Hey, why are you doing all this now?

822
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,680
Why didn't you take me seriously
when I called you?

823
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,160
You already picked your side,
so stick with it!

824
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,360
What are you going to do now?

825
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,800
I'm tired of it.

826
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,080
I'm sick of living a life full of regrets.

827
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,080
Aren't you sick of it too?

828
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,280
(Restaurant)

829
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,680
-Ring up the bill for me.
-Okay.
(Restaurant)

830
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,280
-Ring up the bill for me.
-Okay.

831
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,120
-Here.
-Thank you.

832
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:15,720

833
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
(Fresh pork belly)

834
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,760
Sorry for not coming
to see you right away.

835
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,120
You should be resting.

836
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,800
I wanted to,

837
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,800
but I had too many questions.

838
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,560
When I was in prison,

839
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,960
I thought about this ridiculous incident
that had happened to me.

840
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,360
I kept thinking,
but I couldn't come up with an answer

841
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,800
because

842
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,720
I trusted you too much, Captain.

843
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,760
So I gave a possibility a thought
that I had never had before.

844
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,200
That you were behind everything
that had happened to me.

845
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,000
It all started with Min Su.

846
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,200
About Sim Sang Ho,
the guy who killed Min Su.

847
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,960
Sim Sang Ho handled low-quality drugs.

848
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Do you really think he had a connection
with that drug ring?

849
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
(Munyang Police Agency)
Do you really think he had a connection
with that drug ring?

850
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,680
Like Gyeong Jun said,

851
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,120
Do Yu Gon and his people

852
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,960
had nothing to do with Min Su's death.

853
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,560
Hui Gyeom. Stay calm and focused.

854
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,160
You should

855
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,280
get Do Yu Gon first.

856
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,320
(Korea Democratic Party, Do Yu Gon)
get Do Yu Gon first.

857
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,280
(Korea Democratic Party, Do Yu Gon)

858
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,560
But Superintendent Ryu
and I really got Do Yu Gon.

859
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,840
And when I was ready
to dig Min Su's death again,

860
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,320
you knew you had to kill Do Yu Gon.

861
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,120
But you

862
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,200
wanted the drugs too.

863
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,560
That night,

864
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,960
Do Yu Gon told you
where the drugs were, right?

865
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,560
I told you everything!
I told you where the drugs were!

866
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,680
I knew it.

867
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,760
You're smart, Hui Gyeom.

868
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,360
Why did you let this happen to you?

869
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,360
Why...

870
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,840
Why on earth

871
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,360
did you kill Min Su and Gyeong Jun?

872
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,480
How could you of all people
do that to them?

873
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,240
You knew it was wrong.

874
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,160
Right? This isn't right.

875
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,240
Why did this happen?

876
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,000
Why?

877
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,160
Let me ask you something.

878
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,160
Why do we

879
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,440
put up with our measly paychecks
and risk our lives

880
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,960
just to catch those criminals?
Why must we try so hard?

881
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,200
Answer me.

882
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,640
That's my answer to you.

883
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,600
The next time I come,

884
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,640
I will be arresting you.

885
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,960
(To Chan Gi, a fan of expensive liquor,
from Min Su)

886
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,840
I told you I would take care of it.

887
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,080
Why are you butting in
my family's business?

888
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,520
Gosh. You really are a jerk.

889
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,240
Didn't you know?

890
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,760
What do you mean?

891
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,880
My son got into
Hanguk University this year.

892
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,400
And he got a full-ride scholarship too.
You didn't know?

893
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,560
I wanted to pay for his first tuition
more than anything.

894
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,720
So I saved up all of my emergency funds.

895
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,720
Now, I don't have use for it.

896
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,080
Gosh. Don't look at me like that.
It's making me sick.

897
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,840
Hey, order that expensive liquor you like.

898
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,160
I'll buy us a bottle tonight.

899
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,040
-Sir! Give us the menu.
-That's fine, sir.

900
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,960
-Come on. No.
-Gosh.

901
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,760
-Give us the menu now.
-That's fine.

902

(-Are you sure)

906
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,400
you can catch Kim Gye Sik?

907
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm asking you a question. Can you do it?

908
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,960
I will catch him no matter what.

Give it to me.

958
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,240
Pardon?

959
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,760
Darn it.

960
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
Darn it.

961
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,080
Chan Gi.

962
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,280
Captain.

963
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,600
I'm sorry.

964
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,520
Please forgive me this once.
I must have lost my mind for a second.

965
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,280
Did you kill Sang Ho?

966
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,200
Why did you kill him, you jerk?

967
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,080
Don't. Stop it, you jerk!

968
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,160
-My gosh.
-Gye Sik!

969
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,200
Please forgive me just this once!

970
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,400
Just this once.

971
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,400
Chan Gi. Was there a time

972
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,680
when I forgave someone easily?

973
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,040
You jerk!

974
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,400
You think you can catch me by yourself?

975
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,080
You think I came alone?

976
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,040
-What is this?
-You!

977
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,480
-Isn't it obvious?
-I'm a superhero.

978
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,560
It's over for you now. Okay?

979
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,040
You're just going to take that?

980
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,520
No. You're coming with me too.

981
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,320
This might be your last time
getting some air outdoors.

982
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,920
Take deep breaths. Okay?

983
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,160
Then

984
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,520
what about Hui Gyeom?

985
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,960
What about her?

986
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,760
By the time

987
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,880
we arrive at the police agency,

988
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,600
poor Hui Gyeom

989
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,480
would be dead.

990
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,720
What are you talking about?

991
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,320
You know,

992
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,480
don't you think

993
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,720
I had something to fall back on
when I came here alone?

994
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,360
You stupid softie!

995
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,840
Why did you drag me in
when you couldn't finish the job?

996
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,080
Why did you drag me in? Darn it.

997
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,560
No. No...

998
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,120
No. Stop it, you crazy jerk. No.

999
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,120
Don't waste your time
on something so stupid like this.

1000
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,040
Go to the junkyard.

1001
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,960
Hui Gyeom will be waiting.

1002
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,360
Come on!

1003
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,560
Hui Gyeom. Wake up.

1004
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,800
Hui Gyeom, wake up.

1005
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,440
Hui Gyeom. Let's get out of here.

1006
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Darn it.

1007
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,680
I'll move them and finish the job.

1008
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,960
Make no mistakes.

1009
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,640
Wake up.

1010
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,640
Don't just sit there. Do it with me.

1011
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,160
You think
that's going to get the door open?

1012
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,080
Then do you suggest we just die here?

1013
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,600
You're just a big softie.

1014
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,840
I'll join you.

1015
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:07,399
Hui Gyeom.

1016
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,840
Hui Gyeom.

1017
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,439
We don't have time. Hurry.

1018
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,920
Kick on my count of two.

1019
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,240
One, two.

1020
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,840
One, two.

1021
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,319
One, two.

1022
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:51,960
Two.

1023
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,360
One, two.

1024
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,320
Su Yeol!

1025
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,720
Hey, Hui Gyeom.

1026
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,600
Hold on tight!

1027
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,640
(Bad, Evil, Crazy)

1028
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,000
(Bad and Crazy)

1029
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,720
(Step on it!)

1030
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,840
(Those Russians aren't the only ones
you should fear.)

1031
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,760
(My guys can be scary too.)

1032
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,800
Kim Gye Sik just used you
to clean up his mess. You fool.

1033
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,320
How dare you? Are you crazy?

1034
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,640
It looks like Andrei has become
Kim Gye Sik's new partner for now.

1035
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,520
What are you doing?

1036
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,520
I'm on my way. Don't go alone.

1037
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,640
Protecting my stuff

1038
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,840
(is your job, isn't it?)

1039
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,120
(You think I'll let you catch me?)

1040
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,480
(I should've arrested you
a long time ago.)

1041
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,400
Step aside! Do it now!

1042
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,560
(You're all dead meat.)
