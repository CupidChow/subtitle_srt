(Baek Young Joo at the shelter,)

(crying.)

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,039
Why was she crying?

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,960
Because

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,160
he was in front of her.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Even if she wanted to stop,

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
she couldn't.

21

Hurry up.

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
Are you afraid?

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360

To the place
where you were oppressed and chained?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,240
Just like when you were living
with your father,

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,520
do you want to be locked up?

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
No one

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
can lock me up now.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,360
You haven't changed a bit either.

I have you.

You bet!

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,760
Now you know.
I'm a hero who only exists for you.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Jeong Hun's statement
won't be enough to arrest him.

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,880
We should prove
that jerk is a psychopathic murderer.

42
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,720
How?

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,160
I'll let him drag me

Sin Ju Hyeok!

58
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,560
I told you at least hundreds of times.

59
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,680
Are you doing this on purpose?
What is this?

60
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
I want to kill this jerk.

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Listen. Sin Ju Hyeok went to lengths
to confirm your identity. He was onto us.

62
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
You remember that, right?

63
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960

This jerk... Why me?

67
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,240
Right. You have no idea, right?

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,680
So here's our game plan.
We must figure out what he's plotting

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,840
and what he plans to do. Right?

70
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,360
Until then,
we cannot let him know that we know

71
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,360
he is Jeong Yun Ho!

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,680
-Su Yeol.
-What?

73
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,320
I can perform when it counts.
I'm good at acting, you know.

74
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,600
Sure. I really hope that's the case.

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,560
Let me ask you again. Who is that?

76
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,360
-Jeong Yun Ho.
-Come on!

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,560
Jeong Yun Ho!

78
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,320
You jerk!

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
Darn you.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,680
Let's talk about the day
when you first saw K.

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
When was the first time

82
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,880
you saw K?

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,120
It was

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
(when Jeong Yun Ho killed my father.)

85
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,120
K came out to save you.

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
What happened afterward?

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
I ran away.

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,280
Back then,
I wasn't aware of K's existence.

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Anyway, after that day,

90
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,120
you were free from Jeong Yun Ho
and your father's abuse

91
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,600
thanks to K.

92
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
Yes.

93
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,760
By the way,

94
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,120
is K here with you?

95
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,840
Yes, I am. You jerk.

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,640
If it's okay with you,

97
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,159
can I talk to K first today?

98
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,120
You wanted to talk to me.
Why are you so quiet?

99
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,360
Is this a staring contest?

100
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
Go ahead.

101
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,680
Did it already start?

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,040
It's been a while.

103
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,080
You don't remember me?

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm Yun Ho.

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
What?

106
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,360
Come to think of it,

107
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,960
we are very similar.

108
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,360
We were both trying to protect Jae Hui.

109
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,960
Right?

110
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,080
You jerk.

111
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,840
You wanted

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,560
to kill Jae Hui's father as much as I did.

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
Am I wrong?

114
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,440
Shut your mouth.

115
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,960
You thought

116
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,960
that without that scumbag of a father,
Jae Hui would have been free.

117
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
You remember that, right?

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
You crazy jerk!

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,640
Let go of me!

120
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
What are you doing?

121
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,040
I had to check K's reaction
to Jeong Yun Ho.

122
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,200
For K to disappear,

123
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,480
you must first overcome your trauma
regarding Jeong Yun Ho.

124
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Are you saying
this is part of the treatment?

125
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,480
He's much more hostile than I expected.

126
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
And he's violent too.

127
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
Don't worry.

128
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,840
I can control him.

129
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,800
But Mr. Ryu,

130
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,280
did you check if your father was dead

131
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,880
before you ran away that night?

132
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,640
Pardon?

133
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,200
You left your father,
passed out on the floor.

134
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,520
You ran away,
leaving only K and Jeong Yun Ho.

135
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,160
If K is this violent,

136
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
can you be sure
Jeong Yun Ho killed your father?

137
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
Not K?

138
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,960
-Darn you.
-Hey.

139
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,200
-No.
-You jerk.

140
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,560
Do you want to die? You psycho!

141
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,040
No! Stop.

142
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,520
He's trying to frame you
for my father's murder.

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,720
He wanted to gaslight you.
That was his goal all along.

144
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
Let's just get rid of him!

145
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,680
That jerk already figured it out!

146
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
I can just go there and...

147
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,080
Is that all you can do?

148
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,840
Get rid of him?

149
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,640
How? Will you kill him?

150
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,320
It wasn't me.

151
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
I didn't kill anyone.

152
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Okay.

153
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,160
I know that.

154
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,640
So you cannot give him what he wants.

155
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,280
When he tries to provoke you,
you must stay calm.

156
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Okay.

157
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,160
But

158
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,200
he must have recorded
everything on camera.

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
I was a bit worked up in there.
Will that be okay?

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,320
Gosh. The camera?

161
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Hey.

162
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,760
The therapy files.

163
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,440
What if he kept records
of every session he gave so far?

164
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,400
My gosh. Seriously.
I can even pull off a school uniform.

165
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
"Come to the rooftop."

166
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you here to have fun?

167
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,520
Now that I'm in a school uniform,
I want to reform delinquent teenagers.

168
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
A high school superhero!

169
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Hey, the real problem we have

170
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
is this.

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,960
-Why are there so many keys?
-Darn. No idea. It's like a collection.

172
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
Hurry up.

173
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,320
"In appreciation for helping the youth"?

174
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,360
He got these based on lies. That liar!

175
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,840
-I should break it.
-Darn it.

176
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,080
Where is it?

177
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,960
He didn't leave them
at the shelter? Come on.

178
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
Hey. He left, right?

179
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,040
-Why is the door open?
-Who knows?

180
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,360
-Be quiet.
-Sorry.

181
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
-Hurry.
-Darn it.

182
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,160
-It's right here.
-Gosh.

183
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,360
I saw him secretly putting stuff in here.

184
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,000
A shrink should focus on his sessions.
Why confiscate our cigarettes?

185
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,840
Hey, let's get back.

186
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,880
Freeze!

187
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,080
Put that back where it was. Now.

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,840
It looks like you're troubled teenagers.

189
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,440
How dare you!

190
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,880
How dare you smoke cigarettes already?
You're still in school.

191
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Is that how students ought to behave?

192
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
Go bring your parents!

193
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,960
Then is it okay for you to smoke?

194
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
It looks like you came in here
to get your cigarettes back.

195
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,120
You want us to put it back,
so you can take it?

196
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
That was his plan.

197
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,480
-That thief.
-Come on.

198
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,960
You should quit smoking, you jerk.

199
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,800
You already look like a dinosaur.

200
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,000
Freeze.

201
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,200
-Come on.
-Come on.

202
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,720
That's really important to me.

203
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
So here.

204
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,640
Su Yeol. I'm your hero.
I can't let you pay them off.

205
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,320
Here.

206
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
(Therapy record)

207
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,680
He's been gathering them
for a very long time.

208
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,560
(Jeong Hun, what if)

209
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,160
(your brother disappears, not you?)

210
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,280
(What if there's no more misery for you?)

211
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,040
(Who's going to help me?)

212
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,960
(Someone in misery just like you.)

213
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
(You can destroy each other's misery)

214
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,320
(and save each other from it.)

215
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,920
This is how Sin Ju Hyeok
has been provoking the kids.

216
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,480
He pretended to help them
by slyly provoking them.

217
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
He made the kids commit murder.

218
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,240
That scumbag.
He shouldn't even be called human.

219
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,960
We should have figured it out
when we looked into him. But we missed it.

220
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,080
There must be many students
who had counseling from him.

221
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Gyeong Tae. Jae Seon.

222
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,600
You two should see if you can find anyone

223
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,160
who has connections
to murder or suicide cases.

224
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,360
-You can help them too.
-Okay.

225
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,400
But is the video enough to arrest him?

226
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,840
He didn't use any trigger words
or physical force.

227
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,960
It'll be hard to indict him
with the charge for gaslighting.

228
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,960
It'll be to our advantage to prove
that Sin Ju Hyeok used drugs too.

229
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,640
And we can prove
that he killed Andrei too.

230
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,560
Boss Yong. Let's find her first.

231
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,600
-Okay.
-Okay.

232
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
Let's move.

233
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,480
(When was the first time you saw K?)

234
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,520
(It was when Jeong Yun Ho
killed my father.)

235
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,960
Did you recognize me?

236
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,040
Jae Hui.

237
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,080
Is that it?

238
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,720
(Barbershop)

239
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,800
(To Seong Bok Jun, From Jeong Yun Ho)

240
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,800
(From Jeong Yun Ho)

241
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,360
You're sure it was her, right?

242
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,640
The woman who took Andrei's body.

243
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Yes.

244
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,760
Gosh. I'd never seen her before.
She seemed suspicious, so I went to her.

245
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,920
Look right here.

246
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,520
She Tasered me good.

247
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,560
So you were done
with Andrei's autopsy, right?

248
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Yes. Luckily, we were.

249
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,040
A lethal dose of narcotics
was injected into his body.

250
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,840
But he was stabbed to death.

251
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,400
From the back.

252
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
And the police found a weapon at the scene

253
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,160
which had this guy's fingerprint.

254
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,600
His carotid artery was cut.

255
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,040
My guess is that
the murderer used a jackknife.

256
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,320
But it wasn't found at the scene.

257
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,680
But you can confirm

258
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,520
that there had to be
at least three people at the scene.

259
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
She must have bought off a worker
at a crematory for pets.

260
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,120
She cremated Andrei's body.

261
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,800
Well, she must have wanted
to send Andrei off herself.

262
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,440
Darn it. She could have left already
with his ashes.

263
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
(Not likely.)

264
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,040
That woman

265
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,240
looked like she was going
to get revenge no matter what.

266
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,680
Perhaps, she might be looking
for Sin Ju Hyeok.

267
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay. Hold on.

268
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,760
Hello, Mr. Nam. What's up?

269
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
(Barbershop)

270
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,360
Mr. Seong Bok Jun.

271
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,360
Mr. Seong.

272
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
It's me. Ryu Su Yeol.

273
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,600
Mr. Seong.

274
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,000
I got a call from Mr. Nam.

275
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
You suddenly decided
not to file for retrial.

276
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,000
Please be patient.

277
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,920
Mr. Seong.

278
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,160
Mr. Seong.

279
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,280
Darn it. Come on.

280
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,160
Hello. I'm at... Where am I?

281
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Gojin-ro, 9-gil.

282
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,000
He tried to kill himself.
Yes. Please hurry.

283
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
(Mr. Seong Bok Jun)

284
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,720
(Mr. Seong Bok Jun.)

285
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,560
(Do you still believe
that you can change your life?)

286
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
(How much more must you suffer in misery?)

287
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,560
(Wouldn't it be better)

288
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,480
(to end this misery?)

289
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,240
That crazy jerk, Jeong Yun Ho.

290
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,440
(Munyang General Hospital)

291
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,240
Thankfully, the gastric lavage went well.

292
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,640
Why did you save me?

293
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
You said
the statute of limitations has expired,

294
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,200
and Jeong Yun Ho

295
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,440
won't even be punished for what he did.

296
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,200
If I told you that I was
one of Jeong Yun Ho's victims too,

297
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,240
would you believe me?

298
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
You know you'd never do such a thing

299
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,680
but keep getting a feeling that
you might have done something horrific.

300
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,000
You feel crazy because
you can't stop suspecting yourself.

301
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,560
I know that feeling very well.

302
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,440
Even now, I feel overwhelmed
and anxious from time to time.

303
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,320
Then you must understand how I feel now.

304
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,760
I want to let it all go

305
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,560
and rest.

306
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,400
You can run away anytime.

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,720
But this may be

308
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
our last chance to catch Jeong Yun Ho.

309
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,600
Yes, the statute of limitations
has expired.

310
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
But you can still clear your name,

311
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,880
and we'll uncover all the other crimes
that Jeong Yun Ho committed.

312
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,560
We're almost there,

313
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,280
so wait just a little longer.

314
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,840
(To Seong Bok Jun, From Jeong Yun Ho)

315
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,440
It's from Jeong Yun Ho.

316
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,800
"Seong Bok Jun"?

317
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Do you know him?

318
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,120
Yes, we volunteer together
at a few organizations.

319
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Mr. Seong Bok Jun

320
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,520
served 22 years in jail
in Jeong Yun Ho's stead,

321
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,040
for a murder that he never committed.

322
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Then his suicide attempt today...

323
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
Was that related to Jeong Yun Ho?

324
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,320
So you already heard?

325
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,640
Jeong Yun Ho.

326
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,840
It seems like he absolutely hates it when
things don't go according to his plan.

327
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,200
I can see that he wants Mr. Seong
to remain the murderer

328
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,120
who killed his father, no matter what.

329
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,480
And that's why

330
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,160
he egged him on to take his own life?

331
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,640
He'll do the same thing to me, right?

332
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,960
To lead me in the direction that he wants.

333
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
But I am sure

334
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,440
that you can overcome it.
As you have, all this time.

335
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,840
This is hard for me.

336
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,040
I'll come back another time.

337
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,480
You know, yesterday...

338
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,040
I think someone sneaked into my office
and took my stuff.

339
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,080
But don't worry.

340
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,760
They can't do anything
with that alone anyway.

341
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,480
Mr. Sin.

342
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,600
Yes?

343
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,080
About Jeong Yun Ho.

344
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
What do you think he wants from me?

345
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,080
Why did he want to know about K?

346
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,280
And when will this game end?

347
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,880
Will it

348
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,920
ever end?

349
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
It's so interesting.

350
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,560
Everything is starting again.

351
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,600
You think so?

352
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,400
But you know,

353
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,040
I'm getting a little tired of this game.

354
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,840
I must

355
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
end it now.

356
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,720
You are the cop
who caught Kim Gye Sik, aren't you?

357
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,600
Who are you?

358
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,720
(It had to be our stuff.)

359
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
(It was to lure the cop
that caught Kim Gye Sik.)

360
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,040
(There are always surprises in life.)

361
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,720
-Andrei!
(-I bet you didn't see it coming either.)

362
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,960
(How you would end up dead
in a dump like this.)

363
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,400
-This voice. Who is this man?
-You...

364
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Where did you get this?

365
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,680
Answer my question,
or I will kill you at once!

366
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,200
Oh, Su Yeol is here.

367
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,960
Why won't he come in?
What's he doing in the car?

368
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,600
Gosh, this is embarrassing.
Must he do this in our neighborhood?

369
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,800
What... What are you doing?

370
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,160
Su Yeol, why...
Why is this lady doing this to me?

371
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,360
Let him go.

372
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,520
What do you think will happen
if you take one step closer?

373
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,880
Su Yeol, I don't know what you did wrong,

374
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,080
but apologize to her now.

375
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,520
I guess you two know each other. Tell me,

376
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,240
or this punk will die.

377
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,240
No, I don't know him.
I was just passing by...

378
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,920
You don't think I can do it?

379
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,440
Okay, hand over the phone.

380
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,440
-We'll catch him.
-Tell me who it is!

381
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,200
Andrei!

382
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,960
You held a funeral for him
despite the risk of getting caught,

383
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,320
which tells me
that you two were very close.

384
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,240
And you must desperately want
to avenge his death.

385
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,160
Shut your mouth.

386
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,040
But you see,
you can't find that man by yourself.

387
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,240
I'm not sure if you know this,

388
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,840
but that jerk is after me,

389
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,760
and I want to catch him as much as you do.

390
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,960
As much as I do?

391
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,600
What, then?
Are you willing to risk your life?

392
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,200
You have my word.

393
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,560
Just hand over the phone.

394
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,200
If you cooperate,
I will put my life on the line

395
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,680
and catch that scumbag at all costs.

396
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,400
(Munyang Police Agency)

397
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,920
So you're saying
Andrei went to see the person

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,040
who gave the drug to this girl.

399
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,320
Andrei was talking to you on the phone,

400
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,880
and the conversation is recorded
on your phone.

401
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
Do you think

402
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,600
I can see that scumbag in court?

403
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,640
Yes, because you'll be the main witness.

404
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,160
Who'd believe a drug dealer?

405
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,560
Then just believe what I tell you, okay?

406
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,520
-The therapist at the shelter--
-The therapist at the shelter

407
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,520
committed and instigated murder

408
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,200
on top of inciting someone
to attempt suicide?

409
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,320
I busted my butt

410
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,520
and managed to secure evidence
and even a witness.

411
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
But we still have no conclusive evidence.

412
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,800
The recording?
That can easily be manipulated.

413
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,960
Bong Pil.

414
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,880
Hey, do you realize how big this is?

415
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,760
That therapist even had a contract
with our HQ.

416
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,920
Whenever we caught a juvenile offender,
we went to him

417
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,320
for advice and to get his statement.
After all that...

418
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,040
If things go south,
even the Commissioner--

419
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,400
So that's it?

420
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,320
Is that why you won't let me
arrest Sin Ju Hyeok?

421
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,000
How dare you raise your voice at me?

422
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,040
He's hurting kids. He's killing them!

423
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,480
And you'll sit back and do nothing?

424
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,360
I never said
we should sit back and do nothing!

425
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,320
Catch him at once!

426
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,720
And gather more evidence
as quickly as possible!

427
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,320
Why did you have to say that
in such a roundabout way?

428
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
What do you take me for?

429
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,360
Put in a request for a warrant at once!

430
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
I knew I could count on you,
our next commissioner.

431
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,920
Darn it. You're right.

432
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
(Gwak Bong Pil)
Darn it. You're right.

433
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,240
(Gwak Bong Pil)

434
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,720
I should aim for the commissioner title.
(Gwak Bong Pil)

435
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,200
I should aim for the commissioner title.

436
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,760
Since I'm already on it.

437
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
(Munyang General Hospital)

438
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
Come out when you're done. I'll wait here.

439
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
-We should go eat something nice.
-Forget it.

440
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,360
Let's eat out. It's been too long.

441
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,120
Why? We have so much food at home.

442
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,880
I kept you waiting so long.

443
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,880
My gosh, hello.

444
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,640
Sorry I'm late.

445
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,280
Gosh, don't worry about it.

446
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,600
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedule to meet with me.

447
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,960
I really appreciate it.

448
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
Oh, please. This is my job.

449
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,120
-Let's go.
-Okay.

450
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,000
So? Have you been sleeping well?

451
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,960
You said
you've been dreaming a lot lately.

452
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,920
Yes, these days...

453
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,280
We got a warrant on Sin Ju Hyeok.

454
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,400
-Yes! Finally!
-Let's go and catch him!

455
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,120
Sin Ju Hyeok, you're so dead.

456
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,520
Hello, Mr. Seong.

457
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,800
(-Now, it all makes sense.)
-Pardon me?

458
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,520
(I think I know)

459
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,560
(who Jeong Yun Ho is.)

460
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,880
Mr. Seong.

461
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Mr. Seong!

462
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,360
Can you explain
what you said to me on the phone earlier?

463
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,960
I will die with him.

464
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,080
What?

465
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,480
I will die with Jeong Yun Ho.

466
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,680
I've finally figured out who he is,

467
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,720
so it's unfair if I must die alone.

468
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
Why did you do that to me?

469
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,640
You came to see me

470
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,840
and told me that
I should clear my name and never give up.

471
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,000
Why did you do that?

472
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,560
Well...

473
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,280
Mr. Seong, I don't understand
what's going on right now.

474
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,080
Put the knife down, and we'll talk. Okay?

475
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,280
It's you.

476
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
You are Jeong Yun Ho!

477
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,640
Did you think I was a complete joke?

478
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,160
Did you have fun toying with me?
You scumbag!

479
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,600
Mr. Seong, please... Snap out of it.

480
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,960
You're scared, aren't you?

481
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,400
Every time I tried to kill myself,
I was so scared too.

482
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,920
Don't worry.

483
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,880
We'll die together.

484
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,160
I'm not Jeong Yun Ho.

485
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,520
You can no longer deceive me.

486
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,360
The therapist told me everything.
My therapist.

487
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,880
Your therapist?

488
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
Sin Ju Hyeok?

489
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,080
Sin Ju Hyeok is...

490
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,240
Jeong Yun Ho.

491
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,840
You're still trying to fool me?

492
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,640
You can't fool me anymore.

493
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,440
It's not me.

494
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,920
Sin Ju Hyeok is...

495
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,960
Mr. Sin.

496
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,760
Mr. Sin.

497
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,080
Mr. Seong, are you all right?

498
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm here now,
so don't worry about anything.

499
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,520
No...

500
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,280
No!

501
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,360
Mr. Seong.

502
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,960
Help me. He is...

503
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,719
No, don't talk.

504
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,840
Help...

505
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,960
Unfortunately, it had to come to this.

506
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,120
You psycho!

507
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
Who is this now?

508
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,160
In Jae Hui?

509
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,800
K?

510
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
You're laughing?

511
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,920
No! Stop!

512
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
Let go! I said, let go!

513
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
I will kill him!

514
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,280
Don't you get it?
This is exactly what that scumbag wants.

515
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,600
Do you not get it?

516
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,640
Sin Ju Hyeok.

517
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,920
No, Jeong Yun Ho.

518
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,480
You're finished now.

519
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,080
(Munyang Police Agency)

520
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,360
So finally,
he killed a man in front of Su Yeol?

521
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,160
-Yes.
-Do we have evidence?

522
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,760
We'll get a confession out of him.

523
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,840
You know, the reporters

524
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,920
already caught a whiff of this.
They're swarming outside.

525
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,520
Finish it up properly.

526
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,520
Yes, sir.

527
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,040
Sin Ju Hyeok.

528
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,240
You instigated your juvenile patients

529
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,480
to commit crimes
using gaslighting methods,

530
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,920
distributed illicit drugs,

531
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,480
killed your own father,

532
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,840
and even murdered Seong Bok Jun
last night.

533
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,920
You admit that
you did all those things, right?

534
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,080
Jeong Yun Ho is the culprit
behind all those crimes, correct?

535
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Yes.

536
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,560
And you are Jeong Yun Ho.

537
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,800
I know that I was the one you were after.

538
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,680
Why did you kill Seong Bok Jun?

539
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,040
I wonder too.

540
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,320
Why did Jeong Yun Ho do that?

541
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,120
The victim of Jeong Yun Ho's first murder
was his father.

542
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,920
He probably had a revelation
after killing his father.

543
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,520
"Oh, it was actually nothing."

544
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,360
"When you see trash, you get rid of it."

545
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,480
"It improves the quality of your life."

546
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,840
"Why did it take me so long
to realize this?"

547
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,320
But then,

548
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,000
he saw that so many people around him
were still suffering

549
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,480
because they did not know
what he had just discovered.

550
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,040
So he thought,

551
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,960
"I can put them out of their misery
by helping them see this."

552
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,840
And that's why

553
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
you incited the kids to commit murder?

554
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160
Jeong Yun Ho's job

555
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,840
probably aggravated the situation
by providing him with plenty of stimuli

556
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,600
because it exposed him
to lots of abused children.

557
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,640
Is that an excuse?

558
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,040
But the thing is, Mr. Ryu...

559
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,160
Does Jeong Yun Ho

560
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
really exist?

561
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,400
Yesterday, you told Seong Bok Jun
that I was Jeong Yun Ho.

562
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,360
Now, you're trying to insist
that he doesn't exist?

563
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,960
No, I know that he appeared again.
But the problem is...

564
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,720
He disappeared 22 years ago.

565
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,920
So why is he back? Why now?

566
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,600
Right after K reappeared,
also after 22 years.

567
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,560
You said all the victims had links to
Jeong Yun Ho, but there's one more person.

568
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,240
The common link
amongst all of these cases.

569
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,080
You, Ryu Su Yeol.

570
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,640
No one has really met Jeong Yun Ho,
except for you.

571
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,120
What are you trying to pull here?

572
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,600
The stimuli you experienced

573
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,120
while working as a cop
must have reactivated your trauma,

574
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
and your other self woke up again.

575
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,800
Hey, Sin Ju Hyeok.

576
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,480
You still don't get it?

577
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
K is Jeong Yun Ho,
the person you were after.

578
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,920
Your alter ego.

579
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,880
The person who killed Seong Bok Jun
right before my eyes yesterday

580
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,560
was you, Mr. Ryu.

581
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,280
-You psycho!
-Mr. Ryu!

582
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,520
You can't avoid the truth anymore.

583
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
You must accept it.

584
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,560
What the heck happened?

585
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,280
I was going to tell you everything.

586
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,400
It's just that the timing...
I missed the right time to tell you.

587
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Tell me what?

588
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,160
What were you going to tell me?

589
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
The other day, you asked me

590
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,560
who K was.

591
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,080
K?

592
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,640
Who is K?

593
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,680
-What?
-You kept calling that name in your sleep.

594
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,080
"K".

595
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,920
So?

596
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,040
K is...

597
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,240
It's me.

598
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,560
My alter ego.

599
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,960
That's K.

600
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,520
What?

601
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
A little while back,

602
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,720
you asked me why
I was doing things I never used to do

603
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,160
and called me crazy.

604
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,560
You know,

605
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,280
I couldn't even remember what I did

606
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,280
and did all sorts of weird things.

607
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Do Yu Gon!

608
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,520
-You murderer.
-What?

609
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,600
(What's up with you?
Do you have a split personality?)

610
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,640
What?

611
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Hui Gyeom.

612
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,160
Hui Gyeom.

613
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,040
Hey, Hui Gyeom.

614
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,920
I understand that you're confused.

615
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,960
And I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

616
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,680
But his claim that K is Jeong Yun Ho
is pure lunacy.

617
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,440
That psycho is trying

618
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,240
to dump everything he did on K!
That's what he's doing!

619
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,920
Honestly,
I don't even know what to think right now.

620
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,360
With Jeong Yun Ho too,

621
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,800
we came this far because we trusted you.

622
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,760
And you were the only one
at the scene yesterday.

623
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,640
If things go south...

624
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,280
Hui Gyeom, please trust me.

625
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,520
Then you should've earned my trust!

626
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,760
You should've told me everything
from the get-go.

627
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,920
All these things already happened.

628
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,400
If you tell me this now...

629
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,800
As of this moment, you're off this case.

630
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,960
If you stay involved,

631
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,560
things will get even more complicated.

632
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,120
-Hui Gyeom.
-Please.

633
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,240
Right now, I feel...

634
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,320
I'm about to lose it, for real.

635
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,480
(Heart Mender)

636
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,520
(Yeom Geun Su is wanted)

637
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,840
(for illegal gambling
and violating the Medical Practice Act.)

638
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,680
(Darn it.
Maybe someone gave him a heads-up.)

639
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,560
(He's completely fallen off the grid.)

640
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,880
(Heart Mender)

641
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,880
Oh, boy. I really slept in today.

642
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,280
Seung Suk.

643
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,360
Seung Suk.

644
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,240
Seung Suk.

645
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,080
Mom.

646
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
Mom.

647
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,000
Mom, what's wrong?

648
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,840
-Dong Yeol.
-Yes, Mom.

649
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,640
Are you not feeling well?
Do you have a fever?

650
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,200
Do you remember the day
when we first met Su Yeol?

651
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,160
What? The day we first met Su Yeol?
What about it?

652
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,080
I had a dream and...

653
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,400
Mom, what's wrong? Mom.

654
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,080
It's nothing. Don't mind me.

655
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,360
What's the matter, Mom?

656
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,480
You've been dreaming a lot lately.

657
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,280
Should I take you to the hospital again?

658
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,320
Mom.

659
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,960
(You said you brought
your younger son's stuff by mistake)

660
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,640
(and left it here.)

661
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,480
I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

662
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Don't be afraid, Jeong Hun.

663
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,160
I understand everything.

664
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,680
Just remember this one thing.

665
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
That I'm the only person
who won't give up until the end

666
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,800
and save you.

667
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,840
She talked to Andrei on the phone
until just before he died.

668
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,400
Boss Yong is a drug dealer,
not a con artist!

669
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,720
Why are they saying
her statement is not admissible? Darn it!

670
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,200
Before people start talking
and spreading rumors,

671
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,520
you should clear yourself
of any wrongdoing.

672
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,200
They'll issue a search warrant
on your house soon.

673
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,600
Then what about Sin Ju Hyeok?

674
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,960
We'll have to let him go.
We can't prove his involvement.

675
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,680
I told you that I saw it.

676
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,680
He killed a person right before my eyes,
as if he wanted me to see it!

677
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,920
Hey, how come no one would believe me?

678
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,840
Su Yeol. You're really okay, right?

679
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,320
Captain.

680
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,560
Here's some info on what Sin Ju Hyeok
does outside of the shelter.

681
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,040
Stay strong, Captain.

682
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,480
I trust you.

686
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,960
What is this?

687
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,040
Oh, that. He recently started working

688
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,120
at Munyang General Hospital as a therapist

689
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
around the time
when Baek Young Joo's case took place.

(Munyang General Hospital

691

just in case.

(Therapist Sin Ju Hyeok)
I wanted to investigate his patients there
just in case.

694

I wanted to investigate his patients there
just in case.

695
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,640
But unless we bring a warrant,

696
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,560
the hospital can't share
any patient information.

Move back, please!

700
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,280
-What is this?
-Goodness.

701

Hey, don't skim through anything.

702

Jeez.

704
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,800
Mom, look at me. Mom!

705
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,520
This is nothing serious.
Don't worry, okay?

706
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,960
-Okay.
-Mom.

707
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,200
This is... You know, it's...

708
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,800
Right, it's like the vetting process
for presidential candidates.

709
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,960
Su Yeol has an important job.

710
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,480

-Yes.

712
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,280
Call Su Yeol.

What?

714
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,400
I said, call Su Yeol. My son, Su Yeol.

715
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,680
-Su Yeol!
-Okay, I will.

Try to calm her down.

00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,400
Tell Mom I'll be there shortly.

722
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,200
Wait just a little longer.

723

-Be quiet.

724

-Don't show up again.
-Calm down--

725

729
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,600
Hold on. Are you allowed to come in here?

730
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,160
All right. Go easy on me, will you?

731
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,560
My mom's not well--

732

We're just doing our job.

You know that better
than anybody else does. Am I wrong?

Hey, we're not here to play.
Search every nook and cranny.

735
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,280
Why? What is it, Mom?

736
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,800
What? Why...

737
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,880
-Mom.
-Come on.

738
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Mom.

739

-Hush.

740

Listen carefully, Su Yeol.

741
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,040
I remember everything now.

742
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,320
That day, you came to our house
with a knife in your hand.

743
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,240
You were covered in blood.

744
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,800
What did you say?

745
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,480
You ran away after killing your father.

746
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,120
I remember everything now.

747
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,040
Mom, why are you being like this?

748
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,360
What the heck are you saying now?

749
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,120
Su Yeol. Listen, Su Yeol.
Don't worry about a thing.

750
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,040
That knife...

751
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,520
I got rid of it.

752
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,920
Oh, right.

753
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,880
And very soon,
I won't remember anything anyway.

754
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,400
So don't be anxious, okay?

755
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,200
Mom. Sin Ju Hyeok got to you, didn't he?

756
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,480
You met him at the hospital.

757
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,960
-That's why you're being like this.
-It's okay! My sweetheart.

758
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,640
It's all right.

759
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,480
I will protect you.

760
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,920
I will. I promise.

761
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,600
What about the stuff under it?
Pull them all out.

762
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,320
-Captain!
-What? Did you find something?

763
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120
This is mine?

764
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,280
You left it here
the last time you were here.

765
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,000
You said you brought
your younger son's stuff by mistake

766
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,880
and left it here.

767

My gosh, it's...

768
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,160
Be careful not to misplace it.

769
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,160
I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

770
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,160
Thank you, Mr. Sin.

771
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,840
Thank you.

772
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,760
What did you do to my mom?

773
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,680
-Mr. Ryu.
-You jerk!

774
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,600
What did you do?

775
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,680
I just

776
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,520
sent you back to where you belong.

777
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,400
Back to that misery.

778
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,880
-Detective Ryu!
-My goodness.

779
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,400
-Stop!
-Break them up!

780

-Let's go.

781

Are you all right?

782
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,480
-Come on now!
-Let's go!

783
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,680
Stop.

784
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,600
-Don't!
-No!

785
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,120
-Stop.
-Let's go.

786
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,200
-Let's go of me.
-No! Stop!

787
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,920
-Snap out of it!
-Please.

-Captain.
-You can't do this. Please!

792
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,720
-Please.
-Let's go, Su Yeol. Come on.

793
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,520
-Move. Move aside!
-What?

794
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,640
We found a murder weapon at your place.
Do you understand?

795
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
-What?
-What? What did you find?

You are under arrest for the murder
in the basement room in Samgyeong-dong.

798

What are you doing?

799
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,120
-What are you saying?
-Back off. You stay out of this!

800

-Stay still.
-What... What is going on?

801

What is happening?

I'm in a good mood.

815

You have a visitor
coming to see you today,

816
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,120
so you'll need a really good shower.

00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,520
Have you been eating well?

819
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,320
You look like you've lost a bit of weight.

820
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,360
Aren't you cold?

821
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,120
Your mother

822
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,160
and Dong Yeol are doing well.

823
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,800
Jae Seon and Gyeong Tae too.

824
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,960
They're all really worried about you.

825
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,760
We're trying really hard

826
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,000
to help you prove your innocence.

827
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,800
Su Yeol, about K...

828
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,280
Is K really gone?

829
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,160
As the doctor said,

830
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,560
he's gone, and you're okay now, right?

831
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,560
K?

832
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,360
Who is that?

833
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,640
K.

834
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,840
You don't know who K is?

835
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,320
Do you not remember him?

836
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,640
I'm sleepy.

837
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,000
Su Yeol, have some. Just one bite.

838
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,200
I know you're sleepy,
but have just one bite,

839
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,360
and you can go back to bed. Okay?

840
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,640
Hello, Ms. Seo. It's me, Hui Gyeom.

841
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,480
Yes, I saw Su Yeol. I'm just leaving now.

842
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,600
He really enjoyed the food
you packed for him.

843
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,120
He must've really liked it.
He ate all of it.

844
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,040
He seems to be doing much better now. Yes.

845
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,320
(Ministry of Justice)

846
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,800
Are you ready?

847
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,480
Let's go.

848
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,480
Let's get out of here
and finish off that jerk, Sin Ju Hyeok.

849
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,560
(Bad, Evil, Crazy)

850
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,080
(Bad and Crazy)

851
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,520
-Hey!
-Get him!

852
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,760
Hurry, quick!

853
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,200
Ryu Su Yeol!

854
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,560
You guys must know!

855
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,600
No, we don't!

856
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,120
Mr. Ryu...

857
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
-Hey, you!
-What?

858
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,680
(Do you not trust us at all?)

859
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,200
(How could you escape
without even telling us?)

860
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,400
(There was one more person)

861
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,120
(who knew it was Jeong Yun Ho.)

862
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,120
Back then,
how did you people find that man?

863
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,000
Hey, stop!

864
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,080
(Heart Mender)
Hey, stop!

865
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,160
(Heart Mender)

866
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,200
(What would you be most scared of
when you're hiding behind a mask?)
(Heart Mender)

867
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,680
(What would you be most scared of
when you're hiding behind a mask?)

868
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,520
(Why here?)

869
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,120
(Because this is where it all began.)

870
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,240
(I'm the one he's after.)

871
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,800
(So I should fix this.)
