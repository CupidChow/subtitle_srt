What are you talking about?

92

95

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Mom, what's gotten into you lately?

97
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,920
You're scaring me!

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,480
Mom.

Hey, Su Yeol.

101
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
What happened?

102
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,240
Su Yeol. Mom is...

103
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Mom is acting weird lately.

104
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Mom.

105
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Yes.

106
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,720
Let's go home.

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,159

(Episode 9)

109

The water heater is acting up again.

110
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,920
Mom, I'll draw you a bath later.

111
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,600
You didn't have to. I could've done it.

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,120
Do you want something to drink?

113
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,960
Do you want some warm water? Yes?

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,640
No. Would milk be better?

115
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,640
Why are you making a fuss?

116
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,080
Why didn't you tell me?

117
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
It's nothing to celebrate.

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,400
I'm perfectly fine.

119
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
What did the doctor say?

120
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,919
-When did you find out?
-You should've moved out when I told you.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
You wouldn't have seen me like this then.

122
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,960
Don't worry about me.
You just live your own life.

123
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,320
Find a house for yourself now.

124
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
What...

125
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,160
Is that why you were pestering me
to move out?

126
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,760
Is that why
you've been telling me to move out?

127
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,920
Since I'm a selfish jerk, you wanted me

128
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,160
to live my life,
not knowing about your condition?

129
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,080
-Is that why?
-I want to stop

130
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,240
holding you back.

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,840
-What?
-You've done enough for me.

132
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,400
I didn't bring you here to give you much trouble.

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
I couldn't do anything as your mother.

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,840
You were such a smart boy.

135
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,160
-You couldn't even go to college.
-Gosh.

136
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,920
Anyway, I don't want
to be a burden to you anymore.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,440
So there's that.

138
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,040
-Mom.
-I saved up money.

139
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,160
I already looked into a nursing home.

140
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,720
So don't even think
about taking my burden.

141
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
You can't.

142
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,480
You were never a burden.

143
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,080
Not even once.

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,880
You didn't even know who I was,

145
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
but you took me in and raised me.

146
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,840
Gosh.

147
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,080
Okay. Rest up.

148
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,800
-What?
-Su Yeol.

149
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,600
Gosh.

150
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,240
Let's talk.

151
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
You can ask me anything you want.

152
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,920
Are you taking your medicine?

153
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,400
When is your next doctor's appointment?

154
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,640
Let me go with you next time.

155
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Not about my disease. Ask me about you.

156
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,680
Your childhood. Before you came to us.

157
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,400
I don't know
how long I will have my memories.

158
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,920
So you should ask me
any questions you have.

159
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
Mom.

160
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
You weren't scared?

161
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
What?

162
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,320
I could have killed my own father.

163
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,240
How did you think about raising me?

164
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,480
What do you mean?

165
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
Mom.

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,440
My father...

167
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
Did I really kill him?

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,880
(Mom!)

169
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,040
Mom!

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
-What is it?
-Come here.

171
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
Who's this?

172
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,480
Mom, you don't think he's dead, right?

173
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
Right?

174
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,520
(You slept for two days straight.)

175
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,840
(The doctor told me
you needed to keep resting.)

176
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,560
-It's pretty good, right?
-Yes.

177
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,720
So you don't remember anything?

178
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,880
About how you got here?

179
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,440
Right.

180
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,400
What's your name?
Do you remember your name?

181
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
It's

182
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,320
In Jae Hui.

183
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,800
In Jae Hui.

184
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,200
Then where do you live?
Do you remember your house?

185
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,760
You really didn't know
your house was on fire?

186
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,120
And that your father was dead?

187
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,080
Is

188
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
my father really dead?

189
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,280
You really didn't know?

190
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,240
You'll get in trouble if you lie.

191
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Gosh. You're scaring him.

192
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,760
Your neighbors told us
that your father beat you a lot.

193
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,040
Where have you been
after the fire broke out?

194
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
It's okay. You can tell me.
Where have you been? What were you doing?

195
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,160
-He was with me.
-Hey.

196
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,680
Excuse me.

197
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,280
He was with me.

198
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,160
-You?
-Yes.

199
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,720
He must have run away when he was beaten.
He was passed out covered in blood.

200
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,480
So he was with me.

201
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,680
I don't know what happened.

202
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,000
You can properly investigate.

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,520
You can't scare him like that
when he's not even well.

204
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,840
Think about what it will do to him.

205
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
-No. I wasn't scaring him. What?
-Mom!

206
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,320
-What's wrong with him?
-Jae Hui, wake up.

207
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,160
(-After that, your fever lasted a week.)
-Gosh. What's wrong with him? Jae Hui.

208
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
My goodness. What do we do?

209
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,000
The doctor said that
you couldn't suffer another trauma

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,760
and you might regain
your memories someday.

211
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
And I was going to tell you everything
once you did.

212
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,080
That's all.

213
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,240
But I could have killed him.

214
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,040
-I could have killed my father...
-You think cops are stupid?

215
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,880
Then they would have arrested you.

216
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,160
The evidence could have been destroyed.

217
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
There was a fire.

218
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,000
Ryu Su Yeol. Look at me.

219
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,200
Let me tell you again.

220
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm going to start losing my memories.

221
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,760
And I might say things
that don't make sense.

222
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,680
I might look at you and ask who you are.

223
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
So listen to me carefully.

224
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,840
All those years ago,

225
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
you were a boy
who ran away to save his own life.

226
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,560
That was the boy I met back then.

227
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,920
Ryu Su Yeol who has been
my son for over 20 years

228
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,720
grew up to be the man
I knew he was all those years ago.

229
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
And I still

230
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
believe in you.

231
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,720
So

232
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,079
you should too.

233
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,480
Get yourself together,
and protect yourself.

234
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,880
So will I.

235
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,200
(Gukban)

236
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,640
Sim Jeong Hun.

237
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,040
I told you everything I know.

238
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,560
I don't know anything else.

239
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,640
I know the protocol is annoying.
I'm sorry.

240
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,920
It won't take long.
I just need to confirm your statement.

241
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,360
Why did you say you went
to Dr. Sin Ju Hyeok's office?

242
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,880
I couldn't sleep,
so I wanted to play basketball.

243
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,680
I went to get the basketball.

244
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,640
Did you see Baek Young Joo?

245
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,800
I saw her in the hallway.

246
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,320
And then I went to his office.

247
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,720
He was on the floor and covered in blood.

248
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,880
So I called 911 first.

249
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,840
I bet you were shocked to see
something like that for the first time.

250
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,960
But you were pretty calm.

251
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
Gosh. Come on.

252
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
This wound...

253
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,880
Gosh. What?

254
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
I don't know who did this to you.
But did you report it?

255
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
Why would I?

256
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,120
Why wouldn't you?

257
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,800
It's bearable.

258
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,520
Jeong Hun!

259
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,680
Coming!

260
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,440
I have to make a delivery.

261
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,320
Wait.

262
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,640
Hurry up.

263
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,760
You. Come here.

264
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
Come here already.

265
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,320
You're not going to come? Seriously?

266
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
Stop right there, you jerk!

267
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
How can I stop when you're chasing me?

268
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,800
-You jerk!
-You're scary!

269
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,080
Stop right there!

270
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
You jerk. Stop right there!

271
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,200
You jerk.

272
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,960
-Goodness.
-Come on. Stop running already. You jerk!

273
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,200
Su Yeol, are you okay?

274
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Are you okay?

275
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,080
Gosh. Hey.

276
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,200
You're okay. All right.

277
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,880
So why did you run away from me?

278
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,120
-Hey. You know something, right?
-Hey.

279
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,040
You're hiding it from me, right?

280
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm not hiding anything.

281
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,680
Then why didn't you let me open that door?

282
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,880
You must know something!

283
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
No.

284
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,880
I was just scared. That's all.

285
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,880
So what are you scared of?

286
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,440
Tell me what you're scared of!

287
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,200
That I might have killed him!

288
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,200
What?

289
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
It could've been me!

290
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,080
The one who killed your father.

291
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
What are you doing?

292
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,280
Isn't it against the law
if you don't report a possible murderer?

293
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,320
Gosh. Come on. That's not what happened.

294
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
No, that's what happened.

295
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,560
If you saw yourself killing your father
when you were young,

296
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,240
doesn't it mean
either you or K is the murderer?

297
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
It was me. I killed him.

298
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
-I should kill myself. That's only fair.
-Gosh. Come on.

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
-I should just kill myself.
-Stop jumping to conclusions.

300
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,320
If I thought I should report this,
I would have turned myself in.

301
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,480
I need more than that.
Do you have any other expert opinions?

302
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,400
Why did I suddenly remember that?

303
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,360
And why is he so anxious and shaken up?

304
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,480
You want an expert opinion?

305
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,200
Fine. Then what about the other doors?

306
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,920
The other doors?

307
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,400
I know there were other doors
in your subconscious mind.

308
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,000
So what were the other ones for?

309
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,960
The other ones...

310
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,720
I have no idea.

311
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,440
Hey, did you try opening the other ones?

312
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,720
I do not want

313
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,440
to open any doors.

314
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,880
I won't...

315
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,640
Never.

316
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,520
Wait, hold on.

317
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,120
What's October 2, then?

318
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,960
I know my father passed away
on October 23.

319
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,960
But the door I opened
had October 2 written on it.

320
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
And it was the date
Baek Young Joo emphasized.

321
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,280
You see, your mind has the tendency
to selectively forget,

322
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,880
store, and distort your memories.

323
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
-"Distort"?
-Yes.

324
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,120
In other words,
what we saw could be far from the truth.

325
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,360
Bingo.

326
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,160
It's possible. It certainly is,

327
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,720
but it's not always a good thing.

328
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,920
Why does the subconscious mind
distort memories?

329
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,320
Usually,

330
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,920
it does that to hide the truth,
which is often even more horrific.

331
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,520
(Case File)

332
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,600
Have some coffee.

Sure.

337
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,400
Why are you suddenly digging up a case
that happened over 20 years ago?

338
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,120
And what's with October 2?

339
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,360
Why is that date so important?

340
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
It's the only lead I've got. That's all.

341
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,160
A lead on what?

342
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
The jerk who gaslighted Baek Young Joo.

343
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,280
It's a lead on that person.

344
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,720
That's all you can say right now,
I gather?

(Captain Ryu Su Yeol)

349

The Gojin-dong Murder.
That's what I should start with, right?

350
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,960
And find links to the Baek Young Joo case?

351

a man named Seong Bok Jun got arrested.)

(At first, he denied any involvement.)

363
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,560
(But the murder weapon was found,
and the case was closed.)

(Along with the murder weapon,
a yellow raincoat was found.)

(Barbershop)

Why did you suddenly give up
on appealing your conviction?

377
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,560
At first, you said
you never even saw the murder weapon.

378
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,240
One day,

379
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
I suddenly remembered all of it.

380
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
You suddenly remembered it one day?

381
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,080
I was broke at the time.

382
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,880
I asked Gang Jae if I could get some drugs
off him and said I'd pay him later.

383
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,360
But he went bonkers
and started swearing at me.

384
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,360
I was young and didn't know any better.

385
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,200
I went to the Hope Pub at around 7:30 p.m.
and got drunk.

386
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,960
Then I went to Boram Mart
by the intersection in Gojin-dong.

387
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,840
There, I bought a raincoat for 100 won
and a kitchen knife for 5,000 won.

388
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,240
Then I went to Gang Jae's place.

389
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,200
The door was unlocked,

390
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,560
and he was asleep.

391
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,920
That's how it happened.

392
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,200
I see.

393
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,640
You remember it in such detail
although it happened 22 years ago.

394
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
How could I forget?

395
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,320
The moment I let it all go

396
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,200
and admitted to it,

397
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
it all came to light.

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
Yes.

400
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,240
Well, there was
nothing overtly suspicious.

401
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
But it kind of sounded like he was
reciting something he had memorized.

402
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,400
Something he'd memorized?

403
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,800
So you think someone told him what to say?

404
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm not sure.

405
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,560
Anyway, where are you?

406
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,400
I came to meet the attorney

407
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
who worked on Seong Bok Jun's case.

408

does not fear his past.

-Let's go, Su Yeol.
-Go where?

419
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
We must retrieve our memories.

420
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
From this moment on,

421
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,720
this hero exists only for you,
no one else.

424
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
you remember seeing
the spinning bicycle wheel, right?

425
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
What?

426
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,200
I know you have memories
related to a bicycle.

427
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,720
What are you talking about?

428

-This is your old neighborhood.
-What?

429
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,240
You must try
to reactivate your old memories.

430
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,000
What do you say?
Is this bringing back any memories?

431
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Memories, my foot! My butt hurts so much!

432
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,320
It's about to split in half...

433
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,720
I already have two buttocks.
They'll turn into four at this rate!

Yes, I remember him.

He received so many letters.

-Letters?
-Yes, letters.

465

It's certainly rare to see an inmate
who receives so many letters.

466
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,520
Most importantly, they were

467
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,640
from the same person who consistently
wrote to him for over a decade.

I'm very interested in interior design?

Just come out already.

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
Is anybody home?

647
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,480
We're from the local office.

648
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,440
-That's...
-Are you all right?

649
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,800
Wait here.

650
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,280
Sim Jeong Hun.

(Women and Juvenile Unit, Interview Room)

652
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,600
We've met before, right?

653
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,560
The day Baek Young Joo hurt Sin Ju Hyeok.

654
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,880
Right?

655
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,640
Is he

656
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,320
really dead?

657
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,240
My brother.

658
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,360
You crazy idiot. Why would you bring that?

659
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,560
Just go get me a glass of water,
you loser.

660
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,080
Is he really dead?

661
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,200
Why didn't you report it to the police?

662
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
And why were you staring
at your dead brother?

663
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,880
To check
whether or not he was really dead.

664
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,360
Because that jerk...

665
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,520
Maybe he's not dead.

666
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,200
Did you kill him?

667
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,800
If he's dead, it's all good.

668
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,760
Was it an accident?

669
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,440
-Or--
-Why does that matter?

670
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,680
What matters is that
the misery is now over.

671
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,360
"Misery"?

672
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,640
Did you just say "misery"?

673
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,200
Captain.

674
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,920
Could you spare me a moment?

(Women and Juvenile Unit, Interview Room)

677
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,600
Captain, Jeong Hun didn't do it.

678
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,400
What do you mean?

679
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,440
Sim Jeong Hun has an alibi.

680
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
What?

681
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,600
What's your deal?

682
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,200
You didn't kill your brother.

683
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,200
At the time of his death,

684
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,680
you were stealing money
from the restaurant where you work.

685
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,320
It's all caught on the security footage.

686
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,040
Sim Jeong Hun,
you'd better tell me the truth.

687
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,800
Why did you do that?

688
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,240
Why did you say you killed him
when you didn't? Why?

689
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,120
I never said I killed him.

690
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,920
I just said, all's good if he's dead.

691
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,840
What?

692
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,840
I can go now, right?

693
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,720
Wait.

694
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,960
You said the misery is now over.

695
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,480
Who told you that?

696
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,960
Did you and Baek Young Joo
know each other?

697
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,040
Is someone else involved in this case?

698
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,920
Tell me.

699
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,440
You need help, right? I can help you.

700
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,120
Help? As if.

701
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,760
You said
that jerk is dead for sure, right?

702
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,840
I'll be honest. Whoever killed him

703
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,720
helped me by getting rid of him.

704

(Police)

705
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,840
(Everything will be fine now.)

706
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,120
No more misery.

707
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,680
This misery will never end for both of us

708
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,800
until they disappear for good.

709
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,000
Captain.

710
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,520
We checked the CCTV footage, and it's odd.

711
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,720
And the restaurant owner says

712
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,640
there's no way Jeong Hun didn't know
about the camera.

713
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,280
He purposely went there
to steal chump change

714
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,680
at the estimated time
of his brother's death.

715
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,920
Do you think Jeong Hun crafted his alibi?

716
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,400
I have a bad feeling.

717
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,920
My hunch tells me that it's not over.

718
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,760
I get a feeling
that it's starting all over again.

719
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,960
You see, Jeong Hun...

720
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,960
It seems like he's doing just fine
after such a traumatic event.

721
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,840
I think he feels lost and doesn't know
how to cope with what happened.

722
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,120
Hey, where was I?

723
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,920
Right, be natural.

724
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,680
When you tail someone,
you have to be natural.

725
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,640
Look. You don't look natural at all.
You look all stiff right now.

726
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,480
It's because
this is your first time doing this.

727
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,320
Look at me. When you tail someone,

728
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
you need to be part of the scenery,
naturally.

729
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,800
Just be a passerby and walk naturally.

730
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,800
Who would think I'm a detective?
No one, right?

731
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,280
Just walk naturally and...

732
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes, ice cream.
If we're holding ice creams,

733
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,320
we'll totally look like passersby.
I'll go get it.

734
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,280
Wait, sir. What if Jeong Hun sees you?

735
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,240
He doesn't know me.
In a cone, right? Good call.

736
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,560
-Wait, sir!
-I'll be right back.

737
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,720
That thing outside.
That ice cream. Can I get two...

738
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,480
You're that detective, aren't you?

739
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,800
What? No, I'm not a detective.

740
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,320
Come on. You are! Don't you remember me?

741
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,840
You know, the fire in the rooftop room.

742
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,280
I was waiting for my jokbal
while having a smoke.

743
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,080
No, that wasn't me.

744
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,920
You must've confused me with someone else.
I have a common face.

745
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,440
Anyway, what brings you here?

746
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,600
I noticed that
you were staring over there.

747
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,880
Are you tailing someone?

748
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,040
Who? Who is it?

749
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,960
Can I just get my ice cream?
Two, in cones.

750
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,360
The one in the picture.

751
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,880
Tell me when you get your ice cream.

752

(Tteokbokki, Sundae, Fishcake)

753
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,280
Are you tailing me?

754
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,120
No.

755
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,160
-What... What are you doing here?
-Why are you here, Detective?

756
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,440
Me? I was just...

757
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,120
Hey, Gyeong Tae.

758
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,480
-Hey!
-What the...

759
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,240
Gosh.

760
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,360
You, Dirtbag of Munmi-dong!

761
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,680
-Hey.
-You're under arrest

762
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,200
-What are you doing?
-for theft and fraud!

763
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,520
Hey, what... Hey, Born to Be.

764
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,840
Shut it, you jerk.

765
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,440
What happened?

766
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,360
I'm Officer O Gyeong Tae
from Munyang Police Agency.

767
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,960
He's known as the Brown Bear
of Munmi-dong.

768
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,600
He was on the wanted list for a long time.

769
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,600
-No, it's not true.
-Hey!

770
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,600
Do you know what I had to go through
to tail you?

771
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,720
You jerk.

772
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,080
-Sir.
-What?

773
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,720
Earlier, you called him
the Dirtbag of Munmi-dong.

774
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,720
This man is a detective...

775
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,840
He used to be known
as the Dirtbag Bear of Munmi-dong.

776
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,080
But now, he's old and fat,
so we just call him Bear now.

777
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,560
Get up, you stupid bear.

778
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,680
-You'll rot in jail for at least 20 years.
-Darn you.

779
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,640
Be quiet!

780
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,480
Shut it!

(Munyang Police Agency)

782
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,800
-That's it?
-Yes.

783
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,600
-You didn't meet anyone?
-No.

784
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,560
Oh, Gyeong Tae met someone.

785
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,800
Yesterday, he met someone
known as the Dirtbag Bear of Munmi-dong.

786
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,200
Sorry about that.

787
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,760
But I think it was a good call.

788
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,760
A good call, indeed.

789
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,480
Thank you.

790
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,240
-Thanks for the ice cream.
-I'll buy you another one next time.

791
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,520
-Darn you!
-Hold on.

792
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,760
This woman is...

793
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,360
Wait, don't.

794
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,560
A woman?

795
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,560
Who?

796
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,800
What is it? Who?

797
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,640
What about this woman?

798
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,320
I've seen her before.

799
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,200
-Where?
-At the shelter.

800
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,520
The shelter?

801
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,240
The shelter?

802
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,360
Then maybe she knows Sim Jeong Hun.

803
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,960
I saw her the day before yesterday.

804
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,120
-The day before yesterday?
-The day before yesterday? That's...

805
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,640
A few hours
after Sim Jeong Hun's brother died.

806
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,640
There's something fishy about her.

807
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,720
Her name is Gi So Yeon. She's 23,

808
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,680
and she's a social work major.

809
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,000
She's been volunteering
at the shelter since high school.

810
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,400
Captain?

811
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,960
-Gyeong Tae.
-Yes.

812
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,520
-What do you see from here?
-Pardon me?

813
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,760
The flower bed and the manhole.

814
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,400
Nothing out of the ordinary.

815
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,600
Right?
Just the flower bed and the manhole.

816
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,480
But... Captain.

817
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,600
How did you know?

818
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,760
That woman.

819
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,240
She wasn't thinking of jumping.

820
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,200
She was staring at this spot.

821
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,600
This manhole,
where she had hidden her weapon.

822
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,400
Send this over to Forensics right away

823
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,360
and tell Jae Seon
to track down Gi So Yeon at once.

824
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,800
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

825
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,680
Excuse me. Coming through.

826
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,200
Ms. Gi So Yeon? Is she Gi So Yeon?

827
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,080
How is she?

828
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,440
You don't know who did it?

829
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,680
Darn it.

830
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,680
Okay, I'm on my way to the hospital now.
All right.

831
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,680
(Reception, Payment)

832
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,040
-This way.
-How's Gi So Yeon?

833
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,960
She just went into surgery.
But it's not going well.

834
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,360
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)

835
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
Still no idea who did it?
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)

836
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:10,440
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)

837
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,320
No. I looked into it, and Gi So Yeon
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)

838
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:12,400
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)

839
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,080
actually had her disk surgery
booked for today.
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)

840
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,640
But the disk problem
was most likely caused

841
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,200
by repeated external trauma.

842
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,960
So this wasn't the first time
she got beaten up?

843
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,720
Any links to Jeong Hun?

844
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,040
I looked but found nothing.

845
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,920
I went through her call history, texts,
and emails, but nothing.

846
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,360
I know she's been volunteering
at the shelter,

847
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,480
but the chances of her
meeting Jeong Hun were very slim.

848
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,160
Darn it.

849
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,120
This way.

850
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,680
(Operating Room 2)

851
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,520
(Operating Room)

852
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,160
Captain, we got the forensic results back.

853
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,920
Yes, I heard.

854
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,840
So the blood does belong
to Jeong Hun's brother.

855
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,280
Yes. And Gi So Yeon's DNA
was found on the gloves.

856
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,640
Why do you think
she did something like that?

857
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Captain.

858
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,840
You need to see this.

859
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,600
That's Park Seong Gwan,
Gi So Yeon's ex-boyfriend.

860
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,840
Apparently, he works as a male escort now.

861
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,440
But he was obsessed with Gi So Yeon.

862
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,960
I heard she had to move several times
to get away from him.

863
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,120
And records show that she's already
reported him twice for assault.

864
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,040
You think this was him again?

865
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,880
It's highly likely.

866
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,640
But the thing is, Captain...

867
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,720
Here.

868
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,520
Park Seong Gwan has been seen
everywhere Jeong Hun went.

869
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,400
Do you think it's a coincidence?

870
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,200
No.

871
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,960
There's no way this is a coincidence.

872
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Jeong Hun was after Park Seong Gwan.

873
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,000
And Park Seong Gwan
was harassing Gi So Yeon.

874
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,760
We checked the CCTV footage, and it's odd.

875
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,160
(And the restaurant owner says)

876
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,600
(there's no way Jeong Hun didn't know)

877
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,920
about the camera.

878
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,400
Do you think Jeong Hun crafted his alibi?

879
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,880
Sim Jeong Hun purposely went there
to create an alibi.

880
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,440
Did you kill him?

881
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,240
If he's dead, it's all good.

882
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,960
What if Gi So Yeon killed his brother
while he was doing that?

883
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,000
Gi So Yeon actually had her disk surgery
booked for today.

884
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,120
(Lobby, Reception, Payment)
Gi So Yeon actually had her disk surgery
booked for today.

885
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
That means

886
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,120
Gi So Yeon's alibi is...

887
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,880
(Gi So Yeon, In Surgery)

888
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,600
If this surgery is her alibi...

889
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,840
It's certainly not over yet.

890
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,720
Sim Jeong Hun and Gi So Yeon.

891
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,160
They decided to commit murder
for each other.

892
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,840
Where is Jeong Hun? No, Park Seong Gwan.

893
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,240
Park Seong Gwan is in danger now.

894
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,680
Captain!

895
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,080
Taxi! Wait, taxi!

896
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,400
Darn you!

897
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,000
You little...

898
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,280
Hey, who are you?

899
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,440
Who are you? Do you know me? You punk.

900
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,280
Hey, who sent you?

901
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,280
Who put you up to this? Who sent you?

902
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,040
Are you not going to answer me?
You little...

903
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,280
You'd better answer me. Who sent you?

904
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,440
You jerk!

905
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,560
Hey, Jeong Hun. Are you all right?

906
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,600
Darn it.

907
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,680
Who are you? Scumbag!

908
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,240
Stay out of this, you punk.

909
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,600
-You piece of...
-Jeong Hun, no!

910
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,480
Hey, don't.

911
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,520
Don't. Put the knife down, okay?

912
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,440
If you don't want to die, just move aside.

913
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,040
You shouldn't do this.
This won't solve anything!

914
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,280
Then what is the solution?

915
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,800
Who will save her?

916
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,760
Who will end her misery?

917
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,400
I'll help her, okay?

918
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,240
Let me help.

919
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,880
I'll help you guys, so...

920
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,480
Sim Jeong Hun!

921
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,000
No!

922
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,800
Jeong Hun!

923
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,560
Stop, Sim Jeong Hun!

924
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,120
Jeong Hun!

925
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,400
(Jae Hui.)

926
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,960
Thanks.

927
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,320
You killed my father for me.

928
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,880
Wait just a little longer.
I'll save you too, very soon.

929
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,400
Su Yeol, are you going to stay lost
in this maze forever?

930
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,320
No.

931
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,840
I don't know how I suddenly ended up here.

932
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,960
Don't you remember?

933
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,040
You got stabbed.

934
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,520
Stabbed?

935
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,520
Right, yes.

936
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,320
I did.

937
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,120
Jeong Yun Ho. He killed my father.

938
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,040
I remembered everything.
I didn't kill him.

939
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,520
You're right. It wasn't you.

940
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,320
So you remembered it too?

941
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,880
Yes.

942
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,280
It was Jeong Yun Ho, that scumbag.
He killed your father.

943
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,800
Let's go.

944
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,200
Let's go catch Jeong Yun Ho.

945
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,440
But what about me?

946
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,280
Do you not remember my part of the story?

947
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,680
What? Your part of the story?
What do you mean?

948
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,480
You...

949
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,480
This is

950
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,480
the first memory I have of myself.

951
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,360
I...

952
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,800
killed someone.

953
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,400
(Bad, Evil, Crazy)

954
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,200
(Bad and Crazy)

955
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,680
(I'm sorry,)

956
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,320
(Ryu Su Yeol.)

957
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,120
One became two,
then the two became one again.

958
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,640
Someone called and asked
how Gi So Yeon was doing.

959
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,720
(It was a young man.)

960
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,320
(From the beginning,
I thought it was like some sort of game.)

961
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,720
He's enjoying this.

962
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,280
(-Get out!
-While watching me.)

963
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,440
(I found someone
who's willing to pay the price.)

964
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,720
(Let's stick to the plan.)

965
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,360
Andrei! Where are you?

966
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,000
(Who are you after?)

967
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,520
Who is that scumbag?

968
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,600
(If this really is his plan,)

969
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,800
(we should let him know that
he's messing with the wrong person.)
