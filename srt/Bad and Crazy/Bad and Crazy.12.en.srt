What do you say?

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,960
I suddenly had this thought.

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,400
What thought?

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
Out of all our moments together,

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,800
when was the most messed up moment?

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,320
When was it? When? Tell me.

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,960

It was burning hot.

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Jumping out the window.

39
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,000

about our memories?

43

44

What are you drawing?

56
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
Then what does the "X" mean?

57
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
It's a spot

58
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,080

59

in the outside world.

68
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,720
Dr. Hong, I always wondered
why you were so popular among the inmates.

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,720
You've been making a killing
selling pain meds.

70

71

74
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,520
get me out of here.

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,320
Transfer me
to the nearest university hospital.

76
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,640
And you'll escape once you're there?

Su Yeol, you're in trouble.

79
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,920
These guys are going to kill you.

80
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Maybe just tell them
that you want to go back, okay?

81
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
I've trained really hard
for the past five months.

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
I've been waiting for this moment.

83
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,160
Get this straitjacket off me.

He escaped. He doesn't have a phone.

91
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
Why doesn't he have...

92
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,320
Right, he doesn't have one
because he's a fugitive.

93
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,360
Darn it, this lunatic!

94
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,920
There is nowhere to hide
in this small country.

95

I can't believe he escaped.

96

Does he want to rot in prison
for the rest of his life?

My apologies.

100

We'll put out an APB on him at once.

I'll take care of it right away.

102

Yes, of course.

103
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Darn it.

104
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Gosh, Su Yeol must have
really lost his mind.

105
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,120
What do we do now?

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,680
Where could he be now?

107
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Give me that.

108
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,760
Here, let me. Come on.

109
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,960
Oh, boy.
It's actually not that cold, right?

110
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,080
Darn it. He's not there.

111
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,800
I contacted every person
he could reach out to but can't find him.

112
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,280
He didn't contact us or his family.

113
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
Where could Su Yeol be?

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
Jeez, this is nuts.

115
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
He wasn't caught on
any of the security cameras.

116
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,560
Gosh, that idiot.
What on earth is he trying to do?

117
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,240
Hey, Jae Seon. You know...

118
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
Remember that psychiatrist
Su Yeol used to see?

119
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
You know, that quack.

-Yeom Geun Su?
-Yes, him.

121
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,640
He fled long ago.

122
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,680
That's right. That space is vacant now.

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,560
It's vacant?

124
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
-Let's go!
-Let's go! Come on!

125
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,120
-Inspector Lee, your jacket.
-Hey, hurry!

Yes, that's right.

129
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,120
I was born between 5 and 7 a.m. Right.

130
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
That's correct.

131
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,440
Thanks to you, I got through another day.

132
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,160
And as you predicted,
I keep getting more new patients.

Wait, it doesn't look like you've sent
your membership fee for this month yet.

145
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,520
(Oh, that.)

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
I sent you extra last month,
so you said it'd carry over.

147
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,560
What?

148
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,960
My son takes care of my accounting.

149
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,200
You know, he's an attorney.

150
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,040
He must've missed it

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
(because he's been swamped with work.)

152
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,560
Oh, I should mention this to you
just in case.

153
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,560
If you're having a hard time,

154
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,960
you can always come to Attorney Nam
for practical advice.

155
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm his mom, so I can make sure
he gives you a nice discount.

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hold on a moment.

157
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
Gosh, my goodness.

158
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,280
Mr. Ryu... Wait, are you K right now?

159
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
No, Su Yeol.

160
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,920
I have no idea anymore.

161
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm really sorry.

162
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
At the time, I wasn't in my right mind.

163
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,400
Thank goodness
I have a connection in the police.

164
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,320
That was why I could flee in advance.

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,000
If not, I would've ended up behind bars
with you.

166
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,800
Thanks to you, I was labeled a lunatic
and ended up in a psych ward.

167
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
Because I had no one to testify for me.

168
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,240
I knew that you weren't a lunatic but...

169
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,400
Well...

170
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,680
Anyway, you made a difficult decision.

171
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,880
You're still a beginner,

172
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
but being a fugitive...

173
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,400
You see, I've been doing this
for four to five months,

174
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,560
and it's really awful.

175
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,600
Why did you get out?

176
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
On the news earlier,

177
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,760
they said that cop escaped.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,560
If he finds out that I got out of juvie,

179
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
will he come and find me again?

180
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,240
He must know that
I refused to provide a statement.

181
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,680
Did you have something
to tell the police though?

182
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,640
I told the police everything,

183
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,640
and it all proved to be true.

184
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Don't worry too much.

185
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
That man, Ryu Su Yeol...

186
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,560
He'll soon return to where he belongs.

187
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,480
(Save Voice Memo)

188
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,600
(Voice Memos)

189
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
(So you're saying)

190
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,960
you want to figure out
Shin Ju Hyeok's psychological weakness.

191
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,600
As you know,
he has destroyed all solid evidence.

192
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Let me think...

193
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,200
What would you be most scared of
when you're hiding behind a mask?

194
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Having the mask removed?

195
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Someone revealing the fact
that he is Jeong Yun Ho?

196
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,960
That's right!

197
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,600
As they say, the sparrow near a school
sings the primer.

198
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,320
A lunatic has finally learned
how to handle a psychopath.

199
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,320
So I should help that jerk
reclaim his real name first.

200
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,840
Psychopaths who are obsessively meticulous

201
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
often have psychological weaknesses
that are fatal.

202
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
Mess with them a few times,

203
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,080
and they just fall apart.

204
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,920
I think I can figure out a way.

205
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,120
Let's get through the day

206
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,120
without getting caught.

207
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,520
Hold on.

208
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
If Jeong Yun Ho is Shin Ju Hyeok...

209
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,360
Then who is Shin Ju Hyeok?

210
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,680
(-Move. Out of the way!
-Back off.)

211
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,160
-Out of the way.
-Move! Hey!

212
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,440
-How dare you push me?
-Hey! What the heck!

213
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
-Move!
-Hey, you little...

214
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,560
-You punk.
-Wait, stop.

215
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Stop!

216
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Everybody, shut up.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,240
-Sir.
-Jeez.

218
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
You followed us, right?

219
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,160
Look at you
trying to ride on our coattails.

220
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,400
Hey, Lee Hui Gyeom.

221
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,200
Watch what you say.

222
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,800
Ride on your coattails?
What are you talking about?

223
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
We received a tip

224
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
-that Ryu Su Yeol was here.
-What?

225
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
-Goodness.
-Who sent in the tip?

226
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,960
Who would send in such a tip?

227
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
Jeez, my ears hurt.

228
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm not an amateur.

229
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
Why would I tell you who sent in the tip?

230
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,040
What about you guys? Why are you here?

231
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
-Captain, over there!
-Get him!

232
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Stop them! Block them!

233
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,360
-Hey, stop.
-Move!

234
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,000
Stop, you jerk!
(Heart Mender)

235
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,640
-Hey!
-Wait up!

236
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,040
Wait up!

237
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,800
Hey!

238
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,160
(Hangukgwan)
Hey!

239
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,320
(Hangukgwan)

240
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,560
Go! Get him!
(Hangukgwan)

241
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,360
Stop right there, you punk!

242
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
Su Yeol! Get in the car!

243
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
-Get him!
-Hey!

244
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
-Hey!
-Hey!

245
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Hey!

246
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Darn it!

247
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,040
Gosh.

248
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
How have you been?

249
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,359
Hey, Hui Gyeom! Goodness.

250
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,680
Hey, are you all right? Jeez.

251
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Do you not trust us at all?

252
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
How could you escape
without even telling us?

253
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,200
What were you thinking?
Have you really lost your mind?

254
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,320
My, that was fun and thrilling
for a change.

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,280
-All right, I'm sorry.
-What? You're sorry?

256
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
You totally fooled us for months.

257
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
And what? You're sorry?

258
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,960
-Come here.
-Hey.

259
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
-Get back here.
-Calm down, Hui Gyeom.

260
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Hey, it's not important right now.

261
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,600
Su Yeol, I didn't know
you were such a good actor.

262
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,720
Become an actor.
Why did you become a cop with that face?

263
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Actor, my foot. He's a con man.

264
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,360
-Come here!
-Hey, calm down!

265
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,160
Calm down, all of you!

266
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
We should hear him out first.

267
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes, let's hear him out. Goodness.

268
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,400
All right. Let's hear what he has to say.

269
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,480
-Speak.
-Go ahead, sir.

270
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,000
I must prove that
Shin Ju Hyeok is Jeong Yun Ho.

271
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,320
But I realized
that there's something I missed...

272
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
What? What is it?

273
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Jeez.

274
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,160
My alter ego, K. Say hi to everyone.

275
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,720
It's nice to meet you. I'm Oh Gyeong Tae.

276
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,520
-Hey, well...
-What are you doing?

277
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Tell him we've met before.

278
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,800
I saved his life.

279
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,560
You two have met before.
He saved your life.

280
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,840
-Pardon?
-When there was a fire at your place,

281
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,960
K threw me in there to save you.

282
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
Shall I profess my feelings to Hui Gyeom?

283
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,480
Profess what?
Don't you know the situation we're in?

284
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,920
Hey, I'm good. I don't need to meet him.

285
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,800
What about me?

286
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
He has nothing to say to you.

287
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
Really?

288
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,960
Well, anyway... So?

289
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,720
What was the thing you missed in the past?

290
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
There was one more person.

291
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,640
Who?

292
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,680
Someone else knew that
Shin Ju Hyeok was Jeong Yun Ho.

293
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,360
Who is this person?

294
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,760
Are you Jeong Yun Ho?

295
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,040
-You're laughing?
-Pick up your phone.

296
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,280
Yun Ho is waiting.

297
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,640
(That man died,)

298
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,880
but he certainly knew Jeong Yun Ho's name,

299
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,880
which means he knew Shin Ju Hyeok
even when he was Jeong Yun Ho,

300
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,120
so I'm sure they go back a long way.

301
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,720
If we do some digging on him,
we may be able to prove

302
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,800
that Shin Ju Hyeok is indeed Jeong Yun Ho.

303
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,120
About that man...

304
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,200
Even the autopsy found nothing,

305
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,200
(except for the fact that his fingerprints
were intentionally damaged.)

306
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
Identifying him...

307
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,080
I know that it'll be hard.

308
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,600
(But I have to try)

309
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,160
(because this is)

310
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
(my last chance.)

311
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,880
Even back then,

312
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,280
he was confident that he could catch him
and even risked his life for it,

313
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,960
but he ended up behind bars himself
instead of catching him.

314
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Right?

315
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
Yes, I admit that things went haywire.

316
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
But to fix it,

317
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,520
I need to find out some things
about that man who died with Andrei.

318
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
Help me.

319
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
Back then,
how did you people find that man?

320
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
-Hey!
-Darn it.

321
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,280
Stop right there, you punk!

322
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,800
You little rat.

323
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,720
-Just tell us his name.
-I don't know. I have no idea!

324
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
You little...

325
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
We don't exchange names
with everyone we do business with.

326
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,640
He was just a homeless man. A vagrant!

327
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,840
Don't give me that!

328
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,720
-Tell us everything you know.
-Darn it.

329
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,640
Gyeong Tae, it's always easier
to use both hands, right?

330
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,960
-It sure is.
-Right?

331
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,960
The clinic. The mental health clinic!

332
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,160
A mental health clinic?

333
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,680
When I met him for the first time
about ten years ago,

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,080
he came to buy drugs
wearing his patient uniform.

335
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,920
The uniform was quite unusual.

336
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,000
(Yang Jae Seon)

337
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeom Geun Su? Are you sure?
(Yang Jae Seon)

338
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,960
Yeom Geun Su? Are you sure?

339
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,480
Yeom Geun Su?

340
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,280
The fake psychiatrist who treated Su Yeol?

341
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,280
(Yes.)

342
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,560
You don't commonly see a patient uniform
with an angel symbol.

343
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,040
(I did a little digging.
The clinic shut down ten years ago,)

344
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
(and he was the director of the clinic.)

345
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
Shin Ju Hyeok is dead meat now.

346
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,520
Okay, all right.

347
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Meet us at Heart Mender, okay?

348
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,640
(Mom, you're okay, right?)

349
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,600
Why do you keep calling me?

350
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,280
Buy groceries and hurry back home.

351
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
(Mom, wave your hand at the camera.)

352
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,120
(I can see you, so don't worry.
Wait just a little.)

353
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
(-I'll be home soon.)
-Okay.

354
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,160
Of course,
I still have all the patient charts.

355
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,200
(Grant me the strength
to get through this day.)
Of course,
I still have all the patient charts.

356
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,280
(Grant me the strength
to get through this day.)

357
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,440
I kept them to use
when I opened a new clinic soon.
(Grant me the strength
to get through this day.)

358
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,520
(Grant me the strength
to get through this day.)

359
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,640
They're all on my computer.
(Grant me the strength
to get through this day.)

360
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,960
They're all on my computer.

361
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,600
You have everything from ten years ago?

362
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,880
(Come on.)

363
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,800
A mental illness relapse is very common.

364
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,960
And it's not like my patients magically
recovered when I closed my clinic,

365
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,920
(so I need all the records for reference.)

366
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,000
(Yeom Geun Su)

367
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
This is how you do business.
(Yeom Geun Su)

368
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,440
(Yeom Geun Su)

369
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,200
Yes. You're absolutely right.
(Yeom Geun Su)

370
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Yes. You're absolutely right.

371
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,840
Hey, I'm sending you a photo.

372
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
(He was your patient in the past.
Find out his name.)

373
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
I'll be there very soon.

374
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Okay.

375
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,200
All right, let's see.

376
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
I used to have so many patients.

377
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,480
Those were the good days.

378
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,280
Let's see.

379
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,400
(Patient Counseling Log)

380
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
(Patient Counseling Log)

381
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,800
(Personal Information)

382
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,160
Is it him?

383
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,760
(Name: Shin Ju Hyeok)
Is it him?

384
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,800
(Name: Shin Ju Hyeok)

385
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,960
He's already here? Hey, you.

386
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
Oh, you've never met me before.

387
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,280
I've seen you many times,
so I'm happy to meet you in person.

388
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,920
My gosh. That's...

389
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,880
When... When did you put that there?

390
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
I was curious

391
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,760
what kind of treatment
Ryu Su Yeol was getting.

392
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,040
Oh, this?

393
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,280
I installed it over six months ago.

394
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,600
I'll go in first.

395
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,440
(Hangukgwan)

396
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,000
Hey, Dr. Yeom!

397
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,280
What happened?

398
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,000
Hey, Dr. Yeom.

399
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
What happened? Wake up!

400
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,680
What? What did we do?
Aided and abetted a fugitive?

401
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Unbelievable.

402
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,400
Hey, that jerk...
Has he completely lost his mind?

403
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,280
(He wants to use this
to get us in trouble.)

404
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,800
(I didn't want to put Su Yeol in danger,)

405
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,360
(so we came back to the office for now.)

406
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,560
(What about Yeom Geun Su?
Did you meet him?)

407
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm on my way there now.

408
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
Hey, I'll call you back.

409
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,840
Hey, Dong Yeol.

410
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
(Hey, Hui Gyeom.)

411
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,160
(Can you reach Su Yeol right now?)

412
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Darn it.

413
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,280
Hurry! He's dying! Please hurry!

414
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
-You need to leave at once.
-Why?

415
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
What, then? Are you going to wait
for the police and medics here?

416
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,960
Here. Take this and go.

417
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,400
Hurry! I'll take care of things here.

418
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
(Dong Yeol)

419
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,560
Hey.

420
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Su Yeol!

421
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,440
What happened?
What's with all this mess? Where's Mom?

422
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,760
Mom? I managed to calm her down.

423
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,280
She was doing well,
taking her medications on time and all.

424
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,400
I listened to Hui Gyeom
and made sure she wouldn't watch the news.

425
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,680
I don't know how she heard the news,

426
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,040
but she kept saying she had to find you
and save you from danger.

427
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,200
Su Yeol.

428
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Are you okay?

429
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,520
All right.

430
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Mom.

431
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,840
My dear Su Yeol.

432
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,440
Mom, it's me. I'm here.

433
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,760
What did you do to Su Yeol?

434
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,320
Who are you?

435
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,040
What did you do to my son, Su Yeol?

436
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm...

437
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,080
What's going on?

438
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
Stay away, Dong Yeol! Don't come in.

439
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,640
I can't let you get hurt.

440
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,200
You. You're not Su Yeol.

441
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,800
I know everything. I read the letter.

442
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,040
I read the whole thing.

443
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,360
"Letter"?

444
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,080
Mom, what letter?

445
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,960
You impersonated Su Yeol and hurt people.

446
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,640
You made people suffer.

447
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,600
Where is Su Yeol?

448
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,400
Where is my son? You scumbag!

449
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,960
Bring the real Su Yeol back.

450
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,400
My son, Su Yeol! I want my son back!

451
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,200
Su Yeol, Mom!

452
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
(Su Yeol! Mom!)

453
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,760
Mom, I am Su Yeol.

454
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,120
It's me. Your son, Su Yeol!

455
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,280
The boy who ran away to survive.

456
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,040
You put your trust in me, remember?

457
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,280
It's me. I am Su Yeol.

458
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,800
Your son, Su Yeol!

459
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,240
You told me to pull myself together

460
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,280
and protect myself.

461
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,280
You told me that, remember?

462
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,360
Su Yeol.

463
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,440
My dear Su Yeol.

464
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
My dear son.

465
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
Mom.

466
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,280
Su Yeol.

467
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,680
It's okay, Mom. Everything will be okay.

468
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,040
It's all my fault. My poor son.

469
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,240
I put you through so much, Su Yeol.

470
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,120
Mom, I'm okay.

471
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm really okay.

472
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,720
You are Su Yeol, right?

473
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,000
You are my son, Su Yeol.

474
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,920
I'm sorry, Mom.

476
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,240
(No Caller ID)

477
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,320
Just a moment, Mom.

478
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,880
(Mr. Ryu Su Yeol.)

479
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,640
(Don't you think
that every choice you've made)

480
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,160
(is wrong?)

481
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,920
The more you try to do things,

482
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,360
the more people will get hurt.

483
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,960
Why are you doing this?

484
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,560
What do you want from me?

485
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,160
You just won't

486
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,680
accept the fact

487
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,240
that Jeong Yun Ho saved you.

488
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,960
You saved me?

489
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,320
You committed murder.

490
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,680
(You think you saved those kids?)

491
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,320
(You just used them)

492
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,160
to justify the murders you committed.

493
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,600
(I'd say,)

494
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,680
it's about time we met.

495
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,960
Why do you look so scared?

496
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,000
I told you.

497
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,360
This man, Ryu Su Yeol...

498
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,480
He will soon be sent back
to where he belongs.

499
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,760
Why did you want to see me today?

500
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
To tell you that you can stop now.

501
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,600
Sorry?

502
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,040
Recording our conversations.

503
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,440
You've been recording our conversations
in secret.

504
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,360
You can stop that now.

505
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,440
Why here?

506
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,960
Because this is where it all began.

507
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
The very beginning,
with that scumbag and me.

508
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,160
I'm the one he's after.

509
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,680
So I should fix this.

510
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Trust is key.

511
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,800
Of course, I have to trust you.

512
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,040
No.

513
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,240
You, not me.

514
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,320
Trust yourself.

515
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,800
I do trust myself.

516
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
Who knew we'd meet again here?

517
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,760
In Jae Hui

518
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,880
and Jeong Yun Ho.

519
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,960
Finally, you're admitting it?

520
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,960
That you are Jeong Yun Ho.

521
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,440
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

522
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,920
We lived as complete strangers
for 22 years.

523
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,560
Do you remember everything now?

524
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,719
I saved you, right here.

525
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,679
I'm sick and tired
of hearing your nonsense.

526
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,080
You see, back then...

527
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,480
Did we have another option?

528
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,199
Let's say I chose not to kill your father.

529
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,960
Then do you think you would've been able
to escape that misery?

530
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,159
Really?

531
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,320
Let's find out.

532
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,480
-What?
-Jae Hui.

533
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,240
You really have to accept it now.

534
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,160
Killing your father

535
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,800
was the only way to save you back then.

536
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,360
Just like now.

537
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,640
Help!

538
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,160
Help me! Help!

539
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
-Is that Jeong Hun?
-Help!

540
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,440
-What is he doing here?
-Help...

541
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,120
-Once again, it had to come to this.
-Help!

542
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,840
Help!

543
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,560
Snap out of it, Ryu Su Yeol.

544
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Have you forgotten already?

545
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,320
Fire doesn't faze us.

546
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,600
Help...

547
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,960
Help. Help me...

548
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,760
Jeong Hun, I can get you out of here.

549
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,720
Help...

550
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,760
Let's go. I won't let you die like this.

551
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,080
It was because of K.

552
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,280
The reason you believed that
I wasn't the one who saved you,

553
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,040
and the only reason you rejected my help.

554
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,240
It was because of K!

555
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,920
Now, say it.

556
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,280
"Save me." Now, you want me to save you?
Really?

557
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Back then and even now,
I am the only one who can save you.

558
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,480
Say it.

559
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,560
Beg me for help. Beg me to save you!

560
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,160
Even back then, I graciously saved you!
I saved you!

561
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,360
Accept it, darn it!

562
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,560
Get lost.

563
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,800
Get lost, you psycho.

564
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,040
That was fun, Jae Hui.

565
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,960
K...

566
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,320
K.

567
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,520
Jeong Hun...

568
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,360
Save Jeong Hun.

569
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,920
-Su Yeol.
-Please...

570
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,880
(Then what is the solution?)

571
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,440
Who will save her?

572
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,520
Who will end her misery?

573
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,600
(Put that down.)

574
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,920
The person who made you like this.

575
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,720
I promise I'll catch that person,
at all costs.

576
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,080
So please don't do this.

577
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,720
No!

578
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,640
Young Joo.

579
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,960
Help me. He is...

580
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,080
No, don't talk.

581
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,480
Help me.

582
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,760
-He is...
-No.

583
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,640
(I've been here the whole time.)

584
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,600
Right by your side.

585
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,360
(Back then, you were just a little boy
who ran away to survive.)

586
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,280
And I still

587
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,840
believe that.

588
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,120
So you should trust yourself too.

589
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,600
Trust is key.

590
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,840
You, not me.

591
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,160
I can do this.

592
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,640
I can do this.

593
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,800
Jeong Hun.

594
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,840
Jeong Hun, let's go.

595
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,280
We must get out of here.

596
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,160
Let's go.

597
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,520
Come on.

598
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,720
I'll be right back, okay?

599
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,840
Don't ruin the fun.

600
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,760
You must be sick of me now.

601
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,720
You're scared of me, aren't you?

602
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,360
I bet that's why you're doing this to me.

603
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,680
Because you can't control me.

604
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,880
Look at you all scared.

605
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,880
You see, this is proof right here.

606
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,240
The fact that you're scared now.

607
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,000
It proves that you know
you committed crimes.

608
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,000
In Jae Hui.

609
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,920
I'm Ryu Su Yeol.

610
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,400
Jeez, you talk too much.

611
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,800
Forget it.
It's time for you to get beaten up.

612
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,160
(I did)

613
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,840
(pretty well, didn't I?)

614
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,560
K.

615
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,240
K.

616
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,080
Hey, where are you?

617
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,400
Where are you, K?

618
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,480
Jeez, it's you again.

619
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,720
Why did you follow me all the way here?

620
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,040
Goodness.

621
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,080
I thought you were gone for good,

622
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,680
but you were hiding here?

623
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,960
You should've been there
to see Shin Ju Hyeok get pummeled.

624
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,120
-It's time for me to leave.
-Leave?

625
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,320
Heroes are never afraid to say goodbye.

626
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,640
I can say goodbye
and just be cool with it.

627
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,640
"Goodbye"?

628
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,720
-Why?
-What is this, Su Yeol?

629
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,400
Are you getting teary-eyed?

630
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,040
Are you, seriously?

631
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,880
Oh, boy. This is why I was going to
just disappear quietly like the wind.

632
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,920
Fine. Since you managed to find me,

633
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,280
I shall give you a gift.

634
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,240
My real name.

635
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,800
Your real name? I thought your name was K.

636
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,400
My real name. My full name.

637
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,680
K,

638
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
I,

639
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,520
N,

640
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,040
-and...
-Don't tell me it's "G."

641
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,360
Bingo! That is my name.

642
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,960
King! Of the world.

643
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,400
Just leave.

644
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,280
I should leave.

645
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,360
Okay. I really am leaving now.

646
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,640
If you grab me or hit me in the back
of my head the moment I turn around...

647
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,440
Or if you give me a wedgie,

648
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,320
-you will pay the price--
-Just go.

649
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,360
You're a good guy.

650
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,760
King...

651
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,640
K!

652
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,200
Thanks.

653
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,040
I haven't heard that

654
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,080
in a while.

655
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,760
Are you all right?

656
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,000
Thank you.

657
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,880
Thank you

658
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,840
for saving me.

659
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,240
You should thank yourself.

660
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,200
Because I am you.

661
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,200
It was all you.

662
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,960
You saved yourself. It wasn't me.

663
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,760
K!

664
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,360
(I think he'll wake up soon.)

665
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,480
But

666
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,960
why is he smiling?

667
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,800
It looks like he's crying too.

668
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,240
He's up. He's awake.

669
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,200
-What?
-Su Yeol.

670
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,960
Are you okay?

671
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,440
Goodness.

672
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,520
What about Jeong Hun?

673
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,360
Jeong Hun is fine.

674
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,120
And his injuries are mostly minor.

675
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,840
What about Shin Ju Hyeok?

676
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,960
There's no Shin Ju Hyeok.

677
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,120
What?

678
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,640
He's Jeong Yun Ho now.

679
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,000
Dr. Yeom had a patient file on the man

680
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,120
who died with Andrei.
So we identified him.

681
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,520
That man was the real Shin Ju Hyeok.

682
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,040
Shin Ju Hyeok wasn't the first one
Jeong Yun Ho stole identity from.

683
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,040
People at the shelter
and psychiatric hospitals

684
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,080
were his victims.

685
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,240
Jeong Hun testified.

686
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,880
And you'll be able to clear your name now.

687
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,960
And Dr. Yeom is fine too.

688
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,960
Right. So you just have to get better now.

689
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,480
That's all we need.

690
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Are you okay?

691
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,520
You were smiling and crying earlier.
It was quite a scene.

692
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,200
-Oh, that crazy jerk.
-Crazy jerk?

693
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,320
What?

694
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,960
He's really gone.

695
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,400
Crazy...

696
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,640
-K?
-No.

697
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,360
He's not K. He's King.

698
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,720
-What?
-That's his real name.

699
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,360
Do you know what that means?

700
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,320
"King" means a ruler of a country.

701
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,280
I know that too.

you never had a split personality.

704
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,520
He's gone anyway, right?

705
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,160
You were just doing a sting operation.

706
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,120
To catch that psychopath.

It was suspected that you had

717
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,200
a split personality which was the issue.

Recently,

732
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,720
he had undergone a checkup.
And a psychiatrist said

733
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,320
he was perfectly fine.

734
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,520
Superintendent Ryu. Isn't that true?

735
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,560
Yes. That's true.

736
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,440
Then he won't have a problem
coming back to the job.

737

Hey. You were at our house before.

821
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,840
Yes. He'll work for us now.

822
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,440
Really? Are you sure you can do it?

823
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,560
Hey, do you enjoy
following me around wherever I go?

824
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,680
Not by following around a loser like me.

825
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,560
Don't you want to live
the life that you want?

826
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,120
How?

827
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,080
Do you want me to join you?

828
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,240
Well, you played a critical part
in the operation.

829
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,000
And even if K was there,
the psychiatrist cleared you now.

830
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,240
I'll be honest.
Cops don't just talk about it.

831
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,080
But a lot of them are suffering from PTSD.

832
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,600
People said cops shouldn't be fired
because of that.

833
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,800
This went viral on our agency's website.

834
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,080
This is the first time realizing
that a lot of cops were rooting for me.

835
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,240
Right. Same here.

836
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,520
You'll come back, right?

837
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,480
I'm not sure.

838
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,080
-What else?
-What?

839
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,920
It looks like there's something else.

840
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,040
I thought you came here
to talk about something serious.

841
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,400
That's why you probably
came here alone without the team.

842
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,920
Right.

843
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,520
Do you remember the day
when we arrested Kim Gye Sik?

844
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,840
You stopped by my house briefly
because of your wound

845
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,080
-on the forehead.
-Oh, that day.

846
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,520
I can't forget that day.

847
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,760
What? What about that day?

848
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,280
What?

849
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,040
I'm curious about the thing
that happened that day.

850
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,200
Who were you back then?

851
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,960
Were you yourself? Or were you K?

852
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,680
-What do you mean?
-What?

853
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,680
Who was it? You know, the thing...

854
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,120
The one who kissed me.

855
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,720
-Hey.
-I knew it.

856
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,680
-Let go of me, you jerk.
-I already warned you.

857
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,560
When it comes to justice and love,

858
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,920
-heroes go all out.
-Hey, let go of me.

859
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,160
You crazy jerk.
It's been a while. Say hi first.

860
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,360
Say hi?

861
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,560
How can I be happy
and say hello to you right now?

862
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,960
You. Tell me what happened
between you and Hui Gyeom that day.

863
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,560
Tell me everything!

864
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,120
Nothing happened.
We just watched "Amazing Saturday."

865
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,000
Let go of me!

866
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,080
I will never believe you, jerk!

867
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,960
Su Yeol.

868
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,440
-What?
-What's wrong? Are you okay?

869
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,680
Did K show up again?

870
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,880
No.

871
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,880
He doesn't show up anymore.

872
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,720
If he knew that we had kissed,

873
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,440
he would have done everything to kill me.

874
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,960
So what do you want to do, Hui Gyeom?

875
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,640
Me?

876
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,160
Well...

877
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,960
Are you going to stay with our team?

878
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,200
I see. The team...

879
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,600
What? "Our team"?

880
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,760
You're coming back?

881
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,720
Right. K is gone, anyway.

882
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,160
I should keep an eye on you now

883
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,120
and make sure you don't revert back
to your old days.

884
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,360
Like you said,

885
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,760
let's argue that you were fragile
due to your childhood trauma.

886
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,760
We can try that,
but you shouldn't get your hopes up.

887
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,840
All right, then.

888
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,520
(Keep it clean.)

889
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,520
(One year later)

890
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,000
Gosh.

891
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,280
This place has gotten bigger already.

892
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,080
Hey, don't pour me one. I'm on duty.

893
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,280
Why are you offering a drink to him?
He's on duty now.

894
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,200
-Come on. Read the room.
-Gosh.

895
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,200
Right. Superintendent Ryu.

896
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,040
I can't describe you
without complimenting how cool you are.

897
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,160
That's right.

898
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,600
And you're a zombie after money,
Superintendent Ju.

899
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,080
I'm a zombie who only cares about money.

900
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,840
I should have taken care of you.
I know it's long overdue.

901
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,920
I messed up again!

902
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,560
-All right. Here
-Gosh.

903
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,800
Take it.

904
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,960
Detective Kim,
you're really going to upset me.

905
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,560
I came out here to catch up
because it's been a while.

906
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,520
I didn't even know he was here.

907
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,240
-Isn't that right?
-Right.

908
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,480
Why do I keep messing up?

909
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,360
Why do you make so many mistakes?

910
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,880
I have way too many people
I ought to take care of.

911
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,840
Ta-da.

912
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,480
This is for you.
Just spend it on whatever you need.

913
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,520
And as for this,

914
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,680
put it in the bank.

915
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,240
Look how thick that is.

916
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,400
By the way, if I keep digging,

917
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,720
how far will I get?

918
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,920
I can't help but get curious.

919
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,880
What do you take me for? Gosh.

920
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,720
It's obvious that you're bribing me.

921
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,960
-Wait. What are you doing?
-Hey.

922
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,080
-Hold on.
-Pictures?

923
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,520
Don't touch it.

924
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,720
It will only make it worse.

925
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,520
All right. Evidence number one.

926
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,280
Let's talk about the rest at the agency.

927
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,520
Why?

928
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,640
All right, students.
You're listening, right?

929
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,360
Come on in.

930
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,200
Come on!

931
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,120
Darn it. That jerk, Ryu Su Yeol.

932
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,080
Stop them.

933
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,360
Gyeong Tae.
Get them on the count of three.

934
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,480
-Okay.
-Three!

935
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,640
Look.

936
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,960
You startled me.

937
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,480
Detective Kim, it's been a while.

938
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,360
Do your salute properly.
You have no respect for your seniors.

939
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,880
Then live properly.

940
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,560
You have no respect for others.

941
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,360
Wait.

942
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,760
Hey, let go of me. Su Yeol. Hear me out.

943
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,600
Getting arrested by me
sure feels awful, right?

944
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,040
You crazy jerk.
I'm with the Police Commissioner!

945
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,120
The moment you start this fight,
your career will be over!

946
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,840
The Police Commissioner?

947
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,960
Our Police Commissioner? Kim Pyeong Jung?

948
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,360
Now you get it?

949
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,080
Before he goes to the National Assembly,

950
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,520
he's collecting money from everyone!

951
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,040
How will you handle this mess?
You nutcase.

952
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,440
Where are you going, Su Yeol?

953
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,560
-Sir!
-Where are you going?

954
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,280
No. Don't do it! No!

955
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Hey! Come on!

956
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,600
-No. What do we do? Mr. Kim!
-Su Yeol.

957
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,520
-No! stop it. Where are you going?
-Stop him.

958
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,120
-Don't do it!
-No!

959
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,480
Police Commissioner Kim!

960
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,320
-No!
-Don't do it, Su Yeol!

961
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,600
No!

962
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,520
(It's nice to meet you, Ryu Su Yeol.)

963
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,120
You crazy jerk! Hey!

964
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,319
(Who the heck are you?)

965
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,960
Who are you
and why are you doing this to me?

966
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,520
To punish those trash-like rotten punks.

967
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,840
The last of this era! The hero.

968
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,600
You're one crazy idiot, aren't you?

969
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,840
-Want one?
-You were going to come out anyway.

970
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,880
What? Take off what?

971
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,840
-Why? Why would you take that off?
-I'm boiling! I'm so hot right now!

972
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,200
Idiot! If you take that off
in this situation right now,

973
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,359
it'll look so weird.
Think about that, you twerp!

974
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,120
Let's go!

975
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,680
-♫ Kungtari shabara ♫
-Hey!

976
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,720
(-Isn't it obvious?
-I'm a superhero.)

977
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,439
(Bad and Crazy)

978
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,080
(Bad, Evil, Crazy)

979
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,680
(Bad and Crazy)

980
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,600
(Thank you for watching Bad and Crazy.)
