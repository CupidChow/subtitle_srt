I'll do whatever it takes
to catch that crazy jerk.

caught everything on camera.

I don't have it.

117
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,720
What do you mean?
You found it and watched the video.

118
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Right. I did watch it.

119
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,760
But that jerk grabbed it
and jumped into the river.

120
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,280
But that jerk kept saying that I was...

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,840
No. I'm me. Listen.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,840
So I put the handcuffs on that jerk.

123
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,440
But look. Look how red my wrists got.
They hurt so much.

124
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
Are you kidding me? Snap out of it.

125

-Give me the necklace.
-I don't know where it is!

Okay. Su Yeol...

128

No. Mr. Ryu.

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,120
Don't you see that your career
will be over if you don't have that?

130
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,919
So give it to me when I ask nicely.

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,520
Where is it?

132
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,520
I know that.

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,080
-Come on. This is driving me crazy.
-You'd better come to your senses!

134
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,000
Hey.

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Fine. Let's say that I was that jerk.

136
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,560
If I was him...

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,400
Hold on. Where's your car?

-Where is it?

Where did you park your car? Let's go.

140

-To go where?
-Home! Come on. Hurry.

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Gosh. This is so stupid.
Seriously. Trouble follows that guy.

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,480
I've been running it in my head,
but I don't get it.

143
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,720
Ryu Su Yeol must have had a good reason
if he went berserk like that.

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,000
Gosh. That nutcase, Ryu Su Yeol.

145
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,720
That jerk.

146
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Yes, Commissioner.

147
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't think
he moved out of his apartment.

148
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay. Yes, sir.

149
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Have you gone mad?

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,880
You have no idea
the kind of predicament you are in.

151
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
I see. Yes. I'm a fugitive.

152
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
Yes, you're right.

153
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,160
Are you kidding me?
How could you not know where you put it?

154
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Superintendent Ryu,
are you trying to hide that from me now?

155
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
What?

156
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,640
-How could I not remember where I put it?
-How would I know?

157
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,120
Here?

158
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,520
What's this? Hey, what is this?

159

Over here.

160
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,560
-Hey. There.
-How do you open it? Come on. Hurry.

161
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,920
It might be in there.

162
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
What? That's my birthday.

163
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Move.

164
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,640
What's all this?

165
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,920
Why do you have that here?

166
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,800
Since when did you drive a motorcycle?

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,920
Since when did I drive a motorcycle?

168
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,680
Why do you have that here?

169
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
Why do I have that here?

170
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
What are we doing here?

171
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,760
Well... I...

172
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,960
What do we do?

173
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,880
Hey, Ryu Su Yeol might be hiding in here.
Search every corner of the house.

174
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,240
-Yes, sir.
-Check over there.

175
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,920
Yes. Over there. Come here.

176
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Gosh.

177
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
I definitely saw lights inside the unit.

178
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,640
Captain, we should go.
I don't think he's here.

179
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,240
Goodness, Ryu Su Yeol.
That nutcase is making my job harder.

180
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,720
Hey, let's go.

181
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
-Let go now.
-What?

182
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,680
There's no way we will find that here.

183
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,880
You know what? This wouldn't have happened.

184
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,800
Come on! What were you even thinking?

185
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,200
Were you going
to turn a blind eye to this?

186
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,960
Yes. I was going to.

187
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,320
I was going to pretend it wasn't my job
and turn a blind eye to it.

188
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I didn't want that case
to complicate my life!

189
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,960
So I threw it in the river.
Are you happy now?

190
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes! That's it!

191
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,160
That's more like you. You piece of trash.

192
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,680
Hey. Then answer me this.
Why did that piece of trash

193
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,120
kick Do Yu Gon?

194
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,720
Hey, where are you going?

195
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,040
Hey! Where are you going?

196
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Hey!

197
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,080
Ryu Su Yeol!

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,240
Has he gone mad?

199
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
Why is he taking off his clothes?

200
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
Darn it. Come on!

201
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
If you're going to do it, do it right.

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Darn it.

203
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
Gosh.

204
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,040
I can't see a thing. How will I find it?

205
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,960
Jeez. That nutcase!

206
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,800
My life is over.

207
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm doomed.

208
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,920
I'm totally ruined! Darn me!

209
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,600
(Side Dishes)

210
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,400
What brings you here at this hour?

211
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
Can't a son come to his mom's shop?

212
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,040
Mom. Listen.

213
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,160
Whatever happens later,

214
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,840
don't be shocked. Okay?

215
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,120
We paid off all of our debt, right?

216
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,640
When things are too quiet,
that makes me nervous.

217
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,040
What is it this time?

218
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,520
Did Dong Yeol cause trouble again?

219
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
No. It's not him.

220
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
Then what is it?

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
-Mom.
-Yes?

222
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Where did you get that?

223
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,800
Dong Yeol gave me this. Why?

224
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,200
That jerk. Did he steal this?

225
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,840
He stole it. I knew it. That brat.

226
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,040
What's wrong with you?

227
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,160
-What's going on?
-Mom.

228
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,320
-What's gotten into you?
-We're good now.

229
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,480
We're all good now.

230
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,960
-What's the matter with you?
-We're good now.

231
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,400
What are you talking about?
Hey, what's going on?

232
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,200
Come on! That jerk!
You scared the wits out of me!

233
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
(You brought this upon yourself.)

234
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
(You brought this upon yourself.)

235
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,920
It does look like Assemblyman Do.

236
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,839
But it's too blurry.

237
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,760
Okay. I get that it's damaged.

238
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,079
But you have to admit it.

239
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,119
You know that this is Do Yu Gon.

240
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,640
Hey. This didn't capture him in the act.

241
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,079
If he says it's someone who resembles him,
we got nothing.

242
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,319
We'd be lucky if the prosecution
doesn't dismiss this case.

243
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,920
You're going to ruin his career with this?
He might end up at the Blue House.

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,360
Exactly. This circumstantial evidence

245
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,080
shows the man who's likely
to be the president, Do Yu Gon,

246
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,840
murdered a woman.

247
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,640
If our team gets to the bottom of this,

248
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,000
"The Anti-Corruption Unit
of Munyang Police Agency solves

249
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,280
the unprecedented murder case
of the next presidential candidate"!

250
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,200
Lee Hui Gyeom of the Narcotics Unit
is already on this case.

251
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,400
We would be fools if we let the other team
take this case from us!

252
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,120
I got the bait, hooked it on the needle,
and threw the line.

253
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,840
Then a big fish bit.

254
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,680
And this catch...

255
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
What if the others take the fish?
You're sure it won't drive you mad?

256
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,720
If you indeed caught a shark,

257
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,440
it will bite the bait
and sink the boat you're on.

258
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,040
Don't you know that?

259
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,560
We just need to find the guy
who took care of Jeong Yu Na's body.

260
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,080
I'll get everyone that
requested him to get rid of the body.

261
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,880
That's what he said.

262
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,400
So what do you think?

263
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,240
Given the turn of events,

264
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
we should let him handle it.

265
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,880
If Ryu Su Yeol gets it right,

266
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,400
you will have a case
that will make your career.

267
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,120
Even if something goes wrong,
he will take responsibility and resign.

268
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,280
(I'm sure you can handle it on your end.)

269
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,560
All I have to do now is to watch.

270
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay, I have to go.

271
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Suspension
after assaulting an assemblyman?

272
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,640
These fools want to take this
even further?

273
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,120
What about you? Still nothing?

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
Sorry, nothing yet.

275
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
What about the guy
who took care of the body?

276
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,280
I can't reach him,
so I'm assuming he left the country.

277
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,400
Hey.

278
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,440
Hey, you murderer.

279
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
You murderer.

280
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,480
You murderer!

281
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,080
That punk called me a murderer.

282
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,760
Does it not make you angry
that he called me a murderer? No?

283
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,080
Aren't you angry?

284
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,960
How did that scumbag find out?

285
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
I'll find out as soon as possible-

286
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,360
What? "As soon as possible"?

287
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
In Beom.

288
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,000
In Beom!

289
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,560
How can I trust you after what happened?

290
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't do anything.

291
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,400
Don't go around running your mouth.

292
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,920
Just stay like this
until things get sorted out.

293
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Lie low, and don't do anything.

294
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,040
Do you understand?

295
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
Do you understand?

296
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,200
Darn it!

297
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,400
I will kill you all.

298
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Darn it.

299
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
(Hangukgwan)

300
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,680
(Lee Hui Gyeom)

301
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,120
Goodness.

302
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,280
(Lee Hui Gyeom)

303
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,400
(Missed Call, Lee Hui Gyeom)

304
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I...

305
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,640
I told you it wasn't a dream.

306
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,840
Right, okay.

307
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,440
So it turns out, this lunatic was you.

308
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,560
That's right.
This nutcase keeps coming out of nowhere.

309
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,160
At this rate, my life is doomed.

310
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,760
That's how it is with mental disorders.
You can't really fully recover from it,

311
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
and the potential for relapse
is very high.

312
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
When you were a kid,

313
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,600
did you experience a traumatic event?

314
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,560
Were you perhaps

315
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,680
abused as a kid?
Or were you in some kind of accident?

316
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,760
No, not at all.

317
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,720
Forget it. I don't plan
to write my autobiography here.

318
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,160
Can you treat me or not?

319
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,280
You don't want to see me
for a long time either, right?

320
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,560
Gosh.

321
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,520
Are you asleep?

322
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,600
Jeez, I can't believe this.

323
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,600
Goodness. Hey.

324
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,600
-Hey, wake up.
-No!

325
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,640
-Gosh, that was close.
-What are you doing?

326
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,880
-So what happened?
-Not much.

327
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,760
You kept resisting to enter hypnosis.

328
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,440
Do you think I came here
to sleep next to you?

329
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,080
That's exactly what I want to say!

330
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,920
Then what are the things
that I saw in my dream?

331
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,920
Why did I have that nightmare?

332
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,560
Your alter... I mean, that lunatic.
Do you know his name?

333
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,600
Was I supposed to ask that jerk his name?

334
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,320
"How do you do? What's your name?"
Like that?

335
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
All right. Please calm down.

336
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,840
You see, alternate personalities
want to be acknowledged too.

337
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,200
You need to address him by his name.

338
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
It's very important.

339
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,240
Next time you see him,
you need to acknowledge him first.

340
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,800
-Then try to appease him-
-So you're saying

341
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,960
I should wait until he shows up again?
Is that it?

342
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,480
First, I suggest that you try
to avoid a stressful situation...

343
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
Avoid what?
I'm stressed out to the max right now!

344
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,320
(Heart Mender)
Avoid what?
I'm stressed out to the max right now!

345
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,400
(Heart Mender)

346
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,040
I told you that you need to calm down!
(Heart Mender)

347
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,320
I told you that you need to calm down!

348
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,200
How can I calm down right now?
I'm so stressed out because of that jerk!

349
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,520
Acknowledge him? Forget it.
I want him gone!

350
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,800
Gosh, seriously!

351
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,560
How could you fall asleep
during my hypnosis session?

352
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,160
(S)

353
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,240
All right, here.

354
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,680
You see, this is strong stuff.

355
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,720
Take one at a time,
and we'll see how it goes.

356
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,160
And you need to learn to control
your thoughts. It's very important.

357
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,080
This is what I want you to do. Watch.

358
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,080
"That jerk is a fake."

359
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,040
"I'm the real one, the one and only.
He's not real!"

360
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,920
You want me to do this?

361
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm dead serious right now.
This is what you need to do.

362
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,400
One more time.

363
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,480
-"That jerk is a fake."
-"That jerk is a fake."

364
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
-"I'm the real one."
-"That jerk is a fake."

365
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
"He's not real."

366
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
-"He's not real!"
-"He's not real!"

367
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,600
Open the door!

368
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,800
The door! Hey, open the door!

369
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
He's a fake.
I'm the real one, the one and only.

370
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,160
-Open the door!
-He's not real.

371
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,920
(Diesel Cars, This Way)

372
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
Jeez, my goodness.

373
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,080
Hey.

374
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,960
Hey, no! Don't take that.

375
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,560
Stop taking those pills!

376
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,440
He's not real.

377
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,280
He's not real.

378
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm so tired.

379
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
I'm exhausted.

380
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
This is nice. This feels so nice.

381
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Hey, you.

382
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,800
Shoot! Darn it!

383
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
That jerk is a fake. He's not real.

384
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,040
I'm the real one, the one and only.

385
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,440
You'll die at this rate.

386
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,600
Hey!

387
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,520
-Hey!
-You fool.

388
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,520
-I can't breathe...
-Here.

389
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,720
Take it all you want if you want to die.

390
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,800
You psycho...

391
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,360
Hey, you...

392
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,840
What's your name?

393
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,560
Me?

394
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,760
Why do you ask?

395
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,280
You little... Your name...

396
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,440
What is your name?

397
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,080
K.

398
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,560
-"Gay"?
-K!

399
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,320
As in, H, I, J, K!

400
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,280
K, I see.

401
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,720
Darn, what kind of name is that?

402
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,680
Su Yeol! Open up.

403
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Su Yeol! Open the door, you jerk!

404
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,840
You always have to
make me so angry, don't you?

405
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,520
Oh, no. Shoot.

406
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,880
Calm down and focus.

407
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,400
Yes, let's give this a shot.

408
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,960
Hey, Su Yeol!

409
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,520
Jeez.

410
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
Gosh.

411
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,840
Senior Inspector, Superintendent, my foot.

412
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,200
Hey, wake up.

413
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,080
Wake up already.

414
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,720
Hey.

415
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,840
Wake up!

416
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,600
Don't hit me, you psycho!

417
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,120
I suppose there are others
who want to beat you up as well.

418
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,640
Where did this jerk go?

419
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,600
"Jerk"? Who?

420
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,360
Hey, wake up already.

421
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm dizzy.

422
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,360
-I'm so dizzy...
-You begged me for help in tears.

423
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,840
Don't act like you remember nothing.

424
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,960
Hang on. How did you get in?

425
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,440
What do you think?

426
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,360
The door code is 881025.
Why didn't you change it?

427
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,760
Why should I?

428
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
-Why? Why do I have to change it?
-It's my birthday.

429
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,280
-None of your business. It's my place.
-What? It's my birthday!

430
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,320
Why are you still using it
as your door code?

431
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,720
Forget it.

432
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,440
The Commissioner was on our case
to bring you in,

433
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,160
but he's all quiet now.

434
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,400
So I'm assuming you found the necklace.

435
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,280
(You brought this upon yourself.
You got that?)

436
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,560
(You deserved to die!)

437
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,000
(Darn it.)

438
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,920
(Why did you have to die?)

439
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,280
(Why drop dead?)

440
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,360
So before Min Su died,

441
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,320
he was after this scumbag, Do Yu Gon.

442
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,920
-Let go.
-Where are you going?

443
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
I said, let go!

444
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,960
Why?

445
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
Will you go there and punch him too?

446
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,360
Look at the mess I'm in.

447
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,400
The person we're up against
is none other than Do Yu Gon.

448
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,000
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

449
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,880
Darn it.

450
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,600
-So what will you do now?
-Forget about it.

451
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,480
It's my team that has to deal with it,
not yours.

452
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,480
Gosh, you're too nosy for your own good.

453
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,680
I don't even know
how much info I can share with...

454
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,600
I haven't even told Jae Seon...

455
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,480
Fine, you can be a little nosy.
Just a little.

456
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,960
Then let's...
We'll investigate it together.

457
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,360
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

458
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,360
(Drop-off Area)

459
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,280
Boss, does this feel nice?

460
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,520
I can't pay you today.

461
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,200
No, then...

462
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,680
Did you just laugh?
Do you think I'm a joke?

463
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,920
(Detective Do In Beom)

464
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Hello?

465
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Hey, I refuse to leave like this.
Do you understand?

466
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,400
-Hey!
-So stop calling me.

467
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,680
Stop calling me, you leech!

468
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,120
You scumbag! Stop calling me!

469
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,280
Boss!

470
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
Hey, SU JAN! How did it go?

471
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,080
We're looking for
the exact same helmet and motorcycle,

472
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,320
but it's like finding a needle
in a haystack.

473
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,440
SU JAN.

474
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,360
Remember, Boss. Chasing a small gain
can make you suffer a huge loss.

475
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,760
Right now, they're scouring the town

476
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,320
to find out who burned the dead body.

477
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,520
Too bad we got that thing stolen,

478
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,680
but we should lie low
for the time being...

479
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,560
Hey, do you know
how much that thing costs?

480
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,680
Go find it.

481
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,640
Find it no matter what.

482
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I will skin that jerk alive,
so go find him.

483
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,320
-Okay?
-Okay.

484
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,600
No!

485
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,880
-Jeez!
-What? What's wrong?

486
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,400
You scared me!

487
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,000
Did you have to sneak up on me like that?

488
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,400
What? I kept shouting your name
from all the way over there.

489
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,960
-So what's up?
-Gosh. What do you think?

490
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,640
You treated me like a piece of trash
for not helping Gyeong Tae.

491
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,360
When did I treat you
like a piece of trash?

492
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,520
-You're not that bad.
-What, then? Am I recyclable?

493
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,720
Anyway, Ma, that dirtbag.
Did you find out anything?

494
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes, I looked into it. That jerk...

495
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,320
-Gosh, are you all right?
-Be careful. It's very slippery.

496
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,880
Jeez, seriously.

497
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,920
He froze his phone and credit cards
and dropped off the face of the earth.

498
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,320
But he was doing
all sorts of illegal stuff.

499
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,160
You saw those signs last time, right?

500
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,840
He mainly smuggled stuff but was also
a stowaway broker and handled corpses...

501
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,240
He does anything and everything
to earn money.

502
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
What is this?

503
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,640
Hey. We must catch him at all costs, okay?

504
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,520
Do Yu Gon will not accept
the circumstantial evidence.

505
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,920
We must track him down first

506
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,760
to get Do Yu Gon and Do In Beom too, okay?

507
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,760
Yes.

508
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,800
Darn it. They took everything.

509
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,960
First, have the Support Unit

510
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
-gather a list of black market dealers.
-Okay.

511
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
And let's go find out more
about Ma's business.

512
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,960
Okay.

513
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,760
-Come on. Let's go.
-But I was...

514
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,679
-I know.
-But I wonder why...

515
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,679
(Munyang General Hospital)
-I know.
-But I wonder why...

516
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,199
-I know.
-But I wonder why...

517
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,159
Hey, go eat something. I'll be here.

518
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,440
-Thank you, sir.
-Let's go.

519
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,719
(Room 201, Munyang General Hospital)

520
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,639
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

521
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,239
That look on your face when you were
looking at Gyeong Tae just now.

522
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Is it guilt?

523
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,040
Fear? Or is it both?

524
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,480
I thought you were suspended. Am I wrong?

525
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
You're right.

526
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,320
I appreciate your interest in this case,
which is why I want to advise you

527
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
to turn yourself in and confess the truth

528
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
unless you want to be framed
for the murder.

529
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,400
Why? Isn't that what's going on?

530
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
The murderer is someone else.

531
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,040
You're just busy cleaning up the mess.

532
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I thought that was what was going on.

533
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,520
The rumors must be true. Everyone says
you've completely lost your mind.

534
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,520
Right. Who in their right mind

535
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,200
would throw a flying kick
at an assemblyman?

536
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,840
Oh, that reminds me.

537
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,040
The one who took care of
Jeong Yu Na's dead body. Mr. Ma, was it?

538
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,560
Did you hire him yourself?

539
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,960
You crazy punk.

540
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,280
Assemblyman Do
may be able to get out of this,

541
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
but not you. Never.

542
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,040
You know that too, right?

543
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,680
Think wisely.

544
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,160
Staying on a boat with a hole
will only cost you your life.

545
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,640
What about the boat you're on? Is it safe?

546
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Let's see whose boat sinks first.

547
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,040
Surprise!

548
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,880
You scared me!

549
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,160
-Be thankful I don't have a gun now.
-Come on.

550
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,560
Ta-da!

551
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
What's that?

552
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,880
It's my little brother's birthday today.
Come on. Sit here.

553
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,360
I made seaweed soup for you from scratch!

554
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
It's your birthday, not mine.

555
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,680
April 18, 1984, Ryu Dong Yeol.

556
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,600
April 18, 1987, Ryu Su Yeol!

557
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,200
I have to say,
I know that I'm a foundling,

558
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,680
but how could she give me
the exact same birthday as yours?

559
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,920
Your mom just doesn't care, does she?

560
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,960
Think about it though. Mom's really smart.

561
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,840
This way, she can just throw
one birthday party for both of her sons.

562
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,760
Hey, try it.

563
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
-What is this? A boiled egg yolk?
-Surprise!

564
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,840
I threw in a boiled egg yolk just for you.

565
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
Amazing, right? I'm a genius.

566
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,360
-Get out. I said, get out.
-What? Eat first.

567
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,280
-Get out.
-No, eat first.

568
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,920
(♫ Happy birthday to you ♫)

569
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,480
♫ Happy birthday ♫

570
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,080
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

571
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,760
Mom! This is for me, right?

572
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,320
-Right? This is mine.
-Hey.

573
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,120
It's mine! Nice.

574
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,480
Su Yeol, make a wish
and blow out the candles.

575
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,040
Su Yeol, ask Mom
to get you a transforming robot too.

576
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,600
You said you wanted one too.

577
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,720
Well...

578
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,880
Then can I...

579
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,840
Look.

580
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,080
Can I call you Mom too?

581
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,520
Yes, you can call her your mom too.

582
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,560
Yes! Of course, you can.

583
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,400
Here, this is for you.
Now, call me Mom. Go on.

584
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Well...

585
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,360
Mom.

586
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,960
Yes, my dear son.
I have a younger son now.

587
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,680
Thank you for becoming
a member of the family. Happy birthday.

588
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,200
You should blow out the candles.

589
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,680
Go ahead and blow out the candles.

590
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,360
All right. One, two, three.

591
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,520
Thanks for the seaweed soup.

592

("Master Conversational English
in a Month")

594

The name, "Korea", comes from "Corea".
Did you know?

595
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,800
Korea, Corea, I don't care.

What is Do Yu Gon up to these days?

599
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,360
He took the drug we sold him
and got himself in trouble.

600
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,400
Should I call him now?

601
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,520
Hey.

602
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,040
Okay.

603
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,160
The ones we left at those spots
got stolen again.

604
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,480
I'm telling you. Those rats stole them.

605
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Should we put out some rat poison?

606
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,640
Goodness.

607
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,520
If you're up, go home already.

What's this?

609
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,280
What? You said you'd kill me
if I didn't get you one.

When? In your dream?

611

What are you talking about?
You kept texting me last night.

612
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,640
You said I should keep my promise.
Why did you have to swear at me like that?

613
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,080
-Hand it over.
-I gave you the robot.

614
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,040
No, your phone! Hand it over.

615
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,960
Jeez, hang on.

616
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,080
-Show me the text.
-Okay. Hold on. What's wrong?

00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
What is it? What's wrong?

625
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,440
How much does this lunatic know?

626
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
By the way,

627
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,880
what will you do with the other stuff?

628
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,920
What? What stuff?

629
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,400
What?

630

The stuff at the store.

You know,
the things that were with Mom's necklace.

I swear. I didn't touch anything
except for the necklace I gave to Mom.

Hey, Jae Seon.

638
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,360
The list of black market dealers.
Do you have it?

639
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,760
Darn it! How come it's taking so long?

640
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,480
Tell them to hurry up!

641
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,200
Okay.

642
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,480
-Do you think these are stolen goods?
-Be quiet.

643

Hey, brother. Who goes to
black market dealers these days?

644

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,240
You see, the dark web

647
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,320
is where
all the sketchy transactions like this

648
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,080
take place.

649
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,520
And naturally,
it's very hard to get into the dark web.

650
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,440
But who's your brother? Ryu Dong Yeol.

651
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,680
Nickname, East Fire.

652
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,800
East Fire has built
quite a reputation for himself here.

653
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,760

(14k Gold Halo Ring)

655
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,440
Are you sure you didn't make any mistakes?

656
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,160
Or I can just contact the Support Unit--

657
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,960
Come on. I've done this many times. Relax.

658
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm telling you.
You shouldn't underestimate these jerks.

659
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
Don't worry.

660
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,720
Yes, Ryu Su Yeol speaking.

661

(Munyang District Prosecutors' Office)

663
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
All right.

664
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,160
Here.

665
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,760
The prosecutor will be here shortly.
Please wait a moment.

666
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,080
Have some tea. Oh, there he is.

667
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,720
Mom, I have to work.
Okay, I'll see you later.

668
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,200
All right.

669
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,800
Hello, I'm Nam Eun Seok.
My gosh, you're very tall.

670
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,040

who trained with Do Yu Gon.)

674
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,520
Well, it's nice to meet you.

675
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,320
-I'm in the Anti-Corruption Unit at-
-I know.

676
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,760
I'm sorry,
but what year did you graduate-

677
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,920
None of your business.

678
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,400
You see,
I have an accounting certification,

679
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,680
which is rare for a prosecutor.

680
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,800
But I don't have
a single blind date lined up.

681
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,440
If you have a younger sister...

682
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,040
Oh, my bad. You only have a brother.
Mr. Ryu Dong Yeol.

683
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
And a single mother
who runs a small deli, right?

684
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,200
That's right.

686

Assistant Inspector Byeon Gwang Beom,
Senior Inspector Choi Mu Cheol, and so on.

687
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,360
What do you think they have in common?

688
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,640
Well...

689
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,760
It looks like you came fully prepared.

690
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,400
I understand
you have to obey your higher-ups--

691
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,360
Yes. I've made it this far because
I listened, obeyed, and studied hard.

692
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,720
You're a good judge of character.

693
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,400
Anyway, the correct answer is...
The people who bribed you.

694
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,800
More accurately, those who sent money
to your brother's account.

695
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,040
You must've thought
you could launder the money

696
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,920
by putting it through
two borrowed-name accounts.

697
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,720
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but you're in deep trouble now.

698
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,960
I have an accounting certification,
and I'm very diligent.

699
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,160
But I don't have
a single blind date lined up!

700
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,360
Sorry, I'm not angry right now.
I get mood swings.

701
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,000
Anyway,
I'm going to investigate this thoroughly

702
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,680
so I can get a promotion and get married.

703
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,120
You understand what I'm saying, right?

704
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,720
I ask for your cooperation.

705
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,920
Okay, Superintendent Ryu Su Yeol?

706
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,080
Did you not hear
that I wanted to meet up with you?

707
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,760
You said drug runners should stay quiet
and never show themselves.

708
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,920
A woman who did drugs with me died.

709
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,320
I think the police know something,

710
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,040
but I have no idea what they have now.

711
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,680
You told us to sort out our own problems
and said you'd do the same.

712
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,840
Kill him. Do a clean job.

713
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,880
You risked your life
to return to your motherland,

714
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,120
so you should sell lots of drugs
and live a good life here for a long time.

715
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,000
Right?

716
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,920
What if you get caught and deported?

717
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,880
Then you'd have to starve
in that cold place.

718
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,560
You've got to be kidding me.

719
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm not done talking.

720
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,520
What?

721
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
If you want this punk dead,

722
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,160
you'll have to give us
a delivery service company.

723
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,840
A delivery service?

724

keep stealing our stuff
from our usual spots.

726
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,080
So you're saying

727
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,120
you'll start
openly distributing drugs now?

728
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
(You don't think I can do it?)

that they must move in

with their lights and sirens off, okay?

-Hey!
-Get him!

807
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,160
Get that cop!

808
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,320
That lunatic is so fast!

809
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,880
Get him!

810

-Spread out and find him!
-Go!

813
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,600
Darn it.

814

Please, K. This is your moment.

817
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,000
Come on, K.

818
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,200
Come out already.

819
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,960
That cop hit one of us!

820
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,200
There he is!

821
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,120
Go! Get him!

822

You can't do this!

823
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,480
Jeez, you scared me.

00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,640
Darn it.

825

You jerks.

826
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,520
I'm really scary when I'm angry.

827
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,400
Remember the guy with the helmet

828
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,040
who destroyed your container building?

829
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,360
That was me, you idiot!

830
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
Okay, bring it on!

831
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,960
If you're that lunatic,

832
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,200
this is like killing two birds
with one stone!

833

How come your Korean is so good?

834

Get him!

You... Darn you.

836

Want one?

837
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,080
Why let me get hurt
if you were going to come out anyway?

838

Jeez, you can't even fight.
You embarrass me.

839

Hey, anyway...

840
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,440
You have to catch Ma. You must get
that scumbag no matter what, okay?

841
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,560
Why should I?

842

-Yes!

850

What's the situation? Brief me on-

851
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,840
Boss, he's that cop.

Are you done playing?

864
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,920
No, I'm not.

865
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,960
I want to play some more.

866

-Don't tell me what to do!
-Hey!

-Be gentle.
-Stay still.

to a dirtbag like you anyway.

01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,360
Kill him. Do a clean job.

967
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,960
Darn it. I don't believe this.

968
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,960
Hey. What?

969
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,360
Okay, stall them. We'll be there shortly.

970
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,080
Hey, we should rush back to the office.

971
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,280
Wait! What's in the box?

972
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,680
-Get the stuff in the shredder too.
-No, wait!

973
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,120
-What is happening here?
-Hey!

974
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,320
-Why are you taking that?
-What is going on, all of a sudden?

975
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,520
-Why would you...
-Why?

976
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,200
-Are you the lead investigator?
-Yes.

977
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,800
I'm Ryu Su Yeol. What is this about?

978
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,040
-I can't believe this.
-Wait.

979
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,440
-Jeez.
-Jerk. How could you do this?

980
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,280
-Hey, take everything.
-Hold on, why...

981
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,200
-Get out.
-Why are you taking everything?

982
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,960
-Wait! Why...
-Hey.

983
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,000
Hello? Mom?

984
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,320
(What is going on?)

985
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,400
(Some people are here to take
my household account book and bankbooks.)

986
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,080
(Look, why are you doing this?)

987
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,280
What is going on?

988
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,520
What did you do?

989
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,440
Why did those people raid my store
and go through everything?

990
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,240
Mom, this is not...

991
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,160
-Let me explain.
-Where is Dong Yeol?

992
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,680
I've been calling him, but
he's not picking up. I can't reach him!

993
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,280
Su Yeol.

994
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,440
Everything's okay, right?

995
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,240
Yes, of course.

996
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
Gosh.

997
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,480
(Assemblyman Do Yu Gon)

998
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,360
You can go in.

999
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,000
I'm sorry, sir.

1000
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,960
Please forgive me just this once.

1001
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,040
Why? What happened?

1002
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,560
I must've been out of my mind.
I sincerely apologize, sir.

1003
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,000
Why don't you just
beat me up to a pulp and--

1004
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,120
Beat you up? What are you talking about?

1005
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,479
Hey, am I a thug?

1006
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,800
No.

1007
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,200
Hey, am I a thug who beats up people?

1008
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,840
-Nonsense.
-Am I?

1009
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,399
Well, I guess he doesn't know who I am.

1010
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,520
This jerk.

1011
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,960
This is the only evidence the police have.

1012
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,160
It's too damaged,
so it won't even be inadmissible in court.

1013
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,200
I should've known my place.
Forgive my brazenness.

1014
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,359
Just this once.
Please forgive me just this once.

1015
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:09,120
Then I will do whatever it takes
to repay you for your mercy.

1016
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,200
You see,

1017
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,920
everyone makes mistakes, right?

1018
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:28,240
Thank you. Thank you, sir!

1019
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,120
All right. Then you'd have to go
work somewhere else.

1020
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,520
You'd prefer a big company, right?

1021
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,960
You mean,
I have to leave the police force?

1022
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,240
My gosh.

1023
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,520
Then what?

1024
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,640
Were you planning to stay there?

1025
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,560
No, sir.

1026
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,280
A big company... That'd be great.
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,320
I have something too.

1028
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,440
Do you want it?

1029
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,840
Hey, go get my jacket.

1030
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,080
What do you think? Does this suit me?

1031
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,760
Thanks.

1032
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,880
Hey, connect this to that thing
and hit play.

1033
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,080
Turn up the volume.

1034
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,360
(Jeong In Seon!)

1035
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,200
(♫ Happy birthday to you ♫)

1036
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,320
(Happy birthday, kiddo!)

1037
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,240
(Isn't this teddy bear so cute?)

1038
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,280
(So stop bringing home
those ugly toys now.)

1039
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,680
(Take good care of this from now on.)

1040
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,360
(I'm going to watch you
and see what you do all day.)

1041
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,240
(Okay, sweetie?)

1042
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,040
(Is this being recorded properly?)

1043
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,720
Hey.

1044
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,920
You can keep that.

1045
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,040
It's your retirement gift.

1046
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,120
Darn it. My feet are all wet.

1047
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,920
Hey, why so serious?

1048
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,840
Are we at a press screening or what?

1049
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,080
Jeez, what a downer.
Come on! Let's have some fun now!

1050
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,960
My eyes well up with tears
every time I watch that.

1051
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,640
(I told you)

1052
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,480
that it's fine.

1053
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,800
I don't have to

1054
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,720
find my mom.

1055
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,600
-My gosh!
-Look at you. You're so excited.

1056
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
Darn it.

1057
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,240
Hello?

1058
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,800
Senior Inspector Ryu, I need your help.

1059
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,080
Who are you?

1060
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,840
It's me, O Gyeong Tae.

1061
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,520
I'm being chased.

1062
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,920
(Please help me.)

1063
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,640
O Gyeong Tae?

1064
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,760
(Bad, Evil, Crazy)

1065
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,240
(Bad and Crazy)

1066
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,240
(In this situation, it'll be hard
for you to prove your innocence)

1067
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,840
(no matter what you do.)

1068
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,280
(You... How could you do this to me?)

1069
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,720
I will fight to the end
and uncover the truth.

1070
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,600
This place reeks of garbage!

1071
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,720
(Can we please respect
each other's privacy?)

1072
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,640
(The entire team died.)

1073
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,680
(Inspector Lee Hui Gyeom
is the only survivor.)

1074
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,600
(Was I their target from the get-go?)
