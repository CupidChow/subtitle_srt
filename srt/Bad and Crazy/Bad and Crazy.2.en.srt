Hey, you piece of...

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
What is this place?

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,440
You owe O Gyeong Tae an apology.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
O Gyeong Tae?

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,720
Apologize to him before you go.

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
Apologize?

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,200
You psycho. What do you mean...

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Darn it!

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,960
Hey, Officer O.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Wake up.

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
O Gyeong Tae. Wake up!

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
You psycho!

23
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,120
We'll all die at this rate.
What will you do now?

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,440
What are you waiting for?

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
What?

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
What do you want me to do? You psycho!

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,400
-This idiot.
-Oh, he woke up!

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,160
-He woke up!
-Hey! Why would you jump in there?

29
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,160
-Who do you think you are?
-Gosh, ma'am.

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,680
He just woke up. Don't smack him so hard.

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
He saved a life. He's a hero.

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
What? A hero, my foot.

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Hey, who do you think you are?
You're no hero.

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,920
-Why would you do such a thing?
-Mom!

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,760
-It's so unlike you.
-It hurts!

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,240
-Why would you do that?
-It hurts.

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,120
-Mom! You're hurting him.
-Gosh, seriously.

38
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,760
Let's go. That's enough.
Goodness gracious.

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,079
-Are you all right?
-Hey, what happened?

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
Why am I here?

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,920
That's what I want to ask you.
What on earth happened?

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,200
-Hey, help me up.
-Are you okay?

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,079
Gosh... Why am I lying down here?

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,079
Exactly, why are you lying down here?

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,120
I have no idea what happened.

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,000

Well, just some psycho.
There's this lunatic but...
(Episode 2)

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,720
Well, just some psycho.
There's this lunatic but...

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Hey, this is not the time
to go on about some lunatic.

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,040
This is serious, okay?

55
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,320
Hey, they're saying
Gyeong Tae tried to take his own life

56
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,480
because you had been
covertly watching him.

57
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,959
They're making stuff up
to get our team in trouble.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Those rats...

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,520
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,280
Are we everyone's enemy or what?
We're cops too, you know.

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,600
The jerks who are supposed
to be our colleagues are even worse.

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Darn it.
Maybe we should track down that lunatic.

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,840
Hey, who called it in first?

64
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,880
Last night, I was suddenly so hungry.

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
So I ordered some jokbal
and came out to have a smoke...

66
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,000
I mean, I came out to get some fresh air.
But it was raining so hard.

67
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,960
That moment,
I saw a handsome guy on his motorcycle.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
I was going to say hi to him,

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,400
but I suddenly heard a loud boom
and saw smoke coming out of that house.

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
So I panicked
and called the police right away.

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,960
Then this guy and someone else
suddenly fell, like you see in movies.

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Hey, that's enough.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,000
Did you see a guy wearing a helmet?

74
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,320
A black helmet.

75
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
-A black helmet?
-Yes.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,640
No, I didn't.

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,600
She didn't see him. The lady
at the corner store said the same thing.

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,400
You said he was here.
Maybe you were confused.

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,800
Does everyone here
walk around with their eyes closed?

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,320
Are you really the guy
that fell from the window?

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,480
What kind of workout do you do?
I thought you died on the spot.

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,200
I go fishing. Hey, let's go.

83
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
You should quit jokbal.

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
Bye.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,840
(Jeong In Seon!)

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,159
(Happy birthday.)

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,080
(Isn't this teddy bear so cute?)

88
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,920
(So stop bringing home
those ugly toys now.)

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,880
(Take good care of this from now on.)

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,520
(I'm going to watch you
and see what you do all day.)

91
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
(Okay, sweetie?)

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
-A video message?
-Yes.

93
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,960
She had a daughter, you know.

94
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,200
There was nothing else?

95
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,320
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,280
Because of this stupid video,

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,600
we went through all the trouble.

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,240
Hey, this video message...

99
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,480
What about Ryu Su Yeol?

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
I haven't really heard anything from him,

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,800
so I don't think he did it
knowing the situation.

102
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,440
It seems like the higher-ups want to
reprimand him for excessive investigation.

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,480
What about that officer?

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,760
He's still unconscious. The chances of him
regaining consciousness are slim.

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,159
Didn't you say

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,480
he saw your face?

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Yes.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
-Hey, In Beom.
-Yes.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,480
-In Beom.
-Yes.

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
We have to get this sorted out.

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,520
If you're charged with attempted murder,

112
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,120
even the President can't save you.

113
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay.

114
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,400
(Officer O attempted suicide
because of a senior inspector.)

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
"The cops in this country
embarrass me so much."
(Officer O attempted suicide
because of a senior inspector.)

116
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,360
"The cops in this country
embarrass me so much."

117
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,600
Do you have to read it out loud
right in front of me?

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,040
(Officer O is innocent.
Bring him back to life!)

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,400
"Senior Inspector Ryu,
you should've been the one to die."
(Officer O is innocent.
Bring him back to life!)

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,120
"Senior Inspector Ryu,
you should've been the one to die."

121
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
-What kind of scumbag...
-Hey.

122
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
My, the number of views
keeps going up at the speed of light.

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,040
At this rate,
this will soon reach the Blue House.

124
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
What the heck are you up to? You idiot!

125
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,320
Someone had beaten him up to a pulp.
I found him collapsed on the floor.

126
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
I mean, sir. I saved his life.

127
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,680
You saved him? Hey, Su Yeol.

128
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,720
You'd never save anyone
if there was nothing in it for you.

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,440
-We both know that.
-What happened was...

130
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,960
-Bong Pil, seriously.
-I clearly told you

131
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,160
to stay out of trouble
until the evaluation was over.

132
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,520
But you voluntarily got yourself
into trouble,

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,640
which tells me that
you don't want the promotion. Am I right?

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
What does that have to do with this?

135
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,559
Why would I not want the promotion?

136
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,080
What? You don't want to give up?

137
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,000
Then what will you do about this?

138
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,320
These jerks are running their mouths
nonstop right now.

139
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,360
Do you actually think
you can be promoted this time?

140
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,080
-Whatever. Stop reading that.
-Hey!

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,920
Okay, fine. I'll go get it all sorted out.

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
(Subsection Chief Gwak Bong Pil)

143
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
Jae Seon, hey.
(Subsection Chief Gwak Bong Pil)

144
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,400
That crazy fool.

145
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,640
I thought you'd finally get a promotion

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,680
by screwing O Gyeong Tae over.

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
But all of that has gone down the drain

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
because you saved him.

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
Shut it. It's not over yet.

150
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,200
It's not over yet? Then what?

151
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,960
What will you do? Will you track down
the one who beat him up?

152
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,840
Gosh, that punk...

153
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
I swear,
that jerk with the helmet saw it too.

154
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
That darn helmet...

155
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,160
Stop talking about the helmet, will you?
Jeez.

156
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,960
No one saw him.

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,840
If anyone else heard it,
they'd flat out say you're lying.

158
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm only listening to this nonsense
because I'm very patient.

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Have you totally lost your mind or what?

160
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
How do you think I feel right now?

161
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
Having to explain it
when I know it makes no sense!

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,760
I definitely saw him.

163
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,200
He was right there with me. What?
Should I lie and say he wasn't?

164
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,840
Okay. I heard you. Come on.

165
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,040
Why did you spit all over my food? Jeez.

166
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,080
Wait.

167
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,280
Seeing how he knew
where O Gyeong Tae lived,

168
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,200
maybe, they knew each other.

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,280
Are they friends?

170
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
Then is he friends with the guy
that beat him up?

171
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,320
Wait. The guy who beat up O Gyeong Tae
is friends with the helmet guy?

172
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
Is this a school reunion?

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,280
This is it. You need to get
some counseling. You need therapy.

174
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,800
Hey, have you lost your mind?

175
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
You want me to start seeing a shrink now?

176
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
So I can lose my badge?

177
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Exactly. You should go see a shrink
before you completely lose it!

178
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,640
I know a good doctor.

179
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
You trust me, don't you?
I'm your guy, Yang Jae Seon.

180
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,480
Geun Su. Yeom Geun Su.

181
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,240
(Munyang Market)

182
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,680
(Heart Mender)

183
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,520
All right. I met Inspector Yang Jae Seon
about five years ago.

184
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,400
The illegal distribution of mental health
medication brought us together.

185
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,800
Ever since then,
we have kept a very nice relationship.

186
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,840
I guess you can say we're good friends.
You know?

187
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Have the drink,
and feel free to talk to me.

188
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,760
I know that opening up to someone
for the first time is very difficult.

189
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,480
Just think of me as your mother.
Please relax.

190
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
You know,

191
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,360
I keep seeing this crazy guy lately.

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Pardon?

193
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,880
But that guy shows up out of nowhere

194
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
and starts attacking me.

195
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
You're a cop. You can arrest him yourself.
What's the problem?

196
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,880
No, listen. The thing is...

197
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,880
I don't know who he is.

198
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,960
He's always wearing a helmet.
So I've never seen his face.

199
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,160
He shows up out of the blue
and vanishes into thin air.

200
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
But what drives me crazy is

201
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,640
that no one has seen him other than me.

202
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
So no one will believe me.

203
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,960
This is really driving me insane.

204
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
(Yeom Geun Su)

205
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,120
Listen. I told you. Didn't I?

206
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,480
He goes around wearing that helmet.
But no one has seen him.

207
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,040
(It's a big one. You're not coming today?)

208
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
(Of course, I'm coming.)

209
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm always the only one who sees him.

210
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,440
That drives me crazy.

211
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
(-Bring a lot of cash.)
-Why am I the only one?

212
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
(When can you come?)

213
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,520
(I'll be late.
I need to listen to this lunatic.)

214
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
It's so frustrating.

215
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,160
You made me tell this frustrating story
again. This is more frustrating!

216
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,520
After going through a traumatic incident,

217
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,960
people start talking nonsense
and seeing things.

218
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,680
No. I saw him even before my accident.

219
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,040
Right. You start to confuse the timeline,
think you saw someone when you didn't,

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
and feel as if you experienced something
that you never did. That happens.

221
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,840
You just need to get a lot of sleep
and rest. Doctor's order. Okay?

222
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,600
That's easy for you to say.

223
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
You think this is some flu?

224
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
Accepting your condition
is the first step in any treatment plan.

225
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,800
Once you give in and think
what I'm telling you is true,

226
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,920
you will be able to relax,

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,960
and the world will start to look
like a beautiful place.

228
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,720
It has nothing to do with my accident.
That wasn't the first time I saw him.

229
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,600
When did you see him first then?

230
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,600
You look like a smart guy.
What's wrong with you?

231
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,960
How is it possible that no one saw a guy
with a helmet in a sauna?

232
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Doesn't it sound odd to you?

233
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,200
Exactly!

234
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,960
I often go to saunas myself, so I know
it's so easy to fall asleep there!

235
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,360
Then are you saying that was a dream too?

236
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Yes!

237
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
What about the wound?
He beat me up pretty hard.

238
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,280
When people fall off while sleeping,
they easily get hurt. You know?

239
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
Are you getting any sleep?

240
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,520
You need to get a lot of sleep and rest.

241
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,240
All right.
Why don't you go and get some sleep?

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,440
What do you need? Sleeping pills?

243
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,920
(Sleeping pills)

244
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
(Sleeping pills)

245
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Right. That apartment unit
with blue lights was super vivid.

246
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
(Jae Seon)

247
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,320
Hey, what did the people
at the substation say?

248
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,600
Who could have a grudge against that guy?

249
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,240
(Sohyang Police Substation)
Who could have a grudge against that guy?

250
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,320
(Sohyang Police Substation)

251
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Couldn't you tell
O Gyeong Tae was such a saint?
(Sohyang Police Substation)

252
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
Couldn't you tell
O Gyeong Tae was such a saint?

253
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,640
He looks just like me ten years ago.

254
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Did you look into his whereabouts
on the day of the accident?

255
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,400
He came here again. Why?

256
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
Probably because of Jeong Yu Na.

257
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,960
Look.

258
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,640
He called her here
in the middle of the night.

259
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,160
He was never going to give up.

260
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
No.

261
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,760
Do In Beom told me that they found
some activity that proved she was...

262
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,960
Her credit card transaction?

263
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,560
I actually looked into that
before coming here.

264
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
She didn't use the credit card.

265
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,160
Her friend from the bar took
the credit card when she dropped it.

266
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,080
She was cash-strapped, so she used it.

267
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,600
She was going to pay Jeong back.

268
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Then...

269
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,040
The case was closed at Munyang Station.
And Jeong Yu Na is still missing.

270
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,240
Gosh. Where did you go, Jeong Yu Na?

271
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Let's go.

272
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,520
Excuse me.

273
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Who are you?

274
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,600
When did you start the construction?

275
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,360
Gosh, come on. Are you serious?

276
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
Who are you guys now?

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Why are so many people so nosy
about what I do with the house?

278
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Get out.

279
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,560
-Come on.
-Hey. We're not being nosy.

280
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,160
We're cops.
We're on official business here.

281
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,040
Was this guy being nosy then?

282
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,480
-Yes. He was looking for something.
-He was looking for something? What?

283
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,520
I don't know.
He said something about a doll. Jeez.

284
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,800
What?

285
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Sir, did you throw out
all the stuff that was in this unit?

286
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,960
I threw them out long ago.
You came too late.

287
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,520
I definitely saw tangled hair
that was covered in blood.

288
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
Gosh.

289
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,960
These are all bloodstains, aren't they?

290
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,360
You... You're... You jerk!

291
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,200
(That can't be. That wasn't a dream?)

292
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,760
The apartment unit
where O Gyeong Tae saw bloodstains

293
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,320
could be the crime scene. But
they're already done with remodeling it.

294
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,200
O Gyeong Tae must have found a clue
about Jeong Yu Na before the incident.

295
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,520
And what if there are people
who need to cover up whatever he found?

296
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,640
They would've done something to him.

297
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
Wait. Then what about Do In Beom?

298
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,640
He already beat O Gyeong Tae up before.

299
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,040
Gosh. I know.
But that's all circumstantial.

300
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,960
True.

301
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,200
Should we look for Jeong Yu Na first?

302
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,599
Darn it. O Gyeong Tae.

303
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,480
He's going to make me
look for Jeong Yu Na.

304
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,119
Jeez. My head hurts.

305
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,440
Really?
I told you to go get that checked out.

306
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,920
Hey, I'm done for the day.

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,640
Meet with the security guard.

308
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,800
And get the security footage from the day
when she stopped using her phone

309
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,119
until she was reported missing.

310
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
-Okay. You just take care of yourself.
-Gosh.

311
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,960

I don't have to

476
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,880
find my mom.

477
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,040
So you can now

478
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,680
stop looking for my mom.

479
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,880
Ma'am, you'll get rid of
this water tank too, right?

480
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,840
Yes, I should.

481
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
-Okay.
-Goodness.

482
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,280
One, two.

483
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,720
Hang on. Put it down for a second.

484
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,040
What's this?

485
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,320
Hey, Jae Seon.

486
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,200
(Hey, Su Yeol. I just heard from NFS
with the results.)

487
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,280
(It is Jeong Yu Na.)

488
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,320
(And I've put out an APB
on those foreigners. I'll rush back now.)

489
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,080
(Okay, all right.)

490
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,560
So you were right, after all.

491
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,120
-Hey.
-Yes?

492
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
How would you define life?

493
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,040
-Not sure.
-When I make pizza, I think that life is

494
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,840
a lot like pizza toppings.

495
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,880
You're my dough,

496
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,960
-and I'm your pizza toppings.
-My gosh.

497
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,920
-I'm the cheese on your pizza.
-Hey!

498
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,240
I'll melt your heart!

499
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,120
Gosh, hey. I'll tell you
what you can call me from now on.

500
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,720
Repeat after me. "Babe."

501
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
-Babe...
-Come on, say it!

502
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,120
-My gosh, I love your outfit today.
-Come on. Say it. "Babe."

503
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,760
Gosh, I can't say it.

504
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,560
-Babe. I mean, the police, right?
-My gosh.

505
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
I'm calling to report trespassing.

506
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,080
-Who's that guy?
-This guy is my little brother.

507
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,760
Brother, shouldn't you be at work now?
What are you doing here?

508
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,240
The address is 110 Lexi Apartments
in Munmi-dong. The unit number is 1523.

509
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,400
Get out now. I mean, please leave.
Babe, get out.

510
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Why do you keep saying 13?
It's 23. Unit 1523.

511
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,600
No, 34! Get it right. It's 34!

512
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,920
-Get out.
-Are you deaf?

513
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,440
Hey, are you not going to leave?

514
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm not in a good mood.
Leave when I'm asking nicely.

515
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,680
Put out the candles, will you?

516
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,640
I didn't even know that they were lit.

517
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,600
Oh, that lady said she was hungry,
so I ordered some jokbal.

518
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,200
Jokbal, my foot.

519
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
-It's 35,000 won, right?
-Yes, here you go.

520
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,320
-Enjoy.
-Thank you. Drive safely.

521
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,160
(But it was raining so hard.)

522
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,080
That moment,
I saw a handsome guy on his motorcycle.

523
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,800
Hey, Jae Seon.

524
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,240
You have that student's number, right?
Gyeong Tae's witness.

525
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,200
(The Delivery Crew)

526
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,280
(The Delivery Crew)

527
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Hang on.

528
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,960
(See? I told you. He's a total nutcase.)

529
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,240
Hey. Can't you tell
that jerk is a total attention-seeker

530
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,120
who wants to be a hero?

531
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,600
Jeong Yu Na's credit card was used
yesterday.

532
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,560
Do you believe me now?

533
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,440
This scumbag...

534
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,360
I knew it! It can't be a coincidence.

535
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,240
He beat up Gyeong Tae
at Jeong Yu Na's place

536
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,880
with a plan from the get-go.

537
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,080
(He killed her.
But Gyeong Tae kept on digging,)

538
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,800
(so he tried to kill him too.)

539
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,680
I was suspicious of Do In Beom,
but he's a real scumbag.

540
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,080
Go to Munyang Police Agency now.

541
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,360
We'll lock him up if we need to, okay?

542
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,640
(Police)

543
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,639
Well, where do I begin

544
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,280
so I can make sure I don't have to see
your shameless face anymore,

545
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,440
Assistant Inspector Do?

546
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,120
If you've got something to say,
say it and go home.

547
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,120
That's one way of doing it.

548
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,360
Why did you go to O Gyeong Tae's place
last Wednesday night?

549
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,199
What? Were you relieved because
the cameras in the area weren't working?

550
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,440
There are dashcams everywhere, you know.

551
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,760
-What's your problem?
-You stay out of this.

552
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,480
I was wondering what this was about.

553
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,679
I went to see him because I felt bad.

554
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,760
I was thinking
maybe he just wanted to do his best

555
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,480
and that I was too harsh on him.

556
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,280
But back then, I really didn't know
that he was such a scary jerk.

557
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,400
Had I known, I would've caught him
right then and there, no matter what.

558
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,800
What? What are you talking about?

559
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,840
What?

560
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,360
You haven't heard yet?
He killed Jeong Yu Na.

561
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,880
-What?
-Who killed whom?

562
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,120
This morning,

563
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,960
(a knife was found under the water tank
at O Gyeong Tae's place.)

564
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,200
(On the knife, they found his fingerprint
as well as Jeong Yu Na's blood.)

565
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,560
We just got back
from the National Forensic Service.

566
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,800
You scumbag.

567
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
Cut the nonsense.

568
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,160
-Hey, calm down.
-Have you no manners?

569
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
I have no respect for a scumbag like you.
Hey!

570
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,440
You killed Jeong Yu Na.

571
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,560
You killed her.
Then you planted evidence at his place

572
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,280
to frame him, you scumbag!

573
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,960
Calm down! And you, get off of him.

574
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
What?

575
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
They found what?

576
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,880
O Gyeong Tae's print
and Jeong Yu Na's blood? On the knife?

577
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,000
What kind of idiot
would hide such evidence at his place?

578
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,760
My point, exactly.
But such an idiot actually exists.

579
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,560
And that idiot tried to kill himself
because he was scared.

580
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,240
-You scumbag!
-Hey, let go!

581
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,640
-Hey!
-I will kill that jerk today and quit.

582
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,840
-Hey!
-Hey, you!

583
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,200
-You're dead meat.
-Bring it on.

584
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,040
-Hey.
-You little...

585
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,640
-Hey!
-Break it up!

(Kind Munyang Police,
Always There for the Citizens)

587
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,680
I don't even get angry anymore.

588
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,880
Trust me. It's not O Gyeong Tae.

589
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,840
They found Jeong Yu Na's blood
and his fingerprint on the knife.

590
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,480
What's your problem? You're the only one
who believes that it wasn't him.

591
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
It was Do In Beom. I'm sure of it.

592
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,360
He killed Jeong Yu Na
and even tried to kill Gyeong Tae.

593
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,960
Listen, I know that you're being like this
because of Assemblyman Do.

594
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,160
He wouldn't want to have anything to do
with a murderer.

595
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,480
You know me. Obviously,
I've already thought this through.

596
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,520
We can clean up the mess
before Assemblyman Do is affected by...

597
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,560
She's estimated to have been killed
on the 25th of last month,

598
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
right?

Yes.

600
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,720
Assemblyman Do called earlier.

601
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,680
He said he was with Do In Beom that day.

602
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
What?

603
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,240
Assemblyman Do said that? Why is he lying?

604
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,520
Clearly, it's not a lie!

605
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,360
What?

606
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,920
Will you go fight with him
and insist that he's lying?

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,560
(The late Jeong Yu Na)

630

corruption when he was a prosecutor)
(The late Jeong Yu Na)

631
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,120
(The fact that he exposed the police
corruption when he was a prosecutor)

632
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,240
(-and his slogan for clean politics)
-Jeez.

633
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,280
(have won over the public.)

634
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,240
(On top of this,
his image as an approachable candidate)

635
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,320
(seemed to have helped win over the people
who are not interested in politics.)

636
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,000
(Clean and just politics!)

637
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,880
(We shall make it happen again!)

638
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,520
(Candidate Do's Ratings Doubles)
(We shall make it happen again!)

639
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,080
(Candidate Do's Ratings Doubles)

640
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,840
(Candidate Do's Ratings Doubles)

641
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,400
(-Number Two Do Yu Gon!

643
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,760
(-Vote for Do Yu Gon!
-Vote for Do Yu Gon!)

644
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,120
What's that? You keep fidgeting with that.

645
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,000
She's got dexterous hands.

646
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,160
My kids can't make anything
with their hands.

647
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
Su Yeol.

648
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,160
I know I shouldn't have lost
my temper that day.

649
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,640
I know I shouldn't have...

650
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
But...

651
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,080
If we stop here,
that will make us scumbags.

652
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,520
Right?

653
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
(From the 11th Graduating Class
of Munyang High School)

654
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,640
(Congratulations on your promotion.
From Style)

655
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,960
(Captain Ryu Su Yeol)

656
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,320
Hello, sir.

657
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,640
Good for him and his promotion.

658
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,000
Hey, Jae Seon.

659
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,920
Why aren't you pestering me
to treat you to a meal?

660
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
I have to go home early
to look after the kids.

661
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,600
Should I buy meat and come over today?
It's been a while.

662
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,320
I can take all of us out to...

663
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,960
There's a fly here.

664
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,880
No. Nothing to see here.

665
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,720
(Captain Ryu Su Yeol)

666
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,480
(Captain Ryu Su Yeol)

667
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,600
You did it.

668
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,040
That's why you were waiting out here?
At this hour?

669
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,440
Let's talk.

670
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,680
Come on. Don't slam the door.
My car isn't in...

671
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,560
So you had O Gyeong Tae's case.

672
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,640
How did you know that?

673
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,560
Why did O Gyeong Tae kill Jeong Yu Na?

674
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,200
-What?
-I looked into it.

675
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,560
They didn't have any connections
until she was reported missing.

676
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,400
Are you sure
O Gyeong Tae killed Jeong Yu Na?

677
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,080
Isn't it odd?

678
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,560
We have the evidence. The knife.

679
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,880
They found the knife at his house.

680
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,240
That's definitive proof. Isn't it?

681
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
You didn't even figure out his motive.

682
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,880
Someone could have framed him.

683
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,560
So what? What's your point?

684
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,360
Jeong Yu Na.

685
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,640
She was Min Su's confidential informant.

686
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,560
(Tak Min Su)

687
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,920
What?

688
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,240
It's been a while, Jeong Hyeon Su.

689
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,560
You know something about Min Su,
don't you?

690
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,880
Isn't that why you've been hiding?

691
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,240
So this is the place?

692
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,920
Min Su got you to make a spy cam
and deliver it here.

693
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,040
Yes. I put it in a necklace.

694
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,160
But the problem is the woman
from this apartment died.

695
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,400
What? She's dead?

696
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,240
Min Su died
when he was going after someone.

697
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,440
And Min Su's informant,
Jeong Yu Na, died too.

698
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,200
This

699
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,280
might not be a simple murder case.

700
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,760
Have you seen a necklace like this?

701
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,240
Come on. Take a look at it again. Please.

702
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,720
Jeong Yu Na had this.

703
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,920
There's a camera inside.
I have to find this first.

704
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,840
I've never seen a necklace like that.
And that's not my case anymore.

705
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,600
So stop pestering me. Go to the Violent
Crimes Unit at Munyang Station.

706
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,840
-Get out.
-Su Yeol.

707
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,280
Get out of my car now. Come on.

708
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,880
Darn it.

709
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,080
Hey! Come on. The door!

710
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,000
Fine! I will do it then!

711
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,440
(Gate 3)

712
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,640
(Exit, Parking)

713
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,720
Gosh. Come on.
You've got to be kidding me.

714
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,640
(Hello. This is the maintenance office.)

715
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,240
Hello. The elevator stopped.

716
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,280
I'm in elevator three.

717
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:30,800
I'm stuck
between the 13th and 14th floors.

718
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,040
(Under Maintenance)
I'm stuck
between the 13th and 14th floors.

719
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,160
Please hurry.

I'm stuck
between the 13th and 14th floors.

720
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,840
Please hurry.

721
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,880
Are you sure
O Gyeong Tae killed Jeong Yu Na?

722
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,360
You didn't even figure out his motive.

723
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,720
(Someone could have framed him.)

724
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,920
Not again. Come on. Don't do this.

725
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,440
Hey.

726
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,440
Hello? Sir?

727
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,720
(Elevator Three)

728
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,720
Hey. Hello?
(Elevator Three)

729
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,080
Hey. Hello?

730
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,880
Come on! Answer me!

731
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,200
Let me see.

732
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,440
My phone isn't working.
This is driving me crazy.

733
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,400
Hey! Please!

734
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,680
Hey! Help me!

735
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,320
Sir, what took you so long?

736
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,640
Please help me.

737
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,600
Peekaboo.

738
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,400
-Are you that happy to see me?
-You jerk.

739
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,400
Hey! We could've fallen. Why did you jump?

740
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,720
-Don't come near me.
-Didn't you miss me? I missed you so much!

741
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,040
You crazy jerk. Get away from me.

742
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,840
What? What's going on?

743
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,520
What is this? What are you going to do?

744
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,720
Stop that! You lunatic! Stop!

745
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,200
Stop jumping!

746
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,120
You crazy jerk. Stop!

747
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,360
-Let's go!
-Stop that!

748
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,160
Stop that.

749
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,200
Stop!

750
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,360
You psycho!

751
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,680
What's going on?

752
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,080
You... What are you doing?

753
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,960
-Bless you.
-No. Don't do it!

754
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,920
Stop!

755
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,720
I told you to stop that, you jerk!

756
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,720
What...

757
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,200
(You are in Basement Level 1.)

758
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,040
Stop that!
(You are in Basement Level 1.)

759
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
Where am I? Why...

760
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,920
Not the stairs! Stay on the flat surface!

761
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,840
No, not the stairs.

762
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,920
Move!

763
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,280
Get out of our way.

764
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Gosh.

765
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,560
What the...

766
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,480
You psycho.

767
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,880
Hey, I'm about to fall off. Hey, no!

768
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,040
Darn it. You lunatic!

769
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,160
Stop!

770
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,960
Watch out!

771
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,360
What? You stopped?

772
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,800
Why? Hey, this is scaring me even more.
Why did you stop?

773
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,880
Hey, how do I unfasten this?

774
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,000
Hey. You psycho...

775
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,480
What's your deal?

776
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,880
You were driving like a total lunatic.
Why stop now...

777
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,800
Hey!

778
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,800
Be gentle, will you?
That thing costs more than your life.

779
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,560
I've always known this about you,

780
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,920
but you're so brave, Boss.

781
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,240
What? You think it's because I'm drunk?

782
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,240
By the way,
your Korean has improved so much.

783
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,760
Staying here makes me anxious.

784
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,680
You said that the cop gave you money
for us to flee the country.

785
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,600
I'm afraid the other cops
would raid this place again.

786
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,200
Hey, was I supposed to say no
when he was offering money?

787
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,480
We need to get rid of the things here
before we flee.

788
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,880
Still, if they find out
that we're still here,

789
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,880
they'll all raid us!

790
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,520
Hey, no one would even think

791
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,800
that we'd come back here.
Think about it, you idiot.

792
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,320
SU JAN.

793
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,920
Just go upstairs and keep an eye on them.
Make sure they don't slack off.

794
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,000
Okay.

795
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,920
Hurry up, SU JAN.

796
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Who are you?

797
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,960
Hey, what are you doing?

798
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,240
The chicken is already here?

799
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,720
No, I'm not...

800
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,880
Tell him he'd better tell the truth
if he wants to live.

801
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,800
-What?
-Is it the fried chicken?

802
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,280
-No, I'm not...
-And tell him

803
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,120
he'll get punched
every time he talks nonsense.

804
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,840
You punk, who are you...

805
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,960
Boys! This guy punched me!

806
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,200
Hey, why are there so many of you?

807
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,480
Hey, why...

808
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,440
-Where did they all come from?
-One, two, three, four...

809
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,720
Get him!

810
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,520
Hey!

811
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,600
Have you seen a necklace like this?

812
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,320
Jeong Yu Na had this.
There's a camera inside.

813
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,200
(I have to find this first.)

814
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,840
Gosh, fine.
It's not like I've never done this before.

815
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,120
You little...

816
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,720
Oh, my. This feels nice.

817
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,400
What's he doing?

818
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,080
-No!
-Please, no!

819
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,640
I'm not doing it, you idiots!

820
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,880
Hey! Get him.

821
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,800
Get him!

822
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,800
Catch him!

823
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,120
Hey, boys!

824
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,520
SU JAN!

825
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
Hey, pig. Get down.

826
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,120
Sorry sir, getting down!

827
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,480
-My apologies.
-Good!

828
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,200
One.

829
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,200
(-All right.
-Two!)

830
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,600
(I'm sorry. We'll leave.
We'll leave right away.)

831
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
(We really will.)

832
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,400
(I told you not to use your phone
when I'm here.)

833
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,680
(Who knows? Maybe you're taking)

834
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,240
(photos of me to blackmail me later on.)

835
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,240
(Hey, are you dead?)

836
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,200
(Listen up, even if you're dead.)

837
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,960
You brought this upon yourself.

838
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,760
You got that?

839
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,360
You deserved to die!

840
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,960
Why did you have to die? Why drop dead?

841
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,680
(Assemblyman Do called earlier.)

842
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,080
He said he was with Do In Beom that day.

843
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,080
Will you go fight with him

844
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,320
(and insist that he's lying?)

845
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,840
You punk! Hey!

846
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,680
That little...

847
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,880
Hey, stop!

848
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,840
You psycho! You piece of...

849
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,840
No! Stop!

850
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,840
Hey! What are you doing? What the...

851
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,960
Hey, stop!

852
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,600
You crazy jerk!

853
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,800
This is attempted murder!

854
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,640
Will this end with Min Su?

855
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,200
Didn't you see this coming
when you fled on your own?

856
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,480
Anyway... What's this?

857
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,360
Give me the necklace.

858
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,360
You have no idea what that is.

859
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,120
Who are you?

860
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,920
Who the heck are you?

861
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,600
Who are you
and why are you doing this to me?

862
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,840
Me?

863
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Hero.

864
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,520
What?

865
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,240
To punish those trash-like rotten punks.

866
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,360
The last of this era!

867
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,920
The hero.

868
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,120
You're one crazy idiot, aren't you?

869
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,160
You...
You still don't get who I am, do you?

870
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,560
Watch closely from now on.

871
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,400
About who I am.

872
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,120
Hey!

873
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
What?

874
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,320
What is this?

875
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,240
(Assemblyman Do Yu Gon
has been re-elected.)

(Munyang Police Agency)
(after exposing
the corruption in the prosecution...)

884
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,920
Hey.

885
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,080
Come on in, Senior Inspector Ryu.

886
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,400
He's Superintendent Ryu now.

887
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,800
Oh, that's right. Superintendent Ryu.

888
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,760
-Hello, sir.
-Things are happening for you, it seems.

889
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,560
My gosh, thank you. I'll work harder.

890
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,080
Oh, there he is.

891
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,480
It's been a while, Superintendent Ryu.

892
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
Hello, sir.

893
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,600
There are many competent officers
in Munyang.

894
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,160
It's all thanks to you,
our competent commissioner.

895
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,120
My gosh, thank you. I'm flattered.

896
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,080
Superintendent Ryu.
This is just between us,

897
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,800
but your promotion wouldn't have happened

898
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,720
without Assemblyman Do's help.

899
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
Right.

900
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,640
Ryu Su Yeol. Are you nervous?

901
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,640
What are you waiting for?
You should thank him.

902
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,800
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't mention it.

903
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,800
Assemblyman Do would like to have a meal
with all of us.

904
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,440
What do you say? Are you busy today?

905
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,520
No, of course not. I made sure
to leave my schedule wide open.

906
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,800
Good, that's great.

907
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,720
There's a good Chinese restaurant
across the street. Let's go there.

908
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,440
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

909
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,560
Shoot.

Are you all right?

912
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,280
Yes. I'll use the restroom
and meet you there, sir.

913
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,000
All right. Let's go.

914
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,720
Darn it.

915
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,960
Get it together, Ryu Su Yeol.

916
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,680
Do better.

917
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,720
Do better? On what?

918
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,880
I watched the clip on the flash drive.

919
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,680
That punk...

920
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,840
What?

921
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,680
Where is he?

922
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,440
Where did he go?

923
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,440
Hey.

924
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,320
That little...

(Stairs)

926
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,320
That jerk...

927
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,680
Hey! Darn you!

928
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,760
What? Where's he going?

929
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,320
Hey! You!

930
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,320
Hey! Stop!

No...

933

No, don't.

934
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,720
No!

935

(who I am?)

938
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,480

-That punk.
-Hey, Ryu Su Yeol! Get him!

942
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,760
What the heck did you do to me?

943
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,120
-Get him!
-Darn it.

944
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,360
(This wouldn't have happened
had you told me what was going on.)

945
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,320
You'll die at this rate.

946
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,880
-Hey!
(-I told you it wasn't a dream.)

947
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,800
-He's not real!
-He's not real!

948
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,960
No...

949
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,440
