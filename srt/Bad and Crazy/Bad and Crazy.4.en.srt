Should we report this?
(Emergency)

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,920
What? Will you tell the higher-ups
that we let a murder suspect get away?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The Anti-Corruption Unit
just caught the guy

52

53

What?

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,839
They'll keep investigating it
and get to the bottom of this.

55
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,160
If they hear Gyeong Tae is gone...

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,240
Darn it. Why now of all times?

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,800
Keep your mouths shut
and go find O Gyeong Tae. Now!

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,960
-Got it.
-Yes, sir!

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920

-Did you kill her?

62
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
Answer me. Tell me the truth!

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,840
It was you. You killed her, didn't you?

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,720
No, it wasn't me.

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I said, no. It wasn't me.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,960
Do Yu Gon did it.

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
What?

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,880
He used both of us
so he can get away with the murder.

69
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,960
Do you seriously think I'd believe you?

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,040

-Here.

75

-Thank you.
-No problem.

76
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,280
Take care.

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
Just hand over the voice recorder.

78

who took care of the body?)

Does it not make you angry
that he called me a murderer?

I can reach out to for help.

so that I can catch the real culprit.

99
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,159
You should get going.

100
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,600
It's okay, sir.
I'll see you off before I leave.

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,400
That's not necessary.

102
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
Isn't O Gyeong Tae waiting for you?

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,120
(I heard he disappeared from the hospital,
so I thought he dropped dead somewhere.)

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,360
We took care of Do In Beom,
all nice and clean.

Bye, then.

But you're not done yet.

111
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,880
We went through
Do In Beom's dashcam footage.

112
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,840
He handed a voice recorder over
to some guy.

113

It can't run on water, you know?

120
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
Find him now.
I'll give you as much fuel as you want,

121
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,200
so bring that punk to me at once.

Thank you.

135

I know you're busy. Why are you here?

136
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,960
It's about Min Su.

137

Do Yu Gon.

141
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,880
What?

142
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
So you didn't know either.

143
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,520
Because he was up against
someone so powerful,

144
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,800
it looks like Min Su made his moves
very cautiously.

145
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,560
Anyway, shortly after Min Su's death,

146
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,160
his informant also died.

147
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,800
His informant died? Are you sure?
Who did it?

148
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,840
Circumstances point to Do Yu Gon.

149

It may not have been a coincidence.

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
You'll find it hard to believe,
but Jeong Yu Na was killed

168
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,440
by Do Yu Gon.

169
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
You knew?

170
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,160
It doesn't matter

171
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,600
because there's nothing we can do.

172
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,480
No evidence or witness. We have nothing.

173
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,440
I have the recording that Do In Beom had.

174
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,440
In the recording, does Do Yu Gon say
that he killed Jeong Yu Na

175
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,200
and admits that he is the culprit?

176
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,880
No, but...

177
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
It's all just circumstantial.

178
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,560
We have nothing

179
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,160
to prove that
he is indeed guilty of the murder.

180
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,960
Do In Beom,
who was the only witness we had,

181
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,720
is now dead too.

182
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
Do In Beom is dead?

183
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,520
In this situation, it'll be hard for you

184
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,800
to prove your innocence
no matter what you do.

185
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,560
And as you know,

186
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,760
we can't even ask for backup.

187
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,640
I must've put you in a bind.

188
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,680
Thank you for helping me.

189
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
And I'm sorry.

190
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
You were the only person I could think of.

191
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
Why are you thanking me?

192
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
You're the one
who's being falsely accused of murder.

193
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,800
Why worry about me?

194
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,720
They're accusing someone like you
of murder. Aren't you angry?

195
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,440
Don't be so naive!

196
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
You're sorry?

198
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,360
Right.

199
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
The powerless must apologize
and beg on their knees.

200
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
(If you indeed caught a shark,)

201
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,760
it will bite the bait
and sink the boat you're on.

202
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Don't you know that?

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,040
(Staying on a boat with a hole
will only cost you your life.)

204
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,640
What about the boat you're on? Is it safe?

205
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,560
You mean,
I have to leave the police force?

206
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,440
Then what?
Were you planning to stay there?

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,720
A big company... That'd be great.
Thank you.

208
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
Thank you, sir.

209
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,640
Hello. It's me,

210
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,480
Mr. Assemblyman.

211
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
You woke up.

212
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
That's too bad.

213
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,600
Who are you?

214
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
Senior Inspector Ryu.

215
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Don't tell me...

216
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
No, right?

217
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
That can't be.

218
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
You...

219
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,640
How could you do this to me?

220
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,640
No one will come here
until the crack of dawn, sir.

221
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,840
Until the crack of dawn...

222
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Then we don't have much time.

223
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
Wait outside.

224
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,280
Mr. O Gyeong Tae.

225
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,800
We finally meet.

226
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,599
My, they say that people
who are destined to meet will do so.

227
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
Have a seat. Let's talk.

228
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,440
Sit down.

229
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,240
Sit down.

230
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Sit down!

231
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
Good. Much better.

232
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
Let me ask you something.

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Mr. O, why are you doing this to me?

234
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,000
Why do you have to

235
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,880
stress me out like this?

236
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,080
Jeong Yu Na.

237
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,560
You killed her, didn't you?

238
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Mr. O, are you still

239
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,080
curious about that?

240
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
-No, I did not.
-What?

241
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I did not kill her.

242
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
That woman...

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,680
I don't know her at all.

244
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,800
-But you said yourself that--
-Right.

245
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Did you hear me say
that I killed that woman?

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,520
No, right?

247
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
You have nothing.

248
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,400
Otherwise, you would've gone
to the police right away.

249
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,280
Am I wrong?

250
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,880
Let go!

251
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
This is the voice recorder, sir.

252
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Hey.

253
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,800
Do you think I tracked you down
because I was scared of this?

254
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,160
You really don't want to give up, do you?

255
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,960
That's why I tracked you down.

256
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,000
Because you seemed to have
no interest in giving up whatsoever.

257
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,200
I figured you could use my help.

258
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,200
Superintendent Ryu, see that over there?
Pull one out.

259
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
What are you waiting for?

260
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,520
We don't have time.

261
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,600
Stay still, you punk.

262
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,400
Thanks.

263
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,080
All right. Let's hurry
so we can make it to the 18th hole.

264
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,040
First, here's my tee shot!

265
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,640
Don't move! Why would you move?

266
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
Stay still. Get ready for my driver shot.

267
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,160
All right. I told you to stay still.

268
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,360
Why must you keep moving
when I clearly told you to stay still?

269
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
-Is it working?
-Yes, all looks good.

270
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,240
Great.

271
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
Hey, this is not a good idea.
It's too dangerous.

272
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,600
We have no idea what that scumbag will do.

273
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160
Officer O, are you really sure about this?

274
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm the one who started this,
so I should get it all sorted out.

275
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,960
Why won't you listen to me?

276
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
How dare a mere police officer
try to get smart with me?

277
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,240
-You little piece of...
-No, please!

278
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
What are you doing?

279
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,920
Let go!

280
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,880
How dare you try to stop me, you punk!

281
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,640
If you hit him more with this, he'll die.

282
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,120
What?

283
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,320
Darn, you clever punk.

284
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
Okay, you stay out of this!

285
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,320
I shouldn't kill him. If he dies,

286
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,000
things will get very complicated.

287
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
What are you doing?

288
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
I will...

289
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,320
I will take you down at all costs.

290
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
-What?
-I will uncover the truth.

291
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,760
I will fight to the end...

292
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,920
Okay, fine.

293
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,120
We shall take this to the end today.

294
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,400
All the way to the end!

295
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,760
Let's do it!

296
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,160
-Darn it. I'm moving in.
-Hey! No.

297
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,320
Why not? He'll kill that kid at this rate.

298
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,560
If we move in now,

299
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,400
Do Yu Gon will only be charged
with assaulting Officer O.

300
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,280
Let's do that!

301
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,720
Even if I die,

302
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,960
the truth will come out in the end.

303
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
That you were the one
who killed Jeong Yu Na.

304
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
The fact that you're a murderer...

305
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
Darn you.

306
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,240
Enough! Shut it!

307
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,080
That's enough! Stop!

308
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
I have no idea

309
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,400
why I killed that woman!

310
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm sure I killed her
because she deserved to die, right?

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,320
Why would I kill her for no reason?

312
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
Why don't you go ask her?
You stubborn jerk!

313
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,920
Hey.

314
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll kill you today
so you can go ask her yourself.

315
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,560
You're finished, you scumbag!

316
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,440
What the heck? Are you out of your mind?

317
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,200
Hey, Officer O.

318
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,040
Are you all right?

319
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,600
(Customer Support Center)

320
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,760
Officer O.

321
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,120
What are you waiting for? Kill them both!

322
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
Hey, you jerks!

323
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,080
Anyone who comes at us
will be arrested red-handed.

324
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
And just so you know,
I'm very hot-tempered.

325
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,960
And I'm worse than this guy!

326
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,160
Darn it.

327
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,320
-That lunatic.
-Darn it.

328
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,240
-Officer O.
-Just go.

329
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Go...

330
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,400
And catch Do Yu Gon.

331
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,200
-No matter what.
-Officer O.

332
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,280
I promise you
that I will catch that scumbag.

333
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,600
Do Yu Gon!

334
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
Darn it.

335
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,520
Do Yu Gon!

Do Yu Gon!

337
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,480
What? You came alone?

338
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,120
Hey, I heard you were a good fighter.

339
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
Show me.

340
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,360
Darn it.

341
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
What? I can't believe
you got punched right off the bat.

342
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,760
Aren't you a good fighter? Was it a lie?

343
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,240
Darn it.

344
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,880
(Bring it on.)

345
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Yes!

346
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,720
That's it! Kill him!

347
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,800
Kill him!

348
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Yes, that's it!

349
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,200

350
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,200

355
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,600

but I'm too busy at the moment.

356

Let's not forget each other though.

357
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Shoot.

361
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
I'll take it from here.

362
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,320
I need to get back at him
for what he did to me.

Yes, Do Yu Gon.

Don't do anything you'll regret later.

-Shut it!

374

Wait! Hold on, Superintendent Ryu.
Hang on, okay?

375
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,560
You know, the one who threw a kick at you
in front of the police agency building.

376
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,200
That really wasn't me.

377
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,520
What?

378
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,840

379

-Hey, let go!
-Come on!

380
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,400
Be gentle, will you? Darn it.

381
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,080
-Get in.
-Let go!

382
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,160
-Get in.
-Get in the car, you jerk.

383

and secure solid evidence.

-Yes, he'll be all right.

387

By the way, don't you think
he's changed a little?

469

Jeez, will you stop talking about that?

470
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,000
Getting your sister's life insurance
payout is nothing to brag about, so stop.

471
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,159
Mr. Jeong, are you sure
you can do a good job raising your niece?

472
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,960
If you're not sure,
I suggest you look for an alternative.

-Put her up for adoption or send her to--
-No, no way.

475
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,280
Of course, it won't be enough.

476
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,120
But why should she be raised by a stranger
when she has an uncle?

477
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,560
Her so-called uncle keeps going on
about the insurance payout. That's why.

478
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,560
I think you got the wrong idea.

479
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,440
My sister always told me

480
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,320
that I should make sure
to get the insurance payout

481

if anything happened to her.

482
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,640
She asked me to do a good job
raising In Seon with that money.

483
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,200
I will keep that promise.

484
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,440
I will do a great job

485
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,600
raising In Seon.

those ugly toys now.)

By the way, why didn't you tell me
about the talent show?

501
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,240
I bet you thought I'd never find out.

Grandma told me all about it.

503

I promise you that I'll be there tomorrow.

504

You'll do an amazing job,
so I have to be there to see it.

Good luck, In Seon!

-This is embarrassing.

-Here, sir.
-Darn it, I missed the party.

528

Did you have to arrive
while I was taking a dump?

529
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,160

How about a beef barbecue tonight?

Hey, kiddo.
You'd better not bail on us today.

The cartel's influence in our district

has grown rapidly
in the past couple of years.

546
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,600
But they're still a new player
in the industry,

547
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,720
so we don't know much about them at all.

548

their distribution channels first,

Sorry to interrupt.

Sim Sang Ho handled low-quality drugs.

Do you really think he had a connection
with that drug ring?

No. Do Yu Gon

570
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,400
is not willing to cooperate at all.

We just did our job, you know.

572

No, that's it.
I don't have anything else to say.

You sure are brimming with potential.

You're writing a new page
in the history of Munyang.

I didn't even do much.

579
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,160
I owe it all to you and the Commissioner,

580
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,000
who threw me into the fiery pit

581
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,160
all by myself. Without you two,
this wouldn't have been possible.

582
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,880
Of course. The Ryu Su Yeol I know
is always so sarcastic.

583
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,680
But today, it's cute.

584
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,200

-He's smiling from ear to ear right now.
-Okay, all right.

586
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,200

for this Friday evening.

Well, what's going on
with the prosecution's investigation?

590
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,760
I think Do Yu Gon is out to get me.

591
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,480
Right, I was actually
going to ask you about that.

592
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,440
What?

593
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,320
You haven't looked into it yet?

594
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,000
You have connections in the prosecution.

595
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,480
I heard they dropped the investigation.

596
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,240
-What?
-You didn't know?

597
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,440
No.

598
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,800
I was impressed that

599
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,160
you managed to get out of it
in the midst of everything going on.

600
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,000
-You didn't persuade them to drop it?
-No.

601
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,080
-What?
-What?

602
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,120
Like you said yourself,
a probie like me has no choice

603
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,400
but to obey and investigate the cases
that are sent my way.

604
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,080
Don't get me wrong though.
It's not like we targeted you.

605
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,880
We strictly followed the protocol
and investigated fairly...

606
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,560
My phone's ringing. Just a moment.

607
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,240
(Hello.)

608
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,280
Hi, Mom. I'm on an important call.

609
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,840
(Yes, my hair?
Yes, I got a haircut. It looks nice.)

Wait, what...
Is he talking to his mom now?

611
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,000
(Okay? Hold on.)

612
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,200
Right, I understand.

613
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,600
I did what?

614
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,200
A donation?

615
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,160
Frankly, I wasn't sure what to do
with your borrowed-name account.

616
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,640
But you donated all the money
in that account to Dream Youth Shelter,

617
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
(so everything's been sorted out.)

618
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,040
I donated my money to a youth shelter?

619
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,880
But why?

620
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,600
Well, that I don't know.

621
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,000
Anyway, I truly admire you.
It mustn't have been an easy decision.

622
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,440
(-How generous.)
-Why would I do that?

623
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,120
(-And what you accomplished--)
-Why would I donate my money? Why?

624

Look, it's not like I'm terminally ill.

652
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,920
Why would a healthy 30-something guy

653
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,720
donate his years' worth of salary

654

for no reason? All of it at once?

I can't even pay my rent this month.

to help the kids with good intentions--

Good intentions, my foot! Sorry.

-But...
-That is not true at all.

You see, it wasn't me.

660
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,520
Some psycho donated my money...

Come out, you jerk.

665
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,440
You'd better come out at once!

666

Fine.

667
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,280
So you won't come out?

668
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,760
Okay. Then we die together today.

We die together.

670
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,400
If I die, you'll die too, right?

671
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,120
I'll count to ten. If you don't come out
until then, I'll actually jump.

Thanks to me, you won't go to jail.
Did you want to thank me?

680
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,720
Look. How rewarding is it?

681
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,200
The future of this country

682
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,120
is even brighter now
thanks to your slush fund.

But why did you pick this shelter
of all places?

684
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Good question.

685
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,400
Why was I drawn to this place?

686
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,800
I wonder why.

687
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,600
I don't know.

00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,600
Hey, why don't I know the reason?

689
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,080
You jerk. Are you kidding me right now?

690
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,440
Shall I really jump?

691
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,880
Should we just die right here and now?

692
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,600
Gosh, you're such a chicken.
Look at you acting all tough.

693

You don't think I can do it?

Do you know what I had to go through
to save up all that money?

696

Do you have any idea?

697
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,080
What did you have to do?

698
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,040
By sucking up to scumbags like Do Yu Gon?

699

You begged that murderer on your knees
to please spare you.

That's how you saved up, little by little.

701

It sure was hard.

702
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,800
You embarrass me.

Do I have to know him?

He was killed

You killed him, didn't you?

What? Your place?

But you bought it under my name,
so it's mine.

No. There are so many bad guys
in this world. You can punish them all!

805
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,600
How can I trust you though?

806
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,480
(If you want to,
you can see everything I'm up to.)

807
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,040
(Everything? All of it?)

808
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,880
(We'll hook up a camera to my watch.)

809
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,440
(You can watch my every move.)

810
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,440
When it comes to stuff like this,
Mr. Jeong here is number one in Korea.

811
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,240
-He's the best.
-I can't give you a discount.

812
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,880
This can record audio too, right?

813
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,880
I even used a NASA-grade camera, okay?

814
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,360
(This is too sudden.)

815
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,880
(Samgyeong Substation)
(This is too sudden.)

816
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,400
I understand that you're flustered,

817
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,960
but we received a tip that
someone's been leaking info on crackdowns.

818
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,600
Please understand. Put it in this bag.

819
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,760
(Police)

820
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,640
Freeze! Hey!

821
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,000
If you get caught texting someone now,

822
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,040
you'll be officially investigated.

823
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,680
(We confiscated all the phones
at Samgyeong Substation.)

824
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Hey, Jae Seon. Yes.

825
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,480
I see.

826
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,160
Oh, just wait here and be on standby?

827
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,640
Sure,
that's what we do all the time anyway.

828
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,480
Okay, I'll wait here.

829
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,760
You idiot,
I'm way more clever than you are.

830
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
Oh, this is nice.

831
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
What's your deal?

832
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,080
What do you think? Here, look.

833
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,320
What? You think you're in trouble
because I'm here

834
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,200
instead of the cops you see all the time?

835
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,320
Go and tell Detective Im
that Superintendent Ryu Su Yeol is here.

836
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,680
Go on. Hurry.

837
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,640
Go!

838
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,880
Jeez, I feel like a peasant
whenever I see stuff like this.

839
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,520
You were investigated
for taking a petty bribe.

840
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,960
When did you become so rich?

841
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,920
This isn't mine. I'm just the manager.

842
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,680
Hey, don't pour me one. I'm on duty now.

843
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,280
It's okay. I haven't seen you in so long.
Let's drink.

844
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,320
Goodness. Look at you crossing the line
now that you've left the force.

845
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
Well...

846
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,000
Bring me the ledger.

847
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,680
Come on. Don't be like that.

848
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,120
Ryu! Come on.

849
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,120
Chief Kim Ji Min
of Samgyeong Substation...

850
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,040
And who else? The guys who took bribes
for giving you a heads-up about the raid.

851
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,520
Just give me two names.

852
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,640
You're right. I failed to take care of
the one whom I really should have. Right?

853
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,960
Ta-da.

854
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,720
You got the wrong idea, man. You know?

855
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,280
I only covered up your investigation

856
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,240
because I knew your situation
and wanted you to get

857
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,000
a nice severance package. That's all.

858
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,960
Did you think I did it
for some chump change?

859
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,560
You're making me feel

860
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,760
so dirty if you thought I would turn
a blind eye to corruption for money!

861
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,800
Fine. That's not enough. Right?

862
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,760
Ta-da.

863
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,440
What?

864
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,800
Hey. What's gotten into you?

865
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,080
Ryu Su Yeol, what are you doing?

866
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,560
Hey. Did I not pay you enough?

867
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,120
Then you should have told me earlier!

868
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,120
For your medical bills.

869
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,600
(Hangukgwan)

870
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,800
Darn it.

871
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,280
I got a call
from Detective Im this morning.

872
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,040
He'd kill me
if I didn't give back the ledger.

873
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,760
I didn't remember seeing any ledger.

874
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,960
But the ledger was right next to me.

875
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,520
This jerk hid a recording device
in my phone.

876
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,720
And he went back there at dawn
and destroyed them!

877
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,840
That jerk...

878
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,560
I get that you must've been shocked.

879
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,760
But you can't come here without
an appointment. I don't do walk-ins.

880
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,640
You're the only person I can vent on.

881
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,760
That nasty jerk.
How dare he stab me in the back?

882
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,880
How dare you!

883
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,080
Mr. Ryu. Let me be honest here.

884
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,880
Why don't you quit your job
and focus on your treatment?

885
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,720
Right. You want me to get treated?

886
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,600
After blowing up my entire savings?

887
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,440
I should treat my mental disorder
and get fired? Is that it?

888
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,040
Fine. I'll go to a psychiatric hospital.
And you'll go to prison.

889
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,880
Is that what you want? Are you kidding me?

890
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,320
You think I'm playing right now?

891
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,480
This is driving me crazy! Come on.
I'm about to lose my...

892
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,080
How are you feeling?

893
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,360
That jerk.

894
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,240
I need to get rid of that jerk.

895
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,240
That's the least
of your problems right now.

896
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,760
At this rate, you'll be dead first.

897
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,280
If he has a hard time finding out
what you've been up to,

898
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,000
it means that your personalities
have become more separated now.

899
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,400
The stronger his personality becomes,

900
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,120
the more ground you will lose.

901
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,080
And this split shift you have...

902
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,040
You think your body can handle it?

903
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,280
Everyone needs to sleep.

904
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,280
It's just an all-nighter.
I just need to rest up a bit.

905
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,040
You'll die without sleep.

906
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,920
Right now, your days are numbered.

907
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,560
Either your personality will disappear...

908
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,400
or you will die due to exhaustion.

909
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,080
Your inner and outer selves
are being destroyed right now.

(Judge Yoon Jin Ho's resume)

911

He's a tough one. You think you're ready?

912
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,440
His son has a business in the States,
so he needs some money.

913
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,600
Yong will handle that.

914
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,080
She knows that
the Narcotics Unit came to see me, right?

915
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
Yes.

916

Call her.

Hey, Yong. It's me.

came to me, right?)

Why are you texting me
when we're on the phone?

Hey. What's gotten into you lately?

01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Not yet.

965
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,200
According to Do Yu Gon,
a drug ring was trying to get rid of him.

966
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,160
The drug ring won't need him anymore.

967
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,240
If we get him to switch sides,

968
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,520
I think he'll testify for us.

969
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,000
So he'll only make a statement
if his safety is guaranteed.

970
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,360
Hold on. We should...

971
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,840
Let's move him
to another detention center.

972
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,400
-I'll put in a transfer tomorrow...
-No.

973
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,160
There's no guarantee
that he'll survive the night here.

974
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,480
Once his safety is guaranteed,

975
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,840
he'll surely find a way to make a living, wasting our time.

976
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,000
Today is our chance.

977
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,120
We should transfer her him ourselves
and get the statement from him.

978
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,520
(I'll get the judge sign off on it.)

979
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,960
(Emergency Transfer)

980
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,320
(Captain, today is our only chance.)

981
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,720
(Ministry of Justice)

982
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,280
(Ministry of Justice)

983
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,560
Do you want it?

984
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,200
Gosh. No. I'm good.

985
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,440
Why not?

986
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,240
You usually hide and eat it in secret.

987
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,960
What? How did you know? Did you see me?

988
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,360
You are my role model.

989
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,560
Gyeong Jun, I see
that your social skills have improved.

990
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,800
Just take it.

991
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,920
I'll only offer it to you.

992
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,520
Thank you.

993
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,280
And relax.

994
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,200
What was that?

995
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:18,000
You can't jump
in front of the bus like that!

996
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,000
(Ministry of Justice)

997
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,279
You startled me.

998
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,720
Why are you stopping? Why?

999
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,960
Hey.

1000
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,920
Mr. Do Yu Gon. Calm down.

1001
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,520
This is nothing. The bus will move soon.

1002
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,399
Nothing? Are you serious?

1003
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,960
You said you would keep me safe!
You promised me that!

1004
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,439
I told you everything!

1005
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,960
Hey.

1006
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,840
Hey.

1007
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:36,520
Get up.

1008
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,120
Get up!

1009
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,319
Who is it?

1010
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,720
Who are you?

1011
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,479
What are you doing? Who are you?

1012
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,200
Who are you?

1013
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,840
You said you'd keep me safe! You lunatics!

1014
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,480
No. Don't come near me!
(Ministry of Justice)

1015
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,480
Hey! I need help!

1016
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,480
(Ministry of Justice)

1017
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,280
(All the officers on the transport team
and Do Yu Gon died.)

1018
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:26,960
(Do Yu Gon, the 21st Assemblyman.
Stabbed to death)

1019
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,560
The only survivor is
(Do Yu Gon, the 21st Assemblyman.
Stabbed to death)

1020
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,440
Inspector Lee Hui Gyeom.

1021
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,920
Was that a coincidence?
Or was that for a reason?

1022
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,120
That's what we need to figure out.

1023
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
She's alive for a reason?

1024
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,160
Who wants this?

1025
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,960
Let headquarters handle it.
She's one of our own.

1026
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,160
Do you want people to say
we go easy on our colleagues?

1027
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,680
Since she's one of our own,
we should help her clear her name.

1028
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,720
If HQ takes over,

1029
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,880
it's obvious they'll do everything to make her resign.

1030
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,920
Do you have proof that she's being framed?

1031
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,240
What?

1032
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,720
Do Yu Gon and Kim Gyeong Jun
had dozens of stab wounds on them.

1033
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,320
But not a cut on Lee Hui Gyeom.

1034
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,120
On top of that, she was the one

1035
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,240
insisted on transporting him on that day and time.

1036
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,640
Is the investigation over?

1037
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,400
We didn't even start.
Why are you already...

1038
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,480
Hey. Be quiet.

1039
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,880
Hui Gyeom is being framed!

1040
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,320
You lunatic!

1041
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,320
You're about to cost me my life too.
You want to save who now?

1042
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,600
Be it her or the world.
You do it yourself!

1043
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,480
What did you say?

1044
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,280
-You jerk.
-You jerk.

1045
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,280
Hey. Are you all right?

1046
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,520
Gosh. She should be worried about herself.
Why worry about us?

1047
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Hui Gyeom.

1048
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,640
I'm all right.

1049
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,840
Ridiculous.

1050
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,440
You think this is "You're My Sunshine!"?
Are you Hwang Jung Min?

1051
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,240
She can't even see us from there,
you dimwit.

1052
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,800
-I'll go.
-Yes. Please!

1053
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,080
When have you ever listened to me?
Just go!

1054
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,360
I'll leave for good.

1055
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,600
If you save her,
I'll leave for good. You jerk!

1056
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,720
You think I'm crazy?
I don't believe a word you say.

1057
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
Heroes

1058
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,560
always keep their promises.

1059
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,680
Hui Gyeom. You can hear me, right?

1060
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,800
-What?
-Don't worry about a thing now.

1061
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,040
I'll save you no matter what.

1062
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,080
(Bad and Crazy)

1063
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,680
You were the one who urged the team
to transport Do Yu Gon that night.

1064
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,560
(This jerk's bracelet seems familiar.)

1065
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,760
(Why are you working so hard on it?)

1066
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,040
Do you still like me?

1067
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,080
Do you like me?

1068
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,440
(Only you and I will go.)

1069
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
-Hey!
(-We'll both die if we mess with)

1070
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,720
(the wrong drug dealers.)

1071
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,760
Starting now,
anyone who deals our stuff is a rat.

1072
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840
Kill them.

1073
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,680
(My gut tells me...)

1074
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,120
-What did you say?
-Watch your mouth!

1075
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,560
(that a certain someone
is in the Narcotics Unit.)
