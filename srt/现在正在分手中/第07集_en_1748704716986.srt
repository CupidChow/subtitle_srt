1
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:12,233
Remember that time, at the ski resort? We made a bet.

2
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,177
Really? Soo Wan did?

3
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:17,378
Yes! They said they'd beat each other going down the slope,

4
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:19,374
but Jae Guk fell big-time.

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,144
Right, I remember now.

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:25,544
Soo Wan took him to the hospital for a small scrape on the knee.

7
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:29,624
Soo Wan adored Jae Guk very much.

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,023
He truly cherished his little brother.

9
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,954
Whenever Jae Guk was visiting, he always waited outside.

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,793
He made sure all the good things went to Jae Guk first.

11
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:41,534
As if he was the only one with a little brother.

12
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:45,933
Right, tell me how you're doing.

13
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:50,403
I heard you told your mother about your girlfriend.

14
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:55,474
Yes.

15
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:57,543
What is she like?

16
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:04,454
She's a nice person. She's someone I care about a lot.

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,694
I'm even more curious now.

18
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,694
What does she do?

19
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:15,034
When are you going to introduce her to your mother?

20
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:23,807
- Cheers, everyone! - Cheers!

21
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:25,748
- Well done! - Great job, everyone!

22
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,013
- Thank you all! - Well done.

23
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,713
(Yoon Soo Wan)

24
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,817
Great job, seriously.

25
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,927
- Hey, good job. - Nice job!

26
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:41,458
Once again, I'd like to thank everyone at Sono...

27
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,193
and Vision PR. Thank you. You're the best.

28
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:45,324
(Yoon Soo Wan)

29
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,574
Yoo Jung, what was that about?

30
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,514
I'm just worried about your mother.

31
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:04,114
A mother can never forget her child.

32
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,813
I understand what you're worried about,

33
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:08,418
but doing this won't change anything.

34
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,283
So don't do this again.

35
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,394
Then why couldn't you say it?

36
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:22,394
You couldn't, in front of your mother.

37
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:27,503
Why?

38
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,403
Why now?

39
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:45,484
(Yoon Soo Wan)

40
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,354
Are you doing well?

41
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,164
I'm sure it was just someone who dialed the wrong number.

42
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:03,843
But was it just a coincidence?

43
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:10,014
A greeting from a time in the past...

44
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,454
that no longer has any warmth or meaning.

45
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,954
(Young Eun, Are you doing well?)

46
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:29,834
Now,

47
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,533
that's all it is.

(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

51
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,323
(Episode 7)

52
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,563
My gosh, I'm so proud.

53
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:01,534
This is so rewarding.

54
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,404
You've only sold 70 pieces.

55
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,703
Don't you think it's too early to be proud?

56
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:08,804
My gosh. I guess you didn't know.

57
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,208
We got so many requests for additional pre-orders.

58
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,873
We've sold 30,000 pieces so far.

59
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:16,344
So I definitely deserve to feel proud.

60
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,914
Let them gloat. It's just jersey.

61
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,614
They're talking as though their entire collection sold out.

62
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:24,753
It could. It's not like it has never happened before.

63
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:27,594
By the way, is it true?

64
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,864
Rumor has it that the factory bribed Ms. Ha.

65
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:33,534
I'm asking because I'm worried. That's all.

66
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,664
That little...

67
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,068
In this industry, people spread all sorts of groundless rumors.

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,474
So of course, this doesn't surprise me.

69
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:42,208
But can't you at least try to be a little more inventive?

70
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,544
I've been hearing the same kinds of rumors for well over ten years.

71
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,678
It's so boring.

72
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,917
She decided to work with the factory that stole her design.

73
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,943
Of course, they made some kind of secret deal.

74
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:57,587
If you focused on improving your designs...

75
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,458
instead of spying on us,

76
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,893
our brand wouldn't be beating your newly launched brand now.

77
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:04,763
It's such a shame.

78
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,237
- You're done, right? - Yes.

79
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,433
Let's go.

80
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:08,833
It is such a shame.

81
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:10,633
I can't believe this.

82
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,734
- Are you happy that you won? - Yes.

83
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,743
What are you going to do about Yoon Jae Guk?

84
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,243
What do you mean?

85
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,018
Hey, why do we love?

86
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,787
To be happy. We do it to live a happy life.

87
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:27,818
So?

88
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,157
But he'll keep reminding you of his brother,

89
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:33,698
and he knows who you dated in the past.

90
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,054
Can the two of you ignore all of it and be happy together?

91
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:38,294
Are you sure?

92
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,433
We need to order more fabric to fill the pre-orders.

93
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,763
- I need you to approve this. - Hey.

94
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,373
The meeting will begin shortly, Director Hwang.

95
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:51,674
Okay.

96
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:02,318
I'm telling you. You could be burned badly.

97
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,453
You'd better heed my advice. Do you understand?

98
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,698
At the meeting, make sure you talk to them...

99
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,998
about sharing links on social media and also about...

100
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,794
the sponsored events with the influencers.

101
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,868
Hey, I'm your boss!

102
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,534
Don't boss me around!

103
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,234
She got me good again.

104
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:49,534
Sorry for asking for a favor like this out of the blue.

105
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:53,034
I wanted to buy the jersey dress for my close acquaintances,

106
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,174
but couldn't find it anywhere.

107
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:59,104
Thankfully, we had a few pieces that we could spare.

108
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,313
Thank you for introducing Sono to your friends.

109
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,383
I heard you and Jae Guk are friends.

110
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:09,724
Jae Guk's family and my family...

111
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:12,654
have been close ever since we were young.

112
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,864
Oh, I see.

113
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,763
Right. Soo Wan, too.

114
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,203
He's Jae Guk's older brother.

115
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,003
He died due to a car accident ten years ago.

116
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:32,404
It was because of the rain.

117
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,044
It was a rainy day.

118
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,813
He left to meet someone,

119
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:42,714
but got into an accident.

120
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:45,823
Why are you...

121
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,393
telling me this?

122
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:52,524
Because he is Jae Guk's brother.

123
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,703
(Yoon Jae Guk)

124
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:14,884
Is she busy?

125
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,213
(Yoon Jae Guk)

126
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,693
So you and Jae Guk. What do you plan to do?

127
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:35,034
That's strange. Is that a difficult question?

128
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,504
Jae Guk couldn't answer either.

129
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,443
His mother knows that he's seeing someone,

130
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,244
and she's very excited for him.

131
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,048
But when we asked him to tell us about her...

132
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,254
and things like her name and what she does for a living,

133
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,823
he went all quiet.

134
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:57,924
Why do you think he couldn't answer?

135
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,034
What are you trying to say?

136
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:04,034
I am asking you if you think your relationship with him...

137
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:05,764
is appropriate.

138
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,514
This is not right.

139
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,648
You know, this outfit in the third episode...

140
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,284
was not appropriate for the location and the scene.

141
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,788
In any case, the number of people who looked up the brand online...

142
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:27,227
went up by 22 percent compared to the previous week,

143
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:29,963
and the jacket in the seventh episode has sold out.

144
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:34,093
The graph on the next page shows the before and after results.

145
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,467
Why don't you explain the rest, Mr. Park?

146
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:42,708
Sure. The brand will be exposed in two more episodes,

147
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,007
in the final week, in the 15th and 16th episodes.

148
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,117
That includes the female lead's social media post.

149
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:49,788
We will proceed as planned.

150
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,083
- That's it. - Yes.

151
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:53,918
That's it?

152
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,424
Is there anything you'd like to add?

153
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,554
No, not really.

154
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,097
Then I believe we've covered everything...

155
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,193
regarding indirect advertising.

156
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:05,894
See you at our next meeting.

157
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:09,394
Thank you.

158
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,634
What's with him?

159
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,353
Why is he so awkward around me?

160
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,853
Is he shy all of a sudden?

161
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,624
Or has he suddenly become timid for some reason?

162
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,294
I'm hurt.

163
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:41,233
Why do you always make assumptions and jump to conclusions about me?

164
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,938
Because I made the wrong assumption?

165
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,804
But still? He doesn't even want to see me because of that?

166
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,374
Why?

167
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:54,813
(Director Hwang Chi Sook)

168
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:57,048
Are you busy?

169
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,448
(Seok Do Hoon)

170
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,544
Yes.

171
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,613
What? That's it?

172
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,028
Could you please arrange everything as soon as possible...

173
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,494
regarding Mr. J using the studio and his staff?

174
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:10,294
Sure.

175
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,038
And please emphasize on the promo materials...

176
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,703
that the contract is exclusively with The One.

177
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,233
Okay.

178
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,048
When can you return the Sono pieces...

179
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,744
that you borrowed from us last month?

180
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:33,483
Now, let's see if you can send a one-word answer to that.

181
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,424
(Seok Do Hoon)

182
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,223
There we go.

183
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,698
Yes, Hwang Chi Sook speaking.

184
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:47,767
Hello, this is Kwak Soo Ho.

185
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,568
About the pieces that you rented to us.

186
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,504
We'll gather them and return everything by the end of the week.

187
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,333
Sure, whatever.

188
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,073
Whatever.

189
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,448
Yes. She distracted me. That's all.

190
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,288
So I wasn't in my right mind for a moment.

191
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,217
I'll go back to being my usual self now.

192
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,853
My sharp-minded, cool-headed, and rational self.

193
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,794
Yes, whatever. Okay!

194
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,433
That being said, how about you go outside and play?

195
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,164
I'm not playing right now.

196
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,203
I have to think about something, so I'm trying to concentrate.

197
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,107
You've got money and fame.

198
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,548
Everything's going great, and so is your love life.

199
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,808
You'll make your mom happy with the news she's been waiting for.

200
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,014
What are you worried about?

201
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,813
It won't make her happy.

202
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,713
Why not?

203
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:42,113
What's with this silence?

204
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,688
Oh, I see. You're afraid your mother wouldn't approve of her...

205
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,254
because Ms. Ha doesn't meet her expectations? Is that it?

206
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,554
Maybe.

207
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:53,097
Hey, Ms. Ha is a great catch.

208
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,438
She's smart, competent, and sensible.

209
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:56,908
Honestly, it's all thanks to her that...

210
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,877
Sono's been the number one brand for the past decade.

211
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,337
That courage and ambition.

212
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:04,548
I'll be honest. An aimless nomad like you...

213
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,644
is no match for her.

214
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,843
My mother won't be able to see any of that.

215
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,044
Okay, but why not?

216
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,424
- Because of my brother. - What? Me?

217
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,223
Hey, what did I do?

218
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,494
No, Soo Wan.

219
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,563
Why are you bringing him up out of the blue?

220
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:29,193
It's her.

221
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,904
The woman Soo Wan wanted to marry ten years ago.

222
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,703
Right, I remember.

223
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,183
What a mess.

224
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,304
Okay.

225
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,208
You can't control your feelings.

226
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,843
It's not something you can stop.

227
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,874
But you see,

228
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,544
I can't support you on this.

229
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:23,654
She and I care for each other.

230
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,693
Must we seek others' permission and support?

231
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,124
Do we really have to?

232
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,924
You were in Paris ten years ago.

233
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,924
I was there, right by Soo Wan's side.

234
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,568
He couldn't even eat or sleep.

235
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,164
And look what happened.

236
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:37,507
That's because he gave up.

237
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,778
No. Because he couldn't think only about himself.

238
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,733
Right. That is precisely why...

239
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,203
I've tried to stay away.

240
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:48,843
That's why I decided to stay in Paris.

241
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,544
Even as a photographer, I never used my real name.

242
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:56,823
I didn't want anyone to be reminded of my existence and bothered by it.

243
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:58,823
Jae Guk.

244
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,394
Do Hoon. From the moment I was born to now,

245
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,034
I never once made a choice solely for myself.

246
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,504
For once,

247
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:14,374
I've made a choice thinking only about myself,

248
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,774
and that's Ha Young Eun.

249
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:21,973
Would you still say no?

250
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,313
What about your mother? What will you say to your mother?

251
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:28,784
I'll tell her the truth.

252
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,483
I'm still debating when to tell her though.

253
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,453
This isn't just about me, you know.

254
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,593
Is Ms. Ha sure about this too?

255
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:41,894
If that's not the case, you can't just go ahead and make it public.

256
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:44,804
It's very likely that she'll have it much harder than you.

257
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,703
You need to think carefully about this. You're in Korea.

258
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,674
(Ha Young Eun)

259
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,483
Who's Shin Yoo Jung?

260
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:04,284
Yoo Jung?

261
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,624
What kind of relationship do you guys have?

262
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:08,723
Why do you ask?

263
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,264
She asked me if I was going to continue seeing you.

264
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,433
Why must I get a question like that from her?

265
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,504
I don't know how close the two of you are,

266
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:24,004
but she asked me whether I thought our relationship was appropriate.

267
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:30,884
She was engaged to Soo Wan.

268
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:33,984
What do you mean...

269
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,294
Wait.

270
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,423
Even when he was in a relationship with me in Paris?

271
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:44,724
Yes.

272
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,563
Even back then, he was engaged.

273
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,363
They had already picked their wedding date.

274
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:01,413
I see.

275
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,383
"I see"?

276
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,554
That's it?

277
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,123
Then what do I say? Should I curse him?

278
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,554
Sure, if you'd like.

279
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,338
Yoon Soo Wan is a total jerk.

280
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,734
I can't believe he two-timed me. Isn't it the worst?

281
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,938
- Agreed. - He stabbed me in the back.

282
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,133
That scumbag.

283
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:29,737
Yes, agreed.

284
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:33,204
I'm a fool for being crazy in love with him for two months.

285
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:40,214
What? You don't agree with that?

286
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,784
You were young.

287
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,194
You were in love, and you trusted him.

288
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,163
That's too biased.

289
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,934
Who cares? That's how I feel.

290
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,863
I'm siding with my woman.

291
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,373
Are you really okay with this?

292
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:11,014
It's about your brother, but it's also about me.

293
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,194
It's about us. You and me.

294
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:39,474
Yes.

295
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:41,774
Just do this, and we'll be okay.

296
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,714
Let me take care of everything.

297
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,083
Just lean on me.

298
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,704
(Daily Sales Report)

299
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,274
Gosh...

300
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,014
Mr. Koh! My gosh.

301
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,224
Did you see the sales report?

302
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:29,227
The main season hasn't even begun yet.

303
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:30,868
Sono has already received orders...

304
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,537
for 20,000 to 30,000 pieces with the jersey dress alone,

305
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:36,133
whereas there's zero buzz about Claire Marie...

306
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:38,237
even with all the support it's been getting.

307
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,408
We're working very hard.

308
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:41,804
Of course, you have to work hard.

309
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:44,173
It has to sell better.

310
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,047
You say you're working hard, but you're not doing a good job,

311
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:49,544
so even I am too ashamed to face President Hwang.

312
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,214
Gosh, President Hwang...

313
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,184
Mr. Koh!

314
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,484
What?

315
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:02,623
I'd like to speak with you in private.

316
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:04,923
Speak.

317
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:06,994
I saw Claire Marie's sales report.

318
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,994
I helped you out so much. You fool.

319
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,467
Dad, can we please not talk about work...

320
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,838
when we're eating?

321
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,403
How's it going with Jae Guk?

322
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:18,774
Well...

323
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,643
He's not my type.

324
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,418
That is something you care about when you're young.

325
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,784
Marriage is a merger of two families.

326
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,658
The adults will get together soon, so be prepared.

327
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,557
Chi Hyung's supposed to join us for lunch.

328
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,628
He should be on time. Why is he late?

329
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,724
He's out working.

330
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,994
He's doing just fine. That's what you must do too.

331
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,764
I'll visit the sample room after lunch.

332
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,764
Me too?

333
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,813
Thank you for joining us for Sono's opening show.

334
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,853
It's the jersey one-piece you wore that day.

335
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,323
It's a famous artist's design, so I'll keep it.

336
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,257
We visit and serve.

337
00:21:06,258 --> 00:21:08,724
We're doing our best to satisfy you.

338
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,353
Do I get a bonus?

339
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,368
Like two days off our deal, or something?

340
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:14,764
What time did you leave last night?

341
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,103
I must've fallen fast asleep.

342
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,934
I didn't hear you go.

343
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:23,477
She asked me to take her home after the party, and I did.

344
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:25,148
She got drunk and passed out,

345
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:27,214
and I left after drinking a glass of water.

346
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,313
I didn't ask for an explanation.

347
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,547
Facts must be relayed to avoid misunderstandings.

348
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,254
What happened last night was just an extension of work.

349
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,323
What are you doing?

350
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,698
I don't want a colleague to think my loyalty for Sono...

351
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,893
is being tarnished by my personal escapades.

352
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,363
What personal escapades?

353
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:49,997
Oh. That we dated, then broke up,

354
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,734
then got back together?

355
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,873
That was also for work.

356
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,833
I will get going, then.

357
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,373
Let's have lunch.

358
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:03,178
You're a freelancer and have no sense of time.

359
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,987
I'm tied to an office...

360
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:06,984
and right now I'm on duty.

361
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,313
Wait for me.

362
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,313
(Mother-in-law)

363
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,383
Hello, Mother.

364
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,353
I just met some friends and only I look my age.

365
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:48,297
Someone's daughter-in-law paid for a round of Botox,

366
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,694
and someone else's paid for a massage.

367
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:54,163
I didn't say a thing so you wouldn't look bad.

368
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,464
We don't have that much extra to spend, Mother.

369
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,333
This is why you struggle on a single income.

370
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:05,673
My poor son is shouldering all the weight.

371
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,573
I have to go.

372
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:27,297
Your savings mature very soon.

373
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,698
You'll lose a lot if you close the account now.

374
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,903
You'll only make 30 percent of what you would if you're to wait.

375
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,774
- I can close the account, right? - Yes, you can.

376
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:41,613
That...

377
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,613
and these too.

378
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,583
Close them all.

379
00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,764
You're not getting off?

380
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,734
How about a movie after work?

381
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,237
I'm busy. We're expecting a shipment of fabric,

382
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,438
I have to check if the samples look good,

383
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,944
and I must check other materials. My to-do list never ends.

384
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:14,313
Then how about tomorrow?

385
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:16,077
The busier you are, the more you need a break.

386
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:17,714
And get some inspiration.

387
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,858
If we must watch a movie, let's watch one with stunts.

388
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,284
And lots of smashing.

389
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,123
Let's see.

390
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,623
What looks like fun?

391
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,227
How about this?

392
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,663
- That looks boring. - The one above, then?

393
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,444
Here you are, Ms. Ha.

394
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,653
What were you doing together?

395
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:57,858
Pardon?

396
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,027
Oh, we're...

397
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:01,123
We came to check the materials.

398
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:03,794
I see.

399
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:08,163
Thanks for your help. I'll let you get back to work.

400
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,987
I saw your Claire Marie draft.

401
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:26,083
- I loved it. - Thank you.

402
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,714
Make it a hit like you did Sono, Mr. J.

403
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:32,123
No, was it Cookie?

404
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:34,423
I'll do my best. Excuse me, then.

405
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:44,403
I have a meeting in 30 minutes.

406
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,434
If you want to look around, let's be quick.

407
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,204
Okay.

408
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:02,883
We should be careful when the president's around.

409
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:06,254
- Why should we do that? - Director Hwang.

410
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,254
I see.

411
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:12,024
- Then can we do this? - Of course not.

412
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,234
- Is this out of the question? - You bet.

413
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,603
Does anything go when we're out of sight?

414
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:23,534
Perhaps?

415
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,979
As you get older, your muscle mass reduces,

416
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,509
and so does collagen.

417
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,809
Collagen that's full and firm when you're in your 20s...

418
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,479
Spinning rollers were added to the upper leg section.

419
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,148
That guarantees a better leg massage.

420
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,858
Now look. You have these options.

421
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:22,529
Let's take a housewife for example.

422
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,729
You're on your feet all day...

423
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,954
Where's my dinner?

424
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,165
There's rice in the rice cooker. Heat the doenjang jjigae.

425
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,064
Eat it all so there's no food waste.

426
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,004
Where are the ramyeon?

427
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,004
Where are the ramyeon?

428
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,385
Hey.

429
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,814
What's all that?

430
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,089
As you can see, there's an extra diagonal...

431
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,398
Three... 3,600 dollars? You didn't buy that, did you?

432
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,128
My mom says she aches all over.

433
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,564
Did you buy it?

434
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,499
As you already know,

435
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,339
this is 100-percent Italian cowhide.

436
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,438
You're kidding, right?

437
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,504
There's a discount if you pay in full.

438
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,938
You bought a massage chair for your mother,

439
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:14,544
a bag for yourself,

440
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,244
but didn't you buy anything for my mom?

441
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:18,378
Did she call you too?

442
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,375
Did you say you have no money?

443
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,954
Yes. I have nothing extra to spend on her.

444
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,618
Jeon Mi Sook!

445
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,559
When I want to buy a winter coat,

446
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,054
she takes the cash saying someone's daughter-in-law bought a fur coat.

447
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,865
When I want to go on holiday to Southeast Asia,

448
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,839
she says someone went to Hawaii for their 70th,

449
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,294
and takes that money too.

450
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,569
I did more than enough.

451
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,769
Hey, you're a daughter-in-law. It's your rightful duty to...

452
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,605
Nothing is rightful.

453
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,708
Who can guarantee I'll wake up tomorrow morning?

454
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,014
You can't treat my mom like that.

455
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,319
She had a real hard time supporting me.

456
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,819
She sacrificed for you,

457
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,615
so why does she expect me to compensate her for it?

458
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,325
I gave up everything for you until now,

459
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:05,794
so now I'll live for myself.

460
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:23,544
What are you doing?

461
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,175
I'm setting up a hip bath to do some aromatherapy.

462
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:33,415
I'll come over.

463
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,494
Are you serious?

464
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:44,224
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

465
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,254
He's here already?

466
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,425
(You can't...)

467
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,494
You can't come.

468
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,464
You said anything goes when we're out of sight.

469
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,405
Mi Sook is here.

470
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,415
Hey. Didn't you just leave?

471
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,554
You got back fast.

472
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:44,658
You said instant foods are your enemy.

473
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,729
They're also a miraculous cure for stress.

474
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,895
Perfect.

475
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,865
- I just got really stressed. - Hey.

476
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,665
That's just one portion.

477
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,635
It's good.

478
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,954
I must be crazy.

479
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,428
Talk.

480
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:18,595
What's the matter?

481
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,524
I said it's menopause and stress.

482
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,895
- You expect me to buy that? - Just go for it.

483
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,905
Soo Ho's up to something, isn't he?

484
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:33,105
What is it? Talk to me.

485
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,605
Give me some time.

486
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:39,274
Once I think things through, I'll tell you.

487
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,445
I'll help, whatever it's about.

488
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,484
If you need a boost, I'll curse for you too.

489
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,655
Don't forget you have me.

490
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,925
That's so reassuring.

491
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,054
Will you pull out some hair for me too?

492
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,125
This must've cost a lot.

493
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:00,034
I closed all my savings accounts.

494
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,964
Your apartment's still yours, right?

495
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:05,279
Young Eun.

496
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,509
To be honest, I thought I'd die if I didn't have any savings.

497
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,575
But now they're gone and I'm still fine.

498
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,814
I can't believe a few bankbooks had that much control over my life.

499
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,718
What's even worse...

500
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,685
is that I wasn't forced. I walked into that trap myself.

501
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,024
So what? Do you feel free now?

502
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,554
It's futile.

503
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,825
Everything's gone now and it wasn't that big a deal.

504
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:36,105
Mi Sook.

505
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,974
I got a call from Soo Wan.

506
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,945
Was it a wrong number?

507
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,214
Possibly.

508
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,855
But...

509
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,754
he had a fiancee.

510
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:57,984
What did you just say?

511
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,625
The jerk was a two-timer.

512
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,195
How does Ms. Ha know that?

513
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,794
I told her.

514
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,234
You honest fool.

515
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,175
You exposed what your brother did.

516
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,734
You are such an upright man.

517
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:16,974
Was I too honest?

518
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,845
What did Ms. Ha say?

519
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:22,615
She went...

520
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:26,085
Not just sounds. Were there any sentences?

521
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,554
"I see."

522
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,984
What? That was it?

523
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,259
She calmly said a few bad words.

524
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,195
"He's a total jerk." That's about it.

525
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:36,825
She was calm about it?

526
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:38,695
Okay...

527
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:42,905
What's your interpretation?

528
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:44,635
Listen.

529
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,834
The "hah" and "huh" sounds...

530
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,374
represent the initial shock and absurdity of a new-found fact.

531
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,044
The few calm curse words...

532
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,945
Were you upset to hear he was engaged?

533
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,825
Did I feel upset?

534
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:06,524
Was she upset?

535
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:11,399
If she were, she'd have gotten angry or had an outburst.

536
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,468
Or she'd have talked about him like he was trash.

537
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,964
She didn't do that.

538
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,479
She was calm and composed as she said "jerk".

539
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,675
Was she?

540
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,905
Then...

541
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,914
It was odd.

542
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,885
I felt indifferent.

543
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:32,955
Indifferent?

544
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,254
When I first heard about Soo Wan being engaged,

545
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,055
I was dazed at first.

546
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,254
But I thought about it...

547
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,394
and realized I didn't mind much.

548
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,164
I'm proud of you, girl.

549
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:50,964
You've grown up.

550
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,104
Have I?

551
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,705
You have.

552
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,515
When you face accidents as you get on in life,

553
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:06,584
you get rid of things that mean nothing to you without regret.

554
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,984
And what you have left...

555
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:13,655
comes to mean even more to you.

556
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,394
You get to see that.

557
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,664
Isn't that what life is?

558
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:24,205
Is it?

559
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,705
Yes. That's what it is.

560
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,345
It means the past no longer affects her present.

561
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,015
So she's calm, composed, and indifferent.

562
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,655
Isn't that the emotional boundary she's on?

563
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,975
I'm here.

564
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,385
Can you open the door?

565
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,754
You didn't say you'd come...

566
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,504
- What's this? - Have a drink with your friend.

567
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,044
That's an excuse.

568
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,644
I wanted to see you even if it's just like this.

569
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:45,714
Do you want to come in?

570
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,725
Thanks for the offer, but next time.

571
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,825
Have fun with your friend tonight.

572
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,225
Drive safely back.

573
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,595
See you tomorrow evening.

574
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,414
- Did someone come by? - Kind of.

575
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,425
What is this?

576
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:25,428
He left it outside.

577
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,195
For us to have some drinks.

578
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:30,164
How lovely. It's the best time of your life.

579
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:36,265
Cheese and shine muscat grapes?

580
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:38,405
I can't help it. Let's drink some more.

581
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,805
Okay.

582
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,580
(Young Eun's father)

583
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:46,345
Thanks to your help, it's almost sorted out.

584
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:47,945
Let me buy you a meal.

585
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,184
Call me any time.

586
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:55,254
(Ms. Wit)

587
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,984
My gosh.

588
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,095
Why did you jump? Am I a stranger?

589
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,664
What is wrong with you?

590
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,434
Can't you at least make a sound?

591
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:08,865
Who were you texting this late that made you smile?

592
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,805
Some announcements for school.

593
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,535
I had to send them out so they can be ready tomorrow.

594
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,175
Get out of my way.

595
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:20,019
I can't have heart attacks at my age,

596
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,115
and you keep creeping up on me.

597
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,615
Drink this.

598
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,305
- Good morning. - Hi.

599
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,845
I said hello. Shouldn't you at least look up?

600
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,374
I'm busy. Get to the point.

601
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:53,745
Why don't you mind at all?

602
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,984
- About what? - About Hye Rin and me.

603
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,144
How could you not comment on it at all?

604
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:00,689
I'm not interested and I don't care.

605
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,789
Exactly. Why don't you care?

606
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,184
I'm the president's son.

607
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:06,595
So what if you are?

608
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:10,124
This isn't the right work attitude.

609
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,865
Listen.

610
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,468
Once we begin to share personal information,

611
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:17,564
we get close fast, and if you know someone like me,

612
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:19,508
your work life will become much easier.

613
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:23,209
With the uncertain hope that you will one day do me a favor,

614
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,479
I try hard to appease you...

615
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,249
and worry that I offended you.

616
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,149
If you change your mind and ditch me,

617
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,515
I lose all I had.

618
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,984
I'd rather draw another design.

619
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:34,115
So Young.

620
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:38,754
Did you just prioritize a drawing over me?

621
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,024
Okay. That was very refreshing.

622
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,968
It's not "So Young". It's "Ms. Jung".

623
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,064
- What you're saying So Young... - "Ms. Jung."

624
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,175
Okay. Ms. Jung.

625
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,975
Keep up. We have to hand this over to the other team.

626
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,644
Okay, Ms. Jung.

627
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,725
What is it? Why did you...

628
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,995
Why brings you here early in the morning, Director Hwang?

629
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:21,234
There's this man.

630
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:23,234
And?

631
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:26,439
To every single text message I send,

632
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,245
he replies with just one word, "Yes."

633
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,044
What do you think that means?

634
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,414
Who is it this time?

635
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,984
You don't need to know.

636
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:40,814
Singer, actor, model.

637
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:42,588
You can't date a younger idol singer.

638
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,459
If his fans find out,

639
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,225
they'll crash our website.

640
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,829
Do it only if you want Claire Marie to shut down right after its launch.

641
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,294
Don't worry, he's not in that field.

642
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,865
He's not younger than me and he's not at all an idol singer.

643
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,104
Are you sure?

644
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,575
I don't have to do damage control?

645
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,475
You just have to sort out Yoon Jae Guk.

646
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,314
Do you know it was painfully obvious outside the sample room?

647
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,245
I think my dad has a hunch.

648
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,484
He's very intuitive, you know.

649
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,419
Anyone could have noticed...

650
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,888
that there was something going on between you two.

651
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:21,124
Seriously. You've got some nerve to flirt with him in the office.

652
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,425
Anyway, enough about that.

653
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,765
Now, tell me.

654
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:27,439
What do you think this means?

655
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,604
Just ask him yourself,

656
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,575
instead of trying to make a wild guess. Okay?

657
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,615
(Director Hwang)

658
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,455
Are you at work?

659
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,925
Yes.

660
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,325
Are you busy?

661
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,425
Yes.

662
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:58,325
I need to talk to you, but I guess you're too busy to come meet me.

663
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:01,394
Yes.

664
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:04,205
So I came instead. I'll be there in a minute.

665
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,035
If anyone asks for me, tell that person I'm not here...

666
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:15,448
You can't just barge in here...

667
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,345
You're taken aback, aren't you? Well, so am I.

668
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,414
About what?

669
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:22,689
You say nothing else but "Yes"...

670
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,725
every time I ask you something.

671
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:27,425
What's with the attitude?

672
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:31,629
I tried to figure out why, but I can't think of a reason.

673
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,734
So tell me why.

674
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,405
- You really don't know? - No.

675
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:44,175
I'm drawing a line.

676
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:48,515
Why?

677
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,615
Because I don't want to be the only one...

678
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,414
who cares and gets my hopes up,

679
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,725
and end up disappointed.

680
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,995
Why exactly?

681
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,695
Why do you think?

682
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,329
Wait a minute.

683
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,135
Being the only one who cares and gets my hopes up...

684
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,664
and end up disappointed?

685
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,464
That's...

686
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:14,535
exactly how I feel every time I fall in love.

687
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:35,055
Great.

688
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:37,195
Give me a bigger smile.

689
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,338
Like this!

690
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,809
Can we put the lights a little closer?

691
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,309
- The reflector too. - Okay.

692
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,475
Great.

693
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,745
Okay. Great.

694
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,984
It's raining.

695
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,484
Let's carry on with the shoot once the rain stops.

696
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:04,325
- Bring everything back! - Careful.

697
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,925
It's too revealing. Let's make the slit smaller.

698
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:17,705
Sixteen.

699
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:21,575
Here.

700
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,104
You brought the wrong one.

701
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:28,044
What? So you want me to go back?

702
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:31,115
- In the sample room... - Let's use velcro for this.

703
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:34,515
Are we still going to add eight rivets near the button?

704
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:37,254
Yes. I want the changes to be made by tomorrow morning.

705
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,555
Okay.

706
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,649
Hello, this is Ha Young Eun.

707
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,175
Ms. Ha, President Hwang wishes to see you.

708
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,265
Did you receive money from the factory secretly?

709
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,504
No, I didn't.

710
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:32,414
I've had this rule ever since I began selling fabric.

711
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:34,475
If an employee asks me for a raise...

712
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,385
or to pay for their transportation expenses,

713
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:38,745
I give them that as long as it's reasonable.

714
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,084
But those who secretly take money...

715
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,024
behind my back...

716
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,354
are never allowed back in my office again.

717
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,265
The money they steal may not be worth much,

718
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,595
but you can't put a price...

719
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,464
on the fact that they deceived me.

720
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,365
I've never deceived you...

721
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,075
in any kind of way whatsoever.

722
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,914
I know. You were able to finish your studies in Paris...

723
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,484
thanks to me.

724
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,184
I'm the reason...

725
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:14,555
you've come this far.

726
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,024
So you shouldn't covet something...

727
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,195
that doesn't belong to you.

728
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:24,695
Right?

729
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,405
I think my dad has a hunch.

730
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:42,044
We should do the photoshoot somewhere else.

731
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,984
Otherwise, we won't be able to finish it today.

732
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,515
Okay.

733
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:09,644
Okay, great.

734
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,004
Smile.

735
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,745
Raise your arms one more time.

736
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,495
Hold the balloons.

737
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,464
I'm scared.

738
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,164
Okay.

739
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,004
Nice.

740
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,695
I barely made it in time.

741
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,865
Why didn't you answer my calls?

742
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,635
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear the phone ring.

743
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:12,265
Is there something wrong?

744
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:14,604
Yes, something's wrong.

745
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,945
We're late for the movie. What should we do?

746
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,745
Let's go somewhere warm. It's cold.

747
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,635
When did you start...

748
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,675
having feelings for me?

749
00:48:48,779 --> 00:48:52,544
I can't tell you the exact date and time.

750
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,374
It just happened.

751
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:00,684
My heart aches.

752
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,984
It's natural that you didn't know. You don't need to feel bad.

753
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,425
I'm not going to like you back.

754
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,834
Why? Because of my looks?

755
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:19,834
Listen. I can be pretty charming.

756
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:29,749
Love needs to be full of mysteries.

757
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,155
But you know that I got rejected by Mr. J...

758
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:37,825
because of his feelings for Young Eun.

759
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:42,258
I just happened to see it. It's not my fault.

760
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:43,425
Anyway,

761
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:47,468
I'm not going to like you.

762
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:50,738
So you should just...

763
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:54,774
forget about me and give up.

764
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:57,104
Okay?

765
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,908
If you're not going to like me, stop doing this to me.

766
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:00,975
Okay, I'll stop.

767
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:03,289
Okay, I won't.

768
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,615
Gosh, not again.

769
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:38,088
Gosh, why is it so cold?

770
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:40,084
We're almost home.

771
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:42,088
Director Hwang, stand up for a second.

772
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:44,129
Come on.

773
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,725
Can you at least try to stand up?

774
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:49,265
Wait here.

775
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:51,925
I don't feel good.

776
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,635
I don't feel too good.

777
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,405
- I don't feel good. - You don't feel good?

778
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:00,508
Who is it?

779
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:01,675
Just a second.

780
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,845
Hello, sir. That's your daughter.

781
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,175
Who are you? That doesn't look like my daughter.

782
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,644
Pardon?

783
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,789
- Director Hwang. - Yes?

784
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,758
I think you need to show him that it's you.

785
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:17,155
One, two, three.

786
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:18,925
- What? - Come on.

787
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:21,354
Here.

788
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,135
Who is this?

789
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,670
(Ms. Wit)

790
00:51:51,376 --> 00:51:53,041
(Ms. Wit)

791
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,750
"Ms. Wit"?

792
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:03,320
Is this really the only option?

793
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,665
Let's be fair and pick simultaneously.

794
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:08,224
This is Supima cotton, and it's very snug.

795
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,165
This is silk with Raschel lace.

796
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:12,130
It's very lovely.

797
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:13,965
One, two, three.

798
00:52:13,966 --> 00:52:15,161
- I prefer being snug. - The lovely one.

799
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:19,701
I guess we have different tastes in bathrobes.

800
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:23,210
You stir the egg after you add it in your ramyeon, right?

801
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,741
No, I don't.

802
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:28,541
Drumsticks are the most delicious when it comes to chicken, right?

803
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:31,681
Chicken breasts are more simple and plain.

804
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,681
Gosh, we really don't click.

805
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:36,491
It looks like we're going to fight a lot.

806
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:39,561
You'll learn that ramyeon tastes good even if you don't stir the egg,

807
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:41,460
and we won't have to fight over who gets to eat the drumsticks.

808
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,291
I personally think it's a good thing.

809
00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:02,951
I thought it wouldn't work out.

810
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:09,150
I didn't think I would, or we would,

811
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,960
be able to become a normal couple just like everyone else.

812
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:20,230
What's the matter?

813
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:29,411
I got a call from Soo Wan.

814
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,011
At what point does love begin?

815
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,181
And at what point does it end?

816
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:44,351
Who else do we need to ask,

817
00:53:46,365 --> 00:53:47,761
other than ourselves,

818
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:50,431
for permission...

819
00:53:51,365 --> 00:53:53,300
to love each other?

820
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,041
Are you doing well?

821
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:16,320
(Yoon Soo Wan: Are you doing well?)

822
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,665
Yes, I'm doing well.

823
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:21,090
(Yes, I'm doing well.)

824
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,204
(Yoon Soo Wan)

825
00:54:26,205 --> 00:54:27,665
(Delete, QR Code, Block)

826
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,034
(Delete)

827
00:54:29,035 --> 00:54:30,701
I realized...

828
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:34,500
I hadn't deleted Soo Wan's number for over ten years.

829
00:54:38,015 --> 00:54:40,880
I lived a busy life, so after a certain point,

830
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:45,610
I had forgotten that I even had his number.

831
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:51,391
I apologize for bringing up Soo Wan again.

832
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,420
But this isn't about him. This is about me.

833
00:54:56,436 --> 00:54:57,661
Yes, I know.

834
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:00,061
I can tell that you're talking about yourself,

835
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:02,601
not Soo Wan.

836
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:11,610
Do you want more ramyeon?

837
00:55:16,285 --> 00:55:17,550
And now,

838
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:21,520
our story has begun.

839
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:25,724
By the way, I know you're slow-witted.

840
00:55:25,725 --> 00:55:27,320
But I guess you also don't know how to be flexible.

841
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:29,630
I can't believe you walked in the rain to come see me.

842
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:32,630
I was going to wait just for ten minutes and leave.

843
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:34,230
You waited for 20 minutes.

844
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:40,744
Is the soup bland?

845
00:55:40,745 --> 00:55:42,514
I've never cooked two portions before.

846
00:55:42,515 --> 00:55:44,871
I added too much water, so it's probably bland.

847
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:47,281
It's okay. It's tastes just right.

848
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:51,451
I feel reassured when he tells me it's okay.

849
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,424
His smile also makes me smile.

850
00:55:54,425 --> 00:55:55,891
Do you want more soup?

851
00:55:56,196 --> 00:55:57,824
- Here. - Gosh, that's hot.

852
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:59,991
Don't get the soup on the bathrobe. It's expensive, you know.

853
00:56:00,365 --> 00:56:01,920
It's not like you're going to wash it.

854
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:05,360
Eat up. Then we'll wash your clothes so you can leave.

855
00:56:06,035 --> 00:56:07,130
Okay.

856
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:10,270
I never thought I'd be able to start a relationship...

857
00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:13,141
- It's delicious. - just like everyone else,

858
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:16,170
but it's finally here.

859
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:22,141
Enjoy.

860
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:38,134
(Young Eun: Yes, I'm doing well.)

861
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:39,531
Are you doing well?

862
00:56:41,006 --> 00:56:43,431
Yes, I'm doing well.

863
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:01,520
(Look. I don't want trouble. Are you happy now?)

864
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,851
What brings you here so early in the morning?

865
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:34,781
I wanted to talk to you about something.

866
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:43,960
Just a second.

867
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,281
So it was you.

868
00:58:15,026 --> 00:58:17,360
What do you think you're doing?

869
00:58:19,305 --> 00:58:20,960
I came to ask you that.

870
00:58:22,575 --> 00:58:23,900
What are you doing?

871
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:27,871
Why did you text Young Eun with Soo Wan's phone?

872
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:31,871
I told you. I'm worried about your mother.

873
00:58:32,316 --> 00:58:35,741
Are you sure you're not using that as an excuse to take your anger out?

874
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:37,781
Are you...

875
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,320
really okay about this?

876
00:58:40,555 --> 00:58:43,420
Think about how shocked she'll be and how much that will hurt her.

877
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:45,650
Are you okay with that?

878
00:58:47,296 --> 00:58:48,520
I know you're not.

879
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:53,831
That's why you couldn't tell your mother.

880
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,871
Mom, it's me.

881
00:59:07,486 --> 00:59:08,880
I'd like to introduce you...

882
00:59:10,486 --> 00:59:11,880
to the woman I love.

883
00:59:14,825 --> 00:59:16,020
Her name is...

884
00:59:18,356 --> 00:59:19,661
Ha Young Eun.

885
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:24,491
What?

886
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:27,000
"Ha Young Eun"?

887
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:36,170
Jae Guk.

888
00:59:37,546 --> 00:59:38,710
Are you...

889
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:41,110
telling me...

890
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:45,811
Yes.

891
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:48,181
It's her.

892
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:47,244
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

893
01:00:47,245 --> 01:00:49,755
Domestic brands have lost their competitiveness.

894
01:00:49,756 --> 01:00:51,654
I want you to cancel the deal with all of them.

895
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:53,585
What do you mean they canceled the deal?

896
01:00:53,586 --> 01:00:55,125
You should've found a common ground.

897
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:58,224
That's enough! Let's wait and see until the end of the month.

898
01:00:58,225 --> 01:01:01,364
Sometimes, there are things you can't overcome in reality.

899
01:01:01,365 --> 01:01:03,690
So stop wasting your time.

900
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,335
Yoon Soo Wan, that crazy jerk.

901
01:01:07,336 --> 01:01:09,704
- Jae Guk. - I know this is difficult...

902
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:11,235
and that you find it hard to accept this.

903
01:01:11,236 --> 01:01:12,800
Then are you going to continue...

904
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:14,871
Good shot.

905
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:16,674
I'll do it.

906
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:19,270
Get in the car. Let's have another drink in Seoul.

907
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:24,954
Your back will start hurting a lot more.

908
01:01:24,955 --> 01:01:27,920
You'll have jaundice, and you'll lose a lot of weight.

909
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,391
Mi Sook, please pick up.

910
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:33,420
Young Eun, help. I'm in so much pain.

911
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:37,565
The world isn't going to be so open-minded about your love.

912
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:38,895
You want me to give up on the woman I love...

913
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,500
just because of what might happen during a few days?

914
01:01:40,736 --> 01:01:43,670
Soo Wan was the one who hurt you, not her.

915
01:01:46,546 --> 01:01:48,201
You're taking it out on the wrong person.
