Now, We Are Breaking Up

00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:20,787
Song Hye Kyo

00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,287
Jang Ki Yong

4
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,656
Kim Ju Hun, Choi Hee Seo

5
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:38,997
A fashion designer designs four collections a year.

6
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:42,667
Now, We Are Breaking Up

7
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,436
It's that way.

8
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,577
- Yes, we're ready. - Come on out now.

9
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,546
Great. Go on.

10
00:00:57,217 --> 00:00:58,356
Every designer hopes...

11
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,227
that each piece they design would become a beloved classic,

12
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,497
but trends are always fleeting.

13
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:09,926
Let's get ready now.

14
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,697
Sun Young, get ready.

15
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:14,507
Come on. Hurry.

16
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,077
At the end of the day, there is only one thing that never changes.

17
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,876
The fact that nothing is forever.

18
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:40,426
Welcome to the first ever K Fashion Week in Busan!

19
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:51,036
Let's all celebrate this grand opening...

20
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,977
of a new beginning tonight!

21
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,926
We must be in the moment and just enjoy it for this moment.

22
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:16,167
Because it's fleeting too and will never come again.

23
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,407
What is your name?

24
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:39,646
Why do you want to know my name?

25
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:46,357
I was wondering how I should address you if we met again.

26
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,226
That won't happen...

27
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:52,297
because neither of us will be here after the Fashion Week's over.

28
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,827
Have a safe trip back to Paris.

29
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:40,405
"Fashion comes and goes, but style lasts forever."

30
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:44,206
"I don't do fashion. I am fashion." Gabrielle Coco Chanel

31
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:51,915
Now, We Are Breaking Up

32
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,687
Episode 1

33
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:02,526
This is an announcement.

34
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:06,137
All passengers for Korean Air 0078,

35
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,737
please go to the departure gate.

36
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:14,006
All passengers for Korean Air 0078...

37
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:16,547
My gosh. There are so many models at this airport right now.

38
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:18,016
They're everywhere.

39
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:21,585
Dior, Chanel, and Givenchy fashion shows will be held in Korea?

40
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,317
- Is this really happening? - Of course.

41
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,786
Korea is now the most sought-after market in Asia.

42
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:29,025
Hey, who would have thought that a K-pop song...

43
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:31,856
- would top the Billboard chart? - Do Hoon.

44
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,396
Good to see you.

45
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:36,025
But even Olivier is doing his show here this time.

46
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,436
- I never thought this would happen. - My point, exactly.

47
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,465
"If you want to see my show, you'll have to come to Paris."

48
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,736
He was always such a stuck-up snob.

49
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:44,535
Look. K-pop, K-beauty, and K-dramas.

50
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,876
Anything that comes from Korea is popular now,

51
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:49,047
and fashion is no exception.

52
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,275
Besides, he needs money if he wants to continue being such a snob,

53
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:55,887
which means he can no longer ignore the market in Asia.

54
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:00,617
Anyway, it's so nice not to have to take long-haul flights.

55
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,926
If we want A-list celebrities,

56
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,427
we have to land a sponsorship deal with Olivier no matter what.

57
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,896
- Anyway, good luck. - Thanks.

58
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,705
- Take it easy. - We'll be off, then.

59
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,336
- All right. Take it easy. - Thanks.

60
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,816
Hey, anything new?

61
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,276
What do they want?

62
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:31,786
Too difficult, right?

63
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:34,927
But thankfully, we have a thing called an online translator.

64
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:36,927
Let's see.

65
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,525
With all the celebrities and money,

66
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,096
they thought they had everything, but that wasn't the case.

67
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,766
Mr. J.

68
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:46,036
They don't have Mr. J.

69
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,437
They've reached out to him a few times only to be turned down.

70
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:50,265
"Mr. J"?

71
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:53,176
You know, the photographer with many nicknames.

72
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:55,006
Even fashion houses like Hermes, Dior, and Chanel...

73
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,376
want to work with him.

74
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:59,845
Right, isn't his name Jun? That Japanese guy.

75
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,077
I heard he was Chinese.

76
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,916
Oh, people call him "Cookie" these days.

77
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,286
"Cookie"?

78
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,656
That's such a cute nickname.

79
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:21,567
Mr. J, this is Sebastien from Olivier's atelier.

80
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,165
We heard you turned down...

81
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,906
exclusive contracts with Dior and Chanel.

82
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:30,976
Mr. Olivier de Saint Sauveur is in Busan now...

83
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,317
This is Olivier's atelier...

84
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:46,126
Hello, this is Olivier de Saint Sauveur's atelier.

85
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,997
Please call us back when you get a moment.

86
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,797
- Any word from J? - No, nothing yet.

87
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,367
I'll try calling him again.

88
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:00,776
Persuade him at all costs.

89
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:02,676
I know he's rejected everyone else,

90
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:06,417
but not me because I am Olivier de Saint Sauveur.

91
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,616
I need him.

92
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,316
The colours and the angles that he uses.

93
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,486
The warmth and the coolness, and the contrast between them.

94
00:08:15,157 --> 00:08:17,027
I need him, no matter what.

95
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,706
Earlier, you told me to wait for 30 minutes.

96
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,506
It's delayed again?

97
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:36,245
What's going on with the meeting with Olivier?

98
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:37,605
He has meetings booked...

99
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,517
with five other companies besides us.

100
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,886
And there are so many people here trying to get a meeting with him.

101
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,787
I've been waiting for three hours now.

102
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:45,056
That sounds stressful.

103
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,017
Right, Director Hwang has arrived too.

104
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,505
The person you have reached is unavailable.

105
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,677
Please leave a message...

106
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:14,916
What about the photo book?

107
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,547
I just picked them up at the print shop.

108
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,517
- I'll leave right away. - Call me when you're here.

109
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:24,356
Ms. Ha, Olivier still hasn't come down.

110
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:27,196
How many meetings does he have before ours?

111
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:28,267
Two.

112
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,096
He's meeting with Viace just before us.

113
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,705
You must be hungry. You should go eat something.

114
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:36,835
I'll stay here.

115
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:38,806
I had a big brunch.

116
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,407
You should go eat something.

117
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:43,105
I can wait until the meeting is over.

118
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,345
But you haven't eaten anything yet.

119
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,715
I'll call you as soon as Viace's meeting starts.

120
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,716
Go eat something.

121
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:53,115
Since Olivier has decided to break into the markets in Asia,

122
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,355
they will certainly need our help...

123
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,726
as Sono is the number one fashion brand in the country.

124
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:59,455
That will be the focus of my pitch.

125
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,866
I don't need to hear it. I want results.

126
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,595
What would a mere fabric vendor like me even know?

127
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:05,697
There's no point in telling me.

128
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,407
I will keep you updated, sir.

129
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,307
What is Chi Sook up to? I haven't even heard from her.

130
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:23,286
The Olivier show is tomorrow, you know.

131
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,686
She has a lot of reports to go through...

132
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:26,057
for the meeting after the show.

133
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:32,956
My secretary made a reservation at a restaurant for 7pm today.

134
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,767
Make sure Chi Sook gets there on time.

135
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:44,705
Young Eun. This love bug jerk has another woman.

136
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:46,605
Make sure you bring enough...

137
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,646
It was arranged by both families, so she'd better not embarrass me.

138
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:50,906
Tell her to be on her best behaviour.

139
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:52,246
Yes, sir. I will.

140
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:54,746
Director Hwang

141
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,356
Director Hwang, don't do anything.

142
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,486
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

143
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,327
I'm sorry. I'll come back another time.

144
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,267
Hey, long time no see.

145
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:17,566
This rude brat.

146
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,677
He always makes me call him first and come to him.

147
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,446
He's got a lot of nerve.

148
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:33,215
I kindly let him check into the room first.

149
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,226
How dare he sleep with another woman?

150
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:38,797
She even posted a photo of them together.

151
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,106
Who are you?

152
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,106
Can you tell Jimmy to come out?

153
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,646
Jimmy! Come out for a second.

154
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,786
- Coming! Relax, will you? - Hurry!

155
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,985
What would it take to satisfy you?

156
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,256
My legs are still all wobbly from...

157
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:09,626
Ms. Ha.

158
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:17,396
Jimmy, you are the face of The One's male clothing line.

159
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:18,696
And you have violated the clauses...

160
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,267
in your contract regarding decorum and your personal life.

161
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,705
I'm sorry. This was just a mistake.

162
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,605
It really was. Please believe me.

163
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:27,605
You will have to pay back three times the amount you received.

164
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:28,606
You know that, right?

165
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,776
I swear, nothing happened. I don't know her.

166
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,245
Hey, do you know me? No, right?

167
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:33,416
Why are you here?

168
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,047
Come with me.

169
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,786
As if.

170
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,017
Who are you to tell me what to do?

171
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,657
Not you.

172
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:42,586
You, Jimmy.

173
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,657
Can we just kick her out?

174
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:46,856
You jerk.

175
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,496
Chi Sook!

176
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:52,296
No fighting, okay?

177
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:53,865
Let's get this sorted out quietly.

178
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,536
Killing and burying him is okay, right?

179
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,466
It'll be done quietly, and no one will find out.

180
00:12:58,307 --> 00:12:59,976
Do you want to stay here or come with me?

181
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,287
Doors are closing.

182
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:14,787
Doors are opening.

183
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,027
Doors are closing.

184
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,336
- Hold on! Wait up. - Doors are opening.

185
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:30,006
You got the wrong idea.

186
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,476
Nothing happened.

187
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,475
I met her at a club last night.

188
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:37,046
She told me that she had nowhere to sleep.

189
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,646
What was I supposed to do? Leave her in the streets?

190
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,245
It gets very cold at night by the ocean.

191
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:42,286
Come on. That's heartless.

192
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,345
We slept in the same bed, but nothing happened.

193
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:47,057
You think I had a one-night stand? No, not at all.

194
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:50,226
I'm telling you the truth. Please believe me.

195
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:55,827
Wait, hey!

196
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,036
Hey!

197
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,667
Please, forgive me just this once. I beg you.

198
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,845
I had booked an ocean-view room,

199
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:12,047
but a friend of mine said he couldn't get a room.

200
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,345
He's still new to the PR industry,

201
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:16,386
so he didn't know it'd be that hard to get a room.

202
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,455
- And? - So,

203
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,885
I kindly told him he could take my room.

204
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:23,885
Why? It gets very cold at night by the ocean.

205
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,356
Because I can stay with you.

206
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:28,095
Bye.

207
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:30,926
Fashion leaders from all around the world are here now.

208
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:33,036
I am the CEO of Vision PR,

209
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,306
one of the leading fashion PR agencies in the country.

210
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,806
You still refuse to accept it, but I'm a celebrity.

211
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,276
What does my room have to do with this?

212
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:41,975
This is the first ever K Fashion Week...

213
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:43,576
in Busan, and also in Asia.

214
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,115
I need to stay where it's happening...

215
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,475
to see what these people are wearing and what they listen to...

216
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,517
so I can stay on top of the latest trends.

217
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:51,687
There's only one trend happening at this hotel.

218
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,157
Love and war.

219
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,027
What?

220
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,167
What?

221
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:11,807
Got something else to say?

222
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:16,047
Delete the photo of Jimmy you posted on your social media.

223
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,206
And delete every photo of him on your phone.

224
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:19,417
That's ridiculous.

225
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,647
It's my phone. They're my photos I want to keep for memories' sake.

226
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,917
Then I will sue you.

227
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,625
Let's be honest. You two aren't even married.

228
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:31,426
We hit it off. That's not against the law, is it?

229
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,057
Go ahead and sue me.

230
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:34,725
If a model's personal photos...

231
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,426
circulate on social media due to girl problems,

232
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:38,167
the brand image will be ruined as well.

233
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:41,037
He violated the personal conduct and the portrait rights clauses,

234
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,567
so we can hold him accountable for damages incurred.

235
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,807
- Now, what do you say? - Darn it. This is so annoying.

236
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:57,447
Delete

237
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:00,756
There. Happy now?

238
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:08,456
Darn it!

239
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:14,437
This is your supplementary contract.

240
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,536
If this happens again, you'll pay three times the amount...

241
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:20,936
of the agreed penalty and compensate The One...

242
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:23,047
for all damages incurred.

243
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,146
If you agree to the terms,

244
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:27,346
let's say it was a misunderstanding and leave it at that.

245
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,287
Thank you.

246
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:34,615
It's too easy. People don't take relationships seriously.

247
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:37,056
No one is sincere.

248
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,425
It's truly sad.

249
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,756
You're not the one going through it, so calm down.

250
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:44,125
At least he's trying, going back and forth between those two women.

251
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,966
What about you? Are you not going to get married?

252
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,766
You'll turn 40 before you even know it.

253
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,037
You're already 40...

254
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:51,307
and still single. Worry about yourself first.

255
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,905
I'm waiting for my fate, the one I'm meant to be with.

256
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,446
And I'm a misogamist.

257
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,576
Do you think saying that makes you look cool?

258
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,546
Be honest. You just don't want to take responsibility.

259
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,787
That's right. I don't want to.

260
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:06,717
My gosh, you're too honest.

261
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:09,056
Why take responsibility for someone else's life?

262
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:11,256
I just want to be free and independent.

263
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:12,756
I want to keep living this way.

264
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,756
So you just want to have fun with no strings attached.

265
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,297
You said that in such a convoluted manner.

266
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,865
Keep a safe distance, and you'll never expect anything...

267
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,365
or be disappointed.

268
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,466
So you wander around the world...

269
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,636
and only take jobs that please your palate?

270
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:27,906
Is that it, Mr. Cookie?

271
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:31,175
What are you, dandelion fluff that travels all over the world?

272
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,146
I'm just trying to live in the moment.

273
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:36,287
For work and love as well.

274
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,956
Meet someone who's passionate.

275
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:42,056
And when it happens, cherish your fate.

276
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,656
That being said...

277
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,956
Let me stay with you.

278
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,057
Where is your room?

279
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:49,997
Hey, Do Hoon!

280
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,366
It was just a one-night stand.

281
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:09,017
He said he was drunk. It can happen, you know.

282
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,217
It's lame to dwell on it.

283
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:17,057
What about Jimmy?

284
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,396
I warned him, so he knows not to do it again.

285
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:23,096
The word won't get out, so President Hwang won't find out.

286
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,596
Really?

287
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,736
Right, you should get a new purse.

288
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,067
You've had that one for a long time.

289
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,875
President Hwang said the reservation is at 7pm.

290
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:37,007
I booked an appointment at the salon for you. Don't be late.

291
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,067
Jerk.

292
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,267
Why were you in such a rush to leave?

293
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,507
You left without even giving me an excuse.

294
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:29,896
Where are we going?

295
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:33,037
A restaurant that's very popular among couples these days.

296
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:36,136
Why would I go there with you?

297
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:38,807
Thanks to you, I don't have to pay for a hotel room.

298
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,375
I'll buy you dinner, so come on time.

299
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:43,905
Gosh, I've been so sleep-deprived because of work.

300
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:45,915
I'm exhausted.

301
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,247
Where are you going now if you're that tired?

302
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,186
There are all these fashion shows happening.

303
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,456
I need to meet people and build connections.

304
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,086
The main ones don't start until tomorrow. Get some sleep.

305
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:58,185
Hey, you shouldn't put off anything in life.

306
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:00,125
If you don't act now, you may lose it forever.

307
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,656
So seize every opportunity that comes your way.

308
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,296
Meet me at 7pm.

309
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:06,037
It's an expensive place, so come dressed up.

310
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:25,286
How's this?

311
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:27,686
Put a bit more.

312
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,327
- Stack them more uniformly. - Okay.

313
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:40,967
You did so well.

314
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:42,936
Please stand up.

315
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,506
The person who prepared today's menu the best...

316
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:50,146
is Madam Min again.

317
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:55,717
Food should look stylish too.

318
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,016
Garnish that is beautiful and classy...

319
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:00,086
makes the dish look even better.

320
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,957
Shall we put the finishing touches to your dishes?

321
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,996
That woman comes first all the time.

322
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,226
Why does she even learn?

323
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,096
Is she going to open a restaurant?

324
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,067
She looks rich.

325
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:14,335
If she's rich,

326
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:16,707
why would she learn something that gets her hands wet?

327
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,436
What an odd hobby.

328
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,635
Her late husband was a doctor.

329
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:22,846
She often volunteers at a nursing home.

330
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:29,116
I find it hard to approach people who are good at everything.

331
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,396
- Hi, Do Hoon. - Ms. Min.

332
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:44,727
Her unmarried son lives in France.

333
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,666
Son?

334
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,606
I gave Jae Guk the location.

335
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,406
Of course. You know me.

336
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:56,547
He will be there.

337
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:18,936
What do you mean?

338
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:21,396
It's totally unbelievable.

339
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,007
He complained about his condition and jet lag and whatnot,

340
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,307
then suddenly pushed everything to tomorrow.

341
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:29,906
Isn't this just plain rude?

342
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:34,176
Okay.

343
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:36,446
Confirm tomorrow's schedule and leave.

344
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,146
Good job.

345
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:44,886
This is Ha Young Eun from The One.

346
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:48,126
Chi Sook's not there yet?

347
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:51,626
Sorry. Let me check and get back to you.

348
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,366
Director Hwang

349
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,537
- Where are you? - Ha Young Eun.

350
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:02,807
Jimmy that punk hasn't called once.

351
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:05,977
He even left the tie I got him in Milan.

352
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,077
He didn't come back for it.

353
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:11,146
I said you have an appointment at seven.

354
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:13,656
Stay where you are. I'll come over.

355
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:24,865
I told you to talk to her nicely...

356
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,296
and you drew blood?

357
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:27,767
Your blood?

358
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,307
You really lost your mojo.

359
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:33,077
I lost my self-esteem too.

360
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,606
And you spend too much.

361
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,676
I spend a fortune at salons just to stay young.

362
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:41,776
My skin may be taut,

363
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:43,416
but my bones must be hollow.

364
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:48,186
Gosh, that wench... Is it her young age?

365
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:51,056
She was strong and she could take a punch.

366
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:52,355
Forget your hair.

367
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:54,757
You can be there on time if you fix your makeup.

368
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,096
She was so confident.

369
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:02,267
She said that to Jimmy, I was just an expensive wallet.

370
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:04,866
He felt sorry for me for not knowing that,

371
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,537
so he just played along.

372
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:10,105
He's from your father's old neighbourhood,

373
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:12,345
and before he died, he was a respected doctor.

374
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,445
You'll meet his son,

375
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:16,317
so he'll have high hopes about family and character.

376
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:19,155
If you can survive the aftermath of blowing him off,

377
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,415
stay here and cry.

378
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,856
Young Eun.

379
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:25,057
Even if I spent a huge amount on him,

380
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,557
he must care for me enough to cover the interest.

381
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:30,327
Or so I thought.

382
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:33,037
Lament your poor judgement later.

383
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:38,406
You've been through enough.

384
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:40,506
Quit the dangerous emotional play...

385
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:42,676
and live a safe, stable life, okay?

386
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,376
Men mean nothing.

387
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:52,585
Hey. Whether I just had fun with Jimmy or was serious,

388
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,217
how would you know?

389
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:55,615
Men?

390
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:57,527
Yes, I crave men.

391
00:24:58,287 --> 00:24:59,696
Aren't you?

392
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:03,866
What were you doing when you turned off your phone?

393
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:36,595
Don't act like you're classy.

394
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:39,297
Acting like you don't care doesn't make you different.

395
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,696
I am different.

396
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,566
You believe in pointless things like men and love,

397
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,707
but I don't.

398
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:48,936
That one experience was enough.

399
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,477
You witch.

400
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,916
How come you're never a friend?

401
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,817
You never apologize.

402
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,685
I just think it's fortunate it was water...

403
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,987
and that it won't smudge.

404
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,686
That's what we have.

405
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,586
Don't expect friendship.

406
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:08,457
To you, my dad's trust and favour come before a friend.

407
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,365
Unlike someone, I don't have a large sum...

408
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,425
to invest for the interest.

409
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:13,766
I must run around all day even if I starve...

410
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,405
because I don't have five minutes to eat a pastry.

411
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:19,106
You don't see that I want to drop dead, do you?

412
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:23,077
Even then, I'm always thankful for what you did.

413
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:25,106
You're well worth it.

414
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:30,217
The cold will help you sober up.

415
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,017
I can't go.

416
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:34,886
No. I won't go.

417
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,166
I can't go looking like this.

418
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,695
"Your daughter appeared half drunk..."

419
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:50,135
"with a bruised neck."

420
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:51,507
Dad will hear about it right away.

421
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,777
He would be so pleased.

422
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,875
We can make up an excuse for that.

423
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:57,906
You'll be at fault if you don't show up at all.

424
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:02,446
You go instead.

425
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:06,487
You can show up and be Hwang Chi Sook.

426
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,986
Call your father and tell him that yourself.

427
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:11,356
I'll do it if he says yes.

428
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:13,626
Do it.

429
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:15,457
Do it?

430
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,666
He'll hold you responsible for not...

431
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,466
watching me closer.

432
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,296
- Wouldn't you mind? - Director Hwang.

433
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:26,577
Let's keep this between us and sweep it under the rug.

434
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,517
Getting dumped in the morning by a guy who wanted my money,

435
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:37,517
and meeting a guy in the evening who wants my dad's money?

436
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:41,557
I really can't do that.

437
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:45,656
Okay?

438
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:51,267
I'll set things up for the event.

439
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:59,207
Hwang

440
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:07,047
Yoon Jae Guk, Hwang Chi Sook

441
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:11,616
The fool...

442
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,586
Do Hoon

443
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:15,787
My gosh.

444
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:01,796
I called the restaurant.

445
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:03,537
He got there on time.

446
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:06,477
Sorry for bothering you when you must be busy.

447
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:08,277
He's getting older,

448
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:11,076
and as his mom, I had to do something.

449
00:29:11,077 --> 00:29:13,116
So I asked for your help.

450
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,987
You did the right thing.

451
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:17,946
But Ms. Min.

452
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:19,957
Who is the lady?

453
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,366
I'm sorry I'm late.

454
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:37,007
Yoon Jae Guk, Hwang Chi Sook

455
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:40,007
You're Ms. Hwang Chi Sook?

456
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:43,346
Let's say so for now.

457
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:47,876
I'm Yoon Jae Guk.

458
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:50,717
I have some issues at work.

459
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,487
I know it's rude but I must...

460
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,596
"But I must"...

461
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:09,406
and what?

462
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:13,576
You went to the trouble of making a reservation,

463
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:15,875
and it looks like you put in some effort.

464
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:18,077
I'll eat, then leave right away.

465
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:38,665
Blood transfusions can save lives,

466
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,865
but it's accompanied with severe side effects.

467
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,406
Safety measures are a must and must be adhered to.

468
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:46,675
But according to our investigative team...

469
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:47,777
What do you think?

470
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:50,277
I haven't even swallowed yet.

471
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:53,247
Patients have been suffering.

472
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,875
Our reporter has more details.

473
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:55,946
Quit taking classes.

474
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:59,616
If this is the best you can do, I'd rather eat out.

475
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:02,615
Eat it while you can.

476
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:04,457
It could always be your last chance.

477
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:06,557
Are you about to die or something?

478
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:11,996
Let's marry off Young Eun.

479
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,666
It's widely given to patients.

480
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:16,207
But women...

481
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:19,406
You know an eligible man?

482
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:22,737
I asked the young ladies at my cooking class.

483
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:25,406
He's from a decent family,

484
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:28,876
and his mother has a respectable personality.

485
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,885
The man works at a foreign company,

486
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:34,017
so he must be pretty capable.

487
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:37,856
I think he's sweet too.

488
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:41,027
Is he?

489
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,365
Na Ri.

490
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:49,067
Did you ask which brands want to collaborate with Olivia?

491
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:50,737
Tell me.

492
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:54,277
And the hanger?

493
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:58,346
Once he agrees to a deal, we must work on the next season.

494
00:31:58,477 --> 00:32:01,517
See what you like and ask for samples right away.

495
00:32:02,376 --> 00:32:05,017
There can be minute differences with the dye, so check the quality.

496
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:06,916
Bye.

497
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,896
Director Hwang

498
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,506
I apologize. I'm on a business trip,

499
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:28,605
and if I didn't have to be here,

500
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:30,577
I would be hard at work.

501
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:34,146
In the morning, she drags a man out of a hotel suite,

502
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:37,586
and in the evening, she works through a blind date?

503
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:39,317
Are you a designer?

504
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:42,856
I'm a freelance photographer.

505
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:44,787
I shoot fashion models.

506
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,166
We could've already met.

507
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:54,737
Photographers and designers...

508
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,436
often cross paths during such events.

509
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:02,436
The encounters that have no impact mean nothing to me.

510
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:07,416
"No impact"?

511
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:09,616
There's not much.

512
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:13,616
You don't have that good an eye for a designer.

513
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,787
I rarely forget a face...

514
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:19,757
that was once in my frame.

515
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:25,067
I'm not here because I want to be.

516
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:27,536
I had no choice but to show up,

517
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:30,267
and I don't think I'll see you again.

518
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:31,666
Goodbye.

519
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,307
There's still dessert.

520
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:35,777
I don't like sweet foods.

521
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,446
Then how about hot tea?

522
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:39,877
Tea is only hot for a short while.

523
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:43,647
You sound upset by that.

524
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:52,587
Excuse me, then.

525
00:34:13,776 --> 00:34:15,715
What should I do, Ms. Ha?

526
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,017
Why? What's wrong?

527
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:20,057
I think the file got swapped before we sent it to the printers.

528
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:24,627
Tell So Young to email you the original file.

529
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,087
Let's print it out here.

530
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:37,136
- Did you find the original copy? - It's not here.

531
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,337
I checked your desk and the manager's,

532
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:42,037
but I can't find it.

533
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,417
Let's shoot it again here.

534
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:48,815
What?

535
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:51,587
Olivier postponed all the meetings to tomorrow.

536
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:54,857
We've earned some time, and the samples are all here.

537
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:56,115
We can shoot it tomorrow.

538
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:58,056
I'll hire some models.

539
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:59,256
What about the photographer?

540
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,525
The people who shot for us...

541
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:04,127
are all at the show event and unavailable.

542
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:07,037
Oh, no. What should we do?

543
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,366
I'm a freelance photographer. I shoot fashion models.

544
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:20,616
Wait.

545
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:03,857
Are you looking for someone?

546
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:12,426
Are you free tomorrow?

547
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:15,937
Will you work part-time?

548
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:17,807
Do what?

549
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:19,937
You said you shoot fashion photos.

550
00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:22,477
I'll give you a feel of the scene.

551
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:30,087
I'm a designer for The One.

552
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:32,986
I see. And?

553
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,485
This is still a secret, but for the next season,

554
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,957
we're working on a collaboration with Olivier.

555
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,656
This could be a great opportunity for you.

556
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:43,096
Let's see...

557
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,796
I'm usually the one to decide what I do.

558
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,537
I make up my own mind.

559
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:54,406
Working with professionals like me would make you feel proud.

560
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:59,176
I'll get that feeling when I want.

561
00:37:00,377 --> 00:37:02,416
If you gain the experience,

562
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:05,087
when the time comes to sign with a magazine or agency,

563
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:06,346
it'll come in handy.

564
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,587
So I must do it?

565
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:12,327
Yes. You're my only option.

566
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:18,667
There's very little proof we can trust him with the job.

567
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,736
His camera bag is very old.

568
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,406
It means he used it a lot.

569
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,006
He's not a complete novice.

570
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:28,477
The models?

571
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:30,807
I pulled some strings.

572
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,307
You're Ms. Hwang Chi Sook?

573
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:06,776
Let's say so for now.

574
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:16,687
How interesting.

575
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:42,576
Jimmy

576
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:43,587
Kim Sunghee, Park Jihye

577
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:50,557
Kim Sung Hee's first line is in this order.

578
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:51,856
And Park Ji Hye's?

579
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:54,595
- The colour scheme overlaps. - We'll go with the dress?

580
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:55,897
- That's okay? - Yes.

581
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:59,126
Sun Ju, check the models' hair and makeup.

582
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,195
Okay.

583
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:02,497
- Is that set up? - Yes, it's ready.

584
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,636
Jae Guk.

585
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,477
Can you lend me a tie?

586
00:39:12,176 --> 00:39:13,747
Olivier's show is today.

587
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:15,716
I need something that stands out.

588
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:18,917
Cookie.

589
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:24,457
Cookie.

590
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:10,107
We must finish it before lunch, so take the bare minimum of shots.

591
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:11,807
I'll handle it.

592
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:21,845
If you go lo-Fi instead of JPG,

593
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:23,315
it'll be easier to get the details.

594
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:24,985
We don't need the photos retouched.

595
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:27,485
The concept is on the mood board.

596
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:29,857
Zoom in on the outfits.

597
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:31,787
I will handle it.

598
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,026
Let's begin.

599
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:40,537
- Call them. - This way.

600
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,837
Set up the lights, please.

601
00:41:05,687 --> 00:41:07,196
I like where you two are standing.

602
00:41:07,357 --> 00:41:10,397
Ji Hye and Sung Hee can stand in the center.

603
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:14,037
You at the far left, take a few steps back.

604
00:41:14,296 --> 00:41:15,667
This is my spot.

605
00:41:21,977 --> 00:41:23,207
Okay, let's begin.

606
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:30,417
Stand a bit closer.

607
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:31,986
Great.

608
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:34,787
Okay.

609
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:39,885
Na Ri.

610
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:41,826
I'm Director Hwang Chi Sook for today, okay?

611
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:42,827
What?

612
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:47,036
Oh, I get it.

613
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,036
You pretended to be Director Hwang to bring him here.

614
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:50,505
Well, it makes sense. She was the one...

615
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:52,905
who hired all the other staff members anyway.

616
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:53,977
Okay, you got it.

617
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:07,386
Good.

618
00:42:11,827 --> 00:42:13,127
- He's good. - Yes.

619
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,096
Use your hands a little more.

620
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:19,497
Big gestures.

621
00:42:22,937 --> 00:42:25,136
He shoots like a real professional.

622
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:26,596
Stay still.

623
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:34,607
Young Eun.

624
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:37,247
I saw the photo you uploaded on your social media page.

625
00:43:38,977 --> 00:43:40,977
Lucky you.

626
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:43,346
I'm busy mopping the floor.

627
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:46,587
But you're having fun drinking coffee by the beach.

628
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:48,957
Yes, I'm depressed.

629
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:52,026
I think I have menopause.

630
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:53,595
It's about time.

631
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,227
I heard people age quicker these days.

632
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:57,425
Yes, I heard. Why can't I look younger instead?

633
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,267
Why do I have to go through menopause?

634
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,596
Hey.

635
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:06,267
You've become even prettier over the past few days.

636
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,037
Something happened, right?

637
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,377
Who was it? Was he handsome?

638
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:13,207
It was nothing.

639
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,276
My skin keeps getting saggy with age,

640
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:18,787
and my body is only getting lazier.

641
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:21,616
So I just gave myself a little motivation to stay on my toes.

642
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:23,755
"Keep your game up. Keep yourself together."

643
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:26,026
"You've still got it." It's my way of telling myself that.

644
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:28,127
That's just a cunning way of comforting yourself.

645
00:44:28,296 --> 00:44:29,956
I'm just being clever and doing what's best for myself.

646
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:32,666
It just means you're a single woman who has no one to lean on.

647
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:34,236
It just means I have a lot of freedom.

648
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:36,366
I'm so jealous of you.

649
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,136
I know.

650
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:45,147
Let's move on.

651
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:50,686
My gosh.

652
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,747
He's not just good.

653
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:54,917
He might even be better than Mr. J.

654
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:57,327
Where did you find that guy?

655
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:08,037
I'm going to do a final retouch.

656
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:11,037
We don't have time for that. Just have them printed out.

657
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:16,107
They're my photos. I won't give them to you without my approval.

658
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:18,806
We have a meeting with an important client.

659
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:19,946
It'll take only ten minutes.

660
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:07,557
Here it is.

661
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:10,696
All done.

662
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:38,357
Are we done, Ms. Ha?

663
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:42,656
Yes, let's wrap things up.

664
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:46,767
You're better than expected.

665
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,767
Did you not have faith in me when you asked me to work part-time?

666
00:46:50,096 --> 00:46:51,506
I had faith in my good eye.

667
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,537
But you turned out to be even better.

668
00:46:55,877 --> 00:46:57,707
Is that a compliment?

669
00:46:58,707 --> 00:46:59,877
Yes, it's a compliment.

670
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:04,216
I really like your photos.

671
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,736
Olivier Buyer Show at 5pm

672
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:44,255
Calendar

673
00:47:44,256 --> 00:47:45,287
Olivier Buyer Show

674
00:47:49,196 --> 00:47:50,357
Good work, everyone.

675
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:02,776
Ladies and gentlemen.

676
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:06,077
The 2021 Olivier de Saint Sauveur's...

677
00:48:06,546 --> 00:48:08,747
FW Buyer Show will now begin.

678
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:35,376
The security is going to be strict because nothing's been launched yet.

679
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:36,807
The moment the designs leak, people will start making copies.

680
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,306
Why did you bring me here? It's only for buyers.

681
00:48:39,307 --> 00:48:41,215
The more you see, the more you'll learn as an artist.

682
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:42,615
It'll do you good.

683
00:48:42,616 --> 00:48:44,086
Keep a look out for what the buyers like...

684
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,545
and what you think will be in trend next season.

685
00:48:46,546 --> 00:48:49,187
You see? This is how attentive I am.

686
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,457
You were never a guy with pure intentions.

687
00:48:53,156 --> 00:48:54,397
You're clever.

688
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:56,195
This is a bribe.

689
00:48:56,196 --> 00:48:58,227
It's herbal medicine made in Korea that costs 50 dollars each.

690
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:01,196
It's expensive. You can have it.

691
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:06,506
I want to be with you all night.

692
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:08,337
I'm sorry.

693
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:10,476
Olivier is a real big shot.

694
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:11,746
I just wanted to meet him to give him my business card,

695
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:12,877
but I got rejected.

696
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:17,986
So I got you a ticket to his after-party.

697
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:19,287
I'm not going.

698
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:23,156
He'll be shocked once he finds out that you're my little brother.

699
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:26,485
I get offered a job,

700
00:49:26,486 --> 00:49:27,957
and now I even have a big brother.

701
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:29,857
You got a job? What company?

702
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:32,695
Do you know Hwang Chi Sook who works at The One?

703
00:49:32,696 --> 00:49:34,837
Yes, of course. The One is our client.

704
00:49:35,636 --> 00:49:37,607
By the way, how was the blind date?

705
00:49:39,236 --> 00:49:40,337
Do you think that's funny?

706
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:42,106
I'll let you off the hook just this once.

707
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,377
Do that one more time, and you'll never see me again.

708
00:49:43,577 --> 00:49:45,306
It won't happen again.

709
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:46,647
I had to do it for your mother.

710
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:48,046
Let's go.

711
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:37,126
We have a lot of talented artists.

712
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:38,425
I hope we get a chance...

713
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:40,365
to show off Olivier's amazing designs...

714
00:50:40,366 --> 00:50:42,537
through collaborations with our Asian stars.

715
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:33,747
What is this?

716
00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:37,687
Olivier already signed a contract with Viace.

717
00:51:37,957 --> 00:51:39,556
He was using the photo book as an excuse...

718
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:41,897
because he didn't know what to say to us.

719
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,556
I thought we were the strongest candidate.

720
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:45,095
He asked us to bring a photo book.

721
00:51:45,096 --> 00:51:46,997
We went through so much to shoot those photos.

722
00:51:48,136 --> 00:51:49,295
How could he do this to us?

723
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:50,566
So what's your plan...

724
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:52,065
and why did you take photos of the undisclosed designs?

725
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:54,336
I can get back at him by leaking them online.

726
00:51:54,337 --> 00:51:55,976
- Na Ri. - I'll have them copied...

727
00:51:55,977 --> 00:51:57,307
before the weekend's over, and then he'll learn.

728
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,776
How it feels to have your hard work go to waste.

729
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,787
I get how you feel. I really do.

730
00:52:05,386 --> 00:52:06,816
But you're a designer.

731
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:09,886
You know how fatal it is to have your designs copied.

732
00:52:10,216 --> 00:52:12,925
The entire year's worth of hard work will go down the drain.

733
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:16,627
You're a designer. You should be the last person to do such a thing.

734
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:18,796
- But Ms. Ha... - Delete them.

735
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:21,796
- Ms. Ha. - What makes a luxury brand?

736
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:26,207
A self-respected designer who prides in his or her designs.

737
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:29,537
Let's not stoop so low.

738
00:52:46,656 --> 00:52:47,926
Where are you going?

739
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:50,796
To meet Olivier.

740
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:54,066
We should at least let him know what he's missing out on.

741
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:08,307
Hwang Chi Sook?

742
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:10,905
Goodness, did he just smile?

743
00:54:10,906 --> 00:54:12,607
Why? What does it mean?

744
00:54:13,477 --> 00:54:14,577
Are you okay?

745
00:54:15,577 --> 00:54:18,846
Yes. Did I startle you?

746
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:25,256
I'm good.

747
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:43,906
Where in the world is Cookie?

748
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,877
Seok Do Hoon?

749
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:35,616
There's nothing I can do. I already signed the contract.

750
00:56:39,426 --> 00:56:42,196
But you haven't even looked at our designs.

751
00:56:42,457 --> 00:56:46,526
I'd like you to take a look at them and reconsider.

752
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:53,106
Unfortunately, I already made a deal with Viace.

753
00:56:53,107 --> 00:56:54,937
We even celebrated with a bottle of champagne.

754
00:56:55,577 --> 00:56:58,146
Everything was designed, manufactured, and completed...

755
00:56:58,147 --> 00:57:00,576
here in Korea.

756
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:05,985
I can guarantee that we have the best quality products in Korea.

757
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:09,457
Ms. Ha, what are clothes to you?

758
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:15,196
My youth and passion.

759
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:21,236
Although it won't last forever, I want it to be everlasting.

760
00:57:21,796 --> 00:57:22,837
What about design?

761
00:57:24,096 --> 00:57:27,005
Something I don't want to throw away.

762
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:29,776
It's still a dream of mine.

763
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:35,176
No, it's money.

764
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:41,587
Without money, you can't make or buy clothes.

765
00:57:42,256 --> 00:57:44,857
It's cruel, but that's how it is. It's how this industry works.

766
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:46,786
It was a done deal the moment Viace offered to pay...

767
00:57:46,787 --> 00:57:48,256
three times the original cost.

768
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:55,066
But your designs aren't so bad.

769
00:58:02,906 --> 00:58:04,236
Mr. J.

770
00:58:04,307 --> 00:58:06,247
I knew you'd come.

771
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:10,176
Shall we start talking business?

772
00:58:10,517 --> 00:58:13,386
It looks like we're already done talking.

773
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:15,457
What? When?

774
00:58:15,957 --> 00:58:17,057
Just now.

775
00:58:23,096 --> 00:58:24,156
I'm sorry.

776
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:29,436
I thought Mr. Olivier de Saint Sauveur...

777
00:58:29,437 --> 00:58:31,837
would appreciate my photos.

778
00:58:32,537 --> 00:58:34,877
But I guess I was conceited.

779
00:58:36,176 --> 00:58:38,807
What? They were your photos?

780
00:58:39,006 --> 00:58:40,176
We should go now.

781
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:42,516
Let me buy you a drink for getting rejected...

782
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:43,676
by a businessman with horrible taste.

783
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:46,616
Is that okay with you?

784
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,115
No, wait.

785
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:51,426
Mr. J, please wait.

786
00:58:53,426 --> 00:58:55,397
They were really your photos?

787
00:58:56,057 --> 00:58:57,397
Oh, my gosh.

788
00:59:06,037 --> 00:59:07,236
You're Mr. J?

789
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:09,307
You would've known if you had told me your name.

790
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:12,776
What's your name?

791
00:59:16,747 --> 00:59:19,687
I was wondering how I should address you if we met again.

792
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:23,656
The encounters that have no impact mean nothing to me.

793
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:26,026
Why did you act like you didn't know me?

794
00:59:27,256 --> 00:59:28,827
I didn't think it was necessary.

795
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:34,897
Ms. Hwang.

796
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:39,966
Cookie?

797
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:50,716
The show's over.

798
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:53,046
I'm heading back to Seoul tomorrow.

799
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:55,417
Then I'll see you in Seoul.

800
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,526
I'm not Hwang Chi Sook.

801
01:00:01,926 --> 01:00:03,026
I know.

802
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:05,066
Ms. Ha Young Eun.

803
01:00:54,877 --> 01:00:57,646
Now, We Are Breaking Up

804
01:00:57,647 --> 01:00:59,786
He must've liked you.

805
01:00:59,787 --> 01:01:01,385
It's hard not to like me.

806
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:02,715
I'm free until Friday.

807
01:01:02,716 --> 01:01:03,815
- Who is it? - What?

808
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:06,087
This may be a surprise, but go ahead and say hello.

809
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:07,826
He's Yoon Jae Guk,

810
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:09,655
the son of your father's acquaintance.

811
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:12,966
No, he didn't look like this.

812
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:15,536
I want Chi Sook to have a big role for the 30th anniversary event.

813
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:17,695
- She's Director Hwang. - What a crazy coincidence.

814
01:01:17,696 --> 01:01:19,406
You always leave after saying your piece.

815
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:22,276
I don't want there to be any unnecessary misunderstandings.

816
01:01:22,377 --> 01:01:23,436
Why are you getting so ahead of yourself?

817
01:01:23,437 --> 01:01:25,246
I never asked you out or proposed to you.

818
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:26,505
- Which way are you headed? - Why?

819
01:01:26,506 --> 01:01:27,706
So I can go the other way.

820
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:29,345
I swear I filed an order to the factory.

821
01:01:29,346 --> 01:01:31,146
Ms. Ha, how are you going to take care of the mess?

822
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:33,545
How will you promote anything without Olivier?

823
01:01:33,546 --> 01:01:35,516
Did you send invitations to everyone at The One?

824
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:36,655
The fit session is tomorrow.

825
01:01:36,656 --> 01:01:38,456
I'll try to convince him again.

826
01:01:38,457 --> 01:01:40,086
It just shows that you guys are a domestic brand.

827
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:41,996
The event starts in 15 minutes.

828
01:01:41,997 --> 01:01:43,095
Is the main celebrity coming or not?

829
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:44,096
Ms. Shin Yu Jung.

830
01:01:44,227 --> 01:01:46,327
I'm Ha Young Eun, a team manager at The One.

831
01:01:46,796 --> 01:01:50,235
Ms. Ha, you're always so versatile and hard-working.

832
01:01:50,236 --> 01:01:51,806
What happened to the photos?

833
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,166
Who took this photo?

834
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,976
It was taken by an unknown photographer.

835
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,175
The exposure is a mess,

836
01:01:56,176 --> 01:01:57,976
- and the angle is bad too. - Mr. Yoon.

837
01:01:57,977 --> 01:01:59,876
I'm in charge of the photoshoot today.

838
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:01,445
By any chance, do you know Yoon Soo Wan?

839
01:02:01,446 --> 01:02:03,115
- I had forgotten about him. - Do you know him?

840
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:04,545
I thought I had forgotten all about him.

841
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,087
But here I am hearing his name again.

842
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:18,426
Now, We Are Breaking Up
