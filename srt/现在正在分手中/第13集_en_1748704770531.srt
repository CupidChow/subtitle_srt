1
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:18,933
What? Where is my car key?

2
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,812
I'm sure I put it in my pocket.

3
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:36,412
I can't find it.

4
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:40,623
Sorry!

5
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,323
Why is Cookie sorry?

6
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,263
What's going on?

7
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,573
I just wanted to go to work with you.

8
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:56,233
And after all that,

9
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,573
how about we break up...

10
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:00,942
with a smile on our faces?

11
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:05,642
Do not feel sad because of your memories of yesterday.

12
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:09,816
Do not wear yourself out...

13
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,483
by being concerned about tomorrow.

14
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:13,983
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:18,023
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:20,162
Instead,

17
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:24,993
let's just smile, be happy,

18
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:27,832
and love each other today.

19
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,233
Let me love her all I want...

20
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:36,213
just for one month.

21
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,042
Then I'll break up.

22
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:43,953
This may be farewell...

23
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:46,822
But let's call it love.

24
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,463
The weather is nice.

25
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:00,303
I know. It's the perfect weather for a kiss.

26
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:03,673
Is it not?

27
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,857
Are you busy today? Let's eat lunch together.

28
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:19,252
Let me check my schedule later.

29
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,327
One glass of water doesn't equal another.

30
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,566
One may just quench the thirst.

31
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,222
The other you may enjoy thoroughly.

32
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:35,632
Now, We Are Breaking Up

33
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,247
You're late, right? Should I speed up?

34
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,416
No, just drive safely.

35
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,613
Episode 13

36
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,252
You really didn't have to rush over like that.

37
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:53,352
- Anyway, thank you. - Don't mention it.

38
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,696
I have nothing to do at work if I go too early anyway.

39
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:58,093
There you go again.

40
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,267
Did rushing out make you forget...

41
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:02,297
the responsibilities of a good director?

42
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,363
I know my responsibilities.

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,107
I just meant that there won't be much to do...

44
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:07,936
because we're sending over our products today.

45
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,102
I see.

46
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:11,132
I should be the one to thank you.

47
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,707
For what?

48
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,673
For helping us sign a deal with La Fayere...

49
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:17,277
so that we could get a chance to sell our clothes abroad.

50
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:20,286
It was thanks to your superb teamwork with Ms. Ha.

51
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,812
All I did was help you guys lay the groundwork.

52
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,583
But I must say, I did an excellent job.

53
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:27,523
Also, my dad...

54
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,423
isn't as disappointed with me as he used to be.

55
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,192
Now, that's something to congratulate.

56
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,203
This has never happened before.

57
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,102
Guys always hit on me because of my dad and background.

58
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:45,872
You're the first guy to like me purely for who I am.

59
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,813
You're hard not to fall for, Chi Sook.

60
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,182
Focus. Please.

61
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:06,222
We're here. Have a good day.

62
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,032
- I'll call you. - Okay.

63
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:29,912
Mr. Kwak.

64
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,487
You haven't had coffee yet, right?

65
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:35,992
I got you a latte, your favourite.

66
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:37,792
Ms. Seo.

67
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,763
It's just coffee.

68
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,263
Let's just treat each other like we used to in the past.

69
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:45,693
We were happy.

70
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,903
Those darn jerks.

71
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,703
Hello, this is Ha Young Eun speaking.

72
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:26,742
Yes.

73
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,403
Oh, I see.

74
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,573
Yes, thank you.

75
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,412
Yes.

76
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,412
They asked you to call them back.

77
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:39,782
We've been getting tons of calls for you this morning.

78
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:41,653
Yes.

79
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,792
Thank you for the offer.

80
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:46,292
Okay, bye.

81
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,066
Hello, this is Ha Young Eun speaking.

82
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:55,032
What if Ms. Ha gets a job offer from another company?

83
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:57,802
Did you see how Olivier reacted to Ms. Ha?

84
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:03,016
He kept clapping like a seal.

85
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,832
I wouldn't be surprised if she gets job offers from other companies.

86
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,586
The center of fashion is Paris.

87
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:09,322
Do you think I should pack ahead of time?

88
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:13,427
Wait a minute. What makes you think you're going with her?

89
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:14,852
Come on, guys.

90
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,922
Olivier wouldn't have been able to log into the show...

91
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,792
if it weren't for all those electric wires in my hands.

92
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,597
When I heard the connection was unstable,

93
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,896
I took care of things using my gaming experience.

94
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:26,737
So Young, you know what I'm talking about, right?

95
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,403
It's only right that you do.

96
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,032
Stop talking to me like I'm your friend.

97
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,823
Where do you think she'll end up?

98
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,146
She should work for someone who's at least on Olivier's level.

99
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,542
- Totally. - I agree.

100
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:40,047
Are you going to go with her?

101
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:42,042
Of course. What about you?

102
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,412
If you and Ms. Ha both leave, then I'd get to take over.

103
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,122
- It's hard to decide. - Are you kidding me?

104
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,253
- Gosh. - I can't decide.

105
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:52,922
I'm going. You're coming too, right?

106
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:55,227
If Ms. Ha asks me to come, why would I refuse?

107
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,032
Here's what's important. Can any of you guys speak French?

108
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,503
Bonjour.

109
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,537
- Gosh, what is that? - That was so bad.

110
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,133
What's the matter?

111
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,313
Energy Q

112
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:13,213
What's this?

113
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:17,813
It's my way of thanking the treasure of our company.

114
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,526
- Pardon? - Throughout life,

115
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,026
there's something I've learned.

116
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:24,696
Life is filled with temptations,

117
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:28,093
but you should always stay strong.

118
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:32,532
By any chance, if you get job offers from other companies...

119
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:35,407
just because of one successful show, try not to get swayed...

120
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,037
or consider the possibility of working at another company.

121
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,302
I'm asking you not to do that as a fellow colleague.

122
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:43,242
But of course, I already know that you're not that kind of person.

123
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,883
- Thank you for the drink. - Of course.

124
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,513
Enjoy.

125
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,583
Gosh, that was a nice lunch. I'm so full.

126
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:55,927
- Have a great day, everyone. - Okay.

127
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:57,093
Have a good one.

128
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:59,492
What's gotten into him?

129
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,423
I guess he heard the rumours.

130
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,132
He should've treated her better from the get-go.

131
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,033
Hello, this is the Design Team of Sono.

132
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:07,438
Yes.

133
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,806
Na Ri, did you check the colours for the fabric orders we made?

134
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,573
- Yes. - Okay.

135
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:21,317
- Ms. Ha. - Yes?

136
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,183
- What are we going to do? - What is it?

137
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,083
What is it this time? Who was that?

138
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,823
- Nouvelle Vague. - What did they want?

139
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:32,122
They want to interview Ms. Ha!

140
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,296
- What? - What?

141
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,367
Are you serious?

142
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,368
Yes!

143
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:39,033
They just called. Isn't it great?

144
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:41,837
- I can't believe this. - Was it really Nouvelle Vague?

145
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,203
- What is it this time? - Isn't this great?

146
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:48,402
I'm Kim Seo Hyun, the chief editor at Nouvelle Vague.

147
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:51,077
Nice to meet you. I'm Ha Young Eun.

148
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:52,372
Congratulations.

149
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:55,043
I heard everyone loved the show you did for La Fayere.

150
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:56,982
Thank you.

151
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:59,217
You may not be the first domestic brand...

152
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,756
to sign a deal with La Fayere,

153
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,727
but Sono's probably the first brand to receive orders...

154
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,693
from Olivier himself.

155
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:07,327
Is that so?

156
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,022
That's why I wanted to meet you.

157
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:12,197
We'd like to do an interview and publish it in our magazine's...

158
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,703
Up-and-coming Designer section next month.

159
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,682
The article is going to be six pages long.

160
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:20,073
You'll be the first Korean designer to make it on that section.

161
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,617
Of course, she should do it.

162
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,457
Do you think they'll also include photos of our clothes?

163
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,056
That's incredible. Normally, it costs thousands of dollars...

164
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,857
to have them add a photo in their magazine.

165
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:39,597
Do you think our clothes will be on the cover of the magazine?

166
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:41,126
That won't ever happen.

167
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,497
It costs a couple hundred million to make it on the cover.

168
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,296
They're probably booked for the entire year anyway.

169
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,006
How about we ask Ms. Ha to wear one of our clothes...

170
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,506
- to the interview? - That's a great idea.

171
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,536
Right?

172
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:51,406
I know magazines aren't as popular as they used to be,

173
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,207
but they still upload articles...

174
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,977
on online platforms and social media pages.

175
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,913
This is going to have a huge marketing effect.

176
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:00,087
Wait. I want my design in the magazine.

177
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,117
Gosh, that's not fair.

178
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:02,118
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Why?

179
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,857
Wait. You didn't do anything,

180
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,187
- so you don't get a say. - Then what's in it for me?

181
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,857
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

182
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,256
- What? No, too late. - You're out.

183
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:10,992
- You missed your chance. - Rock-paper...

184
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,636
If it's not too much to ask...

185
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,367
and the company is okay with it, I'll do the interview.

186
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,602
Plus, it'll be good for Sono.

187
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,732
Why are you telling me that now?

188
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:24,303
What's wrong?

189
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,207
I already ate two cookies.

190
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,276
Carbohydrates. Oh, gosh.

191
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,573
Do I look swollen? Do I?

192
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,942
Then I'll tell them to send me the interview questions.

193
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,087
You have my consent.

194
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,612
Did they ask for anything else?

195
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:40,323
Do they not want to interview the director?

196
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,482
If so, I'd be open to it.

197
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:45,622
Come on. Go up.

198
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,823
Gosh.

199
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:54,632
Director Shin, I told you to extend the contract with Sono.

200
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:58,203
A different brand has already agreed to take Sono's place.

201
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,707
We can't go back on our promise.

202
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,972
Promise?

203
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:06,217
Promises can be broken depending on our situation and decisions.

204
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,313
- Sir. - Listen to me, Director Shin.

205
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:12,382
Is it really impossible? Or are you just reluctant to do it?

206
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:15,083
If you care about the department store,

207
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,097
you'd better put our profit before your pride.

208
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:20,693
That's what you need to do right now.

209
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:32,972
You don't need to withdraw the cancellation of our contract.

210
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,813
Sono will not stay at Hills.

211
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:40,642
This time, I'm the one rejecting Hills Department Store.

212
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:50,252
Did you bring everything? Make sure you confirm everything.

213
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:51,722
Here.

214
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:54,467
So Young, ask Chi Hyung to move the boxes.

215
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,837
I noticed during the show that he's full of energy.

216
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,937
Why do I always have to do things that require strength?

217
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,036
I'd rather use my brain than exhaust my body.

218
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,602
She's stronger than me.

219
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,607
Let's get on with our work.

220
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,447
We need to get ready for the next season.

221
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:12,276
Time really flies, doesn't it?

222
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:13,817
It really does. I feel like I became a designer yesterday.

223
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,413
People are the ones...

224
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,583
that give meaning to life.

225
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:32,293
How did it go?

226
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,502
What's wrong? Did it not work out?

227
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:39,333
Gosh, I clearly told Cedric to do a good job.

228
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:43,913
Two months. They want us to open up a pop-up store...

229
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,872
at La Fayere for two months.

230
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:03,232
In my case, it was a woman who bought my photo...

231
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,163
when no one else noticed me.

232
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:09,402
I had almost given up photography, but I didn't.

233
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:13,372
The theme of the show is An urban secret garden.

234
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,416
There should be special effects for the highlight, right?

235
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:18,312
Yes, don't be stingy and make it look flashy.

236
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:23,612
You're the only man I can throw a tantrum to.

237
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,553
Anytime.

238
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:38,193
If you think about it,

239
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:42,803
maybe life is about meeting someone...

240
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,002
and falling in love.

241
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:52,872
2021 Specification Sheet

242
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:55,943
Woori Photo Studio

243
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,012
A meal?

244
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:02,152
Come to think of it, I've never treated you a meal.

245
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,093
I was never the ungrateful type.

246
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:08,923
Sure. Where should we go?

247
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,107
We're going to cook?

248
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:15,107
Just taking you to a restaurant to express my gratitude

249
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,833
felt like it lacked sincerity.

250
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,602
Do you even know how to cook?

251
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:21,803
I'll find the recipes on the web.

252
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,522
Can you raise it up a little?

253
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,222
A little closer.

254
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,136
Is onion next? An onion...

255
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,333
You can take it back now.

256
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,632
- For about 1 to 3 minutes. - Why not just come closer?

257
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,602
Come closer. A little closer.

258
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:53,502
Heat the pan.

259
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,276
You can go back now.

260
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,516
- Does it say 3mm? - Are you doing this on purpose?

261
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,272
Why don't you just hold it yourself?

262
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,612
- What do you mean? - I don't know why I'm smiling.

263
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:08,756
When you make clothes, 1mm makes a huge difference.

264
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:10,426
Isn't it too vague to say,

265
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,126
add the sauce and stir-fry until it's ready?

266
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,382
Not many people find that too difficult to understand.

267
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,222
I'll do the dishes.

268
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,262
Of course you should.

269
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:22,902
We could've just cooked something simple like pasta.

270
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,902
Korean dishes are hard to make.

271
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,602
I wanted you to eat homemade food.

272
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:30,073
I opened your fridge earlier, and I found water, beer,

273
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:32,693
and a few side dishes that seemed to have been there for ages.

274
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:36,046
It's boiling. Open the lid.

275
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,183
Oh, okay.

276
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,823
Add the tofu.

277
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:46,666
- Add a little bit of sesame oil. - A little bit?

278
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,327
Not too much. Just a little bit.

279
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,522
Okay.

280
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:54,102
- I think you added too much. - That was a bit too much.

281
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:56,207
- Are you going to fix this? - Is there anything I can fix?

282
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,803
- Something you can fix? - Yes.

283
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,077
- There's not much to do. - It looks delicious.

284
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,343
It looks delicious, right?

285
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,776
- I'm hungry. - Are you hungry?

286
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:05,313
Yes. The doenjang stew looks delicious too.

287
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:06,913
It'll blow your mind away.

288
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,453
We're in trouble. The moon is about to rise.

289
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:17,126
Leave the rest to us. Hurry up.

290
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:20,122
- We need to get ready. - Okay.

291
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:22,663
Shall we begin?

292
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:25,793
This dress is so pretty.

293
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:27,803
Thank you.

294
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,837
I also love the tuxedo.

295
00:16:30,838 --> 00:16:33,573
The pain is going to get worse.

296
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:38,043
The cancer has spread to the nerves surrounding your pancreas.

297
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,043
You will feel a lot of pain in your upper stomach.

298
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,273
Mom, take your medicine.

299
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:15,086
Goodness, it's not your job to make sure I take my medicine.

300
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:16,952
Dad does it all the time.

301
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,083
You don't need to do this.

302
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:27,563
Ji Min, go back to watching the cartoon. I'll do this.

303
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,533
The pain will be gone soon.

304
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,813
I'm okay. You can watch your cartoon.

305
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:47,612
Everything's fine. Watch your cartoon, Ji Min.

306
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,253
It's been ages since I've had proper homemade food.

307
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:57,952
Do you like it?

308
00:17:58,428 --> 00:17:59,892
I love it.

309
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,683
Do you think you can make this on your own next time?

310
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,303
You practiced today.

311
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,942
You should cook for yourself at least once or twice a week.

312
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:22,843
I'll try to remember that.

313
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:32,952
Just a second.

314
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,692
Hello, this is Yoon Jae Guk.

315
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:39,293
Okay, I'll do that.

316
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:41,803
Okay, bye.

317
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,973
Who was it? What are you going to do?

318
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,172
It was the realtor.

319
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,786
I got rented the place for two months...

320
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:55,962
because that was how long it was going to be vacant.

321
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,152
But what's the issue?

322
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:02,922
Someone apparently wants to sign a lease.

323
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:09,622
I'll have to empty the place next month.

324
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,132
I see.

325
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:20,803
At least you'll be there until next month.

326
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:24,843
Well, yes.

327
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:41,223
- Is it not spicy? - No, it's not spicy at all.

328
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,922
It has a clean taste.

329
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,932
Let me try the soup.

330
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,833
The doenjang stew tastes good.

331
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,803
It tastes amazing.

332
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,442
You're complimenting yourself.

333
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:03,187
It's good.

334
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:04,682
How are you such a good cook?

335
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,326
You should open up a restaurant if you get bored in the future.

336
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,397
- Do you think so? - I think it's a great idea.

337
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:12,192
- It's really good. - It is.

338
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,162
This looks delicious.

339
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,276
Where's my food?

340
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:29,303
We're strangers now. Why should I cook for you?

341
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:32,743
Get off your high horse. It's just food.

342
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,313
Just food? Then you can cook for yourself.

343
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:38,917
Fine, I will.

344
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:40,826
I've had enough. I'll cook for myself.

345
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,427
I just have to rinse the rice...

346
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,553
and the rice cooker will do the rest.

347
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,093
You do that.

348
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:52,192
Darn you.

349
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:16,023
You're making such a fuss when you're just making rice.

350
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,122
Will you be able to eat before you turn 70?

351
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:44,152
Darn it.

352
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:46,112
Yes.

353
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,023
Let's get something nice to eat.

354
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,352
Book a table at a nice place.

355
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,622
Call our other alumni too.

356
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,192
Okay, bye.

357
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:58,093
Where are all my socks?

358
00:21:58,168 --> 00:21:59,632
I have nothing left to wear.

359
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,233
You were a teacher your whole life...

360
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:05,702
and you forgot the previous lesson already?

361
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,546
We're in the process of getting a divorce.

362
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:11,013
Why would you ask a stranger about your socks?

363
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:17,217
Seriously? You're so stingy!

364
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:19,556
You said I never earned a cent,

365
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:22,127
so I don't have a claim to this house.

366
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:25,056
If I think about how you treated me because you have a job,

367
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,122
I haven't even started yet.

368
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:30,026
What am I to wear, then?

369
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,293
Want me to lend you mine?

370
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,132
It'll cost you two dollars.

371
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,333
Darn it.

372
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:40,872
That silly man.

373
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:52,882
One, two, three.

374
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:56,422
I heard you're transferring to another brand.

375
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:58,452
Only because Sono's leaving.

376
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:01,023
I heard a foreign brand had an opening.

377
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:03,326
Thanks for your help up until now.

378
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,632
Come on.

379
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,937
They're pulling a brand that got into a French department store.

380
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:08,402
Even I'm upset about it.

381
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:10,803
You're upset too, aren't you?

382
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:13,132
The decision was made already.

383
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:15,073
I won't hold onto regrets.

384
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,442
I'll do my best to sell your clothes until my last day here.

385
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:20,583
Okay. Thank you.

386
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,343
Let's have a look.

387
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:26,086
I want it to look casual. Can you hold it up for me?

388
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:27,253
Okay.

389
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:29,182
- Yes, like that. - Will this do?

390
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:31,556
Did you pinch the back?

391
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:34,122
- The back? I'll pull it tighter. - Yes, please.

392
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:39,733
Congratulations, Ms. Ha.

393
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:43,803
I thought you were reckless.

394
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,773
Jumping into something that everyone thought was pointless.

395
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:53,743
I didn't do it to sell lots of our clothes...

396
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:55,743
and to get our brand known abroad.

397
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:59,612
We wanted to break through the prejudice that we'd fail,

398
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:01,523
and show the naysayers...

399
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:05,622
that their bias about us was wrong.

400
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,362
Do you think you succeeded?

401
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:10,833
To a certain extent.

402
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:15,503
These positive results might not last long.

403
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:18,803
Still, you asked to see me again.

404
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:21,162
Without having to pay the increased commission...

405
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:22,872
or having to grovel to you,

406
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,773
you extended your hand to us first.

407
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,283
That alone...

408
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,043
makes me think my attempt was meaningful.

409
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:34,483
If you don't do well in the upcoming season,

410
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:37,127
we'll have to renegotiate the extension of your contract.

411
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:38,993
Regarding that,

412
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:41,263
I'd like you to contact my company.

413
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:47,833
Ms. Ha.

414
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:51,602
Can you let Jae Guk go?

415
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:55,602
You said you love him.

416
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:57,642
If you love him,

417
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:59,942
can you let him go?

418
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:06,813
I don't think...

419
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:11,852
love has just one shape or look.

420
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,566
Forcing someone to stay close...

421
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:19,093
isn't the only way to continue to love someone.

422
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:41,983
Hi, Mi Sook.

423
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,922
Ha Young Eun. Are you busy today?

424
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:47,593
I just finished putting up the Hills display. Why?

425
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,823
My dear friend.

426
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:53,233
Can you take the afternoon off to hang out with me?

427
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:55,102
Right now?

428
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:07,813
Jeon Mi Sook, how could you?

429
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,013
You call each other best friends,

430
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,013
but today, you called me first?

431
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:14,483
Get to work before she sulks too much.

432
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:17,392
Why are you making so much kimchi?

433
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:21,323
I won't be able to make any in the fall.

434
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:22,997
I made some pickles.

435
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,862
Don't forget to take some with you.

436
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:31,207
When I'm dead and gone and you open your fridges...

437
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,407
and see...

438
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:35,303
the kimchi and pickles I made for you,

439
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:36,872
would that be scary?

440
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,947
How can you say that so nonchalantly?

441
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:43,513
I have no regrets.

442
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:47,553
I washed all the winter blankets and hung them out in the sun,

443
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:51,793
and I made each of you a box of kimchi.

444
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:54,866
I was loved by many during my lifetime,

445
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,823
and loved many before my passing.

446
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:59,362
Wouldn't you say I had a pretty good life?

447
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:02,407
Your kimchi is the best.

448
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,402
How delicious will it be this time?

449
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:08,073
Have a taste. Tell me if the stuffing tastes right.

450
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,172
How is it? Is it so good you can't speak?

451
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:15,712
Shall I have some too?

452
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,387
How is it? It's bland, isn't it?

453
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,497
I must've bought the wrong salted shrimp.

454
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,657
I kept adding some and it still tastes bland.

455
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:29,392
No, it's... It's not bland at all.

456
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:33,333
- It's not bland. - The doctor said...

457
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:36,506
the hormones might affect my sense of taste.

458
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:37,902
No, it tastes fine.

459
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:40,672
It's just right.

460
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:42,046
Young Eun, Chi Sook

461
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:44,343
Who gets the third box?

462
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:46,912
Oh, that?

463
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,043
Someone else.

464
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,813
Work faster. We don't have all day.

465
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,586
How many heads of cabbage did you buy?

466
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:56,852
It's killing me.

467
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:02,093
No. She's happier that she gets to skip taekwondo to see Grandma.

468
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:03,467
Don't worry.

469
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:05,392
Have fun with your friends.

470
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:07,833
Ji Min. Say goodnight to Mom.

471
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:09,503
Mom, goodnight.

472
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,533
Okay, goodnight.

473
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,043
Cheers.

474
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:25,152
This feels like we're on a school field trip.

475
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:28,823
Your first love, the PE teacher, must be 60 by now.

476
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:33,452
He said he'd wait for me to graduate from high school,

477
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:35,796
then sent a wedding invitation just a month later.

478
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,122
What a traitor.

479
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:39,632
That was my first ever heartbreak.

480
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,303
Life is full of breakups and farewells.

481
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:47,372
You spend each day saying goodbye.

482
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,573
Oh, his shirts. Oh, dear.

483
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:56,112
Do you think you're in the position to worry about shirts?

484
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:57,856
He can go naked if he runs out.

485
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,013
The living manage to go on just fine.

486
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,323
Don't worry about your husband.

487
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,192
You're right.

488
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:11,833
The living must go on.

489
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,132
Is she prettier than me?

490
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:16,602
Who?

491
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,872
Seo Min Kyung.

492
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:22,803
Ms. Seo?

493
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:26,543
She's not pretty at all. She's just a flirting fox.

494
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,882
You knew?

495
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:38,753
Mi Sook.

496
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:43,892
Oh... Forget about it.

497
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:45,932
It's fine.

498
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:49,533
It's okay, so don't say a word.

499
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:53,333
I don't believe this.

500
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:58,513
Why should we not say a word?

501
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:01,316
I held back for your sake.

502
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:03,882
If I could have my way, I'd have torn them into shreds.

503
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:08,152
How can you know about it and be so calm?

504
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,452
Are you enlightened? Are you a saint?

505
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:14,593
Soo Ho's just 36 years old.

506
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:17,362
He has a long life ahead of him.

507
00:30:18,037 --> 00:30:20,733
Do you expect him to stay single and always think of me?

508
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,033
Well, yes.

509
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:27,773
It was upsetting.

510
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:33,813
But then it was also a relief to know it was someone I knew.

511
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:36,912
I think she's a good person.

512
00:30:40,857 --> 00:30:42,826
Don't give me that look.

513
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:45,253
The living must go on living.

514
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:49,667
Let's talk about you. You and your love life.

515
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,192
Are things going well?

516
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:54,932
This is just way too upsetting.

517
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,662
What do you mean, Cookie?

518
00:31:23,168 --> 00:31:25,366
You won't extend your contract with us?

519
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:27,902
What kind of an unannounced breakup is this?

520
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:30,902
You said I can annul our contract whenever I want.

521
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,003
Don't sue me or anything.

522
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:36,073
What is it? Does someone want you on board?

523
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:38,313
Who is it? Where is it?

524
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,243
I got a call from Paris.

525
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:42,483
About what?

526
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:45,157
The photo association wants to host my exhibition.

527
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:47,412
An exhibition? For real?

528
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:51,997
You finally get to put on the exhibition you always wanted to?

529
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:54,096
So when do you get to work?

530
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,263
No. When do you come back?

531
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,602
Wait. Are you thinking of...

532
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:11,872
Him and I decided to break up.

533
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:15,912
Are you okay with that?

534
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,152
I'm not.

535
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:29,392
There are too many farewells.

536
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:35,733
My mom. My dad.

537
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,902
And him.

538
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,473
It's okay.

539
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:47,983
I can get through it all.

540
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:54,323
But Mi Sook.

541
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:00,962
How am I to part with you?

542
00:33:11,307 --> 00:33:13,102
How do I say goodbye to you?

543
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:16,303
How...

544
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,212
do I send you alone?

545
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:25,612
You brat...

546
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:35,793
I don't know what to do either.

547
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:42,303
Young Eun, I'm so scared.

548
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:34,482
If we never had to say goodbye, I wouldn't have known...

549
00:34:35,728 --> 00:34:37,252
how precious...

550
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:40,252
this time was.

551
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,962
How limited...

552
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,132
our time is.

553
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,203
Aren't you taking too much of a detour?

554
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,073
The traffic jam will be crazy at this time of day.

555
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:03,343
What if you're late for work?

556
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:07,413
- Then I'll be late. - What?

557
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:10,082
What are you going to do today?

558
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:13,292
I'll work on my Paris schedule.

559
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,033
You're going to Paris?

560
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:23,103
Paris, Marseille, Nice, and Alsace.

561
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:27,603
I got an offer to visit the major cities and take photos.

562
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:30,542
I see.

563
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,643
You'll go to all those places?

564
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,982
I'm envious already.

565
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,323
What about you?

566
00:35:43,827 --> 00:35:46,926
Nouvelle Vague will send over a list of questions today.

567
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,366
I'll edit those,

568
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:51,232
and put up my apartment for sale. I guess that's it.

569
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:53,862
Are you moving?

570
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:57,303
Yes, I plan to.

571
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:04,143
Can you hang out with me in the evening?

572
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:08,143
I'll free my schedule.

573
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:09,882
As if nothing's wrong.

574
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,152
As if I'm fine.

575
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:15,683
We head off.

576
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:19,453
To say farewell.

577
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,108
Nouvelle Vague Interview Guideline

578
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,542
Designer Ha Young Eun...

579
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:39,343
Ms. Ha.

580
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:44,712
Are those the questions from Nouvelle Vague?

581
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:46,812
Yes.

582
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,087
Amazing.

583
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:51,493
Will Sono's brand end up on the pages of Nouvelle Vague?

584
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:54,493
I'm so moved, Ms. Ha.

585
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,562
What's the problem?

586
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:02,433
Is something wrong?

587
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:09,272
I will not do the interview.

588
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:12,672
I believe you know why.

589
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:16,942
Not really. What did you not like about the questions?

590
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:19,817
How did you feel when you were...

591
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:23,482
acknowledged by Olivier, a world-famous fashion trendsetter?

592
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:25,393
That's a very basic question.

593
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:29,123
Why do you think Olivier acknowledged you?

594
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,696
That's something our readers would like to know.

595
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:35,332
Did you have Olivier in mind when you planned to enter Paris?

596
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:36,837
Did you not?

597
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,406
Do you expect Olivier to suggest a collaboration?

598
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,973
That's what everyone wants.

599
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:44,172
Not one question was about Sono.

600
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:49,013
Through me, you want to show the public how great Olivier is.

601
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:51,457
You want people to see what a great honour it is...

602
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,386
that he showed interest in me.

603
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,982
I'm saying I refuse to be used as a prop...

604
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:58,292
in your efforts to praise him.

605
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,422
Even if we were to talk about Sono,

606
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,792
would any of our readers show interest?

607
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,136
Nouvelle Vague writes only about luxury brands.

608
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:08,636
That's what we do.

609
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:12,136
And Sono is a prop you need to make the luxury brands stand out?

610
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:14,676
It's that or 6,000 dollars per page.

611
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:17,402
Would you rather pay 36,000 dollars to be in our magazine?

612
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:22,087
I get that you're excited your show was a success,

613
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:25,212
but you're willing to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

614
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,183
over that?

615
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:29,922
What opportunity?

616
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:33,292
It's a magazine for Koreans that's printed in Korean...

617
00:38:33,557 --> 00:38:35,732
but spew out anglicized words with no nationality...

618
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:39,362
to promote foreign luxury brands? You call that an opportunity?

619
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:44,203
That's where domestic brands currently stand.

620
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:46,033
Just because we're behind...

621
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:48,573
doesn't mean we're worth any less.

622
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:50,703
If you don't see that,

623
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,513
I won't grovel just to be in a few pages.

624
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,413
Excuse me.

625
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:13,993
What is Ha Young Eun like?

626
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:16,803
Well...

627
00:39:18,008 --> 00:39:19,502
She's someone I'm jealous of.

628
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,902
You are actually jealous of someone?

629
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,413
I was of her for a long time.

630
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:30,582
But this time she won my respect.

631
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,212
You respect her now?

632
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,353
I'm even more curious.

633
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:41,527
Woori Photo Studio

634
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:44,096
Today's tasks didn't take as long as I expected,

635
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,466
so I'm off work.

636
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:48,502
Sorry. I have one more appointment.

637
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:50,533
That's fine. I'll wait.

638
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,502
- Hello. I called you yesterday. - Hello.

639
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:57,203
You need a passport photo, right?

640
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:01,382
Here's a mirror.

641
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,736
Tilt your head a bit.

642
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:19,862
Director Hwang

643
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:22,832
That's nice. One, two.

644
00:40:23,807 --> 00:40:25,207
Pull your chin back slightly.

645
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,502
Good.

646
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,477
The call cannot be connected.

647
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:34,212
What is this brat thinking?

648
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:38,212
You refused to do the interview? Why?

649
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:42,656
Director Hwang

650
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:44,326
It's a global fashion magazine.

651
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:46,826
It's a lifelong dream for someone. What are you doing?

652
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:48,522
Ha Young Eun!

653
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,236
Lovely. One, two.

654
00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:54,362
Great.

655
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:58,603
One, two.

656
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:00,473
Okay.

657
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:12,417
Mr. Jay, contact us as soon as you book your plane tickets.

658
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:14,752
We hope to hear from you soon.

659
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:28,103
Hello?

660
00:41:28,938 --> 00:41:31,902
Ms. Seo? It's me, Ji Min's mom.

661
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:35,473
Hello, ma'am.

662
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:38,346
Thank you so much for watching Ji Min that day.

663
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:41,112
I didn't even have the chance to thank you properly.

664
00:41:42,148 --> 00:41:44,513
No problem at all. It was nothing hard.

665
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:48,522
I wanted to ask you if you buy kimchi.

666
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:53,093
I made too much kimchi this year.

667
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:55,493
If you don't mind, I'd love to give you some.

668
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:57,723
You want to give me kimchi?

669
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:04,533
Then feel free to send a little through Mr. Kwak.

670
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:08,672
He hates doing stuff like that.

671
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:12,973
Would you mind stopping by for a quick visit?

672
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:15,413
I'd love to have a cup of tea with you anyway.

673
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:19,712
Sure.

674
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:40,172
For Ms. Seo Min Kyung

675
00:42:40,478 --> 00:42:41,743
Was that my wife?

676
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:43,846
She's offering it with good intentions,

677
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:46,542
so I couldn't say no. I told her I'd stop by.

678
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,683
- Did she say anything else? - No, nothing else.

679
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:53,082
I have the photos from the show too,

680
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:55,323
so I'll go drop them off as well.

681
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,723
If I said no, it'd look even weirder.

682
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,742
Don't say much when you're there.

683
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:07,593
Don't worry too much.

684
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,547
You're the only employee who has the nerve...

685
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:19,877
to ignore the general director's text.

686
00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:21,942
If you weren't my friend, I'd fire you.

687
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:32,422
What? This is random.

688
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:34,123
Hey, how are things with you?

689
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:35,663
Jimmy

690
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,632
Young Eun, I really can't forget you.

691
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:44,303
That's none of my business.

692
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:45,933
Get lost.

693
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:48,172
Do Hoon

694
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:55,042
Mr. Seok? What are you up to?

695
00:43:56,188 --> 00:43:59,386
It's already decided.

696
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,826
What? Are you sure?

697
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:05,397
Yes, ma'am. The board members arrived at a unanimous decision...

698
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:08,826
Goodness. Watch a drama or listen to a song.

699
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:10,792
Just do one thing. Doesn't it drive you crazy?

700
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:12,866
It's the washing machine letting you know...

701
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,902
that it's done washing your socks.

702
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,136
We bought the washing machine over seven years ago,

703
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:20,203
yet you've never even heard the sound before.

704
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:24,676
I can't wait to see how the laundry turned out.

705
00:44:24,677 --> 00:44:25,846
I'm sure it turned out just fine.

706
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:28,062
I put in water and detergent. What more does it need?

707
00:44:28,617 --> 00:44:29,812
Darn it.

708
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:32,413
You never told me that I should wash them separately!

709
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:36,102
When you're studying English, do you also read your Korean textbook?

710
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:40,953
- Darn it. - Say something.

711
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:43,266
You turned down the honorary chairman position...

712
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,167
and even donated all your shares.

713
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:46,236
Are you sure...

714
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:49,132
You're smart, so I'm sure you'll figure it out.

715
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:52,402
Tell me if this shirt should be washed with...

716
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:54,473
coloured clothes or white clothes.

717
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,473
Then will you give me this house?

718
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:59,643
Forget it! Don't tell me anything!

719
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,783
Goodness. Are you having fun punishing me like this?

720
00:45:03,248 --> 00:45:04,783
If this is punishment,

721
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:07,656
does it mean I was being punished for the past 40 years?

722
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:09,727
I know that you single-handedly grew the company to what it is today,

723
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:11,127
but this is wrong.

724
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:12,493
I am not punishing you.

725
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:15,426
This is just how your life is going to be from now on.

726
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,792
I'm your wife.

727
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:21,033
- What? - We've lived together for 20 years.

728
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:25,036
I am entitled to your assets.

729
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:26,232
How could you ignore...

730
00:45:30,548 --> 00:45:31,672
Young Eun!

731
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:33,413
Young Eun!

732
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:40,212
Young Eun.

733
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:43,152
Can't you see that I'm flat out rejecting you?

734
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:45,323
I want to clear up the misunderstanding.

735
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:47,857
After all this time? Why not wait until next year?

736
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:49,826
I promise you that it won't happen again.

737
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,196
You know that I have such a soft heart.

738
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:53,437
She said she had nowhere to go, so I couldn't just turn her away.

739
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,337
I don't even want to know what happened anymore.

740
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,803
Young Eun, let's start over.

741
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:02,343
I heard you're not getting any jobs these days. That's why you're here.

742
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:04,743
I'm not that materialistic.

743
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:06,247
That's not love.

744
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:09,187
How could it be something else other than you and me?

745
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:10,683
Are you shooting a movie right now?

746
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:12,187
If you're done talking, I'm off.

747
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:13,413
Give me a chance.

748
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:16,823
I know I hurt you. Let me heal your broken heart.

749
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:20,397
It's all healed now. I'm seeing someone.

750
00:46:20,398 --> 00:46:21,522
No way.

751
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:23,623
What do you mean, No way?

752
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:25,192
Who are you?

753
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,232
This is my boyfriend.

754
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:30,933
Now that you've met him, I don't need to explain, right?

755
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,402
- Let's go, CEO Seok. - Okay.

756
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:40,812
He's a CEO?

757
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:47,553
Tomorrow?

758
00:46:47,657 --> 00:46:50,723
I've never had a chance to shoot photos of scenery like this.

759
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:53,363
I see.

760
00:46:55,907 --> 00:46:57,332
Don't your legs hurt?

761
00:46:58,007 --> 00:46:59,402
We walked a lot today.

762
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,643
When I'm going home, or when I'm on my way to work,

763
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:07,513
I always pass by here.

764
00:47:07,918 --> 00:47:12,352
But I think this is my first time walking this path.

765
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:18,723
In spring, I think about what would be popular in the autumn...

766
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:21,893
and what kinds of clothes I should design.

767
00:47:22,128 --> 00:47:23,223
Then when autumn starts,

768
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,542
I wonder if I should be ready for an early spring...

769
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:27,332
and what colours I should choose.

770
00:47:28,038 --> 00:47:33,073
So I never get to fully enjoy the season I'm in.

771
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:43,712
This is what this season smells like.

772
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:49,953
I'm happy we made a lasting memory of this day.

773
00:47:54,128 --> 00:47:57,522
A year, or two years from today...

774
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,962
If I ever get to walk a path like this on this day,

775
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,203
I will think of you.

776
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:11,743
And us, today.

777
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:38,272
Will Jae Guk be home late today?

778
00:48:38,438 --> 00:48:39,676
Yes, I think so.

779
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:41,772
He went to the outskirts to take some photos.

780
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,073
He did?

781
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:50,886
My gosh, you're such a good cook.

782
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,152
Do you like it?

783
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:55,326
Jae Guk is so lucky.

784
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:58,192
He can eat all your delicious food before he leaves for Paris.

785
00:49:00,197 --> 00:49:02,192
He's leaving for Paris? What do you mean?

786
00:49:05,498 --> 00:49:06,732
You didn't know?

787
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,743
Good luck with the shoot tomorrow.

788
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,473
I'm sorry I can't go to work with you.

789
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,342
You must have a lot to do to prepare for the shoot tomorrow.

790
00:49:53,478 --> 00:49:56,343
- You should get going. - After I see you go inside.

791
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:48,703
Let's go together.

792
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:51,062
I want to be with you.

793
00:51:36,148 --> 00:51:37,683
That's beautiful.

794
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:41,752
- Isn't this so nice? - You are a great photographer.

795
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,283
They all look amazing.

796
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:53,493
I was the one who told him we should break up.

797
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,502
But it's...

798
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,002
getting harder for me.

799
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:02,243
A road where flowers bloom during all four seasons.

800
00:52:05,648 --> 00:52:06,743
One, two.

801
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:11,143
This isn't the end, Young Eun.

802
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:15,883
Even if someone's gone, the memories will last forever.

803
00:52:19,498 --> 00:52:21,792
No one...

804
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:26,332
can stay by your side forever, Young Eun.

805
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:45,317
Do Hoon

806
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:47,852
Director Hwang Chi Sook

807
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:50,187
Drunkard Sook

808
00:52:50,188 --> 00:52:51,323
I'm sorry.

809
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,093
Thank you.

810
00:52:57,867 --> 00:53:00,696
The person you have reached is unavailable.

811
00:53:00,697 --> 00:53:03,102
Please leave a message after the tone.

812
00:53:08,548 --> 00:53:09,776
This is our first time drinking together.

813
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:11,143
Yes, sir.

814
00:53:12,248 --> 00:53:16,113
I asked to meet up for a drink to talk to you about something.

815
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:19,852
And to make sure you are prepared.

816
00:53:20,257 --> 00:53:21,723
For what, sir?

817
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:23,823
Chi Sook can't know about this.

818
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:29,622
Thanks to you, Chi Sook has changed so much.

819
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:31,842
I must say, you have managed to impress me.

820
00:53:32,697 --> 00:53:34,663
- Thank you, sir. - That being said,

821
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:40,272
I'd like to propose a partnership with The One.

822
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:42,477
Just like how you managed to make the buyer show a success...

823
00:53:42,478 --> 00:53:44,243
and went to Paris,

824
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,076
I trust that you can do the same for Sono...

825
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:47,843
and our menswear brands as well.

826
00:53:48,217 --> 00:53:50,913
I'd like you to handle all PR needs...

827
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,113
of The One's brands.

828
00:53:55,257 --> 00:53:56,652
Are you sure, sir?

829
00:53:56,788 --> 00:53:58,823
When it comes to PR, you're an expert.

830
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:00,723
So I'll leave it in your hands.

831
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:05,292
As for your retainer fee, how does a 15-percent increase sound?

832
00:54:07,197 --> 00:54:09,502
That is a big increase.

833
00:54:10,237 --> 00:54:11,732
Thank you, sir.

834
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,073
- Cheers. - Cheers.

835
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,276
How are things going between you and Chi Sook?

836
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:21,413
Oh, that...

837
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:25,556
I believe that she has totally opened up to me.

838
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:28,017
A little while ago when I couldn't use my car,

839
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:31,553
she came all the way to my place and drove me to work.

840
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:35,727
I'll give you all the support you need. Good luck.

841
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:37,393
Thank you, sir.

842
00:54:37,697 --> 00:54:39,133
Yes, come in.

843
00:54:40,137 --> 00:54:42,803
- Your food is ready. - Thank you.

844
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:44,462
Let me pour you one, sir.

845
00:55:01,788 --> 00:55:04,522
Director Hwang Chi Sook

846
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:12,033
- Good work today. - Thank you.

847
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:14,663
Hello, this is Cedric Roux.

848
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:19,832
Hello, this is Cedric Roux.

849
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:25,643
Mr. Kwak, you need to see this.

850
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:26,843
What is it?

851
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:30,743
I just got an email from DPHP.

852
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:36,482
I'm sorry, sir.

853
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,462
It's okay. You should take the call.

854
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:47,133
Oh, then let me quickly check my work email.

855
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:49,837
Mail

856
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:52,872
We just got an email from Olivier.

857
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:57,973
We just got an email from Olivier.

858
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:00,372
It's about wanting to recruit Ms. Ha Young Eun.

859
00:56:00,677 --> 00:56:01,883
They want to recruit her?

860
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:09,582
Olivier wants to make an official offer to Ms. Ha,

861
00:56:09,858 --> 00:56:12,652
and he's hoping Vision PR could handle it for him.

862
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:17,897
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

863
00:56:17,898 --> 00:56:19,567
This is so random.

864
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:22,906
What I'm saying is, I'm the only man who truly loves you.

865
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:26,602
All the other guys liked you because of your background.

866
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:28,473
They never loved you.

867
00:56:29,077 --> 00:56:30,573
They loved your money.

868
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:34,676
You crazy jerk. What are you saying all of a sudden?

869
00:56:34,677 --> 00:56:36,212
Tell me what's going on!

870
00:56:36,548 --> 00:56:38,283
Are you free tomorrow?

871
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:40,817
I want to spend some time with you. It's been too long.

872
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:42,053
You little...

873
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:45,752
Let me pour you one, sir.

874
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:47,192
They want to recruit someone?

875
00:56:47,757 --> 00:56:49,922
Who wants to recruit whom?

876
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:55,366
Oh, it was just something about work.

877
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:58,332
Does it have something to do with my company as well?

878
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,973
Someone wants my employee?

879
00:57:06,347 --> 00:57:07,473
Who?

880
00:57:08,518 --> 00:57:10,247
No, sir. It was just...

881
00:57:10,248 --> 00:57:11,542
Is it Young Eun?

882
00:57:22,927 --> 00:57:24,562
Another day is passing by.

883
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:32,502
When do you leave for Paris?

884
00:57:34,478 --> 00:57:36,272
Soon, I think.

885
00:57:57,597 --> 00:57:58,763
This is for you.

886
00:58:13,978 --> 00:58:15,812
I figured you could use a new bag.

887
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:19,513
This is really nice.

888
00:58:19,688 --> 00:58:21,582
I picked it out with all my heart and soul.

889
00:58:24,688 --> 00:58:26,593
It's not a breakup gift.

890
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:29,193
I just wanted to congratulate you on your new beginning.

891
00:58:31,768 --> 00:58:34,933
I wish you all the best in everything you do in Paris.

892
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:37,002
Are you sure...

893
00:58:38,737 --> 00:58:40,172
you don't want to go with me?

894
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:44,643
I thought...

895
00:58:45,677 --> 00:58:49,013
a breakup was always painful.

896
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,582
But the past few days,

897
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:54,383
I was really happy.

898
00:58:55,427 --> 00:58:57,683
Maybe when you have to part with someone,

899
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,453
you finally realize...

900
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:03,292
how much you really love that person.

901
00:59:05,538 --> 00:59:06,792
And...

902
00:59:07,668 --> 00:59:09,232
if we ever...

903
00:59:09,507 --> 00:59:11,902
cross paths again by chance,

904
00:59:14,108 --> 00:59:16,042
then I won't make any excuses.

905
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:20,772
I'll just try to believe...

906
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:22,982
that we were meant to be.

907
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:26,413
Okay.

908
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:29,122
When and if that happens,

909
00:59:31,228 --> 00:59:32,622
please do that.

910
00:59:45,938 --> 00:59:47,433
And when that happens,

911
00:59:51,077 --> 00:59:52,643
I will not let you go.

912
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:17,267
The person you're calling is on another line.

913
01:00:17,268 --> 01:00:19,772
Please leave a message after the tone.

914
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,042
Mr. Seok Do Hoon

915
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:31,783
Do Hoon

916
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:41,122
Do Hoon

917
01:00:44,628 --> 01:00:45,832
Hello?

918
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:28,033
Now, We Are Breaking Up

919
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:30,613
To tell you the truth, I already bought my flight ticket.

920
01:01:30,878 --> 01:01:31,946
When is your flight?

921
01:01:31,947 --> 01:01:33,676
Jae Guk will go to Paris.

922
01:01:33,677 --> 01:01:36,647
That is the right decision.

923
01:01:36,648 --> 01:01:39,553
Just once... I want to ask her to stay with me, just once.

924
01:01:39,557 --> 01:01:41,152
If not, I might go crazy.

925
01:01:43,887 --> 01:01:45,556
This is Olivier's offer.

926
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:48,397
I heard you came up with the name, Sono, yourself.

927
01:01:48,398 --> 01:01:49,797
No, it wasn't me.

928
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:52,437
A nameless photographer came up with the name.

929
01:01:52,438 --> 01:01:55,263
Thanks to the nameless photographer, Sono was born.

930
01:01:56,608 --> 01:01:58,063
Let me ask you just one more time.
