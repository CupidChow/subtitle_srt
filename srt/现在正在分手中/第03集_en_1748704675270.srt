00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,801
Now, We Are Breaking Up

2
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:40,710
By any chance,

3
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,310
do you know Yoon Soo Wan?

4
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,420
Do you know him?

5
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:59,131
Paris, 10 years ago

6
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,910
Excuse me.

7
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,241
Hello.

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,551
I'm looking for someone. Her name is Ha Young Eun.

9
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,521
Oh, okay. I'm glad I wrote this down.

10
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:36,630
I'm looking for Ha Young Eun.

11
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,230
I have something to pass on to her.

12
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,070
Ha Young Eun is right here.

13
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,840
- Oh. It's beautiful. - It's so pretty.

14
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,340
- The camera's rolling. - It's just me.

15
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:24,909
I think my face looks bigger.

16
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,610
- That's impossible. - Get closer to the camera.

17
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,111
- Move forward. - That can't be.

18
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,451
Young Eun. What shall we have for dinner?

19
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,181
Dinner? Kimchi jjigae?

20
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,820
You didn't bring any? You won't do.

21
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,559
How could you?

22
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,790
Okay, sorry.

23
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,930
Lots of people take photos here.

24
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,901
It's pretty. Let's take that photo.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,171
- That one? - Yes.

26
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,540
One, two, three.

27
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,680
He was a huge comfort at a time when life was exhausting.

28
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,740
Don't.

29
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,849
I will kiss you before I press the button.

30
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,910
Let's kiss.

31
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,720
It was short but bright,

32
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,730
and a love I dared to think would last forever.

33
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,061
Yes, I know him.

34
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,081
She's that Ha Young Eun.

35
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,860
May I ask you...

36
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,430
how you know him?

37
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,001
May I ask you why...

38
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,841
I must answer this question?

39
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,151
Ms. Ha, the models are ready.

40
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,800
I think the models are ready.

41
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,961
Let's get to work.

42
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,679
"Craft must have clothes,"

43
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,850
"but truth loves to go naked." by Vivienne Westwood

44
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,660
Now, We Are Breaking Up

45
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,789
Yes, I nabbed him.

46
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,790
Episode 3

47
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,631
Of all the people out there,

48
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,201
I met him, and in Busan.

49
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,040
Then I got back to Seoul and he's here too.

50
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,100
Plus, he's Mr. J.

51
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,240
You didn't know?

52
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,581
Oh, my gosh.

53
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:19,110
That "Mr. Paris" was J?

54
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,350
"Mr. Paris"?

55
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,850
When did he get that nickname?

56
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,631
I believe this is an extraordinary meeting.

57
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,401
You shouldn't give that much meaning to coincidence.

58
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,970
Fate comes disguised as a coincidence.

59
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,170
Walk past and it's a coincidence, grab it and it's fate.

60
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,280
So I need you to cooperate.

61
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,711
I plan to turn coincidence into fate.

62
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,900
Beautiful Clinic

63
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,370
Where you are born anew

64
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,381
You have some liver spots here.

65
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,610
Your skin is ageing very fast.

66
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,550
Some must think you're older than you really are.

67
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,021
One even denied my existence.

68
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,660
No, he didn't look like this.

69
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,761
This isn't the Seok Do Hoon I know.

70
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,630
Some laser treatment and a good skincare regime...

71
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:40,930
will make a huge difference.

72
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,670
Don't drink, smoke, and avoid UV rays.

73
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,729
Most importantly, avoid getting stressed.

74
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,140
Stress is the main cause of ageing.

75
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,141
Director Hwang Chi Sook

76
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:52,210
I'm not actively looking to get stressed.

77
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:55,580
It just comes to me at any given time.

78
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,850
Like right now.

79
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,050
Mr. Seok, you're more competent than I thought.

80
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,919
"Than I thought" hurts a bit,

81
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,021
but I am competent.

82
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,220
You accept praise too easily.

83
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,099
I'm the CEO of Vision PR,

84
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,800
the company at the core of fashion PR.

85
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,000
If I dare say so myself,

86
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,469
people in the industry call me "Clean Do Hoon".

87
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,210
I make everything a clean hit.

88
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:28,480
I conquer the whole PR market.

89
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,110
Mr. Seok Do Hoon.

90
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,051
Where are you?

91
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,490
- I'm in an important meeting. - Mr. Seok Do Hoon.

92
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,191
I'll call you back.

93
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,730
This is a very important meeting.

94
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,570
Is that what I said?

95
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,071
You have a poor memory.

96
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,411
You didn't eat that numbing cream, did you?

97
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:03,380
Don't feel ashamed. It's good to make an effort.

98
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,211
Don't get the scars wet.

99
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,080
This stays on really well, and it's my special gift to you.

100
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,620
This is not necessary.

101
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,291
I'm saying we should make some progress.

102
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,191
What kind of progress are you talking about?

103
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,561
I'd like us to create the future together.

104
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,630
"The future"? Do you mean...

105
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:24,900
I mean, Yoon Jae Guk.

106
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,941
I hope we get along.

107
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,740
I believe my work is done.

108
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,681
Even spots can't be taken out in one go.

109
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:39,181
And this is about two people, which is more complicated.

110
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,840
Gosh, what amazing photos.

111
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:10,211
Cookie, you take the best shots. Your photos just have this feeling.

112
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,120
Do you just have to select a few?

113
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:17,990
Do you have something to say?

114
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,661
Come on. Who are you?

115
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,389
You're Mr. J who conquered New York, London, and Paris.

116
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,630
I call you Cookie, and someone else calls you Mr. Paris.

117
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,759
This is the first time you worked with a domestic brand,

118
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,531
and I don't think we should just wrap it up like this.

119
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,541
What are you getting at?

120
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,370
I need to ask for a favour.

121
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,411
An interview?

122
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:44,810
With Mr. Yoon Jae Guk?

123
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,220
I told him already.

124
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,951
That Mr. Paris is Mr. J.

125
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,889
This photographer only works with high-end brands.

126
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,519
Even if we make the offer,

127
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,760
I can't say for sure if he'll accept.

128
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,000
Did you get his answer?

129
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:01,759
At 3pm, the day after tomorrow.

130
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,599
The editor in chief at Elle will come in person.

131
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,201
Mr. Seok even texted me.

132
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,470
Mr. Yoon said yes?

133
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,210
He must be well-connected with foreign celebrities.

134
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,910
If they mention us on Instagram,

135
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,610
Hye Rin is no match for them.

136
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,311
And I pulled off this difficult deal.

137
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,520
Ms. Ha, what do you think?

138
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,790
I think it will help...

139
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,591
improve The One's brand value.

140
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,730
I'll gather the materials we'll need for the interview...

141
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,530
and pass it to the Marketing Team.

142
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:35,230
I want you to be there in person to support the team.

143
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,370
Director Hwang managed to plan something for once.

144
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:39,900
Make sure it goes without a hitch.

145
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Yes, sir.

146
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:44,211
You're not meeting him just for work.

147
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,081
Don't forget this is a merger of families.

148
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,041
Okay.

149
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,880
You don't seem too inclined.

150
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,990
A more appropriate word would be "flustered".

151
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,790
Why would you be flustered?

152
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,561
You just have to do what you usually do, okay?

153
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,291
I'll have Marketing send the PR materials to your office.

154
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:08,400
Before you do that, we must sort things out.

155
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,441
If Dad finds out that you went on the blind date instead of me,

156
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,470
it won't be just me he calls in.

157
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,540
Of course. You're his daughter,

158
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,109
so he'll just glare at you,

159
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,781
but he will penalize me.

160
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:26,350
What do you say?

161
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,120
I've worked hard to build my career,

162
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,691
so I must protect it.

163
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,031
Oh, you want to meet for a meal first?

164
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,940
Yes, of course.

165
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,910
If we get to know each other first,

166
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:54,239
then it would make the interview more amicable and easier.

167
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,311
No.

168
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,910
I'm so sorry.

169
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:01,051
Mr. J is a homebody, and prefers to eat alone.

170
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,451
I'm sorry, Ms. Ha.

171
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,359
It's a meal plus prep meeting.

172
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,760
No pressure at all.

173
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:11,691
When shall we meet?

174
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:17,599
If you tell us when you're free, we'll make the time.

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,870
Let's meet this evening.

176
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,640
Very well, then. I'll call you back with a time and location.

177
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,640
I'll wait.

178
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,120
You seem very enthused all of a sudden.

179
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,921
It's just that I'm intrigued.

180
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,031
- I needed an excuse. - An excuse?

181
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,230
There's something I need to find out.

182
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,831
What's that?

183
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,930
Elle just called.

184
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,139
They want to know if they should run with Mr. J,

185
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,770
Cookie, or your real name Yoon Jae Guk.

186
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,211
Cookie? J?

187
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,281
What flower do you want to be called?

188
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,470
The person I met that day was not Ha Young Eun,

189
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:27,900
but Hwang Chi Sook?

190
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,040
In our business,

191
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,270
the one responsible doesn't always do the actual work.

192
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,009
What I do...

193
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,480
is done in the name of General Director Hwang.

194
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:38,551
I don't care about your company's stance.

195
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,120
But I cannot lie.

196
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,750
Misunderstandings are uncomfortable,

197
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,791
and explanations are a hassle.

198
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,860
Was it just an uncomfortable misunderstanding to you?

199
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:55,531
In Busan and in Seoul. The time we spent together.

200
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:58,301
It was just a happening.

201
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,370
Was that the case with Yoon Soo Wan too?

202
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,479
Here is The One's brief history.

203
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,911
If we work together,

204
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,520
you should know the basic facts.

205
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,720
Aren't you curious...

206
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:22,291
how I know Yoon Soo Wan?

207
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:29,031
This is the new season's concept and press release.

208
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,970
Read it before the interview.

209
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,270
I'll join you in five minutes.

210
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,581
Is the mood nice and soft?

211
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,110
Director Hwang will be here soon. Goodbye.

212
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,650
You like to have fun,

213
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,750
but not take responsibility.

214
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,791
You don't like being lonely,

215
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,890
but hate getting serious.

216
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,201
I get it. I'm like that too.

217
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,301
I think you've just crossed the line.

218
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:04,230
You should've watched who you picked.

219
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,931
Not all men are like me.

220
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,870
- Mr. Yoon. - Yoon Soo Wan...

221
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,671
said he was serious.

222
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:14,911
Did you know that?

223
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,520
Your guest is here.

224
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,350
Oh, dear. I hope I'm not late.

225
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,321
I explained the situation.

226
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,130
I'll leave so you can chat.

227
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,130
Ms. Ha, eat before you go.

228
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,880
Let's eat. I work hard to make a living, after all.

229
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:10,731
Ms. Ha isn't a fan of course meals.

230
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,500
She might work for me,

231
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,471
but I shouldn't dictate what she eats.

232
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:17,741
This looks good.

233
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,920
Young Eun.

234
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,561
Why do you eat so quickly?

235
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,629
Paris, 10 years ago

236
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,760
There's little time and so much to do.

237
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:42,660
I have to spend my 24 hours as if they're worth 48.

238
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,231
Spending time to eat is a luxury to me.

239
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,170
I feel better now.

240
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,940
Is it good?

241
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,261
Here.

242
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,041
I followed the recipe, but I'm not sure if it's good.

243
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,841
You should eat and enjoy one proper meal a day.

244
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:28,241
You can allow yourself this much.

245
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,890
It's good.

246
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,071
The darn jerk.

247
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,500
You don't have to do this all the time.

248
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,011
You're releasing other colours.

249
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:32,971
Don't you work all night tonight?

250
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,180
Eat it with ramyeon.

251
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:36,680
I feel bad.

252
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:40,321
Ms. Ha and I aren't like that. Don't feel bad.

253
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,720
You must be busy. You can go.

254
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:45,119
I'll put everything away.

255
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,591
I'll enjoy the food. Thank you.

256
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,561
Ms. Ha knows all sorts of people.

257
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,629
Celebrities help her,

258
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,971
and you always have her back.

259
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,240
This is for Ms. Ha, but for you too.

260
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,741
It's for everyone here. That's why I brought a lot.

261
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,811
Aren't you here because Sono's new collection is doing well?

262
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,751
I think it'll be difficult for subcontractors to handle it.

263
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:14,081
And Sono already picked the subcontractor to give the work to.

264
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
It's okay.

265
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,620
I'm sure Ms. Ha will give us some work.

266
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,760
I do need a specification sheet if I'm to secure workers.

267
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,561
So Young, say hello.

268
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,800
She's Ms. Choi. She's from one of our subcontractors.

269
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,471
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

270
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,439
She's a new recruit at Sono.

271
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,740
You can ask her for references from now on.

272
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,939
Okay. Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you.

273
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,341
Me too.

274
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:50,950
By the way, is that a specification sheet?

275
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,821
Yes, it is.

276
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:03,200
Ms. Choi.

277
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:04,831
Hey.

278
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:08,041
I heard you had a meeting outside. Did you just get back?

279
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,841
What brings you here at this hour?

280
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,071
I recently made a new batch of kimchi.

281
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,640
You really don't need to do that anymore.

282
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:18,011
I know you tried hard to give me work.

283
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,051
It's the least I can do to make myself feel at ease.

284
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
Gosh.

285
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,261
You should take a cab.

286
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,560
It makes me feel bad every time you do this.

287
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:33,761
I know you have bad knees. Go back comfortably.

288
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,261
I'll call you soon.

289
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:48,140
- You're back. - Hey.

290
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,781
Are the labels all in order?

291
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,109
Yes. We're cross-checking the number of clothes...

292
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,349
with the number of tags we sent to the factory.

293
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,879
It's going to be a race against the clock from now on.

294
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,290
Copies can be made very quickly.

295
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,850
I'm heading straight to the factory as soon as I get off work.

296
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:01,260
Keep an eye on the specification sheets...

297
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,020
so that they don't steal our labels and use that to make replicas.

298
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,331
- Okay. - Got it.

299
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:24,311
No way. This is crazy.

300
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,460
We do housework whenever we have free time during the evening.

301
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:44,231
Meanwhile, Chi Sook is having fun at a wine bar.

302
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,200
My first day with him.

303
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,001
I want to get drunk tonight.

304
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,170
And the guy's handsome.

305
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,370
How do you know?

306
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,511
She's having a blast.

307
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:01,750
And my husband is making sure everyone's happy.

308
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:05,790
Young Eun, let me tell you what my husband did.

309
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,460
He even knows a lot of stuff.

310
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,061
Really? He's an intellectual?

311
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,360
He knows Soo Wan.

312
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,400
What?

313
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,570
How does he know him?

314
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,841
Did you ask anything about him?

315
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:27,909
I didn't see the point in asking.

316
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,679
He totally wrecked your life.

317
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,609
You should at least throw a glass of water on him.

318
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,250
If you had stayed in Paris,

319
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,350
you would've done dozens of fashion shows,

320
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,551
and Vogue would've interviewed you.

321
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,061
Soo Wan didn't force me to come back to Korea.

322
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,690
I chose to come.

323
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:46,091
I'm just upset that you're wasting your talent...

324
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:47,531
on cleaning after Chi Sook's mess.

325
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,071
I really am wasting my talent, aren't I?

326
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,470
You're pretty much giving it away on a huge discount.

327
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:56,939
Instead, I have my own apartment in the center of Seoul,

328
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,041
and I even own a car.

329
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,311
I'm also able to give money to my parents every now and then.

330
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:05,011
I'd say I'm doing pretty well. Don't you think?

331
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,879
How long are you going to keep Soo Wan in your heart?

332
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,450
It's time you let him go.

333
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:12,790
We should hang up now.

334
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,619
I'm cleaning the bathroom. I need to wash the soap with water.

335
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,491
Hey, how does he know Soo Wan?

336
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,531
- Didn't you ask him? - I'm going to hang up.

337
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:37,450
Gosh, that's nice.

338
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,420
And the guy's handsome.

339
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,130
Let's not get attached. It won't make me get rich.

340
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,960
Just forget about it and move on.

341
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,670
That's the wise thing to do.

342
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,581
Young Eun, let's have a drink.

343
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,619
Why do you always crash at my place when you have an expensive bed?

344
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,990
If you're so scared of your dad, why don't you get a room at a hotel?

345
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:23,890
You brat. I laid the groundwork. Why can't you do the rest yourself?

346
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,540
I'm sorry, Ms. Ha.

347
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:40,010
She bought us drinks to thank us for the interview,

348
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,780
but we didn't expect her to get so drunk.

349
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:44,050
I'm sorry. We couldn't deal with her by ourselves.

350
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:47,680
Young Eun, bring Jae Guk in with you.

351
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:52,821
My shoes.

352
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,460
Gosh.

353
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,061
She says you should come inside.

354
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:01,460
Welcome to Young Eun's house.

355
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:10,610
Do you have any strong liquor?

356
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,071
There are tons of bars outside.

357
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,410
Just go and drink with him somewhere.

358
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,510
It's as if he's made of ice.

359
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:19,980
He's so cold.

360
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,551
Why do you think I invited the others?

361
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,991
Oh, my gosh.

362
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:30,991
Mi Sook is probably waiting for you. Shouldn't you go home?

363
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,130
Yes, I should go.

364
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,771
Mi Sook always told me about this place. Your house is...

365
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,400
really nice.

366
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,301
Ingo Maurer. Bang and Olufsen.

367
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,571
You even have china from Royal Albert.

368
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,581
You and I have similar tastes.

369
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,650
Except for this photo.

370
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,120
Unlike your luxurious taste, the photo is too amateurish.

371
00:26:57,521 --> 00:27:00,959
Should I recommend a piece of art that will go well on this wall?

372
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,061
These days, you can rent paintings by paying a monthly fee.

373
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:05,960
Just leave it.

374
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,200
That's who Young Eun is.

375
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,929
- That photo was 20 Euros. - What?

376
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,240
She bought it on the streets of Paris.

377
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,669
It was taken by an amateur photographer.

378
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,271
She told me it inspires and consoles her.

379
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,169
Anyway, whenever she's having a hard time,

380
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,040
she just sits in front of that rainy photo...

381
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,210
and gazes at it for a really long time.

382
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,751
I don't know about anything else,

383
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,021
but she can't seem to upgrade her taste when it comes to photos.

384
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:33,390
Are you going to stay and drink some more?

385
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,831
Oh, well, I'm a little tipsy.

386
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,160
Let's just have another glass...

387
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:42,801
if that's okay with you.

388
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:48,369
Of course, it's okay. Young Eun and I are very close.

389
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,140
Young Eun, we'll just have one more glass each.

390
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:52,271
How about some wine?

391
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,781
Great.

392
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,649
This place has a wonderful view.

393
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,880
Come take a look. Ta-Da.

394
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,850
Gosh, what an amazing view of the Han River.

395
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,061
Jae Guk.

396
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,410
- Enjoy. - Why don't you join us?

397
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,480
We're launching a new product tomorrow,

398
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:30,610
so I don't think I should drink.

399
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,321
Don't just stand there. Come join us.

400
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:45,291
Oh, okay.

401
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,670
We really don't click.

402
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,210
- What? - Forget it.

403
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,410
I know this house is nice, but it's pointless if you're alone.

404
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,649
All I want is a guy whom I can lean on.

405
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,350
That's all I need.

406
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,420
The best kind of consolation is through physical touch.

407
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:12,321
I'm glad you know what I mean.

408
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:13,521
Cheers.

409
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,360
Cheers.

410
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,560
Mi Sook

411
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:22,630
You'd better be home soon.

412
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:28,041
Why did he have to come here and see me like this?

413
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,210
Whatever. It's too late now.

414
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,610
Was this the kind of reality that you wanted to protect?

415
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,630
I gave you permission to drink at my place.

416
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,761
But that didn't mean you could come in here.

417
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:55,801
I wanted to see for myself.

418
00:29:57,971 --> 00:29:59,301
I also wanted to check something with you.

419
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:04,011
Director Hwang is outside. I don't want to cause a misunderstanding.

420
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,740
You mean you don't want to get caught.

421
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:08,610
- Mr. Yoon. - Yoon Soo Wan.

422
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,120
Does he really mean nothing to you?

423
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,950
Doe he really...

424
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,761
mean nothing to you?

425
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,791
What am I supposed to think of him?

426
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:29,031
So what if his feelings for me were sincere?

427
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,430
If he was so sincere, then why did he leave me...

428
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,400
without even saying anything?

429
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,110
What are you talking about?

430
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:48,950
Seoul, 10 years ago

431
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,430
Yoon Soo Wan

432
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:46,741
Young Eun

433
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,349
Young Eun

434
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,550
Missed call from Young Eun

435
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,560
The number you've dialled is unavailable now.

436
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,359
You will be directed to voicemail.

437
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,690
Please leave a message after the beep.

438
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:37,390
Soo Wan, it's me, Young Eun.

439
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:41,231
You never showed up.

440
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:46,700
Is this not where we were supposed to meet?

441
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:22,870
Men?

442
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:26,370
Love?

443
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,110
After some time, I learned...

444
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,551
that it's just full of empty hopes,

445
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:42,591
foolish decisions,

446
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,531
and that it makes you trust too easily.

447
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,241
When love ends,

448
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,641
it becomes crystal clear.

449
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,851
So I'm never going to become a fool like that again.

450
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,261
It's not Soo Wan...

451
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,500
whom I'm breaking up with.

452
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,130
I'm breaking up with the feelings of misery and pitifulness...

453
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,540
that I felt in the rain that day.

454
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,281
Young Eun.

455
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,480
Young Eun, do you have more ice?

456
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:46,650
The life I'm enjoying right now...

457
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:49,391
is the prize I got...

458
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,391
for giving up on men and working like a bee.

459
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,360
- Young Eun. - Ms. Ha.

460
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,031
Director Hwang chose you,

461
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:00,770
and my boss, who has control over my performance ratings,

462
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:03,371
has given me orders to hook you guys up.

463
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,641
I need to go outside and give her some ice.

464
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,480
This is the reality I live in.

465
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,020
I asked myself this hundreds of times.

466
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:21,790
"How could he dump me without even telling me why?"

467
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:24,560
"Did my love really mean nothing to him?"

468
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,431
"Did I do something wrong?"

469
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,761
"Was I not enough?"

470
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,900
I kept thinking back and was full of regrets.

471
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:38,141
But...

472
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,781
that didn't change anything.

473
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,380
So I've decided...

474
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:52,420
to just keep walking the path that's in front of me.

475
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:46,940
Director Hwang.

476
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,879
We should go now.

477
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,510
Oh, okay. It really is late.

478
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:52,951
- We should go. - Where are you going?

479
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,149
- Come on. - Thank you for the drinks.

480
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,180
I'm sorry for everything.

481
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,350
- Let's have one more drink. - No, we can't.

482
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,519
- Let's go. - That's enough.

483
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,690
- Come on. One more drink. - Next time.

484
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,031
- Just one more drink. - No.

485
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,700
- You can skip work tomorrow. - Just get in the cab.

486
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:12,129
- It won't take long. - Goodness.

487
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,870
This cab is headed in the opposite direction of where I live.

488
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:15,801
It'll be a waste of time and money.

489
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:19,510
Not only is she our client, but she's also a director.

490
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:23,040
The CEO should be the one to take her home.

491
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,551
- Are we going or not? - We're going.

492
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,721
- Let's make it fair and square. - Fine.

493
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:33,520
Rock, paper, scissors.

494
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,491
See you tomorrow, sir.

495
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,201
- Jae Guk. - I need to go to my studio.

496
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,871
If we're not going, tell her to get out.

497
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,270
Right. I'm going.

498
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:51,971
Excuse me. There we go.

499
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,310
Deluxe Taxi

500
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,371
Why did I come back?

501
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,290
Monitoring

502
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:46,351
What was it that I wanted to ask?

503
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,911
Maybe all the questions I had...

504
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,610
were nothing but an excuse.

505
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:23,451
I...

506
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,551
wanted to check...

507
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,661
whether or not I could handle you...

508
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:44,040
and what I...

509
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,770
meant to you.

510
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,000
You knew I wouldn't be able to leave,

511
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,511
didn't you?

512
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,920
I don't want to get swept away by fleeting emotions...

513
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,520
and end up losing...

514
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,290
everything I have...

515
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,031
and have achieved so far.

516
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,060
I've been through this one too many times to know better.

517
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,301
Experience does not make you courageous.

518
00:42:48,571 --> 00:42:49,940
Rather, it makes you more fearful.

519
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:56,411
Right now,

520
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,721
I'm afraid of you.

521
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:00,291
What was that?

522
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:02,160
Gosh, what's your problem?

523
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,029
You came home drunk last night, so just sleep.

524
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,470
Don't be too brave for your own good. Don't provoke me!

525
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:11,541
Just keep your mouth shut and sleep as much as you want, okay?

526
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:15,041
I fell asleep as soon as I got home last night.

527
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,610
Gosh, seriously.

528
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:21,311
Darn you!

529
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,660
Why are you sitting like that?

530
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:41,700
Is everything okay?

531
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:45,070
You see, last night...

532
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,441
I was innocent.

533
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:52,110
I wanted to be nice, so I offered to take Director Hwang home.

534
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,481
I don't want to go home.

535
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,251
Pardon? You're not going home?

536
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:01,521
Let's...

537
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,751
be honest.

538
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:06,521
What do you mean?

539
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,961
Why did you get in this taxi with me?

540
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,230
We played rock-paper-scissors earlier,

541
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:14,260
and I lost...

542
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,070
I'll go first.

543
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,300
I thought...

544
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,110
you were my cup of tea the moment we first met.

545
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:25,240
I see. Thank you.

546
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:31,751
Gosh.

547
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,081
Stop it.

548
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:37,791
Stop? Oh, should we pull over now?

549
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,121
Sir.

550
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:41,121
Stop testing the waters.

551
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:44,760
Let's be honest with our feelings.

552
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,000
Why... What are you doing?

553
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:51,171
Let's stop trying to suppress our desires.

554
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,740
What? Hold on.

555
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,110
Wait, no.

556
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,570
Wait...

557
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:18,030
Do you have time to lounge around? What about the interview?

558
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,360
I don't have to go anymore.

559
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,300
It's been cancelled.

560
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:26,441
Young Eun! Ha Young Eun!

561
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,851
Collarless Wool Long Coat

562
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:49,360
What is it? Something fun?

563
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:53,859
My gosh. People copy designs all the time,

564
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,101
but you got one of your bestselling designs stolen.

565
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,600
These days, even knockoffs are well-made,

566
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:00,941
and they're cheaper.

567
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,110
We can't really stop people from buying them, can we?

568
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:06,810
You went on about the Italian fabric non stop,

569
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:08,279
so I approved it for you.

570
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,379
And you pestered me about putting a rush on it,

571
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,651
so I put La Mon's collection on hold and prioritized Sono.

572
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,950
And this is the result?

573
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:16,920
As Head of Design, it is your job to make sure...

574
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,320
things like this don't happen!

575
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:21,790
I'll find out what happened.

576
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:23,230
I don't need to know what happened.

577
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:26,160
Just bring me a plan that shows how you'll compensate the company...

578
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,430
for all the losses and damages incurred.

579
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,541
Do your job better! Darn it.

580
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,879
Orders must be pouring in.

581
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,379
Gosh, yes. We've been working late every day.

582
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,650
Oh, no.

583
00:47:46,651 --> 00:47:49,190
You must be tired and excited at the same time.

584
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:51,320
Even I'm so excited about Sono's new collection.

585
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,621
That's true.

586
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:57,930
Anyway, I should start getting ready so I can be more helpful.

587
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,231
What can I start with?

588
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:01,731
Well...

589
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,601
Ms. Ha hasn't mentioned anything yet.

590
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,670
Oh, I see. I guess you don't know because you're still new here.

591
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:13,380
Usually, they show me the designs in advance.

592
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,410
Oh, let me see.

593
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,610
Well...

594
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,351
Sure, here.

595
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,819
The design looks great.

596
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,890
I should be careful with the sleeves.

597
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:27,089
Yes, for sure.

598
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,460
All right. Let me see.

599
00:48:28,461 --> 00:48:30,791
- I'll hold this for you. - Thank you so much.

600
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,200
Some darts here and...

601
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:37,200
It'll come in this colour and black as well.

602
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,300
- Black? I see. That'd be nice. - Yes.

603
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:51,311
I'm sorry.

604
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Collarless Wool Long Coat

605
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:16,740
Get rid of them.

606
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,641
What about the interview with Mr. J?

607
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:23,380
What's the point of promoting it when its copy is already being sold?

608
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,280
But it's ready to be rolled out.

609
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:29,320
So? Are we going to sell it at a deep discount?

610
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,251
Isn't that your pet peeve?

611
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,461
You said we'd make a few bucks if we got rid of them cheap,

612
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,130
but it'd hurt the brand in the long run.

613
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,929
It'd hurt the brand image. And if we raised the price back,

614
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,270
everyone would say it's overpriced.

615
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,700
You said it'd backfire on us.

616
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:45,440
Yes, I said that.

617
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,901
So just get rid of it.

618
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:49,441
It's the first run, so I'm sure there aren't that many.

619
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:52,840
No, we worked so hard to snag this opportunity.

620
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,880
Dad!

621
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,921
- Ms. Ha. - What is it?

622
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,129
So Young wants to resign.

623
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,160
Letter of Resignation

624
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,501
She thinks it's her fault.

625
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,069
Letter of Resignation

626
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,211
What will change if you quit?

627
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,711
I feel so bad.

628
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:30,780
The company has to suffer losses because of what I did,

629
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,720
and I feel so guilty.

630
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,950
Then you need to take responsibility for your actions,

631
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,191
instead of running away like this.

632
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,660
What can I do...

633
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,590
to take responsibility for what I did?

634
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,429
Don't make mistakes like this again.

635
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,400
And work harder to become better at what you excel in.

636
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:53,171
That is the only way you can make up for this mistake you made.

637
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,570
Ms. Ha...

638
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:59,481
If you hand in something like this again,

639
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,441
I'll be really angry.

640
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:09,921
- Where are you going? - To get some work done.

641
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:25,301
Specification sheet

642
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,491
It happens all the time in this industry.

643
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,000
I know.

644
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,559
Designs get copied all the time.

645
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,429
But you can't do that to a new hire who has no authority...

646
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,670
and can't even say no because she's busy...

647
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:02,441
bending over backwards for everyone.

648
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,671
I wanted to do a good job.

649
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:07,611
I asked her to show me the design so I could get ready in advance.

650
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:11,980
Then you should've waited for our order.

651
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:16,889
When a brand launches a nicely designed piece,

652
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,820
you see the same design with slightly different collars...

653
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:21,160
and a few more or fewer buttons all over Dongdaemun within a week.

654
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,290
As you know, The One is not my only client.

655
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:25,861
My other clients asked me to do it,

656
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:28,471
and I couldn't say no.

657
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,841
My kid wants to go to art school,

658
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,940
and my quick hands and sharp eyes are all I have.

659
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:37,370
Everyone has their own circumstances.

660
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:40,610
I had no way of knowing when you'd place your order,

661
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:42,180
and I had to pay for my kid's art lessons.

662
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:45,551
So as a mother, I had to sit in front of my sewing machine.

663
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,591
I know...

664
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:53,290
that you're a good person,

665
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:55,559
but if you're okay...

666
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,761
with trampling all over others' hard work and effort...

667
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,201
just to send your kid to college, then I'm not sure...

668
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,971
if I can call you a good mother.

669
00:53:04,401 --> 00:53:06,401
We'll sue the company that placed the order.

670
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:09,270
And you'll be in high demand.

671
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,280
"How good was the copy that she made?"

672
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:15,080
"Let's do the same thing." Orders will start pouring in.

673
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,120
But don't be too boastful.

674
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:21,350
I came here to say this.

675
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,000
Ms. Ha.

676
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:35,901
Take this.

677
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:38,171
I didn't have an ulterior motive when I gave you this.

678
00:53:38,471 --> 00:53:39,801
I really wanted to thank you.

679
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,111
I took this because I had nothing else to give you.

680
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:44,971
Get ready for a lawsuit.

681
00:53:45,741 --> 00:53:48,480
Don't trust that your other clients will protect you.

682
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:50,980
We'll do our best to be fully prepared for the lawsuit.

683
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,881
I'm giving you a piece of advice to thank you for the kimchi.

684
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:08,801
Excuse me.

685
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,341
Shin Yoo Jung's Pick

686
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,640
- This is it, right? - It's selling like hotcakes.

687
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,209
Really?

688
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,350
- Here. - What's your size?

689
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,250
- My size? - Which one would you like?

690
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:28,480
Coming through.

691
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,060
Oh, is this it?

692
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,560
That's right. Everyone's asking for this.

693
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,030
Yes? Sure.

694
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:41,160
- What's your size? - What's your size?

695
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,350
Why does it have to be so complicated?

696
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,921
Just do what your heart...

697
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,451
tells you.

698
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,730
The Sono Coat, No Returns

699
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:14,861
Hey, Na Ri.

700
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,870
Call the factory and tell them not to discard the coats.

701
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,040
They'll be rolled out today as planned.

702
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:21,870
Sorry? You'll just push ahead with it?

703
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,340
If we go that route,

704
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:26,040
we may end up with a ton of dead stock.

705
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,710
That's only a speculation. We haven't even done anything yet.

706
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:32,350
But what if President Hwang finds out?

707
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:33,920
If the outcome is good,

708
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:36,790
I can explain to him later, and he'll understand.

709
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:41,019
But people already think that the copy is the original design.

710
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,491
It shows up at the top of the search results.

711
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:49,131
You heard that, right?

712
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:52,671
We've been through this a bunch of times.

713
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:55,241
And I knew this would happen the moment it sold out.

714
00:55:55,971 --> 00:55:58,710
But I'm sure some people would want to buy our design,

715
00:55:59,111 --> 00:56:01,309
just like how some pay thousands of dollars for a Chanel jacket...

716
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,210
when knockoffs cost less than 100 dollars...

717
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,221
because it's the original.

718
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,100
Ha Young Eun, do you think this is a joke?

719
00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:23,729
Do you have no respect for your boss?

720
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,000
I'll talk to President Hwang.

721
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,140
So you'll go over my head now?

722
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,240
Come back to the office at once. Get back here now!

723
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:33,410
Head Manager Koh Kwang Soo

724
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,520
Gosh, seriously.

725
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,480
I heard someone copied your design.

726
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,980
We'll have to reschedule the interview.

727
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,781
I don't think we can do it today.

728
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,020
Are you okay?

729
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:16,091
No, I'm not.

730
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:18,720
Even if we sue them, it'll take a few years.

731
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:19,959
If they move a zipper...

732
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,619
and say they were inspired by the design,

733
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,790
we won't win. That's what happens in these lawsuits.

734
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:28,631
Anyway, is that why you're here? To ask me if I'm okay?

735
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,600
Did you have lunch?

736
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,071
I don't have time. I have to get back to the office.

737
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:36,511
You need to eat at least one proper meal a day...

738
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,540
and enjoy it.

739
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,551
Eat at least one proper meal a day...

740
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,250
and enjoy it.

741
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,631
How do you know him?

742
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:02,770
Yoon Soo Wan.

743
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:07,201
What's your relationship with him?

744
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:24,591
This must be your son.

745
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:27,290
Yes, he's my son.

746
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,401
He's my brother.

747
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:41,801
And...

748
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,680
he died ten years ago.

749
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,650
Now, We Are Breaking Up

750
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:01,150
What have I been holding on to all this time?

751
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,749
Soo Wan? What's wrong? Are you okay?

752
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,990
Soo Wan!

753
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,460
On his way to see me, Soo Wan...

754
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:12,059
What did I try so hard to forget?

755
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,260
Despite her efforts...

756
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:15,400
to fight the copies with the original design...

757
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:16,970
Take responsibility? You just didn't want to lose.

758
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:17,971
I'm sorry.

759
01:00:17,972 --> 01:00:19,570
Do you think saying "I'm sorry" will cut it?

760
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:21,999
There's nothing more foolish than dwelling on what's already done.

761
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,070
Breaking news, everyone.

762
01:00:23,071 --> 01:00:24,269
The Hwang siblings are both here now.

763
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,340
He'll report to Ms. Ha.

764
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:27,309
He'll be on Claire Marie's license team.

765
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,849
She's already struggling to clean up after Director Hwang.

766
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,980
And her brother too?

767
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,619
I totally understand.

768
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,120
I never talk about anything that happens under the influence...

769
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:38,491
Why?

770
01:00:38,492 --> 01:00:40,559
- Why did you want to see me? - Do you have a job for me?

771
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,591
I think I'll be staying here for quite a while this time.

772
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,030
You created this brand.

773
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:45,959
How could you throw everything out?

774
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,760
Are you sure you'll be okay?

775
01:00:47,761 --> 01:00:49,499
No, I'm not okay. How could I be okay?

776
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,329
Do I look okay to you now?

777
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,300
- Is there someone you like? - Yes.

778
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,240
The one you met on the blind date?

779
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:59,010
Soo Wan is his brother.

780
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:00,011
By any chance...

781
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:02,580
When exactly did we get the first button wrong?

782
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,580
Jae Guk.

783
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:08,620
And how many times did we just pass by each other?

784
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,620
What should I do?

785
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:25,615
Now, We Are Breaking Up
