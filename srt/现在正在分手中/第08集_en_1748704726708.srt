Now, We Are Breaking Up Episode 8

2
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:13,314
Jae Guk.

3
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,484
Are you telling me...

4
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:18,783
There's someone I love.

5
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:19,854
It's her.

6
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:29,363
What do you think everyone will think of the two of you?

7
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,074
The world isn't going to be...

8
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:35,404
so open-minded about your love.

9
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:38,243
Sure, people will gossip like crazy for the first few days.

10
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:40,972
Must I give up on the person I love because of those few days?

11
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,684
If no one in Korea supports our relationship,

12
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:44,883
I'll just move back to Paris with her.

13
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:48,353
You must be losing your mind.

14
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:51,553
You've obviously lost your reason, so you can't think rationally now.

15
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,993
Soo Wan was the one who hurt you, not her.

16
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:01,133
You're taking it out on the wrong person.

17
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:40,903
"I never really think about my age. I just wear what suits me..."

18
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:43,003
"in that moment." By Loulou de la Falaise

19
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,913
Now, We Are Breaking Up

20
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:54,013
Episode 8

21
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,124
These brands all want to work with you.

22
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:00,023
- Okay, so? - They're all yours.

23
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:01,223
How?

24
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,223
We got this in the mail.

25
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,563
A love letter from Alexandre de Fontenay,

26
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,692
the chairman of DPHP, the fashion conglomerate...

27
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:11,804
that owns all these high-end luxury brands.

28
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,732
Goodness.

29
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,313
Frankly, the PR industry in Korea is too small for me.

30
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:21,013
Gosh, it feels way too small.

31
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:22,614
Stop snacking at night.

32
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,912
You're always so straightforward.

33
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,382
Keep it up, and we'll now go and sign the contract with them.

34
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:31,452
You'll shoot the ads for all the brands that DPHP owns.

35
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:34,752
No matter what their requests are, just say yes. Got it?

36
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:37,593
Someone from DPHP is actually here to meet you in person.

37
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,464
They came all the way here from Paris. Voil��!

38
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,703
But the dates they gave us overlap...

39
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,803
with the Claire Marie project we're working on.

40
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:47,202
Of course, we'll push it back. Claire Marie will understand.

41
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:49,173
In any case, ten days is too long.

42
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,743
Ask them to move the dates.

43
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:55,042
Hey, Cookie. We can't do that.

44
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:57,882
They're from DPHP, for goodness' sake.

45
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:00,714
A week will be more than enough.

46
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:03,922
Cookie, I want to do business in Paris.

47
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:06,252
Can't you please just help me take my company global?

48
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,223
Play hard-to-get to make them want you more.

49
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,363
That's the Parisian attitude.

50
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:12,633
Cookie, please.

51
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,763
Hey, you have me. Don't you think you can be a little more confident?

52
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,834
People from DPHP are here.

53
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:31,184
Hello.

54
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:35,453
I'm Seok Do Hoon, the CEO of Vision PR.

55
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:39,624
It's a pleasure to meet you.

56
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:43,263
Nice to meet you. I'm Cedric Roux from DPHP.

57
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:48,264
Who was the new head director of DPHP again?

58
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,534
I've heard he's a rising designer.

59
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:52,163
Some also say he's a big shot in the industry.

60
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:55,602
He's been aggressively recruiting top talent for every department.

61
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,704
They're already in the negotiation process with a few of them.

62
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:00,813
Find out which brands he has contacted so far.

63
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:02,473
We should get them in.

64
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,613
Where should we place them?

65
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:10,723
Domestic brands have lost their competitiveness.

66
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,893
I want them all gone.

67
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:16,263
All of them? Then what about Notie, Mardi Mohan, and Sono?

68
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:17,422
Their sales numbers aren't bad...

69
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,964
I want you to cancel the deal with all of them.

70
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,274
- Hello. - Hello.

71
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,014
- Ms. Ha. - What do you mean...

72
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,172
- they cancelled the deal? - Hills called in the morning...

73
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,783
and said they want us out.

74
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:37,943
Who do they think they are?

75
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,714
How could they kick us out like this?

76
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,714
What's the point of having a contract?

77
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,353
What have you all been doing?

78
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:48,753
Getting kicked out of Hills is like saying we're now a dead brand.

79
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,863
None of you saw this coming until it blew up in our face like this?

80
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,662
Was it because we were displeased with their fee increase request?

81
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,162
The business team also needs to make sure the company stays afloat.

82
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,873
It went up from 40 to 45 percent just a year ago. Another increase?

83
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:04,273
Then we'd have to increase the prices to make up for it.

84
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:06,473
You should've found a common ground.

85
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:09,372
You should have taken better care of your contacts at Hills.

86
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:11,513
How could you do nothing and let this bomb blow up in our face?

87
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:12,754
That's enough!

88
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,654
This is no time for fault finding.

89
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,254
We need to come up with a plan.

90
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:20,793
Why don't we just...

91
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,792
take Sono's marketing budget and the talents on the team...

92
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,562
and give them to Claire Marie?

93
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:27,792
The jersey show helped boost Sono's brand awareness.

94
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:31,162
And our numbers have never dropped enough to get kicked out like this.

95
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,903
That's what we think.

96
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:34,273
You need to face your reality.

97
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:36,802
Rumours about Hills ditching us will spread in no time.

98
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,372
Then the other department stores will want us gone as well.

99
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,073
It'd look much better to just walk out on our own instead of...

100
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,013
getting kicked out and becoming a brand that no one wants.

101
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:46,413
- Mr. Koh. - I must say, Director Hwang...

102
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:48,553
has such keen foresight.

103
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,084
What would we have done had we not launched Claire Marie?

104
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:54,992
Sono isn't the only brand dealing with declining sales.

105
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:57,223
It's a problem that all domestic brands currently have.

106
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,463
And every time they wanted to raise their fees,

107
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,163
we let them do it without complaining.

108
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,533
Even according to the three-strikes rule,

109
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:05,534
they can't do this to us.

110
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,574
This is a wrongful termination of contract.

111
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,844
If you complain to me and go on about how unfair it is,

112
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,344
will Hills go back on their decision?

113
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:15,372
- Pardon? - If you have time to get worked up,

114
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,714
go and come up with a realistic solution.

115
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:21,154
Whether you're going to fight your case or beg them on your knees,

116
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:24,923
do something that can persuade them to change their decision...

117
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,993
and let me know what they say. Do you understand?

118
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:32,722
What are you all waiting for?

119
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,964
Each team must come up with a plan on how we'll tackle this.

120
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:51,143
You're always so consistent.

121
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,083
Whether you're at home or at work, you're always just you.

122
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,412
You're never fake.

123
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:57,754
Gosh, I need to get rid of this hangover.

124
00:06:58,623 --> 00:06:59,992
Where's Young Eun?

125
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:01,993
She's not in the mood to have hangover soup with you.

126
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,694
Hills wants Sono gone.

127
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,264
- What do you mean? - Aren't you the general director?

128
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,303
Maybe erase that title from your business card.

129
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,473
Are you really considering...

130
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,574
getting rid of Sono altogether?

131
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:27,954
There are times it has to be done.

132
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:32,284
You can't keep a rotting arm, you know.

133
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,524
Hills said we have until the end of the month.

134
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,894
I'll wait until the end of the month and see how things go.

135
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:42,134
I'll make my decision then.

136
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,103
If you want to save Sono,

137
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:50,774
you need to do something.

138
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,254
Hey!

139
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:08,693
Young Eun.

140
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,364
Is it true? I heard Hills wants Sono gone.

141
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,463
Did you cause some kind of trouble behind my back?

142
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:19,563
Trouble?

143
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:24,774
That fool.

144
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,543
She comes home drunk every day.

145
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,313
Oh, dear.

146
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:35,683
You know, it's not like I didn't try.

147
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:41,253
But the thing is,

148
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,563
he likes my friend of all people.

149
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,293
Gosh, it's so hard.

150
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:48,963
Love.

151
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:51,203
Men and women.

152
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:52,864
It's such a headache.

153
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,712
So something happened.

154
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:04,543
No, nothing happened.

155
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:08,083
I was out until late and got home drunk. That's all.

156
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:13,354
Go have some hangover soup or go to the sauna.

157
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,754
You reek of alcohol.

158
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:19,024
Hey, where are you going?

159
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,293
Hills.

160
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,133
Whether I have to fight my case or beg them on my knees,

161
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,264
I should do something.

162
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:27,604
Okay. Good luck!

163
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:35,744
What should I do?

164
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:45,523
Yoon Soo Wan

165
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:47,293
Son of Yoon Jin Woo and Min Hye Ok

166
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:53,994
The Ha Young Eun that Soo Wan loved.

167
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:57,803
It's her.

168
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:00,534
We met by chance,

169
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,104
and I fell for her right away.

170
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,474
I only found out later...

171
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,073
that we both know...

172
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,313
Soo Wan.

173
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,284
Does she...

174
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,484
know about this too?

175
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,724
- She said we couldn't be together. - And?

176
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,994
I begged her to stay.

177
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,894
I love her so much...

178
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:31,333
and can't live without her. That's why.

179
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,504
- Jae Guk. - I know this is difficult...

180
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,874
and that you find it hard to accept this.

181
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,244
- I'm sorry. - You're sorry?

182
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,514
Then are you going to continue...

183
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,213
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:02,163
Yoon Soo Wan

185
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:12,942
What?

186
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:16,113
You want Marie Amelie to style it...

187
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:23,153
and Julian Dix to do the hair? The one who does the Big Three?

188
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,384
How about I go get the moon for you?

189
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,962
And for the model, I want Helena Christian, the supermodel.

190
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:33,024
Can you make sure she can empty out her schedule for this?

191
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,803
Hey, Cookie. Stop being so difficult.

192
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,932
What if they change their mind and just leave?

193
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,673
What will you do then?

194
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:48,713
Then we'll do the shoot at the Musee d'Orsay.

195
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,453
He's just joking.

196
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:54,984
It's a joke.

197
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,784
I mean, a Korean joke. It's a Korean joke.

198
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,893
And I can't spare ten days for this.

199
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,894
Let's get it done in a week.

200
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:07,733
Jerk.

201
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,933
I know.

202
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:18,473
Okay. Let's seal the deal, then.

203
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:21,743
If you're very busy, we can rent a private jet for you.

204
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:25,213
A business class seat will do.

205
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,854
All right. Then we have a deal.

206
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,154
Deal.

207
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:41,663
Yes, that's right!

208
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,503
You're still such a snob.

209
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,302
And look at you now.

210
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,802
DPHP's director of marketing.

211
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,773
Let's go to Paris together, like we promised.

212
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,942
Fine, I'll go because my friend's asking.

213
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,143
I wouldn't be going if you weren't my friend.

214
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,753
Why do you suddenly want to stay here so much?

215
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:04,154
Are you seeing someone?

216
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,052
Cedric.

217
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:11,592
Do you remember the woman you ripped off ten years ago?

218
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:16,063
You sold her my photo and charged her five extra Euros.

219
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:29,244
How much is it?

220
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,423
That woman...

221
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,994
is here.

222
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:51,063
What? No way.

223
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,903
I brought you our rough design drafts...

224
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,412
for our next SS collection.

225
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:04,342
Please review our total revenue from this season...

226
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,144
and Sono's potential prior to finalizing your decision.

227
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,213
Sono's wool coats.

228
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:12,124
Can you bring their prices down? To under 500 dollars.

229
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,923
Considering the cost, that will be hard.

230
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,963
Does Sono have a unique signature design...

231
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:21,534
that people recognize without having to look at the brand tag?

232
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:25,134
Has Sono ever designed a piece that we've never seen...

233
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,233
in the international brands' collections?

234
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,173
All the international luxury brands' designs are based on size 44.

235
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:33,614
They look nice, but they're uncomfortable when worn.

236
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,073
From the hips to the shoulders, they aren't designed for Koreans.

237
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:38,582
Sono is a premium fashion brand...

238
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,413
that makes comfortable clothes with quality fabric.

239
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,854
Those luxury brands' logos...

240
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,823
entice you to wear them even if they're uncomfortable.

241
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,623
Some luxury brands can open shops in department stores...

242
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,123
without having to pay a sales commission.

243
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,263
But for brands like Sono, it can range from 40...

244
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:53,994
to 50 percent.

245
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,734
It'll be hard to bring down the prices.

246
00:14:57,404 --> 00:15:00,573
In other words, you don't have a competitive advantage.

247
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:06,543
I check out your social media posts on a regular basis.

248
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:09,343
I know that you buy clothes from domestic brands...

249
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,843
and mention the brands in your non-sponsored posts.

250
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:14,254
You once said it's such a shame that Korean brands...

251
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,514
aren't powerful players on the international stage yet...

252
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:18,683
despite the fact that they make such good, quality clothes.

253
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:25,193
Sometimes, there are things you can't overcome in reality.

254
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:30,803
In my opinion, that is your reality and limit.

255
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:34,303
So stop wasting your time.

256
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:38,173
I will not change my decision.

257
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:27,423
Your back will start hurting a lot more.

258
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,053
You'll have jaundice,

259
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,894
and you'll lose a lot of weight.

260
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,004
We'll start with AG therapy.

261
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,632
We'll monitor your condition and see how you're responding...

262
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,803
so that we can adjust the amount and frequency accordingly.

263
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,343
We'll be using strong anticancer drugs,

264
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:48,873
which could cause bleeding, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,

265
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,613
and hair loss.

266
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,883
Are the side effects really that severe?

267
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,183
You must stay strong and get through it.

268
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,494
My son just started the first round of his chemotherapy.

269
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,764
Does everyone experience such severe side effects?

270
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:09,663
For me, AC chemotherapy was a lot more unbearable.

271
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:11,703
I kept throwing up and felt so lethargic.

272
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:13,873
I went to my kid's school wearing a hat in the middle of summer,

273
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,103
then just came home because I didn't want to embarrass him.

274
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,103
- It must be so hard. - I'm rooting for you.

275
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:27,414
Paris?

276
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,024
They're saying they absolutely need me.

277
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,853
By "they", I mean DPHP.

278
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:36,863
DPHP absolutely needs you?

279
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,994
That's very cool. I'm jealous.

280
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,633
How long will you stay there?

281
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:43,504
About a week. I leave tomorrow.

282
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,534
- Want to come? - I have a full-time job.

283
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,073
But you're a designer.

284
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:51,444
There are so many people I want to introduce you to.

285
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:55,014
I can introduce you to the people at DPHP as well.

286
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,183
I'd love to tag along,

287
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:58,914
but I need to take care of some stuff here,

288
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,684
so I don't think I can go this time.

289
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:04,754
Why? Did something happen?

290
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,393
I believe that this was not a decision you made...

291
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:12,664
because of your personal grudge.

292
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,234
You're wrong. That is exactly why I made the decision.

293
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,863
I do not want to sell clothes designed by someone like you...

294
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,204
at my department store.

295
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:24,843
Clothes reflect the thoughts of the person who designed them.

296
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:28,373
I have lost everything in love,

297
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:32,113
and I told myself that I would never do it again.

298
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:37,924
Ten years have passed, and love is now asking me again...

299
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,153
if I would do it again...

300
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:42,893
despite what I went through.

301
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,464
Something must've happened. Right?

302
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,993
You run into all sorts of problems...

303
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,534
while making and trying to sell clothes.

304
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,163
Once, the fabric I ordered got held up at the port...

305
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,572
because of a storm.

306
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:57,244
Then when it arrived, it got held up in customs.

307
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:00,373
But that's my problem.

308
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:03,274
It is my job to make it work no matter what.

309
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,383
I don't want to leave you alone here.

310
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,454
Can't you just miss work for a few days?

311
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:16,852
Thanks for inviting me,

312
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,592
but I have to work.

313
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,934
I'll stay here and work hard,

314
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:24,803
so do an amazing job and blow them all away. Okay?

315
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,184
Dad.

316
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,582
About what I said to you when I was drunk last night...

317
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,724
You fool.

318
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,323
Come on. It's not my fault.

319
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:48,953
We're not talking about a bag or shoes here.

320
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,592
It's not like I can use my credit card and buy his heart.

321
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:53,993
That's your problem.

322
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:56,133
You neither have the guts to take the bull by the horns...

323
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,534
nor have the will to make him yours.

324
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,372
She's bad for stealing him from you,

325
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,934
but you're pathetic for letting it happen.

326
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,303
Does it make you happy when you talk to your daughter like that?

327
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,773
And Young Eun didn't steal him from me.

328
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:09,513
I guess J and I are just not meant to be.

329
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,984
My goodness.

330
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,783
Anyway, I have no interest in J whatsoever.

331
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:16,014
Don't bring that up again.

332
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:19,323
And don't humiliate me by saying anything to Young Eun.

333
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,853
Let's keep work and life apart.

334
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,363
If they can't stay in Hills,

335
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,363
I will shut down Sono.

336
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:29,593
Dad?

337
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,204
Wait, Dad.

338
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:35,034
This is just insane.

339
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,004
My head hurts.

340
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,704
Director Hwang Chi Sook

341
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:43,573
Pardon?

342
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,514
What are you talking about?

343
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:49,714
You must have a few contacts at Hills.

344
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:54,694
Of course I do, but...

345
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,392
businesses are run by people.

346
00:20:58,393 --> 00:20:59,764
Don't just stand there, then.

347
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:01,663
A crisis is also an opportunity.

348
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:04,603
Show me what you can do.

349
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,164
Pardon?

350
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,474
Do you want to be a head manager your whole life?

351
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,173
Becoming a director or executive...

352
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,043
Do you not even dream of that?

353
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,043
You dream small, don't you?

354
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,434
Diversify Distribution Channels

355
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:42,903
Distribution Plan for Latter Half of 2021

356
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,184
Do you sell from a laptop?

357
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:57,583
This is why book-smarts never get anywhere.

358
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,793
What's this?

359
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:04,924
See and learn what it means to run around to sell.

360
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:08,694
I set up a meeting with the person in charge.

361
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:10,833
They will only trust us...

362
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:14,034
if the designer can awe them with plans for the next season.

363
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:17,543
Will they meet with me?

364
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:20,613
I'm meeting the vice-president in four days to play golf.

365
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:23,843
Be there on time.

366
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,284
President Choi, Hills Department Store

367
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,774
Cedric.

368
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,974
Mr. J.

369
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,214
- We meet at last. - It has been a while.

370
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:55,973
How are you?

371
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,744
J, I'm so pleased to work with you.

372
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:05,923
I had a look at the mood board on the way here.

373
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:07,892
That's just a rough concept.

374
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:10,562
I'd like you to take a look and adjust the general tone.

375
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:14,434
Sure. Did you cast the models?

376
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,963
Yes. You requested supermodel Helena Christian,

377
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:19,534
and she just called from CDG to say she arrived.

378
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,774
Perfect.

379
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:43,093
Where are you? Why are you still out at this hour?

380
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,563
I went out to get some air.

381
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,164
The traffic was crazy.

382
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,133
Oh, some air?

383
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:58,504
Was it refreshing? It must've been revitalizing.

384
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:00,974
Ji Min had a rotten day.

385
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:03,443
She wet herself at kindergarten,

386
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,383
and only she didn't have a change of clothes.

387
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,853
She had a towel around her bottom when I went to pick her up.

388
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:16,893
Tell me the truth. Something's wrong, isn't there?

389
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:18,393
Is Ji Min asleep?

390
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:20,123
Did you...

391
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:24,264
invest in stocks?

392
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:29,474
- What? - What's all this, then?

393
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,603
You valued this so much you couldn't even wear it.

394
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:35,143
How much did you lose?

395
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,643
Half? Everything?

396
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,553
How much do you think you'll get if you sell this second-hand?

397
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:46,783
I can't wear it anyway. It's out of style.

398
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:48,524
What are all those girly clothes?

399
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,822
Why did you buy such huge sizes?

400
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,763
Are you trying to save up?

401
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,764
What if I forget again?

402
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,234
Just tell me.

403
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,234
Did you lose three grand?

404
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,303
Five grand?

405
00:25:03,174 --> 00:25:05,744
Hey, did you lose more than 10,000?

406
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,013
Is that why you're so out of sorts?

407
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,784
I told you not to invest in stocks.

408
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,414
That's not for everyone!

409
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:18,883
Yes.

410
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:21,994
Think of it that way.

411
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,164
If it pleases you.

412
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,034
I'm sorry.

413
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:17,214
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:20,343
She's crying over that?

415
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:34,034
Ms. Wit

416
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:37,704
Ms. Wit.

417
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:04,524
Na Ri, where's Young Eun?

418
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,424
She's out to meet someone from Hills.

419
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,763
She said we're not to call unless it's really urgent.

420
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:11,704
That sounds like a special message for me.

421
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,534
It's not exactly that.

422
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:28,684
What's wrong with her walk?

423
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:31,724
Did she sprain her ankle?

424
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:34,224
Did she hurt her back?

425
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,393
Why am I wondering?

426
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,863
I haven't heard we have a meeting, and yet here you are.

427
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,174
I'm here because we need to adjust...

428
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:50,403
the schedule of one of my artists.

429
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:51,974
That's a lie.

430
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,174
It's the truth.

431
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,674
I'll let you get back to work.

432
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:01,153
By the way, is Ms. Ha doing...

433
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,313
okay?

434
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,363
Good shot.

435
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:15,562
You have such a smooth transition.

436
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,504
The ball just soars.

437
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,734
My ball doesn't go half as far.

438
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:22,673
Try keeping your left foot slightly behind when you swing.

439
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:26,003
If your heel lands in a different spot from where you start off,

440
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,444
the ball goes the wrong way.

441
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,514
Let's move on to the next hole.

442
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:35,653
Sit back.

443
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,893
Oh, wow. Yoon Soo Wan was out of his mind.

444
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,493
You don't have to put it like...

445
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:54,402
Shin Yoo Jung is just as disgusting. I thought better of her.

446
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:56,572
Is she trying to get back at Young Eun...

447
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,674
because of what happened ten years ago?

448
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,602
Oh, my gosh.

449
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:04,013
She's not at all a noble, loyal, rich celebrity.

450
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:06,983
How dare she flaunt her stuff as a fianc��e from ten years ago?

451
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:10,184
It could be a misunderstanding. Try not to reach too far.

452
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:13,653
Basically, both my dad and Shin Yoo Jung are after her.

453
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,194
Poor Young Eun...

454
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:26,362
I'll tell you something just in case.

455
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:28,572
Regarding the deal with the department store,

456
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:32,174
there is nothing at all that I or Vision PR can do to help.

457
00:29:36,113 --> 00:29:38,743
Does life go how you expect it to?

458
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,383
Not at all. Never. No way.

459
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:44,454
A fianc��e from ten years ago came out of the woodwork.

460
00:29:45,954 --> 00:29:47,454
I think...

461
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:52,194
I know there has to be something we can do.

462
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,504
You were in great form today.

463
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,074
Your balls flew as straight and far as Hills' future.

464
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,273
Ms. Ha, why don't you have a drink?

465
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:07,274
I apologize. I drove here.

466
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,443
You can hire a driver.

467
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:11,484
Don't be so uptight.

468
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:14,714
Kids these days are so boring even when it comes to business.

469
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,653
That's how desperate and fierce she is.

470
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:18,823
I'm doing my best.

471
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:21,723
Sono's plan for the upcoming SS season...

472
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:24,523
Sir. Your glass is empty.

473
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:26,923
Ms. Ha will fill it for you.

474
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:28,563
Fill it to the brim...

475
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:30,632
so he sees how serious you are.

476
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:31,863
Don't you agree?

477
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,403
Let me.

478
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:50,183
Mi Sook

479
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:55,593
Ms. Ha, you first.

480
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:57,423
Let's have another drink in Seoul.

481
00:30:58,494 --> 00:31:00,693
Go on. He's waiting.

482
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,433
I can't spare time for you again.

483
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:07,804
Don't just stand there.

484
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:16,474
Mi Sook

485
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,244
Don't you want the deal?

486
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,183
Mi Sook

487
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:27,084
I apologize. I will head back to Seoul on my own.

488
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:28,754
I guess...

489
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:32,163
you're not as desperate as I thought, Ms. Ha.

490
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:35,592
You're wrong. I am very desperate.

491
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,764
I need this more than I ever needed anything.

492
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:40,804
That's why I waited the whole day just to get ten minutes with you...

493
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,203
and got my hand groped.

494
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:46,173
Should I get in the back seat of the car with you?

495
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:48,672
- I wondered like crazy. - Young Eun!

496
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,912
During the three-hour dinner,

497
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:52,244
there were more than enough chances for me to speak and you to listen.

498
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:55,652
You're not here to hear what I have to say.

499
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:58,024
What do you want to do as we have another drink?

500
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,622
Are you thinking of using...

501
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:01,794
my desperation as a key to a hotel suite?

502
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:05,393
Sorry, but I can't do that.

503
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:08,593
In this situation, that would be just crass.

504
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:13,263
Ha Young Eun. Don't you know who I am?

505
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,974
Your family gave you your job...

506
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,004
so you'd keep an eye on Shin Yoo Jung.

507
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,103
If you want to throw your weight around,

508
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:22,343
do so with class, as a vice-president should.

509
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:23,943
Okay?

510
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:35,994
Pick up, Mi Sook.

511
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:38,564
Mi Sook.

512
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,593
Young Eun, I...

513
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,663
- It hurts so bad. - Mi Sook.

514
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,974
What's wrong?

515
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,913
Young Eun

516
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:15,393
Mi Sook. It's me.

517
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:17,963
Open the door.

518
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:19,464
Mi Sook!

519
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:20,974
Hurry.

520
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,504
Mi Sook.

521
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:28,744
Mi Sook.

522
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,413
Mi Sook!

523
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:40,384
Mi Sook.

524
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:43,223
- Oh, no. - Ma'am.

525
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:44,524
Mi Sook.

526
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,742
Is there a Jeon Mi Sook...

527
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:58,904
What happened to her?

528
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:01,543
A doctor will explain the MRI results...

529
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:03,413
when her guardian arrives.

530
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:05,844
You should get her admitted first.

531
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:43,453
Mi Sook. Are you all right?

532
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:55,234
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

533
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,334
Jeon Mi Sook. You really...

534
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:07,243
Soo Ho.

535
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,073
Mi Sook.

536
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,413
What is the doctor talking about?

537
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,223
Jeon Mi Sook. You...

538
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:24,694
Why are you like this?

539
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:31,734
Mi Sook.

540
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,873
What should I do with you?

541
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:36,933
Mi Sook.

542
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,044
Mi Sook.

543
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:42,513
Mi Sook.

544
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,524
No!

545
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:03,094
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,174
Why...

547
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:27,524
What time is it in Paris?

548
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,823
You must be getting ready for work.

549
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,033
Today, I...

550
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:45,444
I don't know what I did the whole day.

551
00:36:49,214 --> 00:36:53,183
I hoped he would play a great game just so he'd be in a good mood.

552
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:58,384
That's what I prayed for as I stood still, waiting.

553
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,524
Then...

554
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:08,364
I told myself I just had to pour a few drinks.

555
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:14,404
But then he grabbed my hand.

556
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,274
I told myself it's okay.

557
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:21,774
Because until I get home,

558
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:26,214
I am a mere employee at work.

559
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:34,524
So...

560
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:38,964
I wondered if...

561
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:43,594
I should get in his car.

562
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,774
But...

563
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,314
while I was doing all that,

564
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,154
my friend was suffering in pain.

565
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:06,283
I'm so angry about that.

566
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,964
While I was feeling torn about something so small,

567
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:15,893
my friend...

568
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,734
was suffering alone.

569
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,274
It makes me so angry.

570
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,433
Can you not stay out too late?

571
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,283
They called me crazy...

572
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,983
because I worked without food or sleep.

573
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,754
I finished a week's work in three days...

574
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:15,453
and I'd like that to count.

575
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:39,344
I missed you.

576
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:46,183
So did I.

577
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:09,243
What a jerk.

578
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:13,643
You had no idea your wife was sick.

579
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:31,334
There's not much to life after all.

580
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:36,533
How could this happen to me?

581
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,774
It didn't feel real at all.

582
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,344
But when I felt the pain,

583
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:47,444
that's when I suddenly got scared.

584
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:49,754
Get chemotherapy.

585
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:52,384
Why are you giving up...

586
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:54,794
without trying anything?

587
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:58,263
Ji Min is only seven years old.

588
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:00,763
If I get chemotherapy,

589
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:04,234
I'll have to ask her to bring me water,

590
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,603
and I won't have any strength to braid her hair...

591
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,433
or help her put on her stockings.

592
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:17,373
"Why are you always sick, Mom?"

593
00:41:19,283 --> 00:41:21,584
"I'm sick and tired of your illness."

594
00:41:22,154 --> 00:41:23,513
"I hate you, Mom."

595
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,283
Young Eun.

596
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:30,154
That's not how I want to say goodbye to my daughter.

597
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:37,634
I'll do it.

598
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,734
I'll braid her hair.

599
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:46,573
I'll take her to kindergarten.

600
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,013
So get chemotherapy.

601
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:51,614
Even if you're only given a day,

602
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:56,314
you can use that day to do whatever it is...

603
00:41:57,553 --> 00:41:59,084
that you've always wanted to do.

604
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:03,154
Use that time to do the things that you never got to do.

605
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,634
Do what you can to live another day.

606
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:13,134
Stop giving me hope.

607
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:16,734
They told me that there's no hope.

608
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:19,103
Young Eun.

609
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:23,073
There's nothing I can do to get better.

610
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:58,214
What do you think awaits us at the end of that road?

611
00:42:59,814 --> 00:43:02,714
Hope? Or...

612
00:43:03,783 --> 00:43:07,453
just the end of the road?

613
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:09,524
I will...

614
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:12,993
probably be there.

615
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:17,734
No matter where you go,

616
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:20,234
I will always be...

617
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:23,533
at the end of that road.

618
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:30,114
I won't run away...

619
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:32,513
from anything.

620
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:38,683
Jae Guk.

621
00:43:39,924 --> 00:43:43,294
Can you help me as my boyfriend just this once?

622
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:50,763
We have many talented designers in Paris.

623
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:53,564
I know Mr. J introduced me to you,

624
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,373
but that's irrelevant.

625
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:58,873
It won't be easy to convince me with a few design sketches.

626
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:00,674
I know.

627
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:04,073
That's why I wanted to show you this in person.

628
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:25,702
Why are you so nervous?

629
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:27,964
You introduced her to him. I'm sure he'll give her a chance.

630
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:30,573
That's not how it works with them.

631
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,643
It all depends on whether they like it or not.

632
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:36,013
They're very cold-hearted when it comes to work.

633
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:47,623
"Sono." Interesting.

634
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,823
Would you like to hear a miraculous story?

635
00:44:54,964 --> 00:44:58,334
There was once an assistant photographer...

636
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:00,103
who wrote this on a portfolio...

637
00:45:00,404 --> 00:45:02,103
that was created by an aspiring fashion designer.

638
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,583
I hope one day, your passion becomes a "sono."

639
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:23,024
I want my passion to echo. Something like that.

640
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:24,553
Isn't it cool?

641
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:27,322
Wherever it may be,

642
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:30,234
the first brand I create will be called "Sono."

643
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:35,473
That friend became a very famous photographer,

644
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:36,933
and the aspiring fashion designer...

645
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:42,143
seems to have become very successful as well.

646
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:56,754
How did it go?

647
00:45:58,524 --> 00:45:59,623
What's wrong?

648
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:02,064
Did it not work out?

649
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:06,603
Gosh, I told him to be easy on you.

650
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:10,033
We got two months.

651
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:13,203
He says we can open a pop-up store...

652
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:15,174
at La Fayere for two months.

653
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,213
They're going to decide whether to open an official store or not...

654
00:46:18,214 --> 00:46:19,614
based on how well we do in the market.

655
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:39,334
Fate...

656
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:43,073
approaches you disguised as a coincidence.

657
00:46:44,373 --> 00:46:48,004
Maybe you were there for me...

658
00:46:57,053 --> 00:46:58,254
at the end of the road...

659
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:03,154
even when I wasn't aware.

660
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:08,763
What do you think awaits us at the end of that road?

661
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:11,163
I will probably be there.

662
00:47:12,404 --> 00:47:15,834
No matter where you go, I will always be...

663
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,944
at the end of that road.

664
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:29,653
See? You never know what can happen in life.

665
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,253
Gosh, you're right.

666
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:33,952
I never expected the four of us...

667
00:47:33,953 --> 00:47:36,924
to plan a trip to Paris.

668
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:40,464
Let's officially celebrate. Cheers.

669
00:47:41,623 --> 00:47:42,964
Cheers.

670
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:45,802
I'd prefer it if you guys order alcohol rather than food.

671
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:48,573
- It makes me more money. - Okay.

672
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,503
You used to be an executive at The One,

673
00:47:51,504 --> 00:47:53,302
but you're your own CEO now. Does that feel nice?

674
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,713
I quit because I was sick and tired...

675
00:47:55,714 --> 00:47:57,773
of being someone's employee.

676
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,314
But now, all my customers are like my bosses.

677
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:02,084
So the more you order, the happier I'll become.

678
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,754
Mr. Seok, please do your best to promote our brand.

679
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:08,423
Don't worry.

680
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:10,392
I'm quite familiar with Parisians.

681
00:48:10,393 --> 00:48:12,464
You need to be firm with them.

682
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,393
The more confident you seem, the more they like you.

683
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,364
You're a fast learner, Mr. Seok.

684
00:48:18,703 --> 00:48:21,162
Hey, come on. I also go to Paris at least...

685
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:22,703
twice a year, you know.

686
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,932
I'm so excited.

687
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:27,903
I can't believe we're going to sell our clothes at La Fayere in Paris.

688
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,143
We need to do well. Otherwise, my dad might fire you guys.

689
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:35,154
He's going to fire us if we don't succeed?

690
00:48:35,484 --> 00:48:39,053
The thing is, my dad found out...

691
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,783
about Young Eun and Jae Guk.

692
00:48:44,823 --> 00:48:46,793
Does that mean he might also fire Ms. Ha?

693
00:48:46,794 --> 00:48:48,023
He can fire you for that?

694
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:50,134
If he fires me, then so be it.

695
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:51,964
Don't say that.

696
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:55,773
Just make sure you do a good job at La Fayere in Paris.

697
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:59,642
Otherwise, I might even get fired. You got that, Mr. Seok?

698
00:48:59,643 --> 00:49:02,213
Among the four of us, aren't you the only one...

699
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,073
who won't take a hit from getting fired?

700
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:08,912
Anyway, whether it's for personal reasons or work,

701
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:11,923
our destination has become La Fayere, Paris.

702
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:14,153
That means we're a team until we get there.

703
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:16,822
So let's make sure we work as a team, okay?

704
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:17,893
Okay.

705
00:49:18,194 --> 00:49:19,663
- Cheers. - Cheers.

706
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:30,202
I offered to call a cab for you.

707
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:32,603
Why are you making me walk you home?

708
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:36,013
As someone who's really tired, I just don't get why.

709
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:39,643
If you didn't come with me, you would've left with Mr. J.

710
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:43,084
He's my roommate, so that's pretty obvious.

711
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:45,853
You've never dated anyone, have you?

712
00:49:47,553 --> 00:49:51,154
Let's just say I'm a careful guy who doesn't just open up to anyone.

713
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:54,623
You see,

714
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:59,364
my experiences with love are my only assets in life.

715
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,803
You must feel proud to have a long list of ex-boyfriends.

716
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,243
My dad was always scary,

717
00:50:07,973 --> 00:50:10,714
and my little brother was of no help at all.

718
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:15,114
So I always filled my emptiness with love.

719
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,182
Why are you talking that way again?

720
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,682
I can't carry you on my back again.

721
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:22,453
You're really heavy when you're drunk.

722
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:24,594
Did you see how...

723
00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:27,623
Mr. J fed Young Eun fruit with a fork?

724
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:31,794
No, I don't think so. I'm not very interested in him.

725
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,273
Young Eun's eyes were fixed on him too.

726
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:37,174
That's because they were facing each other.

727
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:48,544
Why are you looking at me like that?

728
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:52,783
We need to go to Paris, right?

729
00:50:53,524 --> 00:50:54,622
Yes, that'd be nice.

730
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:57,293
In order for that to happen, my dad needs to trust Young Eun...

731
00:50:57,294 --> 00:50:59,793
and fully support her like he used to.

732
00:50:59,794 --> 00:51:03,263
Obviously, things will get easier if she has his support.

733
00:51:06,203 --> 00:51:07,703
Would you like to help me out?

734
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:09,303
What?

735
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:11,303
What...

736
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:14,844
Listen carefully.

737
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:17,714
What? I can't hear you properly.

738
00:51:17,844 --> 00:51:20,012
This is purely for business.

739
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:23,412
I'm doing this for me, Young Eun, you, and Mr. J.

740
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,012
- What? - It won't take long.

741
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:26,282
So trust me and follow my lead.

742
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,053
Follow your lead to where?

743
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:44,033
It's him again?

744
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:56,614
Chi Sook, come inside right now!

745
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:03,672
Are you putting on a protest on purpose?

746
00:52:03,673 --> 00:52:04,943
Aren't you embarrassed?

747
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:06,144
How could you do that in front of the house?

748
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:09,044
It's because I love him. I'm passionate about him.

749
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,382
You can't call it love if you care about what others think.

750
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:13,953
Be quiet! I won't approve of him!

751
00:52:14,254 --> 00:52:15,254
End it now.

752
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:17,023
Koreans are so nosy...

753
00:52:17,024 --> 00:52:19,592
when it comes to other people's love lives.

754
00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:21,093
I'm your father!

755
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:26,293
Even so, you're a third party when it comes to my relationship.

756
00:52:26,294 --> 00:52:29,103
Goodness, how dare you speak to me that way?

757
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,033
Let me tell you something, Dad. You're crossing the line, you know.

758
00:52:32,573 --> 00:52:34,933
Young Eun and Jae Guk have feelings for each other.

759
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:36,373
You can't hold a grudge against Young Eun...

760
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,273
and push her into a corner because of that.

761
00:52:38,274 --> 00:52:40,044
That's just inappropriate.

762
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:44,283
Wash up and go to bed. We'll talk tomorrow.

763
00:52:45,714 --> 00:52:47,613
Can you please help Young Eun, Dad?

764
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:51,723
She didn't steal him from me.

765
00:52:51,854 --> 00:52:53,922
I just didn't show up that day.

766
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:57,223
All she did was deal with my mess and help me out.

767
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:04,303
I don't want to lose my best friend because of you.

768
00:53:16,383 --> 00:53:17,414
What an amateur.

769
00:53:25,653 --> 00:53:26,753
According to an insider from Sono...

770
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:28,093
Will Sono officially join La Fayere?

771
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:30,493
La Fayere, the department store, will be...

772
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:33,463
Ms. Seo, how is everything going with the press release?

773
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:35,063
- It's almost done. - Okay.

774
00:53:35,064 --> 00:53:36,802
I want all reporters to work together...

775
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:38,632
to leave a strong impression in the market.

776
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,433
Sono and Vision PR are working together for this.

777
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:42,303
Let's make it work, everyone.

778
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:45,713
Sono is opening a pop-up store with Givenchy and Tiffany?

779
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:47,172
K-fashion is finally going to Paris.

780
00:53:47,173 --> 00:53:48,913
Let's show them how talented Koreans can be in fashion.

781
00:53:48,914 --> 00:53:50,612
I want a dress from Sono for my birthday.

782
00:53:50,613 --> 00:53:52,152
- My wife loves Sono... - Sono's jersey dress...

783
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:55,353
- Yes, that's right. - We're open to the possibility.

784
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:56,783
We'll think about it.

785
00:53:57,423 --> 00:53:58,583
How did this happen?

786
00:53:58,584 --> 00:54:00,922
DPHP has been looking for a brand.

787
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:03,223
It looks like they were impressed with Sono's Jersey Show.

788
00:54:03,763 --> 00:54:05,664
We don't even know the person in charge,

789
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:08,194
but Sono managed to reach out to them?

790
00:54:08,464 --> 00:54:10,664
A photographer named Mr. J introduced them to each other.

791
00:54:12,173 --> 00:54:15,743
The La Fayere in Paris gave us permission to open a pop-up store?

792
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:18,742
DPHP could see the true value of our brand.

793
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:21,544
I'm not good at designing, but I do have a good eye.

794
00:54:21,914 --> 00:54:24,112
I was the last person to confirm every single outfit,

795
00:54:24,113 --> 00:54:26,354
so it's natural that they liked it. Right, Ms. Ha?

796
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,854
Director Hwang helped us out with her good eye.

797
00:54:29,124 --> 00:54:30,653
She did a lot more than just help.

798
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:32,794
Everyone in the industry is trying to reach out to us.

799
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,422
The department stores that sell Sono...

800
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:36,563
are asking us to extend the contract in return for lowering the fee.

801
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,163
Hansung wants to sign an exclusive contract with us.

802
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,862
Some are even asking us to pick a spot for the brand...

803
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:41,193
even though they're not even built yet.

804
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,064
Have you received any calls from Hills Department Store?

805
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:46,173
This time, it's our turn to decide.

806
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:50,803
I heard you have something to say to me.

807
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:54,444
There's something you're mistaken about.

808
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,814
You think domestic brands have hit the limit.

809
00:54:57,644 --> 00:55:00,714
I personally think it's Hills that has hit the limit.

810
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:03,782
Your idea of an innovative plan...

811
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:06,354
was to sign deals with tons of foreign brands,

812
00:55:06,593 --> 00:55:09,322
and then have domestic brands make up for the money they lost...

813
00:55:09,323 --> 00:55:10,763
by making us pay a huge amount of fees.

814
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:14,434
Clothes keep getting expensive, and you end up losing customers.

815
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:18,363
I know Jae Guk helped you to open a pop-up store at La Fayere.

816
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:22,444
The attention will probably last a month.

817
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,644
But how long do you think that will last?

818
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:27,073
Things won't change right after our first attempt.

819
00:55:28,044 --> 00:55:31,484
Then we'll keep trying again and again.

820
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:33,153
We'll try until we make it.

821
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:38,323
You're a lot more reckless than I thought you'd be.

822
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:40,624
Maybe.

823
00:55:42,524 --> 00:55:45,093
Yes. I once had my heart broken due to love,

824
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,964
which led me to give up on my dream and future.

825
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:52,173
I know how dumb and reckless that is.

826
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:55,303
But the reason I still choose to do this...

827
00:55:56,343 --> 00:55:58,274
is because my feelings for Jae Guk are sincere.

828
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:01,944
But you see, I must admit...

829
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:06,254
that I'm glad to see myself...

830
00:56:07,684 --> 00:56:08,883
so dumb and reckless again.

831
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:15,423
You don't need to withdraw the cancellation of our contract.

832
00:56:15,823 --> 00:56:19,363
Sono will not stay at Hills.

833
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:21,834
This time, I'm the one...

834
00:56:22,834 --> 00:56:24,133
rejecting Hills Department Store.

835
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:27,774
Thank you, my friend.

836
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,643
No, you don't need to thank me.

837
00:56:29,644 --> 00:56:31,273
It wasn't for you. It was because I liked the clothes.

838
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:33,342
I liked Young Eun's clothes. I'm a professional.

839
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:35,044
Don't make it look like I did this for personal reasons.

840
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:37,742
You have great taste.

841
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:39,583
I can see why DPHP recruited you.

842
00:56:39,584 --> 00:56:41,483
Her designs are simple. I love it.

843
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:42,753
So much that I'd like to continue working with her...

844
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:43,782
even if you guys break up.

845
00:56:43,783 --> 00:56:47,422
She really is something.

846
00:56:47,423 --> 00:56:50,394
You have everything. You lucky guy.

847
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:54,533
I never had everything in life.

848
00:56:55,803 --> 00:56:57,734
As soon as I was born, I had no father.

849
00:56:58,664 --> 00:56:59,934
When I turned two,

850
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:02,444
my mother disappeared.

851
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:10,584
No one...

852
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:12,814
was jealous...

853
00:57:14,513 --> 00:57:16,084
of my life.

854
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:33,173
Thank you.

855
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:36,243
I'm extremely grateful.

856
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:39,113
It had nothing to do with me.

857
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:42,914
Apparently, it was solely because he loved your clothes.

858
00:57:50,754 --> 00:57:51,854
Great job.

859
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:53,923
You did great.

860
00:58:36,564 --> 00:58:38,664
- Good morning. - Hello.

861
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:47,944
Yes, this is Ha Young Eun speaking.

862
00:58:51,343 --> 00:58:52,383
Hello?

863
00:58:54,914 --> 00:58:57,084
Hello? I'm listening.

864
00:58:58,254 --> 00:58:59,294
I'm...

865
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:03,093
Soo Wan's mother.

866
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:08,664
Can we...

867
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,604
please meet?

868
00:59:21,173 --> 00:59:22,814
If you're Soo Wan's mother,

869
00:59:23,914 --> 00:59:26,254
I don't see why we need to meet.

870
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:31,283
But...

871
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:35,664
if you're Jae Guk's mother...

872
00:59:37,593 --> 00:59:40,394
Sure. I'll meet you.

873
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:26,544
Now, We Are Breaking Up

874
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,883
- What are your feelings for him? - I love him.

875
01:00:30,684 --> 01:00:32,112
How is this normal?

876
01:00:32,113 --> 01:00:33,653
You can't just think about yourselves.

877
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:34,913
You don't live in this world alone.

878
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:35,923
Young Eun!

879
01:00:36,354 --> 01:00:38,222
Another obstacle is coming my way.

880
01:00:38,223 --> 01:00:40,023
Hasn't my dad told you anything yet?

881
01:00:40,024 --> 01:00:42,052
- Did you get yourself in trouble? - Mr. Seok likes me.

882
01:00:42,053 --> 01:00:43,964
Nice to meet you.

883
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,433
I'm here to meet Director Hwang Chi Sook.

884
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,193
Since when? Do you like him too?

885
01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:49,532
I don't like him.

886
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:51,334
You know he's not my type.

887
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,333
Can I lean on you for a bit?

888
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:55,433
I'm going to do everything I can...

889
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:56,803
and say goodbye peacefully.

890
01:00:57,073 --> 01:00:58,143
This is my resignation letter.

891
01:00:58,144 --> 01:00:59,573
