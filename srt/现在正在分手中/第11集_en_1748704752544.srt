Now, We Are Breaking Up Episode 11

2
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:51,063
What would you want to do with me...

3
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,604
if we didn't have much time left to spend together?

4
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:57,373
Nothing lasts forever.

5
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:00,173
Well...

6
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:02,744
What about you?

7
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,883
I want to love passionately so I won't have any regrets.

8
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:08,983
Nice. Looking forward to it.

9
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:11,323
I won't care what others might say.

10
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:13,123
I'll kiss you in the middle of a busy intersection.

11
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,453
Sure, anytime.

12
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:18,994
I'll miss work and spend the whole day with you.

13
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:22,363
If you steal the remote control, I'll find it.

14
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:24,832
We'll drift in the ocean, just the two of us.

15
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,074
Oh, you're not allowed to bring your phone or laptop.

16
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:29,103
We'll go grocery shopping together...

17
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:30,404
and decide who will do the dishes.

18
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:34,443
On a rainy day, we'll share an umbrella...

19
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:36,184
and walk together until our shoes are soaked.

20
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:41,153
After hearing you nag me all day long,

21
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:44,453
I want to wake up to your face,

22
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:46,794
Ha Young Eun.

23
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:50,993
I'm asking him how we should end things,

24
00:01:53,294 --> 00:01:54,393
but his answer...

25
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,363
is all about how we should keep going.

26
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:03,803
What about after we've done everything we wanted to do?

27
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,344
Shall we break up then?

28
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:17,124
If you insist on staying with Jae Guk,

29
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:21,923
I will no longer be around.

30
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:27,833
If I die, he'll beat himself up for the rest of his life.

31
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:32,233
And you'll have to see that. Is that the kind of love you want?

32
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:36,504
We should end things before we hurt each other.

33
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:39,374
Let's not fight or tire ourselves out.

34
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,814
Let's just do the things that we wanted to do.

35
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:51,224
All the good things. If we only have good memories,

36
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,923
we can end things with no regrets.

37
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:01,634
Then shall we...

38
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:05,903
break up with smiles on our faces?

39
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:37,633
"Black is not one colour. Countless colours coexist in it."

Now, We Are Breaking Up

42
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,984
Episode 11

43
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,963
What's going on all of a sudden?

44
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,863
Mr. Kim from the operations department told me...

45
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,434
that a due diligence team is here.

46
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:13,633
Why?

47
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:16,043
Is the company being bought out?

48
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:19,643
- It's here. - I see.

49
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:23,483
- What about the chart? - I'll show you.

50
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:26,912
How much work has been done for the pop-up at La Fayere?

51
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:28,412
We're in the process of confirming the designs.

52
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:30,624
Everything will be finalized in the next few days.

53
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:34,053
Many of your company-operated stores are in the red.

54
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,892
Could we get a list of your company-operated shops...

55
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:37,064
and authorized retailers?

56
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,162
Sure. As soon as I have it,

57
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:43,833
I'll submit it to the operations team.

58
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:45,503
Thank you.

59
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,273
In addition to what I asked for earlier,

60
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:51,402
could you also look into the operating expenses and risks?

61
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:52,543
Sure, no problem.

62
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,014
What's going on, Ms. Ha?

63
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:57,384
I'm not sure.

64
00:04:57,684 --> 00:04:59,613
I heard there are stock market rumours going around...

65
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:01,384
about a fashion company being bought out.

66
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,453
I hope it's not us.

67
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,652
My brother-in-law works in the stock market business.

68
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:09,493
Apparently, a certain foreign company is interested...

69
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:11,924
in one of the leading fashion companies in Korea.

70
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:13,662
They were negotiating under the table,

71
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:14,934
but the deal is almost sealed now.

72
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,863
Are you sure it's us?

73
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,233
Founded 30 years ago. Most famous brand starts with the letter S.

74
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,833
Launched a new brand recently.

75
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,374
Anyone would know that it's us.

76
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:23,702
No way.

77
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:24,943
We have the project with La Fayere,

78
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,743
and the seasonal collection is doing well.

79
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,213
If you want to cash in, you have to sell it when it's doing well.

80
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,043
Have you heard anything about it?

81
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:35,153
No, nothing.

82
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:45,694
Dad, are we being bought out?

83
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,032
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:51,364
What are the due diligence people doing here?

85
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,873
We're doing it for a reason.

86
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,773
How much are you going to ask for?

87
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:59,513
What? Are you already negotiating the price?

88
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:01,342
Am I the only one who was kept in the dark again?

89
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:02,412
What are you saying?

90
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:03,813
You do this all the time.

91
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,152
You always exclude me whether we're at home or at work.

92
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:08,352
You and Chi Hyung know everything, but you never tell me.

93
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:11,383
If the company gets bought out, I deserve a cut.

94
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:13,452
I launched Sono and Claire Marie.

95
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,593
It was all me. You know that, right?

96
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,793
I deserve a cut too.

97
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:18,563
What did you do?

98
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,332
As a newbie, I lifted everyone's spirits.

99
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,694
I did so much manual labour that I even needed a pain relief spray.

100
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:24,503
Because I took care of all the petty tasks,

101
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:26,902
Young Eun was able to focus on the important stuff.

102
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,233
Like a fullback in soccer.

103
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:32,142
Hey, you should've assisted her properly like a forward would.

104
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,673
Know your place. You're like an intern.

105
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,374
Oh, like a forward?

106
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,244
Then neither of us deserves a cut. Young Eun does.

107
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,283
Right, Dad? You should give Young Eun a cut.

108
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,884
Shut it, you brat.

109
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:50,194
- Ms. Ha is here, sir. - Come in!

110
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:58,804
See? Ms. Ha is doing all the work.

111
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:02,032
What's going on with La Fayere?

112
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,402
Do we have their answer?

113
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:07,273
No, not yet. They have many requests.

114
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:09,842
I'll do our best to finalize the deal...

115
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,483
and let you know by the end of the week.

116
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,314
Okay, you may leave.

117
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:18,624
Do you want to talk to me about something?

118
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:22,824
Some strange rumours are going around, sir.

119
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:26,163
About the company being bought out? I already asked him about it.

120
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,863
I heard it's a foreign company.

121
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,864
Really? A foreign company?

122
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,902
Is it a foreign company, Dad?

123
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:35,734
Be quiet. Don't do anything rash.

124
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:37,903
Just focus on the project with La Fayere.

125
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:47,314
He won't tell us. That's what company owners are like.

126
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,183
They won't give it away until it is happening for sure.

127
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:51,683
But we should know.

128
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,722
We work for this company, and this will directly affect us.

129
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,523
You really are clueless.

130
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,092
It'll negatively affect the sales...

131
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,564
and the value of the company.

132
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,533
Then what should we do now?

133
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:03,803
There's no guarantee that the acquiring company will keep us.

134
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,573
Hey, Ms. Ha.

135
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,203
Do you know anything about it?

136
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,543
About La Fayere? We haven't heard from them yet.

137
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,743
If you're talking about the artwork, I'll submit it today.

138
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,142
I can't figure out whether you're discreet or just slow-witted.

139
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,713
Don't you know that we're being bought out?

140
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,413
No, I didn't hear anything about it.

141
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:22,714
Please excuse me.

142
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,724
Fine, keep working hard.

143
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,823
It'll be bought out anyway, so spend all the budget.

144
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:35,063
What do we do now?

145
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,233
I don't even know what I will do.

146
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,334
How am I supposed to know what you guys should do?

147
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,033
In situations like this, you must act fast if you want to win.

148
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:45,704
We're all alone in this fight, so you figure out a way to survive.

149
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:49,073
I must figure out a way to survive.

150
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:52,954
It's me, Head Manager Koh at The One.

151
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:55,614
Yes, that's right.

152
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,254
Do you want to grab a drink with me later?

153
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:01,854
I want your advice on something work-related.

154
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:04,494
Right.

155
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:08,334
What do you mean? The One is being bought out?

156
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,802
Yes, apparently.

157
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:12,733
Rumours are running rampant.

158
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,272
The due diligence team was there,

159
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:16,273
which means it's almost a done deal now.

160
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,604
So?

161
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:19,873
What will happen to Young Eun, then?

162
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:21,313
She'll have two options.

163
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:25,244
She can either stay or quit.

164
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:31,723
Overall, the designs are not trendy enough.

165
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:32,883
The style is far from the trends...

166
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:35,223
So this is La Fayere's feedback. Was there anything else?

167
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:39,523
No. It seems like it'll take a while to reach an agreement.

168
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:41,433
This is too vague.

169
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,333
If it's about the style and trends...

170
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,662
They also mentioned some issues with the sizes and lengths too.

171
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:49,004
As for the dress, they want a relaxed fit,

172
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:52,374
so how about we loosen it up a bit with an inner waistband?

173
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:55,974
We should consult the pattern team first, right?

174
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:03,124
Na Ri.

175
00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:08,724
Is there a point in working hard like this?

176
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:10,192
What, then?

177
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,494
Should we just give up on the project with La Fayere?

178
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:14,932
The company might get bought out.

179
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,563
Will anyone even care?

180
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,204
Yes.

181
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,033
I care.

182
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,104
Did the company already get bought out?

183
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,543
There has been no official announcement about it yet.

184
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,613
Why are you acting like we've already been bought out?

185
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:33,113
The due diligence team was here, so it's just a matter of time.

186
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:35,214
Leave that up to the top management team.

187
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:38,422
We're designers, so we should focus on making clothes.

188
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:40,494
I guess you're not even worried.

189
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,634
I feel the same way as you do.

190
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,163
I have a lot on my mind now, and I am worried too.

191
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,864
I can sit here and worry all I want, but it won't change anything.

192
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,634
The only thing it'll do...

193
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,903
is cause me shoulder pain and make me sigh.

194
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:00,543
So let's focus, okay?

195
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,913
Let's book a meeting with the pattern team first.

196
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:04,714
Okay, I will.

197
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:07,783
I'll go to their office and take care of it.

198
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,733
Okay, please take good care of it.

199
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,642
- Thank you for joining us. - Thank you.

200
00:11:31,643 --> 00:11:34,143
- Today, we'll... - Take good care of what?

201
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,613
I put the house up for sale. If the realtor comes by...

202
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,614
with prospective buyers, show them around.

203
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:43,052
- What? - When it gets sold,

204
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,623
we'll give Young Eun some of it to pay her back...

205
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,723
for clearing our debt for us.

206
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,354
After that, we'll split the rest in half.

207
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,223
Who says you can sell my house?

208
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:52,923
You don't have sole ownership of this house.

209
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,464
I own half of it.

210
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:58,864
In any case, I won't sign the divorce papers. I refuse!

211
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,073
- Why won't you sign it? - Because I'm angry.

212
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,203
You've lived comfortably all your life thanks to me.

213
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:04,743
I can't believe you asked for a divorce...

214
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,104
as soon as I retired.

215
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,244
I refuse to sign the papers because I'm so livid.

216
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:10,084
- So you want to take it to court? - Sure!

217
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,613
Let's be honest here. It's not like I gambled,

218
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:15,254
hit you, or cheated on you.

219
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:18,423
I've done nothing to be forced to divorce.

220
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:22,594
You cheated on me.

221
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:24,594
I cheated?

222
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,094
When?

223
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,662
I don't even have the energy to grab her by the hair.

224
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:32,933
And honestly, I don't even care.

225
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:35,504
I'll just divorce you, clean and simple.

226
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,244
So go live with that woman.

227
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,244
"That woman"? Who are you talking about?

228
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:40,874
Ms. Wit!

229
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,584
Ms. Wit...

230
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,143
This is my number.

231
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,052
Feel free to call me if you ever need my help.

232
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,283
Witness.

233
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,254
Ms. Wit.

234
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,964
Oh, that's...

235
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,432
Wait! My goodness.

236
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,834
Hey! Wait! Gosh, I can't believe this.

237
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,903
One chicken sandwich combo...

238
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,442
with a salad, please.

239
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,844
Sure, no problem.

240
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:23,954
Being bought out isn't always a bad thing.

241
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:26,384
It could actually help the company grow.

242
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,553
I'm not worried.

243
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:31,594
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

244
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,234
What do you mean? You work for the company.

245
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,864
I know nothing about business management,

246
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,464
and I'm not part of the management team.

247
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,504
You're not worried at all?

248
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,073
Just as we all die,

249
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,874
companies can't live forever either.

250
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:48,473
During our allotted lifespan,

251
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:51,744
we live, enjoy our prime, and die.

252
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:54,484
It's a natural cycle of life.

253
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,254
Exactly.

254
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:59,224
Our mothers may be against our relationship now,

255
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,254
but things won't stay this way forever.

256
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:04,193
When some time passes,

257
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,634
things could change.

258
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:10,803
So just until then,

259
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:13,874
can we be patient and wait?

260
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:18,773
When some time passes,

261
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,413
and if they see that we're sure about this,

262
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:25,084
both of our mothers...

263
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,584
will come to understand us eventually.

264
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:36,124
I like your shirt.

265
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,364
I like that colour.

266
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,903
You like black?

267
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,273
I like blue-black.

268
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:49,432
It looks like black.

269
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:53,474
But under bright lights, it looks like dark blue.

270
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,984
Black isn't always dark and dull.

271
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:03,984
Sometimes, it has a colour that you never expected to see.

272
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:10,163
Just like a breakup isn't always sad and hard.

273
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,823
I suppose you were well enough to come to the community center.

274
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,634
Why don't you send him back to Paris?

275
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:49,634
You said he lived there for years.

276
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,234
Why should he? This is his home now, and his mother is here.

277
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:56,474
Distance makes the heart grow apart.

278
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,504
I made it clear to Ms. Ha Young Eun...

279
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:03,073
that I will never allow it.

280
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,552
Why would you tell that to my daughter?

281
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,584
Just talk to your son and make sure he listens to you.

282
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:12,523
Why? He won't listen to you?

283
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:16,653
Jae Guk is very sweet and gentle.

284
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:18,624
I raised him with all my heart.

285
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:22,234
It's not like I only fed Young Eun and did nothing else.

286
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,663
I'll be honest. We're not on the same level.

287
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,802
It's true.

288
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,134
What? You're talking about levels now?

289
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:38,213
Hi, Young Eun.

290
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,052
I'm with Jae Guk's mother right now.

291
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,483
This woman is saying we're not on the same level.

292
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,753
Does she think she's above us because she's rich...

293
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,994
and lives in a wealthy neighbourhood?

294
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:50,663
Hey, your father was a vice-principal.

295
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,823
You come from a family of educators.

296
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:55,792
Mom, I can't talk right now.

297
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,233
She said she told you that she'd never approve of you.

298
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:01,004
Did that not make you loathe her enough?

299
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:03,704
Mom.

300
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,812
I'll call you later.

301
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:07,914
Let me talk to her.

302
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:13,144
Hello. It's me, Yoon Jae Guk.

303
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:16,883
Mr. Yoon Jae Guk?

304
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:19,954
Are you with Young Eun right now?

305
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:21,793
Listen.

306
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:25,424
Your mother says that we're not on the same level...

307
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,593
and that she'll never approve of Young Eun.

308
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,433
Why won't you listen to your mother?

309
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:30,833
Must you make Young Eun suffer like this?

310
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,533
- Let me talk to her. - No.

311
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:36,974
Yes, I'm listening.

312
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,944
You see, Young Eun managed to join The One...

313
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:48,184
and worked her way up without any connections or help.

314
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,583
She's very capable and pretty.

315
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,493
Anyone would say that she's a great catch.

316
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:54,753
Your mother is clueless.

317
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:57,164
How dare she say we're not on the same level?

318
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:02,062
Let me just say this. People in your family think...

319
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:04,164
they can say whatever they want because they're rich.

320
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:07,903
I can't stand such obnoxious snobs. Do you understand?

321
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,934
- Look. - I'm against this too.

322
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,503
I'll never approve of you either,

323
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,873
so please leave my daughter alone.

324
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,273
Okay?

325
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,793
Goodness. You want to talk about levels?

326
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,363
Oh, dear.

327
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,533
Don't you dare talk down to me. He's your out-of-wedlock child.

328
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,072
- What? - My goodness.

329
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:48,674
Take a good look at your own family before you belittle mine.

330
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:50,484
How dare you say such a thing?

331
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:06,323
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

332
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,603
Let's eat.

333
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,183
Mother

334
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,553
Mom

335
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:58,484
She's very upset.

336
00:19:58,843 --> 00:19:59,984
Be nice.

337
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,593
Why did you do that?

338
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,863
I didn't start it.

339
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:20,603
She started it first. She was being unreasonable.

340
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,873
They're not unreasonable people.

341
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:26,704
Are you saying it's my fault?

342
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:28,944
You're a lady of dignity,

343
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:30,943
but I'm not like that.

344
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:32,644
I'm not elegant,

345
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:36,383
and I'm not classy like you and Soo Wan.

346
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:39,622
Do you have to be like this?

347
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,123
Can't you see how upset she is?

348
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:45,424
Because you're my son.

349
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,593
That's why I did it.

350
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:51,103
Because...

351
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,174
you're my child.

352
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,434
That's why I said that to her.

353
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:58,644
Does that answer your question?

354
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:06,543
Why did you do that?

355
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:08,583
Because it was necessary, okay?

356
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,583
Mom, do you have to be like this?

357
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,754
I'm already stressed out as is.

358
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:14,852
What? She raised him with all her heart?

359
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,163
Was she trying to say that I did a half-hearted job?

360
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:19,562
All mothers feel the same way.

361
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:21,193
If she cherishes her son that much,

362
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:23,532
she should know that I cherish my child just as much.

363
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,533
Hey.

364
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,072
I'm against this even if she'd welcome you with open arms.

365
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:30,473
This is my relationship, and he's my boyfriend.

366
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:32,203
Why must our mothers step in?

367
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,603
I never said I was marrying him.

368
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,713
That's it. That's exactly why I'm so upset.

369
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:38,444
You have no interest in getting married.

370
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,754
You're just wasting your time with that punk.

371
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:45,582
Okay, Mom. I got it, so stop complaining.

372
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,822
It won't work out.

373
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,753
Not just Yoon Jae Guk,

374
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:51,092
but that woman he calls mom is nasty too.

375
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,894
I said I got it. You can stop now.

376
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:57,703
Your dad is seeing someone.

377
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:59,363
I said I got it already.

378
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,103
What do you mean?

379
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,042
This is defamation.

380
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:08,612
She critically damaged my honour.

381
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:12,183
I won't let this go. You'd better apologize sincerely!

382
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:13,644
Dad is telling the truth.

383
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:17,454
He got conned trying to arrange a trip for two to Europe.

384
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,583
I'm an innocent victim.

385
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,123
Europe, my foot.

386
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:24,562
Where did you suddenly get that idea?

387
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:27,063
You said you're the only one in your group who has never been there.

388
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:28,464
You...

389
00:22:30,664 --> 00:22:32,664
Don't you feel sorry for your daughter?

390
00:22:32,904 --> 00:22:34,003
Mom.

391
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,733
As we get older, the hospital is the only place we'll go to.

392
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,373
You should think of saving up...

393
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:40,714
so we can pay our own medical bills.

394
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,342
Why are you so immature?

395
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:46,484
Why are you unable to see or plan for the future?

396
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,983
"We have no tomorrow." Is that your motto now?

397
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,822
Did I do it for my own pleasure?

398
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,154
I'd saved up my allowance.

399
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:57,122
You should consider one's sincerity.

400
00:22:57,123 --> 00:22:59,393
All you ever talked about was money.

401
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:00,793
Darn money.

402
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,903
You had to go and lose all our savings.

403
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:06,934
I struggled and suffered to scrimp and save for years.

404
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,203
People say I'm below their level.

405
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,443
Why should I be mocked?

406
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:13,744
Did I want to lose our savings?

407
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:16,372
I vouched for someone and it didn't work out.

408
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:18,043
That was long ago.

409
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,383
After I got pregnant with Young Eun at 27,

410
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,823
I was left with just one dream.

411
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:26,424
To own a home in Seoul...

412
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:28,454
and share your burden...

413
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,424
so that Young Eun doesn't have to move around.

414
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,934
Do you think my life was any better?

415
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:39,233
Teachers much younger than me...

416
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,704
had connections to the director...

417
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:42,404
or were related to the vice-principal.

418
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:45,174
They became a senior teacher or vice-principal before me.

419
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:50,174
Every day, I had to bow to them and speak politely.

420
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:52,813
I never said I would quit.

421
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:54,352
Because I'm the breadwinner.

422
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,783
Because I had a family that relied on me.

423
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,883
That's the kind of life I had!

424
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:01,793
You don't know anything!

425
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:04,224
Darn it.

426
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,934
Good for you, show-off!

427
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,234
My gosh.

428
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:12,063
Why is everyone showing off today?

429
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:35,293
Mom.

430
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:38,063
We know that...

431
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:42,234
you had it tough and that you suffered.

432
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,704
I hated it sometimes too, you know.

433
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,504
I cut my life in half...

434
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:51,474
and devoted half to your dad,

435
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,813
and half to you.

436
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:57,444
I spent every day in anxiety,

437
00:24:58,184 --> 00:25:01,414
wondering and worrying.

438
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,553
It was my life.

439
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,194
Kang Jung Ja's life.

440
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:13,293
But I never lived as Kang Jung Ja.

441
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:20,063
Now I'm old and wrinkly,

442
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:22,603
and...

443
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,944
it's so upsetting.

444
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:53,363
I didn't get to...

445
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,504
live my life either.

446
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:43,214
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

447
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:56,934
You're now an expert at steaming eggs.

448
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:10,543
I read that ice helps keep it down.

449
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:16,053
Thanks.

450
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:23,823
What will you do for my funeral?

451
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:25,793
What?

452
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:30,264
The same old yukgaejang,

453
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,704
cold flat meatballs,

454
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:37,333
and dried squid aren't a good enough send-off for me.

455
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,403
Rinse out your mouth after you eat.

456
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:41,943
So you don't get stomatitis.

457
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:43,474
If possible,

458
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,553
host a party for me while I'm still alive.

459
00:27:47,954 --> 00:27:49,684
Exciting and luxurious.

460
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,583
Shall I wear a dress?

461
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:54,694
I'd look great now that I'm slim.

462
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:59,194
You need to drink 12 cups of water a day.

463
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,833
I'll invite some guests,

464
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:08,904
eat, drink, and have fun with them,

465
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:12,644
then thank them for joining my picnic on earth.

466
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:16,573
Let me say goodbye like that.

467
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,313
Leave the dirty dishes.

468
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,914
Don't touch the knives. Your cut can get infected.

469
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:29,754
Host my funeral before my condition gets even worse.

470
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:33,523
Will you?

471
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,363
Why do you keep talking about saying goodbye?

472
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,964
You aren't dead yet.

473
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,004
You still breathe.

474
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:41,674
And talk.

475
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:46,144
We still see each other. You're not dead yet. You're alive!

476
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:47,843
Why do you keep...

477
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:51,813
Honey.

478
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:57,313
I want to die happy.

479
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:04,264
Let me do that.

480
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:06,793
Will you?

481
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:05,724
Can you really not leave her?

482
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,133
I...

483
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,073
don't like her, Jae Guk.

484
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:25,974
Can't you...

485
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:29,414
give in?

486
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,464
Let's break up.

487
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,164
Before we hurt each other more.

488
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,234
Before we fight...

489
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:53,904
and get tired of it.

490
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,953
Hello, sir.

491
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,353
You have a visitor. Don't just stand and gape.

492
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:15,592
Pardon? Oh, right.

493
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:18,593
Silly me. Please, take a seat.

494
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:22,733
Would you like some coffee? Or tea?

495
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:24,563
I'm fine. Sit down.

496
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:25,863
Okay.

497
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,073
How are things with Chi Sook?

498
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,313
Going well?

499
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:39,214
We just parted after having brunch together nearby.

500
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,613
Any progress?

501
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,983
We're making great progress.

502
00:31:43,984 --> 00:31:48,254
Today, at last, I gifted her a book of poems.

503
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:51,764
- Poems? - Yes. Poems.

504
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:56,664
What's that?

505
00:32:08,414 --> 00:32:10,414
It's a book of poems just like you.

506
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,753
I'm torn and shabby?

507
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:16,184
There are 100 trillion poems.

508
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:19,183
You can combine whichever four lines...

509
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,622
to make 100 trillion poems.

510
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:23,393
That is 10 to the power of 14, and it's amazingly unique.

511
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:26,964
That is not at all poor or shabby.

512
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:30,394
It's very special.

513
00:32:32,563 --> 00:32:33,633
Right.

514
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:39,043
Do you usually live with your head in the clouds?

515
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:43,343
Being in love is like writing a poem.

516
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:47,613
It permeates your heart, moves you, and touches others.

517
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:50,082
Do you own your home or rent it?

518
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,322
I paid off the mortgage two years ago,

519
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:55,253
so it is all mine now.

520
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:57,592
How is your health? Your cholesterol levels.

521
00:32:57,593 --> 00:33:00,062
I got a full physical last month.

522
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,464
My blood is so clean it's Grade One.

523
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:05,603
What do you like about Chi Sook?

524
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:09,103
- Pardon? - What about her do you like?

525
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:12,444
Everything.

526
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,413
I like how she's so clueless,

527
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:16,072
how she apologizes right away,

528
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:19,783
and how she doesn't know how beautiful she is.

529
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,083
I like everything.

530
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:26,353
Are you sure that she likes you too?

531
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:28,754
I would think so.

532
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:33,394
When I gave her the book of poems, she smiled.

533
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:38,064
I bet that right now, she'll be falling for me.

534
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,334
Young Eun.

535
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:46,572
Shouldn't a present be incredibly sparkly,

536
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:51,783
hot off the production line, or a very precious limited edition?

537
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:55,153
They want a different silhouette?

538
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,584
It lacks the sensibility that Parisians love.

539
00:33:57,713 --> 00:33:58,982
I lack sensibility?

540
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,624
It's their way of saying we don't have the touch.

541
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,863
- Ha Young Eun, you... - I'm busy. Bye.

542
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,064
How rude.

543
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:14,133
They all ignore me.

544
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,802
Everyone looks down on Hwang Chi Sook.

545
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:18,774
I gave you the contacts of all the head managers.

546
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:20,543
Soo Ho?

547
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,942
- We're done. - Is he back?

548
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,213
Call them yourself.

549
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:26,343
No, wait.

550
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:28,914
I can't manage on my own.

551
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:31,483
They're your connections and your people.

552
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:33,783
Making them yours is a skill too.

553
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,724
Start working on it.

554
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:37,354
Mr. Kwak.

555
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,564
- What... - Can't you come back?

556
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:43,633
I can't manage without you.

557
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:47,003
- I can't stand what... - Ms. Seo.

558
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:51,033
I don't want to meddle with your personal life.

559
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:53,604
I just need you back.

560
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:55,644
Listen carefully.

561
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:58,983
I'm not a great guy.

562
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,544
My fashion sense?

563
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:04,583
My wife buys me outdated items and dresses me well enough...

564
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:06,482
so that it doesn't show.

565
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,652
The reason I could focus on my work...

566
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:12,764
was that my wife raised our kid all on her own.

567
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:14,422
Mr. Kwak.

568
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:16,393
Don't fall for a married man.

569
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:17,533
It's all...

570
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,604
my wife's work.

571
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,703
Until they hire my replacement,

572
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,603
email me any questions about work.

573
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,744
Stop calling me.

574
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:30,173
Mr. Kwak.

575
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:31,744
Mr. Kwak.

576
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,523
No way.

577
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:44,563
The skirt is too short.

578
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:46,363
Let's lengthen it.

579
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:47,664
Excuse me.

580
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,133
- Ha Young Eun speaking. - Young Eun.

581
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,902
What did I tell you? You said I was wrong.

582
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,473
I said Soo Ho has a woman!

583
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:57,334
The punk is having an affair!

584
00:35:58,144 --> 00:35:59,943
Just wait. I'll tell Mi Sook...

585
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:01,673
Where are you?

586
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,244
Don't do anything. Meet me first.

587
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,283
Where are you?

588
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:09,402
She's being betrayed and we should hide it from her?

589
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:11,402
That's disregarding her.

590
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,873
It's about her, we all know, and she's the last to find out?

591
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:15,744
Do you know how much that hurts?

592
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:17,913
- She's sick. - Exactly.

593
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,943
He's cheating on his sick wife.

594
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:21,544
She deserves to know.

595
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,843
What if it makes her worse?

596
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,112
What?

597
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:26,914
The chemotherapy's barely keeping her going.

598
00:36:27,014 --> 00:36:29,653
If she gets the shocking news her husband's having an affair,

599
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:31,693
can she handle all that?

600
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:33,193
Who knows?

601
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:36,494
It might make her furious and give her will to fight.

602
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:52,914
What is it?

603
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,684
Just spit it out.

604
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,053
I missed you, that's all.

605
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,323
That's it?

606
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,823
That's the weirdest thing I ever heard you say.

607
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,494
Why are you holding Ji Min?

608
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:10,693
I guess she didn't nap at kindergarten.

609
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,564
She wanted me to hug her.

610
00:37:13,193 --> 00:37:15,104
She's heavy. I'll take her to bed.

611
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:17,233
It's not tiring at all.

612
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:22,003
I'm so happy that I can hold my baby.

613
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:24,104
Do you even eat?

614
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:25,974
Hey.

615
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:29,942
I could never lose any weight whatever diet I tried.

616
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,414
Now I can wear everything I used to model in.

617
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:34,014
I look great too.

618
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:35,723
But no one wants me.

619
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:37,752
Do you still want to model?

620
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:38,994
Do you have regrets?

621
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,893
I regret everything.

622
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:44,834
I should've hugged Ji Min one more time.

623
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:48,604
I should've loved my husband more.

624
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:51,603
I'll take care of all that in one go,

625
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,133
and leave peacefully.

626
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,744
Forget about Soo Ho.

627
00:37:56,704 --> 00:37:59,813
Anyway, why are you thinking of leaving already?

628
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:01,343
You should think of holding on.

629
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,883
Letting go is love too.

630
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:07,612
What's more romantic than giving someone...

631
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:10,253
everything you can, then parting amicably?

632
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:13,692
That's why, girls,

633
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:18,164
while you have someone you love, express it freely and openly.

634
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:22,204
Don't scrimp, okay?

635
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:33,744
Will you really go all the way?

636
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:35,644
I think so.

637
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,584
Though I don't know what the end will be like.

638
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:43,253
Even if you lose everything?

639
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:48,124
To be honest,

640
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:51,564
it's my love and my marriage.

641
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,204
I still don't understand why I need a parent's permission.

642
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:58,133
It's my life.

643
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,774
She's mine and it's my choice.

644
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,343
There are things you can't see when you're in that position.

645
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:10,283
That's when you must heed the things...

646
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,213
the people around you say.

647
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,653
I just want to find a partner.

648
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:17,124
And I found her.

649
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:21,923
The fact that it's Young Eun is a tragedy.

650
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:25,533
How would you know that?

651
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,704
At the time, you didn't even know Soo Wan...

652
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,903
was going to break up with her.

653
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:33,903
That's why you went after him...

654
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,274
in the rain.

655
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:45,213
When the police told me Soo Wan had been drinking,

656
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,253
I found it odd.

657
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:51,053
The Soo Wan I know...

658
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,593
never drank on his own.

659
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:57,934
So I found out where he'd gone to drink.

660
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,363
He was with a woman.

661
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,604
I heard someone had been there with him.

662
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:06,874
I found out it was you.

663
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,604
I remember because they come here sometimes.

664
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,813
The man had a few drinks then left.

665
00:40:11,814 --> 00:40:13,314
She followed him right away.

666
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,113
They drove here in separate cars,

667
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:19,514
and I think the lady drove after the man.

668
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:42,942
I realized Soo Wan had been drinking,

669
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:44,343
Yoo Jung

670
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:47,443
only after he'd set off.

671
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,923
It was raining heavily.

672
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:57,994
I thought...

673
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,053
I had to stop him.

674
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,423
That it was dangerous.

675
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:09,133
That he shouldn't drive off like that.

676
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,394
Why...

677
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:42,363
did you not tell anyone until now?

678
00:41:44,264 --> 00:41:45,434
Because I knew...

679
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,803
you loved him with all your heart.

680
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:54,783
And that you would suffer more than anyone.

681
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:57,244
And because...

682
00:41:58,713 --> 00:41:59,954
it was an accident.

683
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:43,093
Well done.

684
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:45,893
It's sad that, after all the hard work,

685
00:42:45,894 --> 00:42:50,434
we have no choice if the new owner wants us all gone.

686
00:42:50,764 --> 00:42:52,633
Did you email La Fayere?

687
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,434
They'll get back to us.

688
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:56,874
I'll follow up with them. Go home.

689
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:58,514
Okay. See you tomorrow.

690
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,873
Let's all work hard tomorrow.

691
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:01,914
See you.

692
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,713
Bye.

693
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,283
Director Hwang

694
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:09,983
What is it?

695
00:43:10,823 --> 00:43:12,653
Do you have a date with Cookie tonight?

696
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:15,624
We're meeting up after work.

697
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:16,963
Why?

698
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:18,164
I plan to give Do Hoon...

699
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:21,463
a taste of what real and passionate love is all about.

700
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,764
Mi Sook's right. Let's not wait.

701
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,873
I'll pull out all the stops.

702
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:29,474
So send Cookie home as late as possible, okay?

703
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:03,044
Would you fancy a drink with me tonight?

704
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:10,113
Yoon Jae Guk

705
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,814
Hey, it's me.

706
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,283
Where are you?

707
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:32,703
Excessive drinking is bad for your health,

708
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,274
and I care a lot about your health.

709
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,172
Are you sure we're dating?

710
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:40,913
- Of course. - Then what's wrong with you?

711
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:42,743
I was expecting to go on a date with you,

712
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:43,842
but you just got me a poetry book.

713
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:45,853
I come here to drink with you, but you offer me tea.

714
00:44:45,854 --> 00:44:47,712
Next time, maybe we should just meet at a bakery...

715
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:49,353
so we can eat sweet red bean buns with milk.

716
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,983
Sure. That sounds nice.

717
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:55,994
What's the matter with you? Do you even like me?

718
00:44:56,724 --> 00:44:57,893
Of course.

719
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:00,493
Why would I spend time with a woman I don't even like?

720
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:02,632
Then what's with the lukewarm attitude?

721
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,632
Poetry books and tea are far from the kind of romance...

722
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,003
that sparks between two adults.

723
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:10,474
It's because you're precious to me.

724
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:16,613
I don't know what kind of relationships you've had.

725
00:45:17,443 --> 00:45:19,314
But now that you're dating me,

726
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:22,483
you've become the most precious person in my life,

727
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:24,684
Chi Sook.

728
00:45:58,224 --> 00:46:00,124
Additional edit requests for La Fayere

729
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:06,533
Charge battery

730
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,403
Do you have a lot of work to do?

731
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:18,044
The people in Paris want us to change our design.

732
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:21,414
Their opinions differ from ours, and we're trying to make it work.

733
00:46:25,814 --> 00:46:26,883
Mother

734
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,053
Aren't you going to pick that up?

735
00:46:48,843 --> 00:46:50,003
Hey, Mom.

736
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,213
Yes.

737
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:02,553
Yes.

738
00:47:03,883 --> 00:47:05,354
I had dinner.

739
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,024
Yes.

740
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:11,593
Don't worry.

741
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,003
Okay.

742
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,073
This is a glimpse of what's going to happen if we stay together.

743
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:28,014
You won't even be able to answer your mother's calls comfortably.

744
00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:45,593
That's not a good enough reason to give up on us.

745
00:47:46,394 --> 00:47:49,434
"In the end, they got married..."

746
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,633
"and lived happily ever after."

747
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:54,434
You can't always say that's a happy ending.

748
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:58,713
Marriage isn't what completes love.

749
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,613
Exchanging wedding vows...

750
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,314
doesn't guarantee that we will love each other forever.

751
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:05,684
If that happens, we can end it then.

752
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:08,083
We won't be able to visit our parents during the holidays.

753
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:10,652
We'll have to refrain from mentioning each other's mothers.

754
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:14,593
We'll always end up feeling sorry even though it's no one's fault.

755
00:48:14,994 --> 00:48:17,123
We'll try so hard to please each other...

756
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:19,633
and pretend like we're both okay even though it's difficult.

757
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,033
Why do you keep looking for excuses?

758
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,374
Why do you keep looking for reasons to break up?

759
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,874
Because I love you.

760
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,744
But just because you love someone...

761
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,213
doesn't mean you must hold onto them.

762
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:37,584
Knowing when to let go is also another form of love.

763
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,713
I care more about...

764
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:47,354
how truly and sincerely we spend our time together.

765
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:49,764
What matters...

766
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:53,033
is that we share those moments.

767
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:58,164
At least, that won't leave us with any regrets.

768
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:08,544
From the moment we met to this very moment,

769
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,854
I have no regrets whatsoever.

770
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:13,814
So...

771
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:16,724
you can talk about breaking up after we try everything we can.

772
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:19,923
If things still don't work out,

773
00:49:21,553 --> 00:49:23,264
then you can call it quits.

774
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:28,093
That's when I'll give you my answer.

775
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,144
I never once...

776
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,854
asked you for anything like a little kid before.

777
00:50:54,883 --> 00:50:55,954
But...

778
00:50:58,354 --> 00:50:59,894
I'm so sorry, Mom.

779
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,564
But can I do that just this once?

780
00:51:07,294 --> 00:51:09,033
Let me be stubborn...

781
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:12,874
just this once, Mom.

782
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:16,744
Please...

783
00:51:19,144 --> 00:51:20,414
accept Young Eun.

784
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,943
What am I going to do, Soo Wan?

785
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:28,113
What am I going to do with your brother?

786
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:49,304
I can't believe they're asking us for a fabric test report.

787
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:51,772
The fabric was approved and is already being manufactured.

788
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:52,914
We can't do that all over again.

789
00:51:53,773 --> 00:51:55,582
The cost of production alone was 500,000 dollars.

790
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,613
The factory used all their machines to manufacture our clothes.

791
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:00,783
If we cancel our fabric order,

792
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,283
they won't be able to make a single penny this season.

793
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:05,793
That kind of loss will cost way more than 500,000 dollars.

794
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:09,124
Why can't they just use the fabric? There are no defects with it.

795
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:11,723
Are they doing this because they know we can't do anything?

796
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:13,264
Does that mean they just want to cancel everything?

797
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,364
Ms. Ha.

798
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:18,364
They just sent us another request to modify something.

799
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:29,083
It's not the design. They want us to make athleisure clothing.

800
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:33,212
So they just want us to do what everyone else is doing.

801
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:34,812
But we can't just...

802
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:37,723
suddenly start making tennis skirts and track pants.

803
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:39,823
They have more power. What other choice do we have?

804
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,623
Still, we can't just throw away the identity of our brand.

805
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:45,562
Use their feedback as a reference, but let's keep our colour...

806
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:47,133
and make one last modification.

807
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:55,333
There are two vacant spots at our company.

808
00:52:55,403 --> 00:52:56,542
Are you interested in coming?

809
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:58,474
When can you give me a final answer?

810
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,974
I'll need to talk to Na Ri.

811
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:10,554
Are you really not going to join me?

812
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:11,752
You're a chief manager here,

813
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:12,792
but they're going to make you the head of design.

814
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:15,923
We can't quit at the same time. What about the pop-up at La Fayere?

815
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:20,494
You know how important of a project this is to Ms. Ha...

816
00:53:20,894 --> 00:53:22,304
and Sono.

817
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:23,902
Who cares?

818
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:26,773
It's not like the company is loyal enough to ask for our opinions.

819
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,332
They don't care.

820
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,144
So why should the employees care?

821
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:34,974
They're only willing to take me in as long as you come with me.

822
00:53:36,014 --> 00:53:38,914
So give it some thought and let me know.

823
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:41,883
If you decide not to go, I'll have to apply for other positions.

824
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:52,793
Are you saying we can't accept the conditions from La Fayere?

825
00:53:53,193 --> 00:53:55,803
We had that fabric manufactured especially for our design.

826
00:53:55,804 --> 00:53:58,732
If we change the fabric, we'll have to change the design.

827
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:01,533
Then we won't have enough time to order new fabric.

828
00:54:01,534 --> 00:54:04,203
But why are you suddenly packing your stuff?

829
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:07,272
No one should stay in the same place for too long.

830
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:09,082
Stagnant water is bound to rot.

831
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,244
If you're too heavy, you sink and drown.

832
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:14,353
I just thought it'd be nice to clean my office for a change.

833
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:17,123
So what do you want to do about La Fayere?

834
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:19,823
I'll see if we can meet halfway by the end of this week.

835
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,422
If we can't, I'll try to find a new way.

836
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:23,562
Okay, do whatever you need to do.

837
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:25,793
Young Eun, go ahead and try everything you want.

838
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:27,264
You have my full support.

839
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,364
Goodness.

840
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,033
Apparently, the colour isn't in trend.

841
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:37,704
They want orchid pink or solar red, but that won't go with our designs.

842
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:41,013
We can't change the main outfits, so tell them...

843
00:54:41,014 --> 00:54:43,482
we'll go with two neon-coloured dresses.

844
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:45,183
Check all the samples once they're ready.

845
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:46,783
Tell Ms. Ha the moment you notice any problems.

846
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,784
Okay.

847
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,353
The length is a bit too long, so we should shorten it a little.

848
00:54:51,423 --> 00:54:54,193
Ms. Ha, they want things to be a little more European.

849
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:57,494
What do you think about this colour?

850
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,593
- I think it's a bit too feminine. - I'll try this.

851
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:01,963
- Give it a check. - Okay.

852
00:55:08,603 --> 00:55:09,673
Here.

853
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:13,014
They're not even replying to our emails.

854
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:16,943
Don't wake her up.

855
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:21,353
Okay.

856
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:24,752
Na Ri, haven't they replied yet?

857
00:55:24,753 --> 00:55:26,423
The person-in-charge went on a business trip.

858
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:47,344
Madam Min, I'm here.

859
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,043
What are you doing in there?

860
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:58,054
I need you...

861
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,193
to do something with me today.

862
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:11,864
- Ms. Ha. - Yes? What is it?

863
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,073
Are you looking for ideas?

864
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:16,502
I'm hoping it might help me come up with something.

865
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:20,043
Imagine inviting buyers to a show like that and hear their applause.

866
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:21,974
That kind of stuff will never happen in our country.

867
00:56:24,383 --> 00:56:25,413
Did you get a reply?

868
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:27,954
No. We got samples for the fabric. They want our final decision.

869
00:56:28,614 --> 00:56:29,753
Gosh. Okay.

870
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:34,724
I brought you the samples.

871
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:38,293
If you tell us your final decision, we'll try to match the order.

872
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:44,062
They look a little different under the sun,

873
00:56:44,063 --> 00:56:45,164
so keep that in mind.

874
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:50,574
This is for the SS collection, so I suggest brighter colours.

875
00:56:51,603 --> 00:56:53,013
Is this also black?

876
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:55,043
That's Charleston green.

877
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:57,443
If you look at it under the sun, you'll see that it's green.

878
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,253
But I guess it does fall under the colour black.

879
00:57:09,124 --> 00:57:10,394
Black has...

880
00:57:11,624 --> 00:57:13,164
so many colours.

881
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:17,733
Let's go ahead with the fabric that we initially decided on.

882
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:21,833
Send an email and tell them we can't make any more changes.

883
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:23,402
Are you serious?

884
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:25,443
What if they cancel everything?

885
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:28,213
What's the point of doing things their way?

886
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:30,744
If we make clothes merely based on their opinions,

887
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:33,114
we wouldn't be able to call them our clothes.

888
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:37,383
Make sure you tell them that we'll proceed...

889
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,153
based on our most recent discussion if they don't reply by tomorrow.

890
00:57:40,894 --> 00:57:41,923
Okay.

891
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:06,554
You're here.

892
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:09,014
I wanted to get this done before you arrived.

893
00:58:10,023 --> 00:58:11,253
What are you doing?

894
00:58:12,324 --> 00:58:15,624
It's time that I let Soo Wan go.

895
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:18,364
Mom.

896
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:19,963
Let's drink tea.

897
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:32,974
I continued to live for you and Soo Wan.

898
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,644
As a woman, it was humiliating and miserable...

899
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:41,583
to live with a husband who no longer loved me.

900
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:45,554
But I didn't stay married...

901
00:58:47,494 --> 00:58:49,793
because I thought that he'd regret and come back to me.

902
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:52,264
I just didn't want...

903
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:54,793
you and Soo Wan to get criticized...

904
00:58:56,434 --> 00:58:59,903
for growing up in a divorced household.

905
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:01,773
I wanted a perfect life...

906
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:04,804
for my kids.

907
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,114
Maybe that was why...

908
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:11,983
I was so against Soo Wan's relationship with her.

909
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,383
I couldn't believe he wanted to leave Yoo Jung for another girl.

910
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,563
If you wish to keep her by your side, then go ahead.

911
00:59:24,124 --> 00:59:27,594
I won't stop you anymore. I'll give in.

912
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:30,934
- Mom. - Instead,

913
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,273
you can be with her after I'm gone.

914
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:38,244
Once I'm no longer alive. So I won't be able to see you guys.

915
00:59:39,313 --> 00:59:40,574
You can be with each other then.

916
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:43,844
Mom, how could you say that?

917
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:45,184
It's horrible, right?

918
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:47,614
But she's even worse.

919
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:49,114
The fact that she's still with you...

920
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:51,153
even after I told her the same thing.

921
00:59:52,184 --> 00:59:54,693
She scares me, and I don't like her.

922
00:59:55,994 --> 00:59:57,394
What do you mean?

923
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:01,664
Are you telling me you said this to her as well?

924
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:05,833
I felt like it was the only way.

925
01:00:06,673 --> 01:00:09,273
So I told her...

926
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,574
that I'd die.

927
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:15,614
I did that...

928
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:18,883
because it was the only way to make her leave you.

929
01:00:21,114 --> 01:00:23,683
What would you want to do with me if we didn't have much time left...

930
01:00:23,684 --> 01:00:24,883
to spend together?

931
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:26,753
And after all that,

932
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:31,193
how about we break up with a smile on our faces?

933
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:36,864
You can use...

934
01:00:38,503 --> 01:00:39,673
Soo Wan's room.

935
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:44,543
You should move in now. Stop roaming around.

936
01:00:44,844 --> 01:00:45,874
Mom.

937
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:48,443
You're being obsessive.

938
01:00:49,074 --> 01:00:52,013
That's because you're my son.

939
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:54,583
Yes, I know. I am your son.

940
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,753
I never once denied that.

941
01:00:57,853 --> 01:01:00,152
I admire you and like you.

942
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:01,153
But...

943
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:04,523
that doesn't give you...

944
01:01:05,824 --> 01:01:07,693
the right to make my decisions for me.

945
01:01:08,693 --> 01:01:10,963
- Jae Guk. - How could you...

946
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:13,403
say that to her?

947
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:16,304
How could you...

948
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:19,943
hurt her like that?

949
01:01:20,114 --> 01:01:22,414
- Jae Guk. - I love her.

950
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:26,114
I can't live without her.

951
01:01:29,454 --> 01:01:31,153
How could you blackmail her...

952
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:35,394
like that?

953
01:01:37,023 --> 01:01:38,124
Because...

954
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:40,733
I had to protect you.

955
01:01:41,534 --> 01:01:44,463
That love wasn't even enough...

956
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,773
to protect Soo Wan.

957
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:52,374
Jae Guk.

958
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:57,344
You're crossing the line.

959
01:01:58,744 --> 01:02:01,013
How could you say that to me?

960
01:02:01,014 --> 01:02:02,213
You're my mom.

961
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:05,923
That's the only reason why I'm still here.

962
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:11,523
Otherwise, you'd be out of my life already.

963
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,043
Jae Guk.

964
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:08,914
I'm sorry.

965
01:03:12,824 --> 01:03:13,853
I'm sorry.

966
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,003
Let me add one more thing to the list of things I want to do.

967
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:30,974
I want to hug you at work...

968
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:35,474
without caring about what other people might think.

969
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:40,353
He answered me with sadness,

970
01:03:41,813 --> 01:03:43,353
but I replied with happiness.

971
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:53,164
Just like how black can be made of many different colours,

972
01:03:56,903 --> 01:03:58,164
I hope our farewell...

973
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:02,133
will be somewhat different...

974
01:04:04,244 --> 01:04:05,543
than others.

975
01:04:57,364 --> 01:05:00,494
Now, We Are Breaking Up

976
01:05:01,094 --> 01:05:04,034
Should we go to Paris?

977
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:07,333
Should we go to a place...

978
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:14,273
where it's just the two of us?

979
01:05:14,673 --> 01:05:15,812
Are you going back to Paris?

980
01:05:15,813 --> 01:05:17,843
He asked me to go to Paris with him.

981
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:19,683
Should I just go?

982
01:05:19,684 --> 01:05:22,382
Young Eun, your mom and I are going to court. Keep that in mind.

983
01:05:22,383 --> 01:05:24,123
Did Mom kick you out?

984
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:26,393
Good going.

985
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,393
What kind of man cooks in the kitchen?

986
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:29,692
What are you guys doing?

987
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:31,292
We need to find a way to survive.

988
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:33,763
Ms. Ha, feel free to do whatever you want.

989
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:36,062
- The investment's been finalized. - We're getting an investment?

990
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:37,063
I noticed you signed the paper.

991
01:05:37,064 --> 01:05:39,232
I'll take responsibility for everything.

992
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:40,233
You weighed all the pros and cons, right?

993
01:05:40,234 --> 01:05:41,373
Stop!

994
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,374
Ms. Jeon.

995
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,343
We want you to be a model for Sono's fashion show.

996
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:47,244
Soo Ho, you're going to be in charge of the show, right?

997
01:05:47,374 --> 01:05:51,414
I love you so much.

998
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,812
I can't help but resent Young Eun.

999
01:05:53,813 --> 01:05:57,082
This is going to be the last time I talk to you about Young Eun.

1000
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:59,554
- Jae Guk. - Just give me one month.

1001
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:02,394
Let me love her all I want.

1002
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:12,495
Now, We Are Breaking Up
