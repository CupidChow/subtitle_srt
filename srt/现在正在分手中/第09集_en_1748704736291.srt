1
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:17,881
Nothing is forever.

2
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:20,921
And we can't really control anything.

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,891
The only thing we can do is...

4
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:26,790
be in the moment and only think about today...

5
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,260
as we try to live and love to the fullest.

6
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:46,511
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ha Young Eun.

7
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:57,451
I don't know what others would say about Jae Guk.

8
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:00,220
But he is my son, and I truly care for him.

9
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,330
He's been hiding away all his life because of his parents' fault.

10
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:10,171
And now, if people find out about the woman he loves,

11
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,300
he'll have to live like that for the rest of his life.

12
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,481
As his mother, I can't just sit back and let that happen.

13
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,410
That's why I wanted to meet you.

14
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,520
What are your feelings for Jae Guk?

15
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,121
Ms. Ha Young Eun.

16
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,900
What are your feelings for him?

17
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,231
I love him.

18
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,340
Although he's not my biological son,

19
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,770
he and Soo Wan are brothers.

20
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:54,381
That will not change the way I feel about him.

21
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:56,511
I've already confirmed it.

22
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,180
I see.

23
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:03,050
Then persuade me.

24
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,791
How sure are you about this?

25
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,821
How sincere are your feelings for him?

26
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,161
If you can convince me,

27
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:13,960
then I'll approve of your relationship.

28
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,174
"It's sad that we even have to talk about diversity and difference..."

29
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,111
"because it should be normal." By Olivier Rousteing

30
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:33,120
Now, We Are Breaking Up

31
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:35,024
Episode 9

32
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:36,994
Don't save them for Ji Min.

33
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,520
You should eat them, okay?

34
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:43,560
Anyway, it sounds like you managed to get over the first hurdle.

35
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,505
It went better than expected.

36
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:49,635
But now, how can I make her believe that I am indeed serious about him?

37
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,975
It's the beginning of another hurdle.

38
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,704
If the two of you are happy, that's all that matters.

39
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:55,370
What else would you have to do to convince her?

40
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,941
Right?

41
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,885
I can't believe I'm smiling in front of you.

42
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:05,855
Hey, please smile so that I can smile with you.

43
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,654
"How are you feeling? Are you feeling any better?"

44
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,654
That's what I hear all the time these days, which is pointless.

45
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,625
I much prefer this. It's so much more interesting.

46
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,721
It's nice to see you happy and hear all about it.

47
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,830
By the way, what's that?

48
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,475
Hey, I keep losing weight.

49
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,400
I have nothing to wear.

50
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,904
I want to start getting rid of my stuff.

51
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,644
Do you really have to upset me like this?

52
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,015
Stop nagging me.

53
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,545
Every time my husband sees me,

54
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,385
he says I should be hospitalized and get chemotherapy.

55
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,744
I'm sick of hearing it.

56
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:37,381
Get chemotherapy. You should be hospitalized.

57
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:40,020
Expecting and hoping to get better...

58
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:43,221
It'd be so devastating if my condition didn't improve.

59
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:45,394
I'll be irritable because of the pain.

60
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,820
I'll yell at all of you and demand that you put up with me.

61
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,331
I don't want to waste my precious time like that.

62
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:55,331
- Mi Sook. - I want to end things well.

63
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,271
That's why I want to live today to the fullest.

64
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:03,211
To the very last day of my life.

65
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:05,771
I want to do everything that I can do...

66
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:07,211
so that I can part...

67
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,281
with all of you and leave with no regrets.

68
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,450
I should throw this out before Ji Min comes home.

69
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:18,854
She's only seven, but she's very mature.

70
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,161
Sometimes, I don't even know how to answer her questions.

71
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,091
I'll take it.

72
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,365
It gets chilly in mornings and evenings.

73
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't catch a cold.

74
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,750
Clothing Drop Box

75
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,521
You know why your friend feels that way.

76
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,961
But I can't let her go like this, without even trying.

77
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:01,161
There are so many things I never got to do for Mi Sook.

78
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,971
Like she said,

79
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:06,640
just take one day at a time...

80
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,711
and do everything you can do for her.

81
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:12,411
What about your mother?

82
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:15,711
Has she said anything to you since she met me?

83
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,414
No, nothing yet.

84
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,550
I don't really know what we can do to show her...

85
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,021
that we're both serious about this and convince her,

86
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,820
but let's just keep doing what we've been doing.

87
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,221
We'll just do what we can do.

88
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,300
Oh, I'm here. I'll talk to you later.

89
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,651
If it's for your girlfriend, you should go for this.

90
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:01,894
Pink roses mean "happy love."

91
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,461
Please make a nice arrangement.

92
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:05,231
No problem.

93
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:10,175
I told you I'd buy you a new outfit.

94
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:11,675
It's for Dad's retirement ceremony.

95
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,401
I want to divorce your dad.

96
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,740
Will this make you look old?

97
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,044
Leave it!

98
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,854
I'll just wear whatever I can grab in the morning.

99
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:24,485
You need to think about Dad.

100
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:27,281
Everyone will want to say hello to the vice-principal's wife.

101
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,154
For nearly 40 years, I woke up at 6am every morning...

102
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,954
to make breakfast for him...

103
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:33,591
and make sure he could get to work on time.

104
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:35,721
What more must I do for your father?

105
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,794
I'm retiring too.

106
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,635
So I'll wear whatever I want. What's wrong with that?

107
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,435
Then why did you call me here?

108
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,305
- You said it was urgent. - It is urgent.

109
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:46,841
- Come sit down here. - Oh, boy.

110
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,515
I want you to get married before I divorce your father.

111
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:52,841
Are you threatening me now?

112
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,885
I want to be free and enjoy my life too.

113
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:58,214
In just two days, I'll be done having to look after your father.

114
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:01,921
But because of you, I'm still tied down here.

115
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:04,990
How much longer do I have to put up with this?

116
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:07,765
- I'm seeing someone. - Exactly.

117
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,690
What? What did you say?

118
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:11,760
I am seeing someone now.

119
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,175
My gosh, who? Who is he? What does he do?

120
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,635
How old is he?

121
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,974
When can I meet him?

122
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:22,471
- You brat! - My gosh.

123
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,711
What are these flowers for?

124
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:28,841
To win some brownie points with you.

125
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,151
I heard you met Young Eun.

126
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,950
Did she tell you to do this?

127
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:40,190
No, this was my idea.

128
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,695
You must be hungry. What do you feel like eating?

129
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,901
Spicy noodles. I came here because I was craving it.

130
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,671
All right. Give me a few minutes.

131
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:11,625
Is 66 the largest size?

132
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:12,995
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:16,191
But it's oversized, so it'll fit you if you normally wear 66.5.

134
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:17,765
I couldn't even zip it up.

135
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:20,231
Excuse me. Can I go a half size up?

136
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,770
I'm sorry. It doesn't come in half sizes.

137
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,941
Are you really not going to make more sizes?

138
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,975
You know it's not that simple.

139
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,674
Hills wants me to quit Sono...

140
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,215
and join an imported brand they're launching soon.

141
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:36,485
So? Have you given them your answer yet?

142
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:38,111
You see, I run my own business.

143
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,824
When you sell domestic brands, it's not easy to deal...

144
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,591
with slow-moving inventory and pay your staff every month.

145
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,420
I have to say, La Fayere is my only hope now.

146
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,434
It's not just me.

147
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:53,231
They contacted all the managers who are famous in the industry.

148
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,265
It's all about diversity these days.

149
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,274
So why is it that clothes still only come in S, M, and L?

150
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,845
I strongly suggest that we make more sizes.

151
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:01,975
That's not enough. I need an answer.

152
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,515
The sales department always pressures us, saying the company...

153
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:06,615
doesn't break even until 60 percent of the merchandise is sold,

154
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:08,880
but you need to help us sell more. Don't you agree?

155
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,780
Yes, I understand.

156
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,654
She wants to make hay while the sun shines.

157
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,595
I bet she's getting many customers because of La Fayere.

158
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,154
Can you finish the report before the meeting?

159
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:20,125
Head Manager Koh will yell at you again.

160
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,361
Yes, probably.

161
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,301
Yes, I'll be back soon. Have it ready by then.

162
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:55,490
Suggestions From Shop Managers

163
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:59,461
Our clothes come in 44, 55, and 66. We also have the free size.

164
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,335
Why do we need more sizes?

165
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:05,471
On home shopping channels, 77 and 88 often sell out first,

166
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,304
which means there is demand.

167
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,674
It's easier said than done.

168
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,115
We'd have to draft new patterns...

169
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,515
and find a different factory.

170
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,910
It all costs money.

171
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:18,385
In the US, women's clothing sizes range from 2 to 12.

172
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,085
For women's bottoms, customers also have the option...

173
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,585
to choose from three different lengths.

174
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:24,194
Because clothes come in many different sizes,

175
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,524
customers can pick the size that fits them the best.

176
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,824
The US has a racially and ethnically diverse population.

177
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,861
Why don't you visit every customer and take their measurements, then?

178
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,934
Where's the report I asked for? This is completely irrelevant.

179
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,404
Just do your job!

180
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,971
Making clothes that satisfy our customers' needs...

181
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,941
is part of my job.

182
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,345
- Ms. Ha. - We lose customers...

183
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,341
when a competent shop manager quits.

184
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,311
Please consider it positively, Mr. Koh.

185
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:58,821
Gosh, she and I never see eye to eye.

186
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,990
I've managed to get past one hurdle.

187
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:04,691
Hey, Young Eun!

188
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,331
Another obstacle is coming my way.

189
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,731
Director Hwang Chi Sook

190
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,875
Hasn't my dad told you anything yet?

191
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:15,101
Did you get yourself in trouble?

192
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,975
Why? What happened?

193
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,311
- Who is it this time? - I didn't cause any trouble.

194
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,740
Hey, Mr. Seok likes me.

195
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,111
What's with that face?

196
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,081
- I'm offended. - Since when?

197
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,551
Do you like him too?

198
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:35,390
Come on. I don't like him. You know he's not my type.

199
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,831
But how does your father know about it?

200
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:42,301
Well, some stuff happened.

201
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,931
So you did cause trouble, after all.

202
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,074
With the CEO of our PR agency.

203
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,245
Hey.

204
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:51,515
You think I'm always that predictable, don't you?

205
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:54,540
But there's this part of me that you don't know about.

206
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,510
Where are you going all of a sudden?

207
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,351
I need to go report this to my dad.

208
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,451
When I'm back, I'll tell you exactly what you can write in your report.

209
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:33,250
I know how dumb and reckless that is.

210
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,081
But the reason I still choose to do this...

211
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,324
is because my feelings for Jae Guk are sincere.

212
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:41,290
I'm glad to see myself so dumb and reckless again.

213
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:48,530
Why are you being so reckless? Why are you so dumb?

214
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:50,904
We'll never be happy together even if we do get married.

215
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,274
I thought I loved you,

216
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,801
but I've now realized it wasn't love.

217
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,845
I'm comfortable around you because I've known you for years.

218
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,441
We're like friends, like siblings.

219
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,981
We've been engaged for too long.

220
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,681
That's why you feel that way. It's understandable.

221
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,611
I'll try harder.

222
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,221
I still see you as a man.

223
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:11,390
And I love you.

224
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,660
My heart is with someone else.

225
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,591
I can't marry you out of a sense of responsibility.

226
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,135
That's just wrong.

227
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,500
It doesn't matter. I don't care!

228
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:25,530
So don't leave me.

229
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,140
Don't go, Soo Wan.

230
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,870
Young Eun

231
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:36,081
Young Eun

232
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,750
Soo Wan, you made the wrong choice.

233
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,020
It was that woman's fault.

234
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,971
I always read the ending credits.

235
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:35,101
Seeing all the names roll up on the screen...

236
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:39,211
is more touching than the actual movie sometimes.

237
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,410
It shows you that the movie you just watched...

238
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:48,150
is the outcome of so many people's time and hard work.

239
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,591
I get so bummed out when I miss post-credit scenes.

240
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,431
This music is nice.

241
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,591
What shall we eat?

242
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:32,290
- Korean food? - No.

243
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:36,000
- I want... - Oh, are you Jae Guk?

244
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,270
Soo Wan's brother, Yoon Jae Guk, right?

245
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,201
Hey.

246
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,711
Hey, how long has it been?

247
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,981
Honey, don't you remember Soo Wan? He is Soo Wan's little brother.

248
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,581
I see.

249
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,951
This is my wife.

250
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:54,051
Hello.

251
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,691
The clinic is so busy these days,

252
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,324
but it's my daughter's birthday,

253
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,920
and she wanted to watch an animation movie.

254
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:02,365
Wasn't it his death anniversary a little while ago?

255
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,731
Is that why you're back?

256
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:05,931
Yes.

257
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,701
Life's been so busy that I keep forgetting.

258
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:10,304
That's okay.

259
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:13,240
You're starting to look so much like Soo Wan now that you're older.

260
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,740
You two sure are brothers.

261
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:18,841
Who is she?

262
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,410
This is my girlfriend.

263
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:26,981
Hello. I'm his brother Soo Wan's friend.

264
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,380
Hello, I'm Ha Young Eun.

265
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,430
Goodbye.

266
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,670
That hit me hard.

267
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,140
The moment I heard Soo Wan's name,

268
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,440
I felt as if my knees were about to give out.

269
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,511
You did?

270
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,851
And I feel like half of my fighting spirit has vanished.

271
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,751
The other half is still there.

272
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:08,761
One hurdle after another. Why does it have to be this way?

273
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:17,170
Let's overcome one more hurdle while we're at it.

274
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,101
I want to...

275
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,470
meet your mother too.

276
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,420
What did you just say?

277
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:38,120
Help me out, just until the project in Paris is done.

278
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,794
Then what? Just say goodbye and go our own ways?

279
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,091
Yes, and be cool with it.

280
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,561
This is too cruel.

281
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:47,064
You already rejected me once.

282
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,430
You'll break up with me again when our relationship contract expires?

283
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,771
You also have to go to Paris without getting caught, right?

284
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,574
What if my dad finds out?

285
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,814
He hates liars more than anything.

286
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:59,741
Well, it's not like I intended for it to happen.

287
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,680
Why is it my responsibility too?

288
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:04,781
Paris. Then Milan, London, and even New York.

289
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:06,851
Don't you want to see how far you can go?

290
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,960
In any case, you're saying we're going to date, right?

291
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,364
We'll sign a short-term contract.

292
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,991
All for show, for the sake of business.

293
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:19,660
So how are we going to do this?

294
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:23,400
First and foremost, you should be seen often at my work.

295
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,134
How close do you want us to look?

296
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:28,301
Let's make people think that we're both passionately in love.

297
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:32,811
And a little bit of physical touch will be needed at times.

298
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,940
Define physical touch.

299
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:38,910
We should be okay with a light kiss here and there.

300
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,581
Sure, we've already done it anyway.

301
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:45,120
Then I'll take that as a yes.

302
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:48,960
Let's be a good team until our contract expires.

303
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,230
Sure, let's do it.

304
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:57,534
Do not get caught.

305
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,930
My dad hates being lied to.

306
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,281
Yes, come in!

307
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,380
Hi, Soo Ho.

308
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,251
- I'll be off then. Bye. - Bye.

309
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,160
Letter of Resignation

310
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:30,331
- What is this? - I'm handing in my resignation.

311
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,341
Why, all of a sudden...

312
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,111
I'm sorry to spring this on you.

313
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,480
I organized all the info on everything I've been working on.

314
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,455
I'll make sure the projects aren't affected...

315
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:48,650
Did you get an offer from another company? What did they offer you?

316
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:52,794
You should've talked to me first if you'd needed something.

317
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:54,794
We started this company with just five employees...

318
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:58,690
and worked so hard to grow it. Now, you're leaving like this?

319
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,361
My wife...

320
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,801
is ill.

321
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:12,741
What are you talking about, Soo Ho?

322
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:14,311
Mi Sook is ill?

323
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,311
- What's wrong with her? - Mr. Kwak.

324
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:40,741
What's up? What now?

325
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,301
What is it?

326
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:46,841
Are things not going well between you and Mr. Seok?

327
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:49,980
- Why didn't you tell me? - What are you talking about?

328
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,051
Mi Sook.

329
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,291
I heard she's ill.

330
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:01,791
You guys are so mean.

331
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,630
You two always do this.

332
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:07,561
The two of you always exclude me like this.

333
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,730
Why didn't you tell me?

334
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,870
I had no idea.

335
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,741
You horrible brats.

336
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,985
I don't want Mi Sook to be ill.

337
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:24,611
Why is she ill? Why does it have to be her?

338
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,660
What are you doing?

339
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:41,064
Where were you? Why didn't you pick up?

340
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:43,230
I stopped by my mom's place to pick up some side dishes,

341
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,774
then went to Ji Min's kindergarten...

342
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,940
and her piano academy, so I didn't hear my phone ring.

343
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:51,271
Anyway, why are you here? Shouldn't you be at work now?

344
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,915
And what is all this?

345
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,111
We're only going to eat brown rice from now on.

346
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:56,814
Oh, no.

347
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,751
Did you leave work early to do this?

348
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:01,551
Did you not go to work today?

349
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:03,420
I quit.

350
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:06,895
What?

351
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,591
Please don't worry.

352
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,190
We won't touch his desk...

353
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:15,205
because this is where Mr. Kwak belongs.

354
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:17,834
I'm not sure how long it'll take for him to come back,

355
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:20,501
but we'll leave his desk untouched until he returns.

356
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:22,440
All right, get back to work.

357
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:27,910
Have you lost your mind?

358
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:30,710
- Do you want all of us to die? - You need to be hospitalized.

359
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:34,185
I refuse to say goodbye to you like this.

360
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,985
- Honey. - I won't let you suffer in pain...

361
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,554
and collapse alone again.

362
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:39,150
Kwak Soo Ho!

363
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,390
I'm sorry, Mi Sook.

364
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,700
What are you doing?

365
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,960
I was a scumbag.

366
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,200
Soo Ho!

367
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,601
When I heard you were dying,

368
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,111
the first thought I had was,

369
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,081
"How am I to manage now?"

370
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:04,680
Then I got worried about Ji Min.

371
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,185
The last thought I had...

372
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,821
was how you would get through this.

373
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,261
I'm such a scumbag.

374
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,130
I only care about myself.

375
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,101
I'm so selfish.

376
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,900
Don't do that.

377
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,180
What should I do about you?

378
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:41,880
How will you manage from now on?

379
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,591
Are you done crying?

380
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:50,930
Have some water.

381
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,274
You evil brat.

382
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:00,771
You said that enough.

383
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:03,710
I don't have the energy to put up with much more.

384
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:07,544
I will find the best doctor in that field.

385
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:10,955
I'll get her a VIP hospital suite and call all my connections.

386
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:13,851
You do whatever it takes to bring her, okay?

387
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,624
- Chi Sook. - Don't leave me out again,

388
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,920
or I'll just...

389
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:22,091
Make sure to bring Mi Sook to the hospital.

390
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,370
Ms. Seo?

391
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,380
I'd like you to take over Sono and La Fayere's pop-up stores.

392
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:44,485
- Me? - You've been working with Mr. Kwak.

393
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:46,155
You know how things work, right?

394
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:47,251
Pardon?

395
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,755
Well, yes.

396
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,755
We can't ignore the call-to-action effect,

397
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,665
so keep monitoring the show windows on the first floor.

398
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,665
Before the artwork concept meeting,

399
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,965
have all the plans and designs prepared.

400
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:59,130
Okay.

401
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,001
Also, one more thing.

402
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,634
Check Cookie's schedule too.

403
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:05,801
I will.

404
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:20,751
Give me a call, Mr. Kwak.

405
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,120
What's all this about you resigning?

406
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,091
How can you do this to me?

407
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,291
What's going on? Have I done anything wrong?

408
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,301
My gosh...

409
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,970
You brought dessert today?

410
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:43,811
I waited for a long time to get it, so I hope you enjoy it.

411
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:46,274
Was this her idea too?

412
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:49,541
It wasn't her idea, but she did wait with me.

413
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,551
Excuse me.

414
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:57,390
Hi, Young Eun.

415
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:02,521
Yes.

416
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,261
Okay.

417
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:05,831
I'd like that.

418
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:07,630
Sure.

419
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:09,900
Bye.

420
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,841
What did you say you'd like?

421
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,241
Tomorrow,

422
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,440
I'll meet Young Eun's parents.

423
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,890
It's over.

424
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:11,791
It's the beginning.

425
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,001
Just so I could afford white rice,

426
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:23,374
I spent...

427
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,344
all my youth...

428
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,341
inhaling chalk dust.

429
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:31,314
For the rest of my life, I'll enjoy my pension and have fun.

430
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:34,120
They say that these days, middle-age begins at 60.

431
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:38,321
Medicine is so advanced, you could even live to be 200.

432
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:39,950
Eat a lot in advance.

433
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:52,501
I could never even catch a cold freely.

434
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,001
I worked so hard and diligently.

435
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:58,241
Only for my family.

436
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:09,150
Why did you eat that?

437
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:12,251
Every morning, I cooked rice and soup for you,

438
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:15,364
and I ironed your shirts, so I'm patting myself on the back.

439
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:16,995
Still, that's mine.

440
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,665
Does the food have your name on it?

441
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,061
Who said this was yours?

442
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,405
I must eat well...

443
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:24,700
to get the energy to move around.

444
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:25,935
To do what?

445
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:29,801
As of today, you have retired from my life.

446
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,470
I'll work on marrying Young Eun off.

447
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,284
This is so delicious.

448
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:44,091
So this is what it tastes like.

449
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:51,390
Thank you for attending Sambong Middle School's...

450
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:53,630
honorary retirement ceremony.

451
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:57,334
The chair of the alumni association will give a speech.

452
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,230
Thank you for your service.

453
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,700
Dear teachers.

454
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:06,675
Thank you for teaching us with warmth and love...

455
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,344
for many years.

456
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:12,255
The alumni association wishes the retiring teachers...

457
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:15,281
all the best on their new beginnings.

458
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:23,460
Vice-principal Ha Taek Soo will give his retirement speech.

459
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,130
When can I meet the guy?

460
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:34,804
It's Dad's retirement ceremony. Let's focus on him for now.

461
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:37,205
Rather than what I did well,

462
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:41,680
my mistakes and regrets remain clear in my mind.

463
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:45,955
Now I will end the time I spent in a classroom.

464
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:48,980
The second chapter of my life,

465
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:53,495
I will spend with the person who is my lifelong partner.

466
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:55,225
I'd like to start anew.

467
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,195
He wants to start anew with you.

468
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,331
What?

469
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:01,735
Why would he not discuss something that important with me...

470
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:03,561
and just make up his mind?

471
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:08,370
Is it just a new chapter for him?

472
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:10,841
I have my own life.

473
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,140
- Mr. Ha. - Hey.

474
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:16,745
- Thanks for teaching us. - Gosh, thank you.

475
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:18,811
- Thank you, Mr. Ha. - Thank you.

476
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:21,281
- Don't be late for class. - Okay.

477
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:25,521
Wouldn't it be nice if we had a son-in-law here too?

478
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,821
It's always just us three.

479
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:29,991
Over here.

480
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:37,930
Don't tell Mom.

481
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,475
Hello.

482
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:42,940
Meet my parents.

483
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,380
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Jae Guk.

484
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:52,311
Yes, hello. It's nice to meet you.

485
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,660
Madam Min's son?

486
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:04,021
Why is he here?

487
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,501
He's the man I'm seeing, Mom.

488
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,660
What?

489
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,470
But...

490
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,311
Ms. Min.

491
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:23,011
Jae Guk and her both are adamant.

492
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:24,781
Soo Wan died.

493
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:27,455
If she hadn't called him that night,

494
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,551
I wouldn't have lost my fiance,

495
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:31,551
and you'd still have two sons.

496
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:35,361
And you still want to accept her?

497
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:37,324
As Jae Guk's girlfriend?

498
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:39,594
I can't lose my other son too.

499
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:41,501
Now all I have left...

500
00:31:42,506 --> 00:31:43,804
is just Jae Guk.

501
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:45,975
- Ms. Min. - Even in my dreams,

502
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:48,541
I never forgot Soo Wan.

503
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,870
Because...

504
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,511
I'm a mom,

505
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:58,081
which is why, Yoo Jung,

506
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:01,420
eventually,

507
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:05,991
those two will break up.

508
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:21,271
One, two.

509
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:23,205
Nice.

510
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,044
We are four at last.

511
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,440
Perfect.

512
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:28,584
I'll take your family photo.

513
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:30,511
Oh, sure.

514
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:34,180
Wait.

515
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:38,091
You should be in the photo. Come on.

516
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:40,554
- Excuse me. - Yes?

517
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:43,690
- Could you take our photo? - Sure.

518
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:46,361
Honey.

519
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:48,200
Stand here.

520
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,771
- Stand close to him. - Are you ready?

521
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:04,894
Sit down here.

522
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:11,134
How deep is the relationship?

523
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,579
If you introduced him to us,

524
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,975
that means you're considering marriage, doesn't it?

525
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,414
Oh, my gosh.

526
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,419
I don't believe this is happening.

527
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,354
I'm all for this union. I like it, no questions asked.

528
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,425
Mom.

529
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,164
Remember only what you saw today.

530
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,834
Think only of that.

531
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,869
Please.

532
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,805
Can't I think about anything else?

533
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,305
Like what?

534
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,104
What?

535
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,474
What did you just say?

536
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,045
Who?

537
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,115
Yoon Soo Wan.

538
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,485
He's my older brother.

539
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,269
That was ten years ago and we only dated for two months.

540
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,499
Shut your mouth.

541
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,264
No one decides...

542
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,295
who we can like and who we can't.

543
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,965
They are brothers.

544
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:17,838
Do you think this is normal?

545
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,805
What is normal and what is strange?

546
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,945
Who decides that?

547
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,874
- Young Eun. - Mom.

548
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,715
The world is full of all kinds of people.

549
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:32,019
They all look different, think differently, live differently.

550
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,584
There is no correct answer.

551
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,425
Who says what is right?

552
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:37,784
The road that most people take is right.

553
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,025
Because it's wide and smooth.

554
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,994
It's right to take that road.

555
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,195
The world changes and so does how people think.

556
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,164
Things that made no sense in your time makes sense now.

557
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:53,005
You're truly and utterly possessed.

558
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,275
Why did I live?

559
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,715
What did I live for?

560
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,764
You should've kept it a secret.

561
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,465
We didn't want to lie to our parents too.

562
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:23,405
Is it okay if you're okay with it?

563
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:26,874
Do you live on your own? You said you're from Paris.

564
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:30,849
You have a place to return to whenever you want.

565
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,275
If you leave, what about my daughter Young Eun?

566
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,874
Go to work. That's what you can do for me.

567
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,084
I made you my wife, but did nothing for you.

568
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:18,499
Soo Ho. Can you at least help me relax?

569
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,825
If you're done eating, go and lie down.

570
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,724
I'll pick up Ji Min. Take a nap.

571
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,764
Chi Sook

572
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:34,845
It's just until today. Go to work tomorrow.

573
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,124
What?

574
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,394
I called a few hospitals.

575
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,898
You can get admitted right away.

576
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,505
Pack what you need, okay?

577
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,465
Don't you add to it.

578
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,039
I'm tired of repeating myself.

579
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,409
Jeon Mi Sook, you have no time for this.

580
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,575
- You must... - Bye.

581
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,914
My gosh.

582
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,925
Can't he at least hang things up?

583
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,224
I'm outside your place.

584
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:41,204
He should have this dry-cleaned right away.

585
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,284
Are you crazy? How dare you come here?

586
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,218
You left me on read.

587
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:53,514
Go home right now.

588
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,885
What should I do?

589
00:37:57,129 --> 00:37:58,695
Let's talk outside.

590
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:12,374
Ms. Seo?

591
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,005
- Hello. - Why did you come outside?

592
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,545
The cold air isn't good for you.

593
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,688
I'm still taking over his duties.

594
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:23,684
Mr. Seok sent me over.

595
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:27,218
Oh, I'm so sorry.

596
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:30,688
He'll get right back to work. You came here for nothing.

597
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,854
- It's fine. - Come in.

598
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,764
- Come inside and chat. - No.

599
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,465
We'll talk out here. It won't take long.

600
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:41,905
Come inside, Ms. Seo.

601
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,345
Come in.

602
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,845
Oh, dear.

603
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,675
Sit over here.

604
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,255
Honey.

605
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,155
- Sit down. - Okay.

606
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:12,235
Please sit, Ms. Seo.

607
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,834
Okay.

608
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:25,845
I'd have prepared something if you'd called ahead.

609
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:29,314
Mr. Kwak must've been busy. I couldn't reach him.

610
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:31,045
I dropped by on my way home.

611
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:34,885
I'm sorry my husband's causing such trouble.

612
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,084
It's fine.

613
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:40,025
- Drink it before it gets cold. - Thank you.

614
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,235
Why don't you go and rest?

615
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,449
Oh, silly me.

616
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,179
I talked too much when she's here to see you.

617
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,275
It's okay.

618
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,314
You can take your time.

619
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:03,945
- I'll go to the dry-cleaner's. - Okay.

620
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,365
Dry-cleaning

621
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,095
I expected Mom to react the way she did.

622
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,795
But it's harder than I thought to actually face it.

623
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,034
Still, you managed better than I thought.

624
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:01,534
I was worried you'd completely...

625
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,805
lose the will to fight.

626
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,514
It's close.

627
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,249
If someone says just one more thing,

628
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,954
I might lose power.

629
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:21,624
That won't do. I must recharge you.

630
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:39,644
I love you.

631
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:44,715
Okay.

632
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:22,155
Report on Human Measurements

633
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:27,795
Sizes 55 and 66 were defined in 1981.

634
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:31,468
Back then, the average height of Korean women was 155cm,

635
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:33,334
and the bust girth was 85cm.

636
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,764
Size 55 was named after the last digit of both measurements.

637
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,608
Was I being pessimistic because...

638
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:41,679
I didn't fit the measurements from 40 years ago?

639
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,608
Last year, the average height of Korean women in her 20s...

640
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:46,119
is 6cm taller than the old statistic.

641
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,244
It is a bit harsh to stick to a 40-year-old system.

642
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,519
They buy what fits their hips and reduce the waist.

643
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,755
Coats that fit their shoulders need longer sleeves.

644
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,128
It's wrong to take that for granted.

645
00:42:57,129 --> 00:42:58,994
Women come in more shapes and sizes.

646
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,764
We should make more varied sizes.

647
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,369
Shall I type up a report on the system's problem...

648
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,965
- and need for more sizes? - Yes.

649
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,465
Why are you alone? Where's Chi Hyung?

650
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:11,934
He left the office for business.

651
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:17,644
I'm exhausted. A full-time job isn't my style.

652
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,718
Why are you exhausted when you return empty-handed?

653
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,655
Listen. You don't have to be at your desk to get work done.

654
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:28,488
I just had lunch with Hye Rin.

655
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:31,354
I told you to help So Young because our samples come in today.

656
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:35,295
All this happened because I tried to help her.

657
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,999
If you had truly known the extent of my sacrifice,

658
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,834
you would reevaluate...

659
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,064
my royalty and affection for my company and colleagues.

660
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,579
I think we're missing one. I'll check and pick it up.

661
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,675
Okay.

662
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,874
Go on.

663
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,175
Me?

664
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:01,784
Give me that. I'll get it.

665
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,425
No. I'll get it.

666
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,564
I said I'll get it.

667
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,738
I won't complain you treat work as a hobby,

668
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:14,894
but I'd like you to not use me as an excuse.

669
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:18,064
Your life is easy and simple because you'll get promoted in time.

670
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:21,179
Using me who is hard working as an excuse is displeasing.

671
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,244
- Listen. - I carried all the boxes.

672
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,275
Isn't it embarrassing to freeload off other people's work?

673
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:48,199
Different pant lengths for each waist size,

674
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,108
and different sleeve lengths for each shoulder size?

675
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,235
I didn't know Sono was such a considerate brand.

676
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,209
If we change sizes and make new patterns,

677
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,575
we must order 100 samples to get people trained.

678
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,648
Until we get just one blouse right,

679
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,718
we draw, revise, and fix it hundreds and thousands of times.

680
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,389
We check the quality and then change it again.

681
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,188
We'll need at least three factories to handle this.

682
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:10,389
What about the other brands in the meantime?

683
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,559
What if we do that and end up with dead stock?

684
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,854
Will you buy them all?

685
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:18,499
How much longer must we make things in a 40-year-old size?

686
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,099
People have different shapes and they want different clothes.

687
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,465
And despite that, they managed to fit into what we sold just fine.

688
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,534
Why should we fit our bodies to the clothes?

689
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,079
It should be the other way round.

690
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,305
Will you always try to beat me?

691
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,979
Shall I submit this to the director...

692
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,575
or directly to the president?

693
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,454
Darn it.

694
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:42,385
Darn you.

695
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,295
Give me one minute to think.

696
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:52,664
She's back.

697
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,704
How did it go?

698
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,945
Request for Approval, Head Manager: Koh Kwang Soo

699
00:46:06,149 --> 00:46:08,314
- Nice! - Nice!

700
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,715
It worked.

701
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:14,559
Let's stay busy.

702
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,985
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

703
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,485
Let's do this.

704
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,454
Here.

705
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,095
Are you here to ask me to accept her again?

706
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:26,795
That'd be nice.

707
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:29,905
But I really just wanted to eat with you.

708
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,775
Let's eat before the food gets cold.

709
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:36,905
By the way,

710
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,715
I'm going to start something new.

711
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:44,545
Like what?

712
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:48,514
I want to take photos of people, not clothes.

713
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,784
You should be in the photo.

714
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,525
Come on.

715
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,829
I always felt like an outsider.

716
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,834
Stand close to him.

717
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:02,704
I never felt like I belonged anywhere.

718
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,735
I never felt comfortable enough.

719
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,084
The interaction, intimacy, and irritation.

720
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:20,514
It was nice. I found myself wanting more.

721
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:27,128
In order to take photos of people, you need to know about them.

722
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:28,898
You need to know their character and the stuff they like...

723
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:30,965
in order to portray them properly.

724
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,164
By any chance,

725
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,064
do you guys also plan to get married?

726
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:39,505
If that's what she wants.

727
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,945
Why don't you invite her over to my house?

728
00:47:54,419 --> 00:47:57,025
I want to cook a meal for her.

729
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,894
Mom.

730
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,825
Bring her over.

731
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,985
What is all this?

732
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:27,115
Do you miss our days as students back in Paris?

733
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:30,229
I had to do your homework as well as mine,

734
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,095
and I'm using the skills I learned back then to do something now.

735
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,398
It's going to take too long for me to do this on my own.

736
00:48:34,399 --> 00:48:35,994
I need you to be my assistant.

737
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,539
I'm already sad and upset because of Mi Sook.

738
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,934
I don't want to be your assistant only to get annoyed as well.

739
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:43,805
I don't know what you're doing,

740
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,374
but I'll leave you to it.

741
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,075
They're Mi Sook's clothes.

742
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,019
The clothes she bought even though they were too pricey.

743
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,814
The clothes she bought because she was excited.

744
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,045
The outfits she wore to the events at her daughter's kindergarten.

745
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:01,454
The stuff she wore to look nice on her wedding anniversary.

746
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,525
They're all part of Mi Sook's past.

747
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,025
So I couldn't just throw them away.

748
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,894
If they're too big for her, we can just reduce the size.

749
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:14,635
If they get bigger, we'll reduce them again.

750
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:18,735
What do you want me to do?

751
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:23,809
We need to reduce the length, so cut the hems.

752
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,514
I'm great with scissors.

753
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,144
- Do I start from here? - Yes.

754
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:46,595
How do I look? Do I look okay?

755
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,104
I knew it. Whoever altered your clothes must be talented.

756
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,338
Tell her she wouldn't have made it without her assistant's help.

757
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:56,378
Listen. I used to be a rising star in the modeling industry,

758
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:57,709
although it was short-lived.

759
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,648
Anyway, just know that my slim body...

760
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:03,688
is what completes your design. Do you agree with that?

761
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:05,615
- I agree. - Wholeheartedly.

762
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:07,358
This is beautiful.

763
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,929
When did you wear that outfit?

764
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,059
When we went to take photos for Ji Min's first birthday.

765
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,258
- Oh, it's that dress? - Try this on too.

766
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:15,628
You need this to complete your look.

767
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:17,695
Didn't this used to be long? I bought this.

768
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,369
- This used to be my long coat? - Yes, I cut it.

769
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,139
- She's taking all the credit again. - She can't help it.

770
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,508
I did all the cutting.

771
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:27,278
You guys are so good.

772
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:28,679
It makes you look like you have long legs. It's nice.

773
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,278
I've always wanted to buy something like this.

774
00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:32,218
I've seen a lot of people wear these kinds of jackets.

775
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:33,575
Cropped jackets, right?

776
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,885
Maybe I should receive treatment.

777
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:44,989
Mi Sook.

778
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,095
Mi Sook.

779
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,425
I only thought about throwing things away.

780
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,425
I didn't know there could be another way.

781
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,834
In order to say goodbye with no regrets,

782
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,064
I should live my life to the fullest.

783
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:59,008
I want to do everything I can...

784
00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:02,104
so I can pat myself on the back and say I did my best,

785
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,144
instead of having any regrets.

786
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,885
Thank you, Mi Sook. Thank you.

787
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,588
You'll be staying in a VIP room.

788
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:12,854
Great. I'll use this chance to spend some of your money.

789
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:17,329
This outfit makes me want to do a catwalk.

790
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,224
- Do you want to see it? - Yes, show us how it's done.

791
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:22,494
Here's my supermodel walk.

792
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:25,599
You've still got it.

793
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,909
- I've still got it. - You really do.

794
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,438
- Is this how they pose these days? - What is that?

795
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:33,479
I'm glad I lost weight.

796
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,505
- The clothes look better on me. - My gosh.

797
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,814
Knowing how to say goodbye is another form of love.

798
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,914
I've known her ever since I was 18. It's been 20 years.

799
00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:48,385
I've known her half my life.

800
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,354
"Okay."

801
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,025
"Goodbye."

802
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,025
How am I supposed to do that?

803
00:51:57,569 --> 00:51:59,164
Saying goodbye...

804
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:01,934
doesn't always need to be sad and heartbreaking.

805
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:05,675
That's a big stereotype, you know.

806
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,874
Let her leave at ease.

807
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:12,175
That's another form of love.

808
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:22,985
Love comes in many different forms.

809
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:28,195
Is it okay if I lean on your shoulder?

810
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,564
Why do you even bother to ask?

811
00:52:31,669 --> 00:52:33,865
You can always lean on me.

812
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:35,735
You're always welcome to.

813
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,115
Hello.

814
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:29,925
Nice to meet you.

815
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:34,255
I'm here to meet Director Hwang Chi Sook.

816
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,513
- Are you going to drink coffee? - Yes.

817
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:39,149
I'm here to meet Director Hwang Chi Sook.

818
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,035
Hello, sir.

819
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,635
The thing is, I came here for business...

820
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,575
Do you like flowers, sir?

821
00:53:57,049 --> 00:53:58,314
Follow me.

822
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,715
Seok Do Hoon

823
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,354
You were born in 1982, the Year of the Dog.

824
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,588
Is this correct?

825
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:11,454
I know I look young for my age, but yes, that's correct.

826
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,329
When did you start your company?

827
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,330
Right.

828
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:17,139
Vision PR was established 8 years ago with only 5 employees.

829
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,468
Now, we have over 400 employees,

830
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:21,338
and as the center of Korea's fashion industry,

831
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:24,035
we're in charge of doing launching shows for top-tier brands.

832
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,758
Do you know that Chi Sook always got rejected...

833
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:40,055
after wasting her time liking guys one-sidedly?

834
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,525
Is that so?

835
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:44,095
She always fell for guys who looked like models.

836
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,595
So I'm surprised that she chose to go out with you.

837
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,398
I'm quite charming once you get to know me.

838
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:51,695
About the accident...

839
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,604
Was it mutual or unilateral?

840
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:55,305
Oh, the accident?

841
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:00,278
I guess you could say...

842
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:02,374
it was both mutual and unilateral.

843
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:04,218
You guys are trying to fool me, aren't you?

844
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:05,718
We'll sign a short-term contract.

845
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,544
All for show, for the sake of business.

846
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,119
Do not get caught.

847
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,454
My dad hates being lied to.

848
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,854
Why can't you answer me?

849
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:19,494
I'm sorry, sir.

850
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:21,465
Are you not a good liar?

851
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:22,939
I'm sorry, sir.

852
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,334
Then tell me how sincere you are.

853
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:28,535
My feelings for her are 100 percent sincere.

854
00:55:29,379 --> 00:55:30,735
I even confessed my feelings.

855
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,405
But she rejected me.

856
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,914
Do you sincerely want to be in a relationship with my daughter?

857
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,218
I know this is a short-term contract,

858
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:41,514
but I don't mind if that means I can be with her.

859
00:55:48,029 --> 00:55:50,124
I want you to keep me updated.

860
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,099
- Pardon? - And listen.

861
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,429
If you want to date her, do something about your hair.

862
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,039
But this is my signature hairstyle.

863
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,369
You must not like her enough to do something about it.

864
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,409
Sir, please let me keep my hairstyle.

865
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,535
Listen to me.

866
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,474
My daughter only cares about looks.

867
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:07,905
What kind of hairstyle do you recommend?

868
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,858
Foreign brands put in orders for at least 1,000 yards.

869
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,655
Why would I sell the fabric in small amounts?

870
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,695
It's not like I'm going to get paid properly.

871
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:25,968
Domestic brands are always trying to get discounts.

872
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,898
We can't go beneath 1,000 yards.

873
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:30,434
We can't afford to keep a lot in stock.

874
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,965
So you're saying it's troublesome for both parties, right?

875
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,909
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

876
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,238
We'll just have to stick to how things were.

877
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,805
So what? How many yards of tweed do you need?

878
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:51,189
It'll take at least three months to create a new material.

879
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,729
What if it doesn't meet our expectations?

880
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,729
It's not like we can take full responsibility.

881
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,789
This won't work.

882
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,559
We have the technology to beat the Japanese and Italians.

883
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,028
It's frustrating that we can't make good use of it.

884
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:02,429
Arrange a meeting.

885
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,264
Maybe that will help us find the answer.

886
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:07,704
So Young, take Chi Hyung to the warehouse.

887
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,209
They're upset that no one's there to help.

888
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:11,374
Okay.

889
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:16,775
Young Eun, I'm very sensitive to dust and bad smells.

890
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:20,314
Wear a mask, then.

891
00:57:21,989 --> 00:57:23,555
Carry it properly, will you?

892
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,325
Here.

893
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,144
We're finally done.

894
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,244
Gosh, there's so much dust.

895
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:55,285
Let's have iced Americano so we can wash the dust down our throats.

896
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:57,655
I need to sort out the defects and send them back.

897
00:57:58,259 --> 00:57:59,624
What's that?

898
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:03,329
There are outfits that shrank in size after they got washed,

899
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,954
and some have washed out colors.

900
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:06,825
I need to sort them out and send them back.

901
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:08,794
Hey.

902
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,934
If you keep working so hard, your joints will start to hurt.

903
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:15,635
- Are you the new recruit from Sono? - Yes.

904
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,039
Once you're done with the sorting, help us cut out the loose threads.

905
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,334
The clothes are over there.

906
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,048
You want us to help?

907
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:24,044
I'll put in a good word to the head of design.

908
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,184
I can't do this anymore.

909
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,555
I'm going to leave before you start sorting out the defects.

910
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,255
Stop right there.

911
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,358
You need to do your part.

912
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:40,224
I'm not interested.

913
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:41,925
I'm done.

914
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:45,334
Do your part.

915
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,164
No.

916
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,505
You're here.

917
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,845
What about Jae Guk?

918
00:58:54,149 --> 00:58:56,519
He found a place on sale for his photo studio.

919
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,278
He said he'd come as soon as he checked the place.

920
00:58:58,279 --> 00:58:59,474
He's probably on his way.

921
00:59:00,149 --> 00:59:02,414
I see. Come inside.

922
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:05,615
I got you something. It's not too sweet.

923
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,555
Just put it on the table.

924
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:17,095
Would you like my help with anything?

925
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:19,465
First, wash your hands.

926
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,934
The bathroom is upstairs.

927
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,575
Okay.

928
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:23,294
It's impossible to just erase or forget about your child.

929
01:00:30,379 --> 01:00:31,474
He still lives in me...

930
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,005
just like he did ten years ago.

931
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,715
Jae Guk probably feels the same way.

932
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:45,115
Soo Wan will always be with him.

933
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:49,124
Soo Wan's acquaintances and memories...

934
01:00:50,529 --> 01:00:52,155
will always be there to haunt you.

935
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,825
If you choose to stay with Jae Guk,

936
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:58,434
you'll have to put up with all that.

937
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:02,305
You'll have to be thick-skinned and act like none of that matters.

938
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,905
Do you think you can do that?

939
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,305
The frightening reality.

940
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,405
The tenacious and cruel nature of people's opinions.

941
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,675
Mom, I'm home.

942
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:47,615
Jae Guk, everything's ready. Welcome home.

943
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:57,894
Young Eun.

944
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,525
I ran here because I didn't want to be late.

945
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:04,465
The meal is ready. Come sit down.

946
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,264
I'm sorry.

947
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,704
I'm sorry. I need to go.

948
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:32,325
Why did you leave the door open?

949
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:37,994
I wanted to see if she was capable of putting Soo Wan behind her.

950
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,035
I told you it won't work out.

951
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,575
She won't be able to overcome it.

952
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,425
I'll go with you.

953
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,325
Listen. I was...

954
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:04,494
I know.

955
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,525
I know how you feel.

956
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,965
You don't need to say anything.

957
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,894
Let's just be together.

958
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:45,235
Woori Photo Studio

959
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,465
This is my photo studio.

960
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,934
I ran away.

961
01:03:56,949 --> 01:03:58,715
I lost the will to fight...

962
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,244
as soon as I saw Soo Wan's room.

963
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,084
I'm going to take photos of people here for the next two months.

964
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:11,354
Your mother was right.

965
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,224
I can't put up with all that.

966
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:21,365
If I want to keep doing it, I might even choose to stay.

967
01:04:22,509 --> 01:04:24,405
I thought I'd be able to do it,

968
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,775
but the reality is just so different.

969
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:36,345
My purpose wasn't to get my mom's approval.

970
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:42,624
If she chooses not to accept you, then let her go ahead.

971
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:51,334
Nothing can stop me from being with you.

972
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,505
The four of us...

973
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,874
can't be together.

974
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,244
I already lost a child.

975
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,374
I can't just sit back and watch my other child...

976
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:07,544
be happy with the woman...

977
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:11,514
who took my child from me.

978
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:14,854
Does it have to be so hard?

979
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:18,025
But if you choose to continue, then so be it.

980
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:19,994
It's not something I can control.

981
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,365
But I won't...

982
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:25,934
be around.

983
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:30,175
Does it have to be so harsh?

984
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,644
I regret it.

985
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:42,544
I regret it so much...

986
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:46,514
that I want to erase those two months...

987
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:49,255
that I spent a decade ago.

988
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:54,764
For the first time in my life,

989
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:58,235
I regret the time I spent with your brother.

990
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,535
That's how much I love you.

991
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:12,575
Because of that, I feel so sorry.

992
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:00,695
Woori Photo Studio

993
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,714
Now, We Are Breaking Up

994
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:55,418
Young Eun, this is wrong. Don't walk this path.

995
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:57,588
- Mom. - Your daughter should stop.

996
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:58,689
It's not my daughter's fault.

997
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,889
If you feel sorry at all, you shouldn't be like this.

998
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:03,229
This is what I'm talking about.

999
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:06,458
Those big eyes and sharp nose.

1000
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:08,368
You look completely different.

1001
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:10,338
You just wait, Chi Sook.

1002
01:08:10,339 --> 01:08:12,865
- Use this chance to do it right. - Tonight?

1003
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,809
I'm confused.

1004
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:18,634
My body keeps sending me messages by making me feel pain.

1005
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,548
We're near my house.

1006
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:22,378
I still need you.

1007
01:08:22,379 --> 01:08:25,918
So this is the where you want to start a new life?

1008
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:27,149
She'll be taking photos today.

1009
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,248
You said you wanted to take photos before you started chemotherapy.

1010
01:08:29,249 --> 01:08:31,054
- Okay. - Move your body to the rhythm.

1011
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,288
Watch me.

1012
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:33,628
Those who are left behind have to live their lives...

1013
01:08:33,629 --> 01:08:35,689
based on their memories of those who are gone.

1014
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:39,059
You're very selfish. That's not love. It's greed.

1015
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,429
What's your intention? Why are you doing this?

1016
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,168
There's something you don't know.

1017
01:08:43,169 --> 01:08:44,535
Ten years ago, Soo Wan...
