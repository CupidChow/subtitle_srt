1
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,305
If you convert the number of clothes that are made in a year,

2
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,145
it adds up to about 42 billion dollars.

3
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,546
And that all begins with...

4
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:43,149
finding out what people want.

5
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,989
The psychology of people wanting to wear bold colours...

6
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,516
like the neon colour of chartreuse or red leather...

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,555
to escape from their stressful reality.

8
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,429
So Young, you're in charge of the basic T-shirts,

9
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,759
and you're in charge of the dresses.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Ask the handmade manufacturing team for the fabric.

11
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:56,665
I'll be off to arrange everything.

12
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,436
Every year, an average of 200 thousand clothes...

13
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,635
are made by me every year.

14
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,105
I think the shoulders are a bit too wide.

15
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,009
- The collar is crooked. - We'll fix it.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,615
Let's just leave the pockets for decor.

17
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,945
- Check what I left on the hanger. - Okay.

18
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:20,686
But clothes aren't what I design.

19
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,225
I design the needs of 200 thousand people.

20
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,665
A spell that people tell themselves thinking they'll stand out...

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,596
or look pretty in a certain outfit.

22
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,665
Call it a self-hypnosis or self-consolation.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,005
A single outfit makes people's illusions turn into reality.

24
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:45,876
So if you want to become happy,

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,975
make it yours.

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,849
"Whoever said money can't buy happiness..."

27
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,716
"simply didn't know where to go shopping." by Gertrude Stein

28
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,656
Now, We Are Breaking Up

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,866
Episode 2

30
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,635
We will soon be arriving at Gimpo International Airport.

31
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,210
Please fasten your seatbelts...

32
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:14,475
and put your seats and table trays in the upright position.

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,150
Please open the window blinds,

34
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,509
and keep your baggage in the overhead compartments...

35
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,005
or beneath the seat in front of you.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,175
Thank you.

37
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,069
Message

38
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,500
Mr. J, Olivier says there was a big misunderstanding,

39
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,705
and he wishes to meet and talk to you again...

40
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,669
Mr. J, this is the captain...

41
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,340
We appreciate if you join us...

42
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,105
Please call me back.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,276
Ms. Ha, I'm here.

44
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,985
Let's begin our emergency meeting.

45
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,190
Here are the top 13 sales of the top 3 department stores...

46
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,026
in the last week.

47
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,829
In the Young and Casual Zone,

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,295
Etre came in third just like last week.

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,629
In the Career Zone,

50
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,896
La Mon rose from 5th to 4th.

51
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,566
Goodness.

52
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:17,205
And Sono lost its first place for the very first time.

53
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,550
Sono is the most popular women's clothing brand in Korea,

54
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,316
but it lost its first place for the first time ever.

55
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:32,819
So I'd say it's a big issue.

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,316
The One Purchasing Order

57
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,030
Just say it.

58
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:38,389
We clearly placed an order for the ethnic blouses to the factory...

59
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,195
because the store managers said there weren't enough stocks.

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,000
But the blouses weren't made because Director Hwang...

61
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,495
left for Busan without signing the form.

62
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,610
I want the business trip report on my desk as soon as it's done.

63
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:51,839
The sales were low because there weren't enough to sell.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,706
The date is written on the order form.

65
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,709
A sales meeting is supposed to reflect the entire month.

66
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,475
He called for an emergency meeting just to talk about the past week.

67
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,216
It means he has something else that he wants to say.

68
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,685
Ms. Ha, how are you going to take care of the mess?

69
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,315
It's just the past week.

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,990
The overall difference is only 0.8 percent.

71
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,860
Are you saying a 0.8 decrease is insignificant?

72
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,756
Your complacency is why you failed to sign a deal with Olivier.

73
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,065
You should've...

74
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,165
waited until I got back.

75
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,165
She proceeded with it without even telling you?

76
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,709
Ms. Ha, are you not aware of your position in the company?

77
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,680
We gave you that title so you'd work hard.

78
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,605
It wasn't so you could do things however you wanted to.

79
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,810
We lost the deal because of money.

80
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,879
Viace offered three times the royalty we had offered.

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,579
To flip that, we needed to pay at least twice the original amount,

82
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,415
which is six times the royalty we had initially offered.

83
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,560
Director Ko, do you think you would've been okay with that?

84
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:44,589
So you just let go of the deal?

85
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,500
He even asked for rights over the project and designs.

86
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,829
That puts them in charge of the division of profits as well.

87
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,969
Is there a reason for us to cooperate with them...

88
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,540
when there will be nothing left for us?

89
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,740
Listen to me, Ms. Ha.

90
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:57,910
"I apologize. It was due to my lack of competence."

91
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,536
That's all you needed to say to settle the issue.

92
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,475
Who do you think you are to talk back like that?

93
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,946
I'm only giving you the reason behind the judgement I made.

94
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,719
If you had such a clever reason, then tell me this.

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,446
Our company's 30th anniversary is coming up soon.

96
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,819
But Lucia is going to hold a big show...

97
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,386
on the same day and hour.

98
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,930
Domestic brands are already saying...

99
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,190
foreign brands are taking over the market.

100
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,896
How will you promote anything without Olivier?

101
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,180
Influencers with over 300 thousand followers

102
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,636
Im Soo Ah, Park Ha Mi, An Hae Rang

103
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:38,776
The real people who influence the fashion industry...

104
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,446
are celebrities and influencers.

105
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,420
Park Ha Mi: 32 thousand followers, An Hye Rang: 30 thousand followers

106
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,750
The value of an outfit is judged based on who wore it...

107
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,190
rather than the characteristics.

108
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:48,519
Did you manage to make contact?

109
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,956
Okay, thank you. Yes, I'm all done.

110
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,756
Okay.

111
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,100
So Young, check everyone's height, weight, and size.

112
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,899
I'll match the outfits as soon as I'm done checking.

113
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,329
Each line costs 10,000 dollars. Make sure you hashtag "The One."

114
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,300
How can you guarantee that making them wear our clothes...

115
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,040
will result in an effective marketing outcome?

116
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,875
These influencers have an average of over 300 thousand followers.

117
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,305
Even if we consider the number of overlapping followers,

118
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,149
we can still promote our outfits to over 1,600,000 people.

119
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,915
You're going to organize the event with all those small fish?

120
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,990
We need a big shot like Olivier...

121
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,815
Hye Rin, a wannabe icon for many women.

122
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,956
She's going to be the main celebrity of our event.

123
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,990
I heard Lucia sent out their invitations...

124
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:27,456
inside their newly launched wallet.

125
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,930
But this just shows that they're a domestic brand. How lame.

126
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,540
But that's the main line.

127
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,596
They especially gave you priority over everyone else.

128
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,040
Who says it's the main line?

129
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,165
It'll only become the main line once I wear it.

130
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,910
Forget it.

131
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:42,709
I want 20 of their newly launched outfits, 20 matching shoes,

132
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,779
and ten bags. Tell them to send me new ones.

133
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,379
If you ask for so many,

134
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,019
what are the other influencers going to wear?

135
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,990
If they have other colours of the same design, put them on hold.

136
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:52,386
I hate people trying to copy my style...

137
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,016
just by wearing different colours.

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,886
Do you have any more comments?

139
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,355
I think that's enough for today.

140
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,396
Ms. Ha, I'd like to talk to you in private.

141
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,966
It's all because she's too good.

142
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,776
When you own a company, you like those who perform well,

143
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:17,846
but they can also be pretty intimidating.

144
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,716
It can be a nuisance to sign all these forms for approval.

145
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,646
I trust you guys to get the work done.

146
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,920
The procedure just seems so unnecessary.

147
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,086
Report for approval

148
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,526
You're a person who knows when to speak up and stay quiet.

149
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,896
What's the matter with you?

150
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:38,696
Whatever the plan was,

151
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,365
you should've let Chi Sook take initiative.

152
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,536
Chi Sook has a job to fulfill, and your job is to support that.

153
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:47,805
I was thoughtless about that.

154
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,680
I want to see Chi Sook play a big role...

155
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,105
for the 30th anniversary event.

156
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,975
I'll support her and make sure everything goes well.

157
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,615
Director Hwang is going inside, sir.

158
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,920
Is it time for another 1 on 1 discussion? What's the...

159
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:03,156
Apparently, your blind date hasn't said anything bad about you.

160
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,925
Will you be meeting him again?

161
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,699
Well, I'd like to choose my own spouse...

162
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,896
He doesn't seem uninterested, so meet him again.

163
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,175
I'm not Hwang Chi Sook.

164
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,805
I know. Ms. Ha Young Eun.

165
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,319
Then why did you act like you didn't know?

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,585
It just felt like the right thing to do.

167
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:35,119
It looks like we've finally introduced ourselves to each other.

168
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,126
I guess you also remember what I last said to you.

169
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm leaving for Seoul tomorrow.

170
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,325
I'm heading back on Monday.

171
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,329
Enjoy your trip.

172
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,726
I'll be arriving in the morning.

173
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,599
I never asked.

174
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,195
I'll be staying at the Saint Hotel.

175
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:49,609
I didn't ask you that either.

176
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,736
I have nothing planned, so I'll have a lot of free time.

177
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,305
I have roaming service, so my number will be the same.

178
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,175
What about your hotel room number?

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,575
Gosh, that's too much information.

180
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,246
He must've...

181
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:07,856
liked you.

182
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,656
It's hard not to like me.

183
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,055
Thanks to you, things got more complicated.

184
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,869
It seems like your father will be checking on you himself.

185
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,026
What do you plan to do?

186
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:21,199
It's too late to tell him the truth...

187
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,699
and start a long-distance relationship.

188
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,369
That kind of relationship requires energy.

189
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,835
It's not even Seoul and Ilsan. I mean, he lives in Paris.

190
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,910
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:28,911
If you have a short life expectancy,

192
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,349
you might not even get to hold hands.

193
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,445
Does that mean I can take care of him myself?

194
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:47,595
Why don't you use your smartness to work?

195
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,869
It's just weird. You were supposed to end it in Busan.

196
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,665
Why is it still ongoing? It's not like you.

197
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,665
Why don't you ask him yourself?

198
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:58,366
The secretary's office probably has his number.

199
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,910
I thought this was waterproof.

200
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:02,506
Why does it smudge every time I yawn?

201
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,776
Whatever.

202
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:06,815
I'll be outside the entire day.

203
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,545
Yoon Jae Guk

204
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,815
I'm free until Friday.

205
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,085
- Who is it? - What?

206
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:19,656
Chief Manager Nam Na Ri

207
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:22,626
Hey.

208
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,440
Did you borrow money from a loan shark?

209
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:29,095
People are asking if I can work with them next season.

210
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:32,810
Gosh, I'm jealous that you don't need to sell yourself.

211
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:35,376
When you first decided to become a photographer,

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,650
I never knew you'd become so successful.

213
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,449
The good days don't last very long.

214
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,915
Work hard and make money while people still want you.

215
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,445
I'm not sure if it's a good thing that people want to work with me.

216
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,286
It's nice that my work is becoming popular,

217
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,955
but it also means that it's becoming more common.

218
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,329
If your work is good,

219
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,356
there's bound to be someone who acknowledges that.

220
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:56,325
You're better than expected.

221
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:00,435
I really like your photos.

222
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,680
Hey, sir.

223
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:10,006
What should we do? Hye Rin wants to collaborate with Lucia.

224
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,310
What? She already took the money.

225
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:13,945
She can't do that.

226
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,815
Can you reach her manager for me?

227
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,545
I'll be right there.

228
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,020
The hotel isn't this way.

229
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:22,190
It's an emergency. I need to go to the office first.

230
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:23,760
I'm busy.

231
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:25,489
I need to meet someone.

232
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,800
We're off to meet the person you need to meet.

233
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,969
You're the director at The One. Use that position to pressure them.

234
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,270
Tell them to do their work properly.

235
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:35,136
Can't you be the one to do that kind of work?

236
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,109
- I'll just get off over there. - Stop the car.

237
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,205
Mr. Seok Do Hoon

238
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,575
- Mr. Seok Do Hoon? - Yes, Ms. Ha Young Eun.

239
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:50,315
Wait here. I'll call you as soon as I'm done.

240
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,085
Yes, is Mr. Kim here?

241
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,415
Okay.

242
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,310
I already told her...

243
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:18,545
that we received the money and settled a deal.

244
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,319
But the other influencers with fewer followers will be promoting Lucia,

245
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,616
so she thinks it's wrong for her to promote a domestic brand.

246
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,815
Gosh, she's killing me too.

247
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,790
Did you send The One the list of invitees?

248
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,256
They're going to proceed with the fitting tomorrow.

249
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,729
Okay, she'll get extra gift cards.

250
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,229
She'll be the last to stand on the photo zone,

251
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,900
and we'll provide her with the best class limousine.

252
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:39,095
We're also going to hire bodyguards for her.

253
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,440
Okay, I'll try to convince her again.

254
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,996
But you know how Hye Rin can be.

255
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,540
The headlines will say she chose to stick with a domestic brand...

256
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,479
even though everyone else went for Lucia...

257
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,810
and that she's a woman with principles.

258
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,050
We'll make sure the headlines say that on the papers.

259
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,050
I'm sure that will have a bigger impact on her reputation...

260
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,715
than choosing to promote Lucia with other influencers.

261
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,286
I do think she will like that.

262
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:00,819
We only have 17 hours until the fitting.

263
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,356
Please do what you can.

264
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,455
Will you see him off?

265
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,896
Come this way.

266
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,465
Should I not have said anything about the gift cards?

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,565
Gosh, I'm running low on sugar.

268
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:25,146
We're here to meet Mr. Seok Do Hoon.

269
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,376
You're looking right at him.

270
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,845
I'm talking about the CEO of Vision PR.

271
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:34,819
Yes, that's me.

272
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,185
I'm the only Seok Do Hoon working at Vision PR.

273
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:40,726
Young Eun, what is he saying?

274
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:44,229
Director Hwang, you must be mistaken.

275
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,726
He is Mr. Seok Do Hoon.

276
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:47,335
Don't joke with me.

277
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,835
Me? You think I'm joking with you?

278
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:53,906
No, he didn't look like this.

279
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:57,476
This isn't the Seok Do Hoon I know.

280
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,050
Ms. Ha, I know I almost lost a deal with a celebrity,

281
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,319
but that doesn't mean I'm okay with being ignored like this.

282
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,146
This is extremely upsetting.

283
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,616
Director Hwang seems to have a misunderstanding.

284
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,315
- Director Hwang. - Wait.

285
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,226
Seok Do Hoon isn't supposed to look...

286
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:15,030
like this.

287
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:16,569
What's wrong with the way I look?

288
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,425
I'm fine with the way I look.

289
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:19,896
Director Hwang.

290
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,835
That's what I'm talking about.

291
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,305
That nose.

292
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,106
That side profile.

293
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,116
That's exactly what he looked like.

294
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,366
Let's talk over some coffee.

295
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,445
Can I have an Americano?

296
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,055
Do you call this fate?

297
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:19,290
I guess those who are destined to meet will meet no matter what.

298
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,396
I guess so.

299
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,026
We meet again.

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,795
How do you plan to deal with this?

301
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,736
I'll do everything I can to put things back to place.

302
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,205
It looks like you're in a bit of a pickle.

303
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,575
Not yet.

304
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,780
Shouldn't you be in Paris right now?

305
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,305
- What brings you here? - I'm here for personal business.

306
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,150
Oh, I see.

307
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,920
What do you do for a living?

308
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,215
I'm a photographer.

309
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:46,715
He takes photos.

310
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:49,756
You're a photographer? I love photos.

311
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,930
Photos of beautiful sceneries...

312
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:54,396
really put your mind at ease.

313
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:55,800
I shoot photos for fashion books.

314
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,195
Yes, fashion photography is the best kind.

315
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,536
Please make sure Hye Rin come to our event.

316
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,565
We're not done talking, Ms. Ha.

317
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:07,006
She says we still have more to talk about.

318
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:10,506
Yes, I heard. We should clear things up.

319
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,476
I know this may be a surprise, but let me introduce you guys.

320
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,520
He's Yoon Jae Guk,

321
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,646
the son of your father's acquaintance.

322
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,386
She's Director Hwang Chi Sook.

323
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,859
Come on. My dad has tons of acquaintances.

324
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,890
He even knows someone whose son lives in Paris.

325
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:25,126
Oh, my goodness.

326
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,295
What a crazy coincidence.

327
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,825
I can't believe you just said that right now.

328
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:34,166
You really cleared things up in an instant.

329
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,166
I'm a very busy woman.

330
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,436
Hey, Na Ri.

331
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:44,850
We've settled things up,

332
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:46,345
so proceed with our plan.

333
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,845
Okay, bye.

334
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,545
I'll see you tomorrow.

335
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,555
Oh, yes. Hello.

336
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,555
No, don't go.

337
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,236
Hey, Mom.

338
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:15,805
Yes, this is Seok Do Hoon speaking.

339
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:20,946
You always leave after saying your piece.

340
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,845
I don't want there to be any misunderstandings.

341
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,916
But I didn't even say anything.

342
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:30,630
Why are you getting so ahead of yourself?

343
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:32,825
I never asked you out or proposed to you.

344
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,496
I never asked you to do anything with me.

345
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,325
- Which way are you headed? - Why?

346
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,565
So I can go the other way.

347
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,145
Mother

348
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,746
Why didn't you come home?

349
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,615
I'm staying at a hotel.

350
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,055
How was your blind date?

351
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,529
You can't tell just by meeting her once.

352
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,266
So try to make time to meet her again.

353
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,125
I asked you not to set me up on any blind dates.

354
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:15,135
You're all I have.

355
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:18,269
I lost your brother in less than three years...

356
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,766
after your father passed.

357
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:23,135
So I just want to see you start a family.

358
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,645
Why couldn't you be like that to your eldest son?

359
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,115
If you let him marry the woman he loved,

360
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,716
my brother might still be alive.

361
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,085
I'll see you on the anniversary of his death.

362
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,476
He must be your son.

363
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,006
Oh, yes.

364
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,446
Is he the son who lives in Paris?

365
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,615
I knew there'd be a guy.

366
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,016
I thought everyone was taken.

367
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:10,655
But there's still a decent guy who's single.

368
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,299
Where are you?

369
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,095
Paris? Seoul?

370
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,736
Sunny day, on my way to work

371
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,010
You look so elegant.

372
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,105
Please share the brand name of your lipstick.

373
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:34,216
I got here today.

374
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,115
Are you doing well?

375
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:38,246
He lives in France.

376
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,390
Thank goodness for that.

377
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:43,585
If he lived here, some other woman would've snatched him away.

378
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,590
He failed to find someone in France.

379
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:47,430
Maybe that means there's something wrong with him.

380
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:48,459
Look who's talking.

381
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,996
Are you still single because you're so great and perfect?

382
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,805
You look great. It really suits you well.

383
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,209
Your daughter picked the right suit.

384
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,150
My daughter works at a fashion company.

385
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:05,276
She's Head of Design.

386
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,575
No wonder. She has a great eye.

387
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:09,880
Not just that.

388
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:12,085
She's clever and good at her job.

389
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,789
She's worth ten sons.

390
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,019
Shall I bag what your daughter picked out?

391
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,585
I don't have to try on too many clothes.

392
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,900
Why would you buy something so expensive to wear just once?

393
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:29,039
Don't you think you're bleeding her dry?

394
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,610
Why is it just once?

395
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:33,170
I'll wear it to meet her in-laws, to her kid's first birthday,

396
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,936
and at your 70th birthday.

397
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,305
- What shall I do? - We'll take it.

398
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:40,645
Hey. It's so expensive.

399
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,249
So what? Dad is retiring.

400
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,716
Can't his only daughter spend this much on him?

401
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,786
Your daughter can afford it.

402
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,190
You must be so proud.

403
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,286
I am.

404
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,266
Three-month instalment, please.

405
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,875
I'm in the red next month too.

406
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,610
What can I say?

407
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,920
Playing a successful daughter to satisfy my parents...

408
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,476
is one of my duties.

409
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:18,986
Why are there so many bills?

410
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,090
So little comes in...

411
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:22,855
and so much goes out.

412
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,555
Your dad must be really pleased.

413
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:33,029
Good for you, though.

414
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,140
You paid off all his debts.

415
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,966
I'm still paying off the mortgage.

416
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:39,635
The balcony and toilet still belong to the bank.

417
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,006
Your dad retires soon, doesn't he?

418
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,779
I'll be the breadwinner soon.

419
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,776
So I have to work hard...

420
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,446
and host the event in two days without a hitch.

421
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,786
Promotion is at stake.

422
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:57,956
Moans at this time of night are very suggestive.

423
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,325
Flab lives off laziness.

424
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,395
I must be working way too hard, then.

425
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,739
Hang up. I have to exercise to survive.

426
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,936
My gosh.

427
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,180
You make it harder for yourself.

428
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,446
I have no choice.

429
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,749
If a designer grows old or fat,

430
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,545
the cruel world says they lost their touch.

431
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,345
I praise you for living life to the fullest,

432
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,420
but leave some room in your heart.

433
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:31,526
Who knows? You might meet a decent guy.

434
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:52,405
Forget it. Even without a man,

435
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,946
my life gets attacked by cellulite whenever I let my guard down.

436
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,746
- I have to go. - Bye.

437
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,595
Hang in there. Good looks are a skill set.

438
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,155
I must do this.

439
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,905
Courier!

440
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,476
Here you go.

441
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,176
Quick and safe.

442
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,986
Yes, sir.

443
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:35,559
Star Marketing Team

444
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,330
Hye Rin's clothes are on the way.

445
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,926
Do you have the main photo and caption for her social media?

446
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,655
The post goes up right after the show.

447
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,900
What about the homepage renewal?

448
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,666
Hye Rin picks a domestic brand.

449
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,900
Did you proofread the article?

450
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,440
Checking it on mobile and desktop.

451
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:51,565
Here are the scrapped articles and the schedule for online articles.

452
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:53,809
Did you check the main page?

453
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,976
- Yes. - Yes.

454
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:57,449
Give me a photo with a close up of her face.

455
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,850
- Ms. Seo. - Yes?

456
00:23:58,851 --> 00:23:59,910
Did you check and confirm?

457
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:01,416
Finishing it up right now.

458
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,949
I'll report as soon as clipping is done.

459
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,219
Hye Rin is the main celebrity.

460
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,360
Put a huge photo with her face in the center of the report!

461
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,719
- Okay. - Okay.

462
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,825
Okay.

463
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,390
- Courier. - Are those relief goods?

464
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:14,895
How dare they ship in a box?

465
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,266
She wants us to package it again.

466
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,325
Courier.

467
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,269
What poor taste.

468
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,436
Mr. Seok.

469
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,536
We'll send the other outfits we're keeping, just in case.

470
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,746
Darn it.

471
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:34,716
Courier.

472
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,786
Leave these and send the rest back with the hangers.

473
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:40,786
Courier.

474
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,026
You got slower.

475
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:47,895
Quick Courier

476
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:54,135
We arranged to have Hye Rin come over.

477
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:56,196
Send us the clothes.

478
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:00,006
I think I've done all I could.

479
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:04,006
Na Ri, go to Vision PR and fit her yourself.

480
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,709
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

481
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,710
Hye Rin with principles picks a domestic brand.

482
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:07,845
Get Hye Rin's pick at The One!

483
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,449
The One's 30th anniversary event! Sono's new model, Hye Rin!

484
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,479
The One

485
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,585
Trending Keyword: Hye Rin

486
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm taking part in The One's 30th anniversary event.

487
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:14,555
Comments

488
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:20,355
At The One's 30th anniversary event,

489
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,699
you'll wear a foreign luxury brand?

490
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,229
I'll wear our clothes on the inside.

491
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,930
It's just the jacket and handbag.

492
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:28,466
This is to accentuate the look.

493
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,870
You must want to show off because Hye Rin will be there.

494
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,706
No. Mr. Paris.

495
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:35,476
I scanned his background.

496
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,605
His mother's family owns a pretty big distribution company,

497
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:40,776
and his dad was a great doctor.

498
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,885
Put them in water so they don't wilt.

499
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,355
Yes, ma'am.

500
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:03,295
I sent your suit for tomorrow to your suite.

501
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,536
Did Do Hoon tell you where I'm staying?

502
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,236
It's not just any memorial. It's the tenth anniversary of his death.

503
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:12,676
We should host a decent service.

504
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,375
Dress for the part.

505
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,776
I'll wear what works.

506
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:19,385
I sent a matching shirt and tie. Wear what I sent over.

507
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,286
Goodbye.

508
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,870
Yoon Jae Guk is free-spirited, a true Parisian.

509
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:42,676
He also inherited intellect and wealth.

510
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:44,709
He's a rare gem.

511
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,880
I get why your father was adamant you meet him.

512
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,580
We'll be photographed a lot tomorrow.

513
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,916
I should show the right attitude towards his family.

514
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:58,786
How about this, then?

515
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:02,355
It's by a talented designer only a few people know.

516
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:04,625
From Paris? New York?

517
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:06,229
It's not Milan, is it?

518
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,335
It is a rich colour. Who's the designer?

519
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,936
Me.

520
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,436
It's from Ha Young Eun's 2021 SS collection.

521
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,105
You're the main host tomorrow.

522
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:21,446
Memorize everything about our new designs.

523
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,446
Let's keep our wits about us, okay?

524
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,055
Your mistake is mine too, and I'm desperate.

525
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,716
Okay?

526
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:34,555
The One 30th Anniversary Event

527
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,395
What a disaster.

528
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:45,905
Call Mr. Jung.

529
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,706
They know the concept better than anyone.

530
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,249
You can trust them.

531
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,575
I don't think I can, and that is the problem.

532
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:56,719
I have therapy at five.

533
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,249
You only have until 4:30pm.

534
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,949
That's realistically impossible.

535
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,219
Mr. Jung is already fully booked.

536
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,825
And he's not the kind of person who can come...

537
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,186
just because I ask him to.

538
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,756
Is that so? Then I can't wear this.

539
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:14,865
Hye Rin.

540
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:16,436
I'm a professional myself.

541
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,835
My value equals my taste.

542
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,006
I can't wear just anything.

543
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,249
I believe you promised yesterday that you'd sort it out.

544
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,476
Ms. Ha, is everything going well for tomorrow's event?

545
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,115
The model's being fitted.

546
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,055
I reported that we hired Hye Rin. This has to happen.

547
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,655
She wants to change the design.

548
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:43,456
This isn't a decision I can make.

549
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:46,966
Is she still there? Keep her there, then.

550
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,266
I'm so tired. I'm low on sugar.

551
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,049
My gosh.

552
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,645
You asked me over for lunch and you're on appetizers already?

553
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:03,080
Oh, lunch.

554
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:05,216
I am so sorry.

555
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,786
I can't join you. Do you mind eating alone?

556
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,355
Did you sort out the problem you were talking about yesterday?

557
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:16,395
No. I think it's about to begin.

558
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,605
The sleeve ends here.

559
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,676
The hem ends here.

560
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:30,436
Did you take note of that?

561
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,920
The classic look is Sono's main concept.

562
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,615
Then put it on a mannequin.

563
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,186
I wear what I want.

564
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:42,655
You can't alter anything. It ruins our design.

565
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,655
Just because your business card says "designer",

566
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,286
that doesn't make you a true designer.

567
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:49,625
Let's be honest. Who wears domestic brands?

568
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:53,226
I wouldn't wear it too if it weren't for the contract.

569
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,436
It's humiliating.

570
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,736
It's humiliating?

571
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,746
What makes you so special?

572
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:10,645
If I weren't special, would you be here doing this?

573
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:14,355
- What? - Quit if you want.

574
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,186
I don't have to wear this.

575
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:24,529
To make that one jacket,

576
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,196
we do quality control seven, eight times.

577
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:29,739
We discard dozens of yards of fabric when a pocket's moved a millimetre.

578
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,635
The jacket you just threw down...

579
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:35,905
is made with hours of effort from hundreds of people.

580
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,545
Doesn't everyone do that much to make a living?

581
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,276
Why are you whining about that to me?

582
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,115
Na Ri.

583
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,986
- Ms. Ha. - That's enough. Apologize to her.

584
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,655
- Ms. Ha. - Apologize to her.

585
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,805
I'm sorry.

586
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,405
Apology accepted. Say you'll alter the clothes too.

587
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,380
I didn't pay one million people to follow me online.

588
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:15,375
I'm not being a bully or causing trouble.

589
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,749
I'm being a responsible professional...

590
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,416
and am doing my best.

591
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,286
I apologize.

592
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:31,769
I have plans and can't stay any longer.

593
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,635
Send the photos once the jacket's altered.

594
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,236
Then I'll decide whether to wear it or not.

595
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:39,105
We won't change our design.

596
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,835
Then I won't wear it.

597
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,840
I'll talk to Mr. Seok...

598
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:45,075
and get Carti to provide the jewellery.

599
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,575
The limited edition of which only three were imported.

600
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:50,746
Can we compromise at that?

601
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,115
I misheard, didn't I?

602
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,855
Please tell me I did.

603
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,026
Carti's limited edition.

604
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,426
Only three were imported.

605
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,795
- I feel so weak. - Hang in there.

606
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,135
- You can do it. - Unless I get what I want,

607
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,766
there's no compromise.

608
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,166
Send the photos by tonight.

609
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:14,905
Or I won't wear this.

610
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:23,620
Hye Rin.

611
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:26,120
If you leave like this, you make me look very bad.

612
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:28,559
Can't we be reasonable and rational?

613
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,686
Hye Rin?

614
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,166
I'm sorry. What she said...

615
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,595
hurt my pride.

616
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:47,610
For this collection, we made 32 sets.

617
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:49,405
A total of 64 pieces, right?

618
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,016
Na Ri, you rushed all over the place for a year to find the materials.

619
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:58,549
Sun Ju and So Young got humiliated at the presentation,

620
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,115
and scolded by shop managers.

621
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:03,355
You stayed up for two months to tweak and change the details.

622
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:08,996
But even if we worked hard and made the best we could,

623
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:12,125
it means nothing if it becomes the dead stock.

624
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,065
I didn't bow to Hye Rin so she'd wear our brand.

625
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:19,666
I want her to wear it...

626
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:23,375
so hundreds and thousands can see our clothes.

627
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,476
Your hard work and your talent.

628
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:32,486
If people wear our clothes...

629
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:37,316
and say it's nice, well-made, and pretty.

630
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,825
That is good enough.

631
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,126
That is our pride.

632
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,766
Hye Rin wants us to alter and we can't do that.

633
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:51,536
We'll find another celebrity to replace her.

634
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,479
So Young, bring your phone and follow me.

635
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,575
Okay.

636
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,016
Hello?

637
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:04,789
Hello. Do you remember me?

638
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,720
I'm Nam Na Ri from The One.

639
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,260
- Yes. - Ms. Lee Hye In?

640
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:09,789
- You're not free. - Tae Im.

641
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,729
- I see. - What's her schedule like?

642
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,025
- She has a shoot? - We had a change of plan.

643
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,726
She's too far out.

644
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,800
La Ra, you're the true celebrity.

645
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:25,909
An event isn't an event without you.

646
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,679
You're not a fill-in. There was a mistake.

647
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,805
Carti's limited edition?

648
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,709
The precious thing of which only three were imported?

649
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,016
You'll think about it if I give it to you?

650
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,316
She won't fall for it.

651
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,686
I'd like to know Ms. Yeo's schedule.

652
00:34:49,861 --> 00:34:52,195
It's Ha Young Eun. How are you?

653
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,266
You're in New York.

654
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,769
It's Ha Young Eun from The One.

655
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,005
Do you remember me?

656
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,005
Yoo Na?

657
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:08,075
She must have the wrong number.

658
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:09,476
I'm sorry.

659
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,356
Practicing our generation's values

660
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:30,796
What now? No one is free.

661
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:33,305
Get Shin Yoo Jung's number.

662
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:37,079
I know it's a very long shot.

663
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,516
But I want to beg her to do something for domestic brands.

664
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,820
Who knows?

665
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:45,485
My sincerity might create a miracle.

666
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,868
Okay.

667
00:35:48,483 --> 00:35:49,513
Good job.

668
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,249
Go back to the office and work on planning the event.

669
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,952
Request you delete The One's article on Hye Rin

670
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,048
Delete

671
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:00,852
Everything we posted on social media about Hye Rin...

672
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:02,118
is to be deleted.

673
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:04,118
Hello?

674
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,662
Why would you put up psychedelic lights?

675
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:07,828
It's not a cabaret.

676
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,828
It'll be a club tomorrow.

677
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:15,769
I'm off to check the venue.

678
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:17,899
Delete Hye Rin from everything.

679
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:19,238
- Okay. - Okay.

680
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:22,709
I don't have an appointment with Ms. Shin.

681
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,013
If you can't put me through,

682
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:26,848
can you pass on a message?

683
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,479
Yes, please.

684
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,819
Why do you live so hard?

685
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:36,859
What are you doing here?

686
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:39,689
I had lunch plans,

687
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,598
but I got blown off.

688
00:36:48,404 --> 00:36:49,738
Each time,

689
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,569
and in a different way,

690
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,868
you work so hard, Ms. Ha.

691
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:55,709
I don't work hard.

692
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,839
This is all I can do.

693
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:02,249
Director Hwang

694
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:09,419
Whose photo is that?

695
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,928
It's an unknown photographer's work.

696
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:15,129
The exposure is dreadful, and the composition is poor.

697
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,158
It's definitely an amateur.

698
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:19,368
The light is a haze.

699
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:25,868
That's why it's like seeing with your eyes, not through a lens.

700
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:31,809
I don't know about exposure or composition,

701
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:36,019
but I wonder who is at the end of this road.

702
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:40,419
How cold must it have felt in the rain?

703
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:44,089
It makes me think and rings in my heart.

704
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,729
That makes him a professional.

705
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,758
His work touched someone.

706
00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:08,578
Paris, 10 years ago

707
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:15,448
How much?

708
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:18,249
20 Euros.

709
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,258
Hey, Ha Young Eun.

710
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:57,319
Is this how you do your job?

711
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:00,028
I was going to wear this to Chanel's show tomorrow.

712
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,162
What if your father finds out?

713
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:05,872
We're not here to go to events and meet celebrities.

714
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,803
We're here as rookies to assist our seniors...

715
00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:10,968
and learn how things are done.

716
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:13,209
You can do that for both of us.

717
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:14,413
Chi Sook.

718
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,113
That's why my dad paid for you to study abroad.

719
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,153
How else could you have studied...

720
00:40:19,154 --> 00:40:21,309
at a fashion school in Paris for three years?

721
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,479
I was paid to help you study,

722
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:26,022
and I did my dues.

723
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,122
I did all your assignments...

724
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:29,158
and never slept more than three hours.

725
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,289
Then you must be good too.

726
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:34,488
So keep doing good, Young Eun.

727
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:03,919
The thought of going back to that time...

728
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:07,828
and feeling miserable scares me.

729
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:11,698
It takes a long time to develop calluses,

730
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:13,928
but they can get infected in a second.

731
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:17,138
That's why I keep going without looking back.

732
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:21,368
Isn't it stressful to have your hard work go unnoticed?

733
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:25,883
People only praise designers with their own eponymous labels.

734
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,613
We may design for labels under the company's name,

735
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:29,649
but we do 12 shows a year.

736
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,792
And I've never made clothes that look the same.

737
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:32,793
I know.

738
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:35,718
Do you know how many fashion shows and covers I shoot a year?

739
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:38,493
If I listened to the higher-ups and sold the popular designs...

740
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:40,463
from the summer collection with long sleeves in winter,

741
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,928
sure, it'd be profitable.

742
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:44,463
But I shouldn't even call myself a designer, then.

743
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:47,533
I get it. We, artists, have a thing called pride.

744
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:48,999
For them, it's just a job.

745
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:51,573
And people don't even know that a designer like me exists,

746
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,468
but that's okay.

747
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:55,343
Why seek validation from others?

748
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:56,839
What you truly need is self-validation.

749
00:41:57,784 --> 00:41:59,348
You impressed me in Busan.

750
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,078
I'm impressed once again.

751
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,388
Hey, Na Ri. Any word from Shin Yoo Jung yet?

752
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:15,598
Okay.

753
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:21,468
No more wasting time in vain. Let's go.

754
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:23,839
I have to get back to the office to confirm things for the event.

755
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:27,238
Would you give me a hand?

756
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,278
Those pieces are very precious.

757
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:35,848
No! Make sure they don't touch the floor.

758
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:39,848
You know, I didn't come back to Korea to do things like this.

759
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:43,589
My shoulders hurt from holding my phone all the time.

760
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,463
You have nothing to do anyway. You said you were free now.

761
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,158
I am free now, but just for you.

762
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,499
Hearing that would've made my heart skip a few years ago.

763
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:56,569
Why not now?

764
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:58,669
You went on a blind date with my boss.

765
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:01,312
I'm old enough to know not to get involved with my boss' man.

766
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:02,383
My gosh.

767
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:04,812
This industry is very small. The rumour will spread in no time.

768
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:06,548
I'd have to quit my job,

769
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:08,452
but no one would hire me because of the rumours.

770
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,319
Gosh, no thanks.

771
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:14,519
So the reasons you are rejecting me have nothing to do with me.

772
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,129
I did feel my hormones reacting to what you said.

773
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:25,399
But movies with predictable endings are no fun.

774
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,618
I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow.

775
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:52,158
Can't you...

776
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,559
be honest with me for once?

777
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:58,769
It's now or never...

778
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,169
because you'll never see me again.

779
00:44:47,253 --> 00:44:49,118
Why you, of all people?

780
00:44:51,803 --> 00:44:54,538
Let's just leave it at that.

781
00:45:12,225 --> 00:45:15,590
Will you be in Paris next spring for the Paris Fashion Week?

782
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:19,130
Yes, if I manage to hold out until then without getting fired.

783
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:22,559
You'd better not get fired.

784
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:26,599
Have a safe flight.

785
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,099
I won't change my number.

786
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,003
Ha Young Eun

787
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:58,029
You seemed to like this photo, so I wanted to share it with you.

788
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:07,909
Did you just finish the photoshoot gig?

789
00:46:07,914 --> 00:46:09,009
Yes.

790
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,520
I sold it earlier. For 20 Euros.

791
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:20,853
Someone bought it? Who?

792
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:22,119
Just some lady.

793
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:35,599
Hey.

794
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:37,670
It's me.

795
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:41,239
Can you do me a favour?

796
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:51,420
The One, Telling Trends

797
00:46:58,995 --> 00:47:02,360
The One, Telling Trends

798
00:47:07,135 --> 00:47:08,340
Ms. Ha.

799
00:47:11,814 --> 00:47:13,643
The event will start in 15 minutes.

800
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:15,079
Is the main celebrity coming?

801
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:18,980
Ms. Shin Yoo Jung!

802
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:20,480
Get the camera.

803
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:39,869
Hello.

804
00:47:41,544 --> 00:47:43,639
I'm Ha Young Eun, The One's Head of Design.

805
00:47:46,274 --> 00:47:47,670
I'm Shin Yoo Jung.

806
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:57,619
My gosh, it's very nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Chi Sook.

807
00:48:07,365 --> 00:48:09,404
Look, are you kidding me?

808
00:48:09,405 --> 00:48:11,300
Did you people just blow me off?

809
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:14,570
Get your facts straight. You blew us off.

810
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:18,614
You told us this morning that you wouldn't be coming.

811
00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:21,040
Then how did you manage to get Shin Yoo Jung there right away?

812
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:23,009
You were double-crossing this whole time!

813
00:48:24,345 --> 00:48:25,683
What are you talking about?

814
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:28,324
Ms. Shin Yoo Jung clearly has such a good eye.

815
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:29,924
Because she recognizes The One's brand value,

816
00:48:29,925 --> 00:48:31,284
she gladly and kindly agreed...

817
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:34,194
to attend this event, fully knowing that she was just filling in.

818
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:37,563
So just relax and get some rest today.

819
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:38,730
Nice.

820
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:43,699
What are you doing?

821
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:47,704
Director Hwang, the models are ready now.

822
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:49,003
Okay. Shall we go in?

823
00:48:49,004 --> 00:48:50,199
- Yes. - Yes.

824
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:59,779
Sun Young, get ready.

825
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:33,114
I don't usually attend events like that.

826
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,980
Why not? Because it's a domestic brand?

827
00:50:35,214 --> 00:50:37,380
Come on. Don't be so biased.

828
00:50:37,885 --> 00:50:39,284
They make quality clothes that they can stand behind,

829
00:50:39,285 --> 00:50:40,683
just like high-end brands.

830
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,583
And all the designers there are like artists...

831
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:45,349
who take their work very seriously.

832
00:50:46,354 --> 00:50:48,050
Is your friend a designer for that brand?

833
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:49,719
What?

834
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:51,730
Which brand?

835
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:53,434
The One.

836
00:50:53,435 --> 00:50:55,134
The One, Ha Young Eun

837
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,599
I'm Ha Young Eun, The One's Head of Design.

838
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:32,230
Yoon Soo Wan

839
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:54,353
Son of Yoon Jin Woo and Min Hye Ok

840
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:58,659
Yoon Soo Wan, May 17, 1982 - March 15, 2011

841
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:05,369
Did you send me here because you knew?

842
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,170
You figured it out way too quickly.

843
00:52:12,115 --> 00:52:13,210
I guess...

844
00:52:13,774 --> 00:52:16,909
you don't know who Ha Young Eun is.

845
00:52:18,314 --> 00:52:19,409
What?

846
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:37,599
Well done, all of us.

847
00:52:37,975 --> 00:52:39,503
I should give myself props for pulling it off.

848
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:42,174
A celebrity backed out at the last minute. It was very stressful.

849
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:44,143
Ask for a promotion.

850
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:46,114
Or just quit.

851
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:48,480
With all your skills and experience,

852
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:50,353
I'm sure you'll get hired in no time.

853
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:52,079
She's not going anywhere.

854
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:55,690
Just stay and don't quit. Trust me, it's much better that way.

855
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:59,420
It's on the house. It expires tomorrow.

856
00:52:59,624 --> 00:53:00,663
Long time no see.

857
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:02,759
- Indeed. - Thanks for this.

858
00:53:02,794 --> 00:53:05,063
Gosh, those darn sales reports.

859
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:07,433
Being obsessed with sales numbers down to decimal digits.

860
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,070
I quit because I couldn't stand it,

861
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:10,804
but it's not much different here.

862
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:13,304
It's still all about numbers.

863
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:15,770
Hey, did you hear that? The reason I can't quit.

864
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:18,143
Like she said, it'd be better to stay at a place...

865
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:19,844
where I've built my career and have already proven myself.

866
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:21,610
Then at least find yourself a nice man.

867
00:53:21,984 --> 00:53:25,020
- I have found someone. - There she goes again.

868
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:31,250
I'm telling you. He really made my heart flutter.

869
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:34,989
The way he looks, his manners,

870
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:39,329
and the muscles under his shirt.

871
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:41,134
You sneaked a peek at the muscles under his shirt?

872
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,829
What about his organs? I hope he's not missing any.

873
00:53:44,175 --> 00:53:46,074
Goodness. Had you slept with him,

874
00:53:46,075 --> 00:53:48,369
you would've died from a heart attack on the spot.

875
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:51,980
- I want to sleep with him. - Gosh, you're crazy.

876
00:53:53,385 --> 00:53:55,679
He grabbed my wrist.

877
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:57,679
Do you know what I heard at that moment?

878
00:53:58,684 --> 00:54:01,119
The cracking sound in my knee joint.

879
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:03,753
Start getting cartilage injections instead of Botox.

880
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,259
We should be starting, at our age.

881
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:07,690
At that moment, I was really terrified.

882
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:10,090
I thought to myself, "I am getting old."

883
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:13,759
You know, before I get any older,

884
00:54:14,164 --> 00:54:18,844
I want to meet someone who truly loves me...

885
00:54:18,845 --> 00:54:21,139
and cuddle with him.

886
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:24,739
Only then will I feel less sorry for myself.

887
00:54:26,084 --> 00:54:27,310
So my point is,

888
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:31,279
I'm going to sleep with that guy.

889
00:54:31,354 --> 00:54:33,953
I will sleep with him, no matter what.

890
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:37,250
Gosh, my goodness.

891
00:54:38,564 --> 00:54:40,364
I have to say, I envy you...

892
00:54:40,365 --> 00:54:43,134
for meeting someone who makes your heart flutter this much.

893
00:54:43,135 --> 00:54:46,304
Hey, that's a dangerous remark. You're married.

894
00:54:46,305 --> 00:54:48,904
Gosh. My husband is just like a family member.

895
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:50,074
Once you're married, it all goes away.

896
00:54:50,075 --> 00:54:51,944
Marriage doesn't make your heart flutter.

897
00:54:51,945 --> 00:54:53,904
It makes you lonely, even when you're with your husband.

898
00:54:53,905 --> 00:54:57,570
So enjoy while you can.

899
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:09,949
Seoul

900
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:16,833
Ms. Ha, that was amazing!

901
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:17,994
Shin Yoo Jung was such a good call.

902
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:19,833
You deserve to be promoted to the managing director!

903
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,703
- Take us out for dinner. - Amazing job!

904
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:22,829
Congratulations.

905
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:36,054
Material rewards that I can see and hold...

906
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:38,549
excite me way more...

907
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:40,449
than men do.

908
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:41,949
You're so materialistic.

909
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:45,060
Those who say that happiness can't be bought with money...

910
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:47,989
are usually poor.

911
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:49,630
You heartless girl.

912
00:55:49,794 --> 00:55:51,529
Men and love...

913
00:55:52,405 --> 00:55:56,130
To me, it's nothing more than my hormones tricking me.

914
00:55:57,975 --> 00:55:59,773
This is so sad.

915
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:01,810
Hey, I only have few years.

916
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:05,143
I have to get a promotion,

917
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:06,480
or I'm finished.

918
00:56:09,314 --> 00:56:11,654
When I was in my 20s, I was jobless.

919
00:56:11,655 --> 00:56:13,884
I'm in my 30s now, and I still don't own a home.

920
00:56:13,885 --> 00:56:15,623
And now that I'm almost 40,

921
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:17,119
I feel like I have no future.

922
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:20,259
Life is so messed up.

923
00:56:22,495 --> 00:56:24,230
Ever since my fatigue...

924
00:56:24,765 --> 00:56:27,929
started to overcome my pheromones,

925
00:56:29,274 --> 00:56:32,469
I have not been able to let my heart flutter.

926
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:42,880
Kim Min Jung, Hwang Jung Won

927
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:49,619
Na Ri.

928
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:52,460
Did we receive the sample of the other colour for the main piece?

929
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:54,224
We have to get the catalogues out to the shops...

930
00:56:54,225 --> 00:56:55,864
when everyone's still talking about Shin Yoo Jung,

931
00:56:55,865 --> 00:56:57,529
so we should get things done quickly today.

932
00:56:58,564 --> 00:56:59,699
Ms. Ha.

933
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:02,429
About the photographer. What happened?

934
00:57:02,905 --> 00:57:04,170
What about the photographer?

935
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:17,079
Mr. Yoon Jae Guk. What are you doing here?

936
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:20,049
Why? Is something wrong?

937
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:23,549
No, it's not that.

938
00:57:23,995 --> 00:57:27,090
I'm doing the photoshoot for the catalogue today.

939
00:57:44,414 --> 00:57:45,540
By any chance,

940
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:49,409
do you know Yoon Soo Wan?

941
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:54,920
Do you know him?

942
00:58:09,975 --> 00:58:11,869
Yoon Soo Wan

943
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:20,739
I had forgotten about him.

944
00:58:22,655 --> 00:58:24,509
I thought I had forgotten all about him.

945
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:30,049
But here I am, hearing his name again.

946
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:32,090
Yes, I do.

947
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:37,489
How do you know him?

948
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:42,270
The passionate days of my youth.

949
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:47,139
And the name that has withered away.

950
00:58:50,015 --> 00:58:52,380
The name that I must let go,

951
00:58:53,385 --> 00:58:56,009
but still can't.

952
00:58:57,655 --> 00:58:58,920
So I'm...

953
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:00,920
I'm still...

954
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:05,360
trying to break up with him.

955
00:59:57,515 --> 01:00:00,543
Now, We Are Breaking Up

956
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:02,583
May I ask you how you know him?

957
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:05,384
May I ask you why I must answer this question?

958
01:00:05,385 --> 01:00:07,483
That "Mr. Paris" was J?

959
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:08,619
An interview?

960
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:12,820
She is that Ha Young Eun.

961
01:00:13,164 --> 01:00:14,724
Why did I come back?

962
01:00:14,725 --> 01:00:16,029
He knows Soo Wan?

963
01:00:16,635 --> 01:00:18,159
- What? - How does he know him?

964
01:00:18,704 --> 01:00:20,304
What was it that I really wanted to ask?

965
01:00:20,305 --> 01:00:22,873
This photographer only works with high-end brands.

966
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:23,933
At 3pm, the day after tomorrow.

967
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:25,503
You don't seem too inclined.

968
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:26,773
This is not necessary.

969
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:28,444
"The future"? Do you mean...

970
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:29,913
People copy designs all the time but...

971
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:31,444
Ha Young Eun!

972
01:00:31,445 --> 01:00:33,543
I'll find out what happened.

973
01:00:33,544 --> 01:00:34,679
I'm sorry.

974
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:35,914
Take care of it.

975
01:00:35,915 --> 01:00:38,384
If he finds out that you went on the blind date instead of me...

976
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,683
Young Eun!

977
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:40,853
We'll both get in trouble.

978
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:43,250
Bring Jae Guk inside.

979
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:45,623
I've worked hard to build my career, so I must protect it.

980
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:47,864
You seem very enthused all of a sudden.

981
01:00:47,865 --> 01:00:50,060
I'm intrigued. There's something I need to find out.

982
01:00:51,595 --> 01:00:53,003
Was it just an uncomfortable misunderstanding?

983
01:00:53,004 --> 01:00:55,304
- The time we spent together. - It was just a happening.

984
01:00:55,305 --> 01:00:56,974
Was that the case with Yoon Soo Wan too?

985
01:00:56,975 --> 01:01:00,270
Aren't you curious how I know him?
