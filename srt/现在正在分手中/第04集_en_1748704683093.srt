00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,801
Now, We Are Breaking Up

2
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,420
Soo Wan

3
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,920
Hello?

4
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,461
Soo Wan?

5
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,041
What's wrong? Are you okay?

6
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,610
Soo Wan.

7
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,280
What do you mean?

8
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,730
Hey.

9
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,600
Soo Wan!

10
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,681
Yoon Soo Wan.

11
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,681
What's your relationship with him?

12
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,850
He's my brother.

13
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,030
And...

14
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,831
he died ten years ago.

15
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,570
Seoul, 10 years ago

16
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,771
That day ten years ago,

17
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,070
he died.

18
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,260
What have I been...

19
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,530
holding on to all this time?

20
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,600
Fabric Sample, Blouse for SS Seoul Fashion Week

FW 2020, October Colour Map

23
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,811
What did I...

24
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,311
try so hard...

25
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,741
to forget?

26
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,790
What did I hate...

27
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,551
and resent so much...

28
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,590
that I'm now left with nothing...

29
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,570
but this feeling of emptiness and despondency?

30
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:37,740
"Those who love you will stay, and those who don't will leave,"

31
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,510
"so don't sweat it." by Vivienne Westwood

32
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,351
Now, We Are Breaking Up

33
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,820
Episode 4

34
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,629
Despite her efforts...

35
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,640
to fight the copies with the original design,

36
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,000
the results are pretty disastrous.

37
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,269
They even hired Mr. J, a top-tier photographer,

38
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,611
to elevate the brand image,

39
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,981
but it didn't help the sales at all.

40
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,579
Sono is still one of the top fashion brands,

41
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,550
but the brand's popularity has been on the decline...

42
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:20,721
with no signs of improvement for two years.

43
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,791
What's going on with the revamp plan for the retail floors?

44
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,690
Here's the plan, ma'am.

45
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,531
We'll be moving some of the brands based on their sales numbers.

46
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,960
Let's move all the domestic brands including Sono...

47
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,031
to Zone B on the third floor.

48
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:40,101
Domestic brands have lost their competitive edge.

49
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,170
Give prominence to newly launched, rising international brands.

50
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:45,770
I want you to completely redo the floor plan, Mr. Jung.

51
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,741
That's it for today's meeting.

52
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,111
Take responsibility?

53
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,051
By submitting a written apology? That won't do.

54
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,649
We're about to get pushed out to the third floor...

55
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,460
after being in Zone A on the 2nd floor for 8 years.

56
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,629
The location of your shop indicates how influential your brand is.

57
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,460
At this rate, the brand reputation will take a big hit in no time.

58
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,801
If that happens, the brand will go out of business!

59
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,801
You just didn't want to lose.

60
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:13,269
That's why you kept being stubborn.

61
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,270
Now, look at the mess you dragged us into!

62
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,481
Do you think saying "I'm sorry" will cut it?

64
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,320
I apologize.

65
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,231
Are you going through something these days?

66
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,199
Me? Not really.

67
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,560
I just want to...

68
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,600
find my better half and settle down as soon as possible.

69
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,301
That's all I'm thinking about these days.

70
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,639
You've dealt with other brands copying your design in the past.

71
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,041
Why are you so upset over nothing? This is very unlike you.

72
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,281
If only you were that attentive to your own children.

74
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,890
There's nothing more foolish than dwelling on what's already done.

75
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:06,890
Just shake it off and move on.

76
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,830
Get Claire Marie to sign a licensing agreement with us...

77
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,090
and spearhead the project.

78
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,161
This is not something I decided to do on a whim.

79
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,640
Imported brands outdoing domestic brands at department stores...

80
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,971
is nothing new.

81
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,640
We should get with the times.

82
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:26,439
Then what about Sono?

83
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,681
Why are you all quiet?

84
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,481
Well understood, sir.

85
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,150
What about Sono, Dad? What's going to happen to Sono?

86
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,551
Young Eun, you explain it to her.

87
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:41,590
What's my dad saying?

88
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,690
He's saying Claire Marie is probably the best international brand...

89
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,700
that would appeal to Sono's customer base.

90
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:50,270
And he wants me to spearhead this project.

91
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,731
Right. If you do that, then what will happen to Sono?

92
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,041
Don't tell me we're getting rid of Sono.

93
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,181
I have to visit our shop at Hills to check the display.

94
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,920
As you know, everything Han So Hye wears sells out.

95
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,689
After each episode airs,

96
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,760
we'll promote the pieces through blogs and social media,

97
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,960
along with info on the prices and where to buy them.

98
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,161
Great.

99
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,660
They'll appear in Episode 4 and 6.

100
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,630
Confirm it again with the production company.

101
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:25,100
The director changed his number. Do you have it?

102
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,301
Hold on.

103
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:28,739
Honey, take me out for lunch.

104
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,340
Honey, take me out for lunch.

105
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,181
I'm craving dumplings.

106
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,011
Mr. Seok.

107
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,311
Let's grab a quick lunch together on our way back.

108
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,819
You and Ms. Seo can go ahead.

109
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,190
I still need to check a few things.

110
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,891
Then we'll see you back in the office.

111
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,531
I kindly sent three heart emojis for a change. What's with him?

112
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,240
Let's be honest with our feelings.

113
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,640
Why... What are you doing?

114
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,051
Let's stop trying...

115
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,319
to suppress our desires.

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
What...

117
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,090
Hold on.

118
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,820
Wait...

119
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,360
No, wait.

120
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,141
Hello, Director Hwang Chi Sook.

121
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,609
How's it going?

122
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,440
I'm here for my monthly meeting with The One.

123
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,380
Why are you telling me all this? And what's with this manly demeanour?

124
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,610
Well, anyway... Bye.

125
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,280
Why are you saying bye already?

126
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,421
I'm just getting started now.

127
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,219
Why are you being like this?

128
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,651
This is where you work.

129
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,460
My gosh. What are you doing?

130
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,891
I was going to call you anyway.

131
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,931
I should explain what happened and apologize.

132
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:05,470
Well, although you could've done it sooner,

133
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,200
I totally understand.

134
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,000
I never talk about anything that happens...

135
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,271
under the influence of alcohol...

136
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,171
because that's what a gentleman should do.

137
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,811
You've been drinking?

138
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,641
Sorry?

139
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,010
I'd like to meet with Mr. Yoon Jae Guk.

140
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,280
It's only right that...

141
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:21,850
I apologize to him in person for the interview getting cancelled.

142
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,791
- That's it? - What else?

143
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,190
Do you see a dermatologist regularly?

144
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,931
Yes, all the time. Why do you ask?

145
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,100
I was wondering if you ate the numbing cream too.

146
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:35,130
What is this? A quiz?

147
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,230
Forget it, if you don't remember what happened.

148
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,501
All right. I'll let him know.

149
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
And I'm okay.

150
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,311
I'm really okay. I mean it.

151
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,291
Is Ms. Ha doing well?

152
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,100
You're staying longer than I thought.

153
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,070
Yes, some stuff happened.

154
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:14,440
- Why did you want to see me? - Do you have a job for me?

155
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:15,940
I think I'll be staying here...

156
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,470
for quite a while this time.

157
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:20,911
Because of a woman?

158
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,210
Yes.

159
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:31,590
Who?

160
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,560
Go through the pieces...

161
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,229
that need to be taken off display with the manager.

162
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,800
And we'll have to hang everything again.

163
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,040
But before you do that, make sure you take photos of everything.

164
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,100
Got it.

165
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,180
Na Ri, go through the pieces...

166
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,850
that need to be taken off display with the manager.

167
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,950
You already said that a moment ago.

168
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,350
- Are you all right? - Yes, of course.

169
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,381
Ms. Ha is acting strange, don't you think?

170
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:37,920
The shop is being pushed out to the third floor,

171
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:40,660
and the higher-ups are pressuring her about the licensing deal.

172
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,061
No wonder she's all over the place.

173
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,261
It'd be weirder if she weren't acting strange.

174
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,141
- We'll have to wait and see. - Yes.

175
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,110
Director Hwang said Ms. Ha is doing well.

176
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:19,031
Hey, cholesterol is your enemy once you reach middle age.

177
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,300
Anyway, Cookie. Why did you want to know how Ms. Ha was doing?

178
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:28,740
I wonder why.

179
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,910
Yes, she's a pretty good catch.

180
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:35,209
I've known her for almost eight years,

181
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,281
but I've never once heard rumours about her dating anyone.

182
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,320
Cookie, how did you fall for a lady who's so hard to get?

183
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,489
Hey, I suggest we eat separately from now on.

184
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,459
Your instant noodles are stinking up the entire room,

185
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,220
and I'd kill for a bite.

186
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,730
- About Sono... - What about Sono?

187
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,661
Are they struggling a lot because of the design theft?

188
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,730
Yes, I'm sure they are. The business must've taken a hit.

189
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:02,301
My poor Cookie. Are you worried about the brand she works for?

190
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,411
What? Are you not going to finish it?

191
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,979
Hey, you're very cynical when it comes to love.

192
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,210
When people like you fall in love, they fall hard, you know?

193
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,120
Yes.

194
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:17,291
But your feelings aren't something you can control.

195
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:18,791
Right.

196
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,990
What's with these prompt answers? My curiosity has been satisfied.

197
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,090
I'll eat this, then.

198
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,531
Food waste is a serious problem.

199
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,440
Hello, Ms. Min.

200
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,740
Yes. I happen to be with Jae Guk now.

201
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,881
Of course. Sure, just a moment.

202
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Seriously.

203
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Jae Guk's Mother

204
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:51,791
Hi.

205
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,489
Can you stop by in the evening if you're free?

206
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,661
I have something to tell you.

207
00:14:58,261 --> 00:14:59,291
Yes.

208
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,460
Is she talking to her son?

209
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:07,870
Hey, be good to your mother.

210
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:09,699
She was the one who arranged the blind date.

211
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,271
You see, that scale... That's love.

212
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,979
By the way, when will you move back home?

213
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,580
Have you ever lived with just your mother?

214
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,751
Hey, I like you.

215
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,949
If you're trying to say that you'll stay with me,

216
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,119
take that back.

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,820
Your feelings aren't something you can control.

218
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,690
Take me in.

219
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,500
Hey, not for some cup noodles!

220
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,671
Wait, Cookie!

221
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:53,820
Yoon Soo Wan.

222
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
Are you really sure he means...

223
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,320
nothing to you now?

224
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:25,181
- Be careful. - Okay.

225
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,421
Is Ms. Ha not feeling well today?

226
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:33,721
Sorry?

227
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,031
She's just going through a lot at the moment.

228
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,330
- Pass me a sewing pin. - Here.

229
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,170
Mi Sook

230
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,711
- All right. - Come and have a taste!

231
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,041
Come have a look!

232
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,579
Yes, enjoy.

233
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,310
These dumplings just came out of the steamer. Try one.

234
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,819
- I'm back again. - My gosh, thank you.

235
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,849
- Hello. - Which ones would you like?

236
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,320
I know you have a lot to deal with because of the design theft case,

237
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,760
but how could you neglect me like this?

238
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,120
You didn't even call me once.

239
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,061
I had a lot of things to take care of.

240
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,701
By the way, why did you want to come here out of the blue?

241
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,670
I had a sudden craving for these.

242
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,201
I was going to ask Soo Ho to bring me here,

243
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,110
but that jerk is ignoring my text when he's clearly read it.

244
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,409
- Enjoy. - Finally.

245
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,741
Hey, let's eat.

246
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,889
It's just what I needed.

247
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,930
Gosh, how do they taste exactly the same as they did ten years ago?

248
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,600
Well, I had a sudden craving for these because...

249
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,770
Never mind. I'll tell you when I know for sure.

250
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,441
Just wait. I'll find out before the end of the day.

251
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,051
What's wrong?

252
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:08,320
Is it too hot?

253
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,291
Hey, what is it?

254
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,761
Did something happen?

255
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:25,531
Mi Sook.

256
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,340
I can't believe I can eat now.

257
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:38,410
That I can actually...

258
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,551
swallow this dumpling.

259
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,150
Hey, what's wrong? What happened?

260
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:48,991
He...

261
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:50,561
He's dead.

262
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,360
Who?

263
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,600
Soo Wan.

264
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:03,811
That day,

265
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,241
on his way to see me,

266
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,580
he died.

267
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,691
Gosh, that fool.

268
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,160
Why? Why would he die?

269
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,231
Dumplings and Snack Food

270
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,711
I could order one for myself.

271
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,650
I can only eat a few spoonfuls. I have sensitive teeth.

272
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:23,951
Well, we've been in the same class for two months now,

273
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,751
and we haven't been able to chat.

274
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,660
So, what grade and class are you in?

275
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,501
- Pardon? - I'm Grade 6, Class 7.

276
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,129
Oh, then I'm one year younger.

277
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,301
Oh, well...

278
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,441
At our age, we can befriend people ten years above and below.

279
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,410
Speak casually.

280
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,610
Here.

281
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,750
Two years ago, my daughter paid a fortune...

282
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,311
and I got an implant.

283
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,580
So now I can eat things like this.

284
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,521
I see.

285
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:02,521
To be honest, we didn't do much for her.

286
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,531
My husband was a teacher his whole life,

287
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,230
so he doesn't know how things work,

288
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:12,971
and whenever he hears someone is suffering, he must help.

289
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:17,040
When she was studying abroad,

290
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,741
we were never able to send her any money.

291
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,540
Still, she got noticed early,

292
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,679
and a huge company offered her a scholarship.

293
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,579
She finished her studies there,

294
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,021
and now she's the head of a department at that company.

295
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,660
You raised her very well.

296
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,491
- Please, eat. - Okay.

297
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,531
Why waste money on coffee that never tastes any different?

298
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,099
It was getting frustrating, trying to keep up...

299
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,770
with the younger housewives in the group.

300
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:53,981
It's nice to finally meet a friend.

301
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,820
Director Hwang Chi Sook

302
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:07,991
Is Ms. Ha doing well?

303
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,370
Why?

304
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,170
What is it?

305
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,711
Ingo Maurer, Bang and Olufsen.

306
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:34,221
Gosh.

307
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,991
You and I have similar tastes.

308
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,491
That's it?

309
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,900
Don't get the scars wet.

310
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,241
Why is she making an appearance?

311
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,620
Oh. Well...

312
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,221
When we don't have business,

313
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,630
meeting twice a day is a bit much, I think.

314
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:18,790
You're leaving already?

315
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,300
Yes, my day is done, so that's the plan.

316
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:24,231
I must prepare dinner before my cohabitant returns.

317
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:25,630
You live with someone?

318
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,201
There's someone called Mr. J.

319
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,339
He forced himself in without my permission.

320
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,640
You live with him?

321
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,349
There's talk that Sono's struggling...

322
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,311
in Hills Department Store.

323
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,580
Did the other colour issue cause a very big problem?

324
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,890
No?

325
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,660
I think I know how you feel.

326
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,630
Shall we head somewhere quiet?

327
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:00,030
How do I feel?

328
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,701
And where do you mean by "somewhere quiet"?

329
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,680
Quite literally, somewhere quiet.

330
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:13,580
For example, your place?

331
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,329
We were planning on having a baby when our eldest starts school.

332
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,930
It's a planned pregnancy.

333
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,570
I'm older than average, so there are lots of tests, right?

334
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,330
- Take a seat. - Okay.

335
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,701
Is the amniotic fluid test a must?

336
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,041
Insurance covers it, right?

337
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,981
Did you have any other symptoms?

338
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:44,780
Well, I had bouts of indigestion,

339
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:46,710
and some nausea.

340
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:48,880
It was similar to when I had my eldest.

341
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:53,590
If you're pregnant, the blood test results...

342
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:56,160
show high levels of HCG.

343
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,291
Your HCG levels are average.

344
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,930
I don't see signs of conception in your uterus.

345
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,600
Oh. Is it because the pregnancy is in the early stages?

346
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,900
You are not pregnant.

347
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:25,620
I heard you'll handle the Claire Marie license.

348
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,860
Is that true?

349
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,231
It's on the board. That you're in charge of it.

350
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:35,400
Then what happens to us?

351
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,760
Is our team disbanding?

352
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:39,600
So Young. It takes a few minutes to reboot a PC, you know.

353
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,470
Sono was The One's main brand for ten years.

354
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,599
It won't disappear just like that.

355
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,810
Other companies got rid of the first brand they ever launched...

356
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,311
because sales were low.

357
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,441
Who says it won't happen to Sono?

358
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,149
A company's priority is always their sales.

359
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,481
And my last decision caused a huge drop in just that.

360
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,790
How can they get rid of Sono just because of that?

361
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,760
Sales have been declining over the past two years.

362
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:02,889
Still, it is the best brand in Korea.

363
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,630
No one stays on top forever.

364
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:06,160
Ms. Ha.

365
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,730
The company makes the final decision.

366
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:11,500
It's true that domestic brands are struggling.

367
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:14,839
We're designers, but we're also employees.

368
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,340
We should follow the company's decision.

369
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,741
And if they say they have no use for us,

370
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:22,840
do we just take the severance pay and leave quietly?

371
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,491
Go home. See you tomorrow.

372
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,221
How are you, Ms. Ha?

373
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,860
Are you all right?

374
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,031
Even if they dismiss Sono,

375
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,031
will you really...

376
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,830
be okay with that?

377
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:14,531
Why did I...

378
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,900
keep so much baggage?

379
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,600
Why was I unable to throw anything out?

380
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,880
Why did I keep everything?

381
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:32,051
It's not just you. That goes for me too.

382
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,850
That's how everyone lives.

383
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,320
Don't apologize.

384
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,590
Who else could you cry with?

385
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,761
Oh.

386
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,900
I'm with my husband.

387
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,240
He felt guilty for not buying me lunch.

388
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,610
He brought me out to dinner.

389
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,410
We're eating.

390
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:05,751
Yes, I'm really happy.

391
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,120
There's not much to be happy.

392
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:14,991
Every now and then, the three of us eat out and have fun.

393
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,031
That is happiness.

394
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,600
It's not morning sickness.

395
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,031
It could be nausea caused by something else.

396
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,771
What are you saying?

397
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,441
I see something on the sonogram.

398
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,041
It's not in the uterus,

399
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,051
but it looks pretty big.

400
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,319
You should go to a general hospital...

401
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,420
for a thorough checkup.

402
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,889
I have to go. The meat needs flipping.

403
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,390
I'll call you back.

404
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,830
Bye.

405
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,580
This isn't a job interview.

406
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:44,380
Relax. We're at your place.

407
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,680
This situation is so unfamiliar.

408
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,781
I hope you don't feel that way. We'll meet often from now on.

409
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:51,721
Why is that?

410
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,691
Because in the future...

411
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,761
What about the future?

412
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,231
We will become especially close.

413
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,531
- Why is that? - This is for your ears only.

414
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:08,670
J.

415
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,511
He's to be my fianc��.

416
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,640
So let's help each other out.

417
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,511
I saw into you.

418
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:21,481
You saw into me?

419
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,120
Since when did you have a crush on Young Eun?

420
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,760
- What? - I'll help you.

421
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:31,630
But when I do you a favour, you must do me one in return.

422
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,531
I expect an active and cooperative relationship.

423
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,339
Don't you usually offer a guest a drink or some fruit?

424
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,971
What? Oh, right.

425
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,811
Can I look around?

426
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,031
His blind date in Busan was Director Hwang?

427
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:13,501
But Cookie has fallen for Ms. Ha.

428
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,001
And she...

429
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,110
It's Jae Guk, not me.

430
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,670
Colour, composition.

431
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,441
Totally fabulous.

432
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,051
Why did he take her photo?

433
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,600
What are you doing?

434
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:23,771
Director Hwang?

435
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,011
I didn't see anything.

436
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,680
What?

437
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,849
I was not in this room,

438
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,021
and I did not come here today.

439
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,890
Then for whom did I brew coffee?

440
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,531
She was already hard to get used to,

441
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,829
and today wasn't much different.

442
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,441
What did she see that...

443
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:02,781
Oh, Cookie. Do you have something raunchy on your laptop?

444
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,211
Is that it?

445
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,350
She saw it. She saw the photos.

446
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:13,619
She's hurt.

447
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,920
She got hurt.

448
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:19,660
Director Hwang Chi Sook

449
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,001
What would I say?

450
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,001
I feel for her.

451
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:32,011
Why do I feel for her?

452
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:36,380
I do feel for her.

453
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:42,150
- Ha Young Eun. - Can't you ring the bell at least?

454
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,050
There's something you didn't tell me, isn't there?

455
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,620
- What are you on about? - You, in Busan.

456
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:51,461
What's all this?

457
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,490
I'm cleaning out my past.

458
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,401
You're really going to Claire Marie?

459
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,171
I was told to.

460
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:04,910
You really are all about survival.

461
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,810
Coffee?

462
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,311
Hot or cold?

463
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:11,009
It's the brand you created.

464
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,211
How can you ditch it like it's nothing?

465
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,620
Sono brought you glory.

466
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,349
And now it's falling?

467
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,920
You've got a license brand now,

468
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,021
and you think it'll give you a few more years?

469
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,421
Are you okay with that?

470
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,160
Can you be okay with that?

471
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,330
No, I'm not okay.

472
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,160
How could I be okay?

473
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,369
For the past ten years, I ran around,

474
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,700
plucking corns out of my feet.

475
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,299
I felt like I was being put through a wringer every day,

476
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,541
but I persisted until I was totally exhausted.

477
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,481
I did everything I could the best I could.

478
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:45,579
I put my whole life into it, so how could I be okay?

479
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,510
Do I look okay to you?

480
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,691
You've been tenacious? Was that it?

481
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,120
What?

482
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,421
You enjoyed it too.

483
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,791
You had fun.

484
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,299
We met in high school 20 years ago.

485
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,429
I know you well enough.

486
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,131
You won't do anything you don't want to do.

487
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,341
Don't brag.

488
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,240
Without Sono, you wouldn't be where you are now.

489
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:13,740
Do you know that?

490
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Oh my goodness.

491
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,100
Why did I get worked up?

492
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,430
I came to ask about her and Cookie.

493
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,501
I lost my chance.

494
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,470
Again.

495
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
"Sono"?

496
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:21,780
It's Latin. It means "echo".

497
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,139
I want my passion to echo.

498
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,450
Something like that. Isn't it cool?

499
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,620
- Echo? - That's what I decided on.

500
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,390
- What do you mean? - The name of my brand.

501
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,719
Wherever it may be,

502
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,591
the first brand I create will be called "Sono".

503
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,041
Why not stay at home if you'll be here for so long?

504
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:28,881
I'm working with Do Hoon.

505
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,381
And I get days and nights mixed up.

506
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:34,450
It's easier and more comfortable to live and work there.

507
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,651
How long will you stay this time?

508
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,251
A while.

509
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:41,720
Did you meet someone?

510
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,021
Yes.

511
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:49,030
Is it the young lady you met at the blind date?

512
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:50,930
No.

513
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,370
No?

514
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,600
We met by chance...

515
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,341
at a fashion show party.

516
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:03,410
Did you?

517
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,811
When will you introduce her to me?

518
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,381
I'm waiting for her right now.

519
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:12,421
When she makes up her mind,

520
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:15,691
you can meet her then.

521
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,561
I see. Okay, then. Let's eat.

522
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Soo Wan?

523
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,321
What is it? Is something wrong?

524
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:25,461
What do you mean, Soo Wan?

525
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:26,961
Right now,

526
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:29,300
I'm on my way to see her.

527
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:36,341
Hey... Soo Wan.

528
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,001
Soo Wan!

529
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,651
Ha Young Eun

530
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,220
Ha Young Eun

531
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:57,291
Hey, Ms. Ha.

532
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,361
Where is...

533
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,731
Soo Wan?

534
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:19,680
RIP Yoon Soo Wan, Yoon Jin Woo and Min Hye Ok's son

535
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,001
I think I need to let her go.

536
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:38,469
What?

537
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,800
She has big dreams, and she's very talented.

538
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,240
She wants to achieve a lot of things here.

539
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,111
I bet a lot of companies want her too.

540
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,941
But I need to return to Korea.

541
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,450
Then let her decide.

542
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,381
Ask if she wants to come with you to Korea.

543
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,250
It's not for you to decide.

544
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:57,080
Mom isn't going to approve anyway.

545
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,990
I'd rather let her go...

546
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:01,760
than to make her go through all that trouble.

547
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,660
But you love her.

548
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,231
Mom was hurt,

549
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,030
and that put us through a lot.

550
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,541
It's between our parents. I don't really care.

551
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,341
I'm in a different situation, Jae Guk.

552
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,440
If she loves you, she will stay.

553
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:26,779
If she doesn't, she'll leave.

554
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:33,251
So don't get too attached.

555
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,861
Let her decide...

556
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,861
whether to end it or not.

557
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,530
If you love her.

558
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:47,401
If you love her.

559
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,521
Yoon Soo Wan rests here in peace.

560
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:10,890
Why did you tell me about Soo Wan?

561
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,530
Because it started to feel like it was more than a fling.

562
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:28,180
My love with Soo Wan lasted only for two months.

563
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:30,611
People might not understand...

564
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,611
why I think of it as such a big deal.

565
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:37,580
But time isn't proportional to love.

566
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:42,720
Back then, those two months meant enough for me...

567
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,691
to change my entire life.

568
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,861
It's all in the past.

569
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,100
Let's not...

570
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,501
try to do anything.

571
00:42:56,671 --> 00:43:00,370
I can't ignore the fact that Soo Wan was your brother.

572
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:12,050
So you're going to push me away...

573
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:16,821
just because you used to love my brother?

574
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,830
I'm not confident about my decisions.

575
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:28,671
There was once when I made a choice based on my heart and not my head,

576
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,341
and that was Soo Wan.

577
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:33,171
And after that,

578
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,640
everything became a mess.

579
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:37,711
I'm not him.

580
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,080
The same choice could lead to different results.

581
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:45,550
Maybe...

582
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,220
if I was 20 years old,

583
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:51,191
I might've done so.

584
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,259
But I'm 38 now,

585
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,361
so I don't see the point in becoming miserable again.

586
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,941
Experience is the most rational advice.

587
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,651
Today, I didn't come here with Yoon Jae Guk.

588
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,361
I came with Yoon Soo Wan's little brother.

589
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,961
Thank you.

590
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,401
I'll leave on my own.

591
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,521
You asked for me, sir?

592
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:30,490
Good morning, Young Eun. Long time no see.

593
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,361
When did you get here?

594
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,271
You asked for me, sir?

595
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:43,430
Good morning, Young Eun. Long time no see.

596
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:46,501
When did you get here?

597
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:48,279
I came back two weeks ago.

598
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,881
I safely went through quarantine and got released yesterday.

599
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:53,120
I asked him to come back.

600
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,890
Oh, I see.

601
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,691
I noticed Hwang Chi Sook is still the head designer.

602
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,790
Why can't you just be honest?

603
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,390
Everyone knows that you're pretty much in charge.

604
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,029
Overall, we also reflected Director Hwang's opinions.

605
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,731
Where? Where can I see that?

606
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:11,800
I can't find it anywhere.

607
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:15,869
Young Eun, you're a good liar.

608
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,041
If you're going to work here, call her by her title.

609
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:22,750
I still want to be free, but my dad agreed...

610
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:25,620
to let me work with you.

611
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,550
I hope we work together for as long as possible.

612
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,520
I let that rascal loose for way too long.

613
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:34,930
He'll be joining Claire Marie. I want you to teach him well.

614
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,700
- So he's officially an employee? - Yes, that's right.

615
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,271
Breaking news. The Hwang siblings are both working at our company now.

616
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,639
Ms. Ha will be training him,

617
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,850
and he's going to be in the Claire Marie License Team.

618
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:58,151
She's already cleaning after Director Hwang's mess.

619
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,550
But now, even her little brother?

620
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,250
It's like getting pregnant with a second baby...

621
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,751
as soon as your first child starts going to school.

622
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,791
What's going to happen to us?

623
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,660
Say hello, everyone. This is Hwang Chi Hyung.

624
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,829
She's Nam Na Ri working in the Design Team.

625
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,401
That's An Sun Ju, and she's Jung So Young, our youngest member.

626
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,740
I look forward to working with you all.

627
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,041
By the way,

628
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:28,280
are we still working for Sono or Claire Marie license team?

629
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,981
I'd like to know what my exact job is.

630
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,550
You want to keep Sono?

631
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,091
I created that brand.

632
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:42,390
I can't just put it aside and let someone else get rid of the brand...

633
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,061
just because it's not doing as well as it used to.

634
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,830
If I must work with Chi Hyung,

635
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:52,700
I'd like to keep Sono instead of switching to Claire Marie.

636
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:57,980
Is that okay, sir?

637
00:47:57,981 --> 00:48:00,080
I wasn't just being tenacious.

638
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:05,421
Sono was my dream, future,

639
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:07,751
and youth.

640
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,360
I know we don't get any recognition...

641
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:13,791
even though we spend all year making clothes for each season.

642
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,960
But that doesn't mean it's all meaningless.

643
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,401
So I should deal with it.

644
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,771
Ms. Ha.

645
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:25,071
You will all be free to choose.

646
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,211
Feel free to switch to the license brand team.

647
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:30,270
Sono will only last for two more seasons at most.

648
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:32,540
In the end, we'll have to purchase licensing rights...

649
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,349
and use the labels from foreign companies...

650
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,981
in order to increase our sales.

651
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,321
Forget it. I choose to stay.

652
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,190
Back when I was in college, I worked part-time for months...

653
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:44,719
just so I could buy an outfit from Sono,

654
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,890
and I got a job here hoping I'd get to design something great myself.

655
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:52,699
We're going to have to minimize our marketing fees...

656
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,299
and wait for our turn for manufacturing.

657
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,400
We'll be told to lower the costs that go into subsidiary materials,

658
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,000
and using Italian fabric will be out of the question.

659
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:01,710
We'll have fewer stores,

660
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:04,111
and our brand will get sent to an outlet store.

661
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,111
Instead, can we do everything we want?

662
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,409
There are so many things I wanted to try but couldn't.

663
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,179
Now that the brand is eventually going to disappear,

664
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,090
can I stop worrying about sales and what the higher-ups will think?

665
00:49:14,091 --> 00:49:16,651
Can I make what I've always wanted to make...

666
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:18,591
during the remaining seasons?

667
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,861
I also choose to stay.

668
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:24,100
Instead, give me a bigger role.

669
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:26,159
I'd rather work here and gain more experience...

670
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,600
than transfer somewhere else.

671
00:49:30,841 --> 00:49:32,771
Hey, Rookie.

672
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,611
What? Are you talking to me?

673
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,740
I'm going to be your immediate supervisor starting today.

674
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,510
Is that okay, Ms. Ha?

675
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,720
- How much do you know about fabric? - Fabric?

676
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,190
I don't know much about fabric.

677
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:49,450
But I do know a popular boutique.

678
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:54,791
I need to go now. I have a meeting regarding subsidiary materials.

679
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:56,291
Bye.

680
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,780
But you see, Mi Sook.

681
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,990
Let me tell you something.

682
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:23,550
To be honest,

683
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:27,890
in that very moment,

684
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,530
I felt worried.

685
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,001
When I heard that Soo Wan...

686
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:36,501
was his older brother,

687
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,671
I was worried because of how I felt...

688
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:44,780
toward him.

689
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,450
What am I going to do now?

690
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,930
What's there to think about? It's a good thing.

691
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:03,961
Let's just end it here.

692
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,430
I did the right thing.

693
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,691
You can choose what's going to happen to us.

694
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,490
Whether or not we're going to keep seeing each other.

695
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,401
Yes.

696
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:15,600
That's all up to you.

697
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,600
But...

698
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:24,111
answer me this.

699
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,050
Did you...

700
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,220
miss me?

701
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,930
How much should I tell her?

702
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,679
Yes, I'm about to leave.

703
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,860
What about the student recommendation letter for Le Vin?

704
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:12,820
Just write whatever you wish and send it over.

705
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:14,730
Me?

706
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:17,429
What should I write?

707
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,759
My goodness.

708
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,469
Don't ask me to deal with that too. I already have enough on my plate.

709
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:26,469
Just write whatever and come back as soon as possible.

710
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,571
This is driving me crazy.

711
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,771
I hope one day, your passion becomes a "sono."

712
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,611
You're still here.

713
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,381
- Don't you have a shoot today? - Yes, I need to get going.

714
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,920
- Can you... - What?

715
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:16,591
give this to someone on my behalf?

716
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,361
The name and school are written right there.

717
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,760
- Do me a favour. - Oh, okay.

718
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:29,231
Don't be late. Make sure you give it to her.

719
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,470
It's really important to that student. Okay?

720
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,271
Okay, go on.

721
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:35,311
Thank you.

722
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:36,311
Sure.

723
00:55:02,771 --> 00:55:04,541
Excuse me.

724
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:06,940
I'm looking for someone.

725
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:09,341
Her name is Ha Young Eun.

726
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,680
Ha Young Eun.

727
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,910
Ha Young Eun is right here.

728
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:26,021
Hello.

729
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:29,260
I'm Yoon Soo Wan.

730
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,571
How we missed each other...

731
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,680
from the very beginning.

732
00:56:14,811 --> 00:56:16,211
How much is that?

733
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,520
Someone bought it? Who?

734
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,260
Just some lady.

735
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,140
And we slid by each other...

736
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:49,171
without being able to meet...

737
00:56:50,341 --> 00:56:51,841
so many times.

738
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:03,521
By any chance,

739
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,591
is it Ha Young Eun?

740
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,231
- Jae Guk. - Yoo Jung.

741
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:12,700
I know what you're going to say.

742
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,501
But Soo Wan...

743
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:16,631
is no longer here.

744
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:20,700
How long it took...

745
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,981
for us to finally meet each other.

746
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:28,981
But forget about all that.

747
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:31,921
I just need to know this.

748
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,180
Answer me this.

749
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,091
Did you...

750
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,361
miss me?

751
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:49,771
I...

752
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:53,941
missed you.

753
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,001
Now, We Are Breaking Up

754
00:58:58,571 --> 00:58:59,599
Are we doing things differently?

755
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,771
Let's maintain Sono's identity and keep things classic.

756
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:03,710
Don't mess with it.

757
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:06,009
We're not machines. We at least need a month.

758
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,210
That's going to Claire Marie.

759
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,810
I'm no longer going to go easy on you.

760
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,579
So you can try to beat me without my help.

761
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,680
Do you mean that?

762
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,719
Is it really okay if I beat you?

763
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,049
Cookie, you finally got some work.

764
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,720
Mr. J agreed to collaborate with us.

765
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,929
It's due tomorrow, right?

766
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,929
I'm worried he might invest and lose his entire severance pay.

767
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,199
I only have one child.

768
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,230
I asked you to check on your dad.

769
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,440
Police

770
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:32,699
- Dad. - By any chance,

771
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,969
do you guys know each other?

772
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,009
- No. - Yes.

773
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,710
- Hey. - Who is that?

774
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:40,139
He's the photographer who will be collaborating with Claire Marie.

775
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,150
Jae Guk.

776
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:43,509
I'm not going to let the past bother me.

777
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,950
What matters is the future.

778
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,751
I already have feelings for another woman.

779
00:59:49,321 --> 00:59:51,360
Jae Guk is seeing someone.

780
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:53,320
Have you met her?

781
00:59:53,321 --> 00:59:55,960
It's the first time he's ever talked to me about a girl.

782
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:57,091
It's time you change...

783
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,300
the wallpaper on your phone.

784
01:00:07,678 --> 01:00:15,139
