1
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,763
Should we...

2
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:44,903
go to Paris?

3
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:51,002
To a place where no one knows us.

4
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,412
No family...

5
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,082
or friends.

6
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,052
Somewhere where there is no one...

7
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:04,153
who'd stick their nose into our business.

8
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:06,552
Should we go to a place...

9
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:13,532
where it's just the two of us?

10
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,603
If I can't overcome it,

11
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:27,343
I'll try once more.

12
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:45,592
If I can't go any further,

13
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,133
I'll take one more step.

14
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:09,112
We happened to meet...

15
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,152
and fall in love,

16
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:15,392
but if we're not allowed to love here because of our situation,

17
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:19,332
let's leave.

18
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:25,663
We should just leave.

(Jangseo Group Sold)

28
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:03,607
(I heard The One is the other company.)

29
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,107
(That'd mean they're giving up on the fashion business.)

30
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,313
(Will The One really be bought out?)

31
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,287
(It is highly likely that The One...)

32
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,112
(will sell its fashion business department...)

33
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,817
What? An interview?

(Episode 12)

35
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,697
Are you really looking for another job?

36
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:23,022
But I won't leave until I get paid at the end of the month.

37
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:26,836
They'll give us better offers if we both come.

38
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:30,467
Hey, what if Ms. Ha hears about this?

39
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,503
Who do you think she'll side with?

40
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:35,603
Us? Or Director Hwang and her family?

41
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,347
Still, this is wrong, Sun Ju.

42
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,746
You're stabbing her in the back.

43
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:41,477
We're the ones who got stabbed in the back.

44
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:44,486
We were counting on Ms. Ha, but we're about to lose our jobs.

45
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:47,113
It'll be pointless to blame her after we become jobless.

46
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:49,756
They just want to see our portfolios. That's all.

47
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:52,282
Let's include the designs we did for La Fayere.

48
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:54,852
They're our designs anyway.

49
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,203
Any word from La Fayere?

50
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:09,703
No. Nothing yet.

51
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:14,642
You two. What were you doing?

52
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,013
Well, the thing is...

53
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,657
We can't focus on work...

54
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:22,886
because we have no idea what's happening with the company.

55
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,657
I read an article this morning that Jangseo Group has been sold.

56
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,392
Rumors are rampant...

57
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,926
that The One is probably the next one to be bought out.

58
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:30,927
So?

59
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:33,767
Ms. Oh In A is taking sick leave for uterine fibroids.

60
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:36,133
She's taking time off to do as many job interviews as possible.

61
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,066
The company isn't telling us anything,

62
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,936
but all sorts of rumors are going around,

63
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,243
so we can't help but be worried.

64
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:46,813
So? We haven't heard from La Fayere yet?

65
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,816
Even if we hear from them,

66
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:50,986
we can't finish it by the one-month deadline...

67
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:53,212
because we've wasted too much time already.

68
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,256
It's just not doable.

69
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:57,527
You won't be affected whether or not the company gets sold...

70
00:04:57,528 --> 00:05:00,592
because Director Hwang and President Hwang will take care of you.

71
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,292
But our situation is different.

72
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:04,623
Should we go to Paris?

73
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:06,863
We need to figure out a way to survive.

74
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:09,193
It's not like you'll take care of us.

75
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,563
Should we go to a place where it's just the two of us?

76
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,673
We need their answer by today. Try to rush them again.

77
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:22,246
- Ms. Ha. - I guess...

78
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,712
it's easy for you guys to give up,

79
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,152
but I can't give up.

80
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:28,587
Whether you have interviews lined up or have to prepare your portfolio,

81
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,482
I understand you need to figure out a way to survive,

82
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:33,453
so that's fine. I won't say anything about that.

83
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,662
But make sure you get your job done.

84
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:38,462
Do your best until your last day here.

85
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:59,212
Yes, a little pain won't hurt you. Pain makes you grow, if anything.

86
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,227
Thanks for making me coffee. You're all grown up now, Cookie.

87
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,626
How come you're heading out so late today?

88
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:07,327
I have a meeting at The One, so I'll go straight there.

89
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:10,563
Sounds like everyone there is stressed out right now.

90
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,433
Hey, Cookie. You've got a text.

91
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:17,306
(Hello, Mr. Yoon Jae Guk.)

92
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:20,037
(This is Frederic from Lavilles Real Estate.)

93
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,842
(I'm sending you the list of apartments in the Marais.)

94
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,212
Are you going back to Paris?

95
00:06:29,617 --> 00:06:32,113
- For good? - I haven't decided yet.

96
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,253
Is Ms. Ha going with you?

97
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,423
That's not decided yet either.

98
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,152
Sorry, just a moment.

99
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:42,623
Yes.

100
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,592
Looks like he really is going back to Paris.

101
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:01,013
Ms. Ha, we have the sample. I should do the fitting, right?

102
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,712
- What about La Fayere? - Nothing yet.

103
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,582
I see.

104
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:07,712
I'll go get ready.

105
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,323
Shouldn't you look for another job too?

106
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:21,732
Why should I? This is my job.

107
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,736
It seems like everyone else,

108
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:26,707
including Ms. Nam and Ms. An, is busy looking for a way to survive.

109
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,203
Hwang Chi Hyung.

110
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,107
You keep talking like we're friends.

111
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:31,746
Don't work too hard.

112
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,017
It's not always rewarding, you know.

113
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:37,142
I'm not doing this for the company. I'm just doing my job.

114
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:40,287
I don't care whether or not the company gets sold.

115
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:42,753
I don't care to know what the higher-ups are thinking.

116
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:47,753
Sono's 2022 SS collection is the only thing that matters to me.

117
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,866
Whether we go to La Fayere or not.

118
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,623
Korea or Paris, it doesn't matter.

119
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:55,933
It'd be so rewarding to see someone wearing the shirt I designed.

120
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,533
What are you doing this evening?

121
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,077
I'll be busy, obviously.

122
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:04,943
- What about tomorrow? - Tomorrow too.

123
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,016
Hey, you're playing so hard to get.

124
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,872
Did you just call me "Hey"?

125
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:10,813
I mean, So Young.

126
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:14,053
Ms. Jung.

127
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,482
- Finish steaming that. - Okay.

128
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,122
Yes, ma'am.

129
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:29,033
- Shall we get started? - Yes.

130
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:31,203
Just a moment.

131
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,433
Yes, it's me.

132
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:37,847
Young Eun, your mom and I are going to court.

133
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,073
Keep that in mind.

134
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:50,453
Mom, what is this?

135
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:52,222
My lawyer told me to do it.

136
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:55,122
I was told to put everything in writing.

137
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,393
Your lawyer?

138
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,903
(Happy Law Office)

139
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,547
Well, shall we begin?

140
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:18,616
Sure.

141
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:21,512
Did your husband have an affair?

142
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,687
Does he become physically abusive when he drinks?

143
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:28,156
Has he never contributed financially during your marriage?

144
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:32,462
No, it's not that. I just don't want...

145
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,193
to live with him anymore.

146
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:37,803
You must prove that he's responsible for the breakdown of the marriage...

147
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:41,573
in order to make sure he'll be ordered to pay you alimony.

148
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:46,746
Alimony? You've got to be kidding me.

149
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:49,477
Fine. We can talk about this in the courtroom.

150
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:52,717
Let's see if the judge will take your side.

151
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,352
What did I even do? Why are you putting the blame on me?

152
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:00,893
"Throughout my marriage, I only ate hard-boiled rice,"

153
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:05,122
"but I prefer soft-boiled rice"?

154
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:06,967
You asked me...

155
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:09,433
why I was always putting water in my rice.

156
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,433
I did it because I couldn't swallow the rice.

157
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:14,832
So? That's no big deal. This is why you want a divorce?

158
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,472
"No big deal"?

159
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:20,916
Is everything I wrote just no big deal to you?

160
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,677
All these years, you said nothing.

161
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:24,347
Now that I'm old and retired,

162
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,882
you want to divorce me right away.

163
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,382
This makes me so angry. This house and my pension...

164
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,252
You're not getting a single penny!

165
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:35,423
Why? Why won't you give me any of it?

166
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:37,823
You're not getting anything. It's all mine!

167
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:42,563
I've done so much for you for the past 40 years.

168
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,933
Why are you saying I won't get a single penny?

169
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:47,403
I'm the one who earned the money, so it's mine!

170
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:51,002
Sure, you earned the money, but I was the one who saved it!

171
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,646
I cooked for you, did all the laundry,

172
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:54,547
and raised our child. I rightfully deserve half of...

173
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,313
It's not like I never worked and did nothing!

174
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:59,516
You stood surety multiple times and lost all our money.

175
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:02,053
- Enough. - You practically threw money away.

176
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,472
Once, we went to a couples' party.

177
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:28,212
And I heard my husband introduce me...

178
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:32,183
as his wife and Young Eun's mother.

179
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,582
I never once heard him say my name when introducing me.

180
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:41,252
For the past 40 years, I lived as a wife and a mother.

181
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:43,862
That's all I was, nothing else.

182
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,732
At the community center, I was asked to write down my specialties.

183
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:53,376
But I could only think of cooking, doing laundry, and cleaning.

184
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,033
Those are the only things I know how to do,

185
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:58,173
so I just left it blank.

186
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:00,913
The other ladies wrote...

187
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,283
things like arranging flowers and cross-stitching.

188
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,813
I noticed that they all had many hobbies.

189
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,982
The members of my kitty party group all wanted to go on a trip together.

190
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,423
But my husband said,

191
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,393
"You can't go. You have to cook for me."

192
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:21,033
"What would I eat before I go to work?"

193
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:26,163
So I told them I was busy and didn't go.

194
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:42,153
You can't afford a six-figure supercar.

195
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,227
Darn you. I'll get something when the company gets sold.

196
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,026
What have you done for the company?

197
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:49,352
You're a total newbie.

198
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,523
- What have you done? - I'm the general director.

199
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,536
Sure, you have that title,

200
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:56,563
but Young Eun is the one who does all the work.

201
00:12:57,007 --> 00:13:01,077
Anyway, you're not getting anything because I'm opening a boutique.

202
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,447
So just take good care of the car you have now.

203
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,506
A boutique?

204
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,347
As you know, shopping is my hobby and specialty.

205
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:09,443
I'll open a boutique that carries all the high-end designer brands.

206
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:10,448
I'll be a big buyer.

207
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,543
Who'd trust your taste though?

208
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:17,053
I may not be good at making things, but I have a good eye.

209
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:21,857
But you can't do anything without Young Eun.

210
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,663
You brat!

211
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,262
That's enough, both of you.

212
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:26,592
My gosh.

213
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,033
What brings you here?

214
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:30,433
Who is he?

215
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,276
I'm Seok Do Hoon, the CEO of Vision PR.

216
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:38,242
And I am Director Hwang Chi Sook's boyfriend.

217
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:40,746
Hey, are you losing your mind?

218
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:42,947
Dad wanted to have lunch with us. Why did you invite your boyfriend?

219
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,283
I didn't.

220
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:47,313
President Hwang invited me.

221
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:48,457
- My dad? - Dad invited you?

222
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,026
I happened to overhear your conversation...

223
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,886
while waiting for President Hwang outside.

224
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,323
And I must say, that was ridiculous.

225
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:56,393
So I had no choice but to step in like this.

226
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:57,828
What do you mean?

227
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,467
Rumors are rampant that The One might be bought out.

228
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:02,896
And the company owner's children are talking about...

229
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:05,433
opening a high-end clothing boutique and buying a supercar?

230
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,447
Think about how anxious the employees must be right now.

231
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,107
Some are worried about how they'd pay...

232
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:13,516
for their kids' education next month.

233
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,717
"How long will my severance pay last?"

234
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:15,776
"Will I manage to get a new job?"

235
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:17,616
Such worries are keeping your colleagues up at night.

236
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:21,012
Do you feel no sense of responsibility for these people?

237
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:24,923
I'm planning a fresh start so I can be responsible for my own life.

238
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:29,496
So you'll buy designer clothes with the money from selling the company?

239
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:30,666
Ms. Hwang Chi Sook.

240
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,736
Have you been keeping your title with that kind of mindset?

241
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,033
Yes, probably.

242
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,766
Company owners shouldn't only be concerned with their own survival.

243
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,207
Their job is to do their best...

244
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,276
to increase the value of the company and earn the employees' trust...

245
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,972
so that they'd want to stay.

246
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:47,547
That's why they get a huge office and a nice chair.

247
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:50,486
Because they must bear the weight of their responsibility.

248
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,116
You don't need to raise your voice.

249
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,482
My sister won't understand anyway.

250
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,482
You have no idea what he's saying.

251
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,882
Your sister? Who's your sister?

252
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,927
- Sorry? - Goodness.

253
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:04,227
Clearly, both of you have no manners...

254
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:06,092
and don't respect your elders.

255
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:09,063
You need to address her politely.

256
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:11,232
If you were my employee, I would teach you a lesson!

257
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,203
And if you were my little brother, I'd...

258
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,146
- Hey, look. - Don't call me like that.

259
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:19,276
I am Seok Do Hoon, the CEO of Vision PR.

260
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,717
Right, Mr. Seok.

261
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:22,173
Hands out of the pockets!

262
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:26,717
Don't forget. You need to be responsible!

263
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,813
Okay.

264
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,382
Hello, sir.

265
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:42,492
Hi, Dad.

266
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,063
Hello.

267
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:47,203
Sit down.

268
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,862
Good going.

269
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,077
Did I go through all that to raise you just to see this?

270
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,742
What kind of man cooks in the kitchen?

271
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,246
- Take off that apron at once. - Calm down, Mom. Please.

272
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:28,317
What is this? My goodness.

273
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,472
Mom.

274
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:34,183
Honey.

275
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:37,453
Were you sleeping?

276
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,292
Hello, Mother.

277
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,626
Why didn't you call us?

278
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,322
I couldn't because I ran here, flabbergasted.

279
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:48,363
I nearly fainted twice today.

280
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,232
I called Soo Ho at work because I was in the area.

281
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:53,532
And what? He quit?

282
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,237
I ran here, wondering if he fell ill or something.

283
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,173
And my dear son is cooking in the kitchen...

284
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,373
while you take your nap?

285
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:02,646
Mom, let me explain.

286
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,787
Mi Sook is not feeling well. That's why I was...

287
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,913
You always whine about not feeling well.

288
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:10,757
What a way to discourage and bring down...

289
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,752
- your hardworking husband. - Mom.

290
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,893
My son has gained nothing from this marriage.

291
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,866
You don't work.

292
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,297
And it's not like your family...

293
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,302
gave you guys money so you could get a bigger place.

294
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:25,837
Mom, please leave.

295
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,277
She's really ill. Don't be like this, please!

296
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,443
Let go.

297
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,443
I didn't accept it.

298
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:35,113
My mom offered me her retirement savings...

299
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:37,116
because she wanted to help us buy a house.

300
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:38,643
How could I accept that?

301
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:40,913
Soo Ho and I are adults. And we're married,

302
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:44,557
so we should stand on our own two feet now.

303
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:46,153
That's why you made him quit his job...

304
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,257
and even told him to cook so you can do nothing...

305
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,696
- and just lounge around all day? - Mom!

306
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,797
Whether it's about him quitting or cooking at home,

307
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:54,833
it is our business, and the decision is up to us.

308
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,966
My goodness. How dare you talk to me like that?

309
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,107
Are you saying...

310
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,676
I should just keep my mouth shut? Is that it?

311
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:04,247
Please, that's enough!

312
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:08,042
Why not just tell me to never visit you again?

313
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,042
Can you do that?

314
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:12,742
Then I'd appreciate it.

315
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:15,312
What... What did you just say?

316
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,923
I'm stepping out to get some air.

317
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:28,597
- Mi Sook. - My gosh.

318
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,502
What is she doing now?

319
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,436
Mom, please!

320
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:36,103
Gosh, I can't believe this. How dare she...

321
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,343
So you skipped dinner and came here?

322
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,913
I came unannounced, but you have so many side dishes today.

323
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,012
I went to see my mom.

324
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:48,616
I rarely eat these, but she always sends me home with tons of stuff.

325
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,853
You know.

326
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:54,492
Our moms at least make side dishes for us.

327
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:57,126
What did she even do for us?

328
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:00,363
People would think that she bought us a house or something.

329
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:03,762
We bought our place with Soo Ho's loan and my savings.

330
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,366
You're paying back the loan together,

331
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,107
but your savings were solely your money.

332
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:08,502
Why didn't you say that to her?

333
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:11,072
I was too worked up to even think of it.

334
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:15,143
And with Ji Min too.

335
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:17,587
It's not like we only wanted one child.

336
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,817
It costs a lot to raise a child.

337
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,916
When you're dating, people ask you when you're getting married.

338
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,027
When you get married, they ask you when you'll have a kid.

339
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,087
When your kid is born, they ask you when you'll have another kid.

340
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,456
They won't live our lives for us,

341
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,196
but they have to give their two cents on everything.

342
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:32,327
If she changed Ji Min's diaper even just once,

343
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:33,492
I wouldn't be saying any of this.

344
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:40,103
By the way, is Soo Ho dead set on not going back to work?

345
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:41,603
Yes.

346
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:44,443
He won't listen to me.

347
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,413
That's because he's worried about you.

348
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,742
If he wants to help, he should live his life and live it well.

349
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:53,752
Seeing him all sad and discouraged...

350
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:57,752
pains me more than the fact that I'm ill.

351
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:03,863
Thank goodness I have you. What would I have done without you?

352
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,222
You think so?

353
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:12,663
What is it?

354
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:14,833
Is something else going on?

355
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:19,072
He asked me to go to Paris with him.

356
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,242
And?

357
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:30,322
Did you say yes?

358
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:35,722
Should I just leave with him?

361
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:23,133
You hurt yourself?

362
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:26,173
Yes. While climbing.

364
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,722
I did some thinking.

365
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:48,333
Did I really love Soo Wan?

366
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:53,262
Was it not just an obsession?

367
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:55,433
Or...

368
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:58,472
was I afraid of rejection?

369
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,212
If it hadn't been for Young Eun,

370
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:03,443
would Soo Wan and I...

371
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,683
really have not had any problems?

372
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,312
Would we...

373
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:12,623
still be happily together?

374
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:16,522
It's a path we never got to take,

375
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,363
so naturally...

376
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,562
I can only wonder and regret.

377
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:26,802
And naturally, all I can do is resent Young Eun.

378
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:29,232
I know.

379
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,772
And naturally, still...

380
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:41,153
I miss Soo Wan so much, Jae Guk.

381
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:43,413
I know.

382
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,083
I understand.

383
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,863
Young Eun.

384
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:55,262
Don't let her go.

385
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:58,232
What hurts more than anything...

386
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:00,833
is endlessly wondering about...

387
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:03,873
the path you couldn't take.

388
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:07,072
I can't forgive her,

389
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,173
but then,

390
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:14,153
I can't find fault with your love for her.

391
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:18,822
No one has the right to stone anyone else.

392
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:24,792
I'll never speak to you about Young Eun again.

393
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,762
Do you know what that means?

394
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:28,893
Yes.

395
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,663
Take care.

396

(Woori Photo Studio)

397
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:08,072
My life is gaining wrinkles.

398
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:13,472
Sometimes, they become sighs.

399
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:22,353
Sometimes, they become tears.

400
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,143
She can't wake up?

401
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,817
No. Her medication must be pretty strong.

402
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:51,012
She threw up all she had for dinner,

403
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:53,683
then passed out asleep and hasn't woken yet.

404
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,812
Okay.

405
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:02,153
I guess you haven't told your mother about her illness.

406
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,863
I told her earlier today.

407
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:07,022
She asked why I hadn't told her sooner.

408
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,292
She feels sorry for Mi Sook now.

409
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,732
She's sorry too.

410
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:20,103
You should go back to work.

411
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,643
It's good you want to be there for her,

412
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:27,252
but what she really wants...

413
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,683
is for us to act like nothing has changed.

414
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,123
Let her see you...

415
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:36,992
go on with life as if nothing has changed.

416
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,863
That will put her at ease.

417
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:41,633
But...

418
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,163
You know, Young Eun,

419
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:49,433
I had no idea I relied on her this much.

420
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:54,873
I didn't know I loved her this much.

421
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,913
Why do I see that only now?

422
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:00,413
We had so many years together.

423
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,123
We all...

424
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,722
are the same.

425
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,423
I'm so sorry.

426
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:12,363
I'll come back for her early in the morning.

427
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:13,992
Goodnight.

428
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:20,633
Just like that, one by one,

429
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,403
my life is gaining wrinkles.

430
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:28,012
Sometimes, they become sighs.

431
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:32,883
Sometimes, they become tears.

432
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:37,552
Sometimes, they become a path.

433
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:52,032
I looked up a few places in Paris where we could stay.

434
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:55,203
There's a place close to a gallery,

435
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:57,173
or with great infrastructure.

436
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,943
This place is closer to many parks.

437
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:01,913
Another place is next to many pretty cafes.

438
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:06,087
I know this place.

439
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:07,517
When I was there to study,

440
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:11,083
I told myself I'd make lots of money and live here one day.

441
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:12,552
You can live there now.

442
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,123
With me.

443
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:16,353
That sounds like fun.

444
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:18,693
Shall I call and sign the lease?

445
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:27,032
My mom wants to get a divorce.

446
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:33,443
If things keep going this way,

447
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,413
they might end up in court.

448
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,982
I tried to get them to stop,

449
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,083
but then I read the long notes my mom had written.

450
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,653
Now I don't think it's something I can stop.

451
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:51,027
A friend I love so much...

452
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:55,062
gets smaller at the waist each time we meet.

453
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:58,562
And there's talk of my company getting sold off.

454
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:02,072
My teammates are checking out other companies,

455
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,072
looking for job openings.

456
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:07,643
But...

457
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:10,312
But?

458
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:15,052
I can't leave it all behind.

459
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:19,923
At a time when all those people are going through their worst,

460
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:22,893
how can I turn my back?

461
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:26,492
When I had lost everything,

462
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:29,693
it was Sono that kept me going.

463
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,262
Even if everyone else were to leave,

464
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,472
I must remain.

465
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,002
Young Eun.

466
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:45,042
In my heart, I'm with you,

467
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,012
in this very street in Paris,

468
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:52,722
looking up at the sky...

469
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:54,623
with a huge smile.

470
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,123
But I can't actually do that.

471
00:28:57,427 --> 00:29:00,423
My life is getting in the way.

472
00:29:05,808 --> 00:29:09,232
Can't you live a little less stressful?

473
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:13,072
Can't you drop it all and think only of me?

474
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:17,072
Can't I ask even for that?

475
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,683
I love you.

476
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:57,522
But I love my life as well.

477
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:03,226
I have a set of parents that might get divorced,

478
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:04,762
a gravely sick friend,

479
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:08,693
and a company that might get sold off.

480
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:11,933
Everything around me is unstable,

481
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:15,802
but that's why...

482
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,472
I find it even harder to leave.

483
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:38,193
Ms. Ha.

484
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:42,433
Yes? Did you hear back from La Fayere?

485
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,203
No, not yet.

486
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:49,002
What shall we do now?

487
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:01,613
Let's stop waiting.

488
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,587
They haven't replied.

489
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:06,522
That means they're not sure how our clothes will come out.

490
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,226
We must let them see for themselves.

491
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,757
Will you send them new samples?

492
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:13,762
No. I'll put on a show.

493
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,133
What?

494
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:20,532
Let's put on an online show for Sono's 2022 SS season.

495

(Head Manager Koh Kwang Soo)

496
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:34,113
Sono will put on a show for the buyers worldwide?

497
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,716
What a massive plan.

498
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,726
You always go beyond my expectations.

499
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,522
We can't spend all our time waiting for a reply.

500
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:43,327
If we keep making the alterations they demand,

501
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:44,792
we'll end up with nothing.

502
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:46,827
There's no way the end product will be any good.

503
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:49,933
I'd rather show them that we made our clothes with conviction,

504
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,807
and whatever evaluation we get,

505
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,737
they can see for themselves.

506
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:56,732
The company's struggling, and there's talk of a merger.

507
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,742
Will Head Manager Koh approve the idea?

508
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:03,676
Do it. Spend as much as you want.

509
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:06,683
We should know to spend when we must.

510
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,012
Go ahead!

511
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,386
There's no taking it back.

512
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,222
Do you always take things back?

513
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:14,322
I'll take full responsibility.

514
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:17,022
This is all on me.

515
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,196
You just do what you want.

516
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,433
Whatever you want.

517
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:26,732
Yes, of course. What?

518
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:30,903
And the salary?

519
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:32,427
A show for the buyers?

520
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:36,597
The La Fayere pop-up was designed to promote our clothes.

521
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:40,202
Showing it directly to the buyers will be more effective.

522
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:42,271
It takes anything from 10,000 to 100,000 dollars...

523
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:43,771
to invite an influential buyer.

524
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:45,937
Not to mention the models, crew, labor costs.

525
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:47,712
It's too expensive a venture.

526
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:50,311
What buyers look for more than anything...

527
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:52,808
are skilled designers, no?

528
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,278
I'm a director.

529
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:57,318
I'm thinking what's best for the company.

530
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:00,492
If you don't think they'll come because they've never heard of Sono,

531
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:02,957
take off the tags and show just the clothes.

532
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:03,993
What?

533
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:06,988
Take off the tags and labels of any luxury item,

534
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,632
and people will wonder...

535
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,268
why they paid thousands of dollars for it.

536
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:14,298
What do you think, Mr. Seok?

537
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:17,571
It seems like a good idea.

538
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:20,838
The largest entry barrier for Korean brands is brand power.

539
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,781
If you take away the brand and compete with just the quality,

540
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:27,212
you can get a fair judgement without a bias or stereotype.

541
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,952
If you're going to do it, you might as well go all out...

542
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:32,218
and get everyone's interest.

543
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:35,617
To invite 50 buyers from Europe, the US, and China...

544
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,421
will cost us 400,000 dollars.

545
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:39,531
It will be an online show with no presence required.

546
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:40,957
The cost of hosting will be zero.

547
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:44,631
Just like how Vivienne Westwood, Vetements, and Balenciaga did it.

548
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:47,432
Cameras can show even the quality and texture of the fabrics,

549
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,897
and buyers greatly prefer it.

550
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:50,941
Would they attend just because we ask?

551
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:54,577
You can leave that matter to my company, Vision PR.

552
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:59,278
Then give it a go.

553
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,888
Sir, the show itself will cost a huge amount.

554
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:06,687
We will get an investment.

555
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:11,727
Many of your company-operated stores are in the red.

556
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,832
Could we get a list of your company-operated shops...

557
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,028
and authorized retailers?

558
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,158
The due diligence team that got you worried.

559
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,468
They were from the investor.

560
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:20,928
What?

561
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:26,807
Hi.

562
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:31,107
What? We're getting an investment?

563
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,278
Okay. I'll come right back.

564
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:38,247
(Junghan Private Invests 15 Million Dollars in The One)

565
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:39,892
(Investors, not due diligence)

566
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:41,388
(I hear stock prices going up)

567
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,258
Taxi!

568
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:46,892
(For Hire)

569
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:49,127
Take me to The One.

570
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:50,428
Okay.

571
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:54,338
Sono's past performance, future outlook,

572
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:58,338
and the effort and work Young Eun put into Sono.

573
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,042
The investors looked it over objectively,

574
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:02,607
and gave positive feedback.

575
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:04,348
They thought we couldn't complain,

576
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:07,977
so the French looked down on us and didn't invite us.

577
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:11,488
Young Eun.

578
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:13,892
If you take that treatment for granted...

579
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:16,917
and bow down and give in, that makes you even worse.

580
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,631
Mr. Seok agrees with Chi Sook's idea,

581
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:22,028
so I will too.

582
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,432
You three. Put on a show that makes everyone...

583
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:28,897
who looked down on us clutch their hearts with regret.

584
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:31,838
This is so exciting.

585
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:33,738
We'll really go all out.

586
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:40,207
- Thank you. - This should be champagne.

587
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:46,848
Thank you for taking my side in front of my dad.

588
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:49,017
I didn't take your side.

589
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:52,557
I said it was a good idea because it really was.

590
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:58,627
Do you know why I couldn't quit dating?

591
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:03,937
Dad and Chi Hyung think I'm pathetic.

592
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,807
I wanted to be able to say that someone recognized my worth...

593
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:11,807
and that someone saw me for what I was.

594
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:14,147
Of course, I always got dumped.

595
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:18,848
Ms. Hwang.

596
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,091
You're not pathetic.

597
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:24,287
Don't try to fit yourself to your father's standards.

598
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:28,702
You're not a common ready-made article.

599
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:32,368
You're a very unique limited edition.

600
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:35,997
That's what you mean to me.

601
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:47,408
I love it that you are mine.

602
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:53,647
I too love it that I am yours.

603
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,057
Yes.

604
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,901
I understand. In one hour?

605
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,432
Since it's for the SS season,

606
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,972
how about this color instead?

607
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:09,772
- An iced americano. - Thanks.

608
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:10,937
That's for...

609
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:13,767
Drink this.

610
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:18,707
You must love fashion shows.

611
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:21,247
It's not the show that I like.

612
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:23,577
It's the fact I can go on doing what I like.

613
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,591
We need the samples first.

614
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,421
Na Ri, you handle the Development Team.

615
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,122
Sun Ju, get the guest list.

616
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,131
Okay.

617
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,231
So Young, collect all the photos of Sono's samples.

618
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:34,698
What for?

619
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:39,227
If we mention our brand name, they'll become prejudiced.

620
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:42,242
We'll send photos of our clothes in the invitations instead.

621
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:44,868
Let them see those and decide whether or not to attend.

622
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:46,972
Okay.

623
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,977
Good luck. I'm off to hire models.

624
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,278
- Okay. - See you.

625
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,082
Sun Ju, recheck the invitations.

626
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,551
I'll join you after dropping by Development.

627
00:37:53,552 --> 00:37:54,718
Okay.

628
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:57,477
- What invitation? - For the buyer show.

629
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,517
Mr. Koh backed them up.

630
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:01,218
DId he?

631
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,528
Good shot.

632
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:08,997
- I noticed you signed the paper. - Yes.

633
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:11,368
It must be a heavy burden.

634
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,397
You weighed all the pros and cons, right?

635
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,838
I will manage the risk.

636
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:19,412
Birdie.

637
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,977
Stop! Put a stop to everything!

638
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:25,682
You didn't sign off on the budget, did you?

639
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:26,977
I just did already.

640
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,577
The invitations...

641
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:34,892
It takes a while to send out the invitations, right?

642
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:35,992
Let's be more cautious.

643
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:37,417
I emailed them out already.

644
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:39,131
We live in a digital age.

645
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:40,957
Not the fabrics.

646
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:45,472
You haven't ordered anything yet, have you?

647
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:48,071
Don't. Don't do anything. Stop!

648
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,901
We're already way into the process.

649
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:52,037
Things are going so well, aren't they?

650
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:55,678
Don't laugh!

651
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:04,048
Soo Ho.

652
00:39:05,322 --> 00:39:07,118
Did I just hear them right?

653
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:08,618
I doubt it.

654
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:11,827
It's not that hard a sentence that you'd mishear.

655
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:14,361
Ms. Jeon Mi Sook.

656
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:16,698
We want you to be a model for Sono's fashion show.

657
00:39:17,003 --> 00:39:19,028
The clothes came out amazing.

658
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:22,167
I need you to wear them and let them shine.

659
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:25,638
You're out of your mind.

660
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:39,722
I just happen to be the exact size I was when I was a model.

661
00:39:39,723 --> 00:39:41,417
What great timing.

662
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:43,718
I have no choice but to do it.

663
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:47,428
- Okay? - My gosh...

664
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,301
You'd better brace yourselves. I can hit it out of the ballpark.

665
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:52,531
You'll wear this and walk down the runway.

666
00:39:52,532 --> 00:39:55,071
This is something like what you'll wear.

667
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:56,602
You need to practice your walk.

668
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,412
- I need to, don't I? - Your walk's too outdated.

669
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:01,167
It is. Models nowadays walk differently.

670
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:05,678
Thank you, Young Eun.

671
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:08,618
I didn't think she'd be so pleased.

672
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:12,088
Soo Ho, you're going to be in charge of the show, right?

673
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:15,118
Don't you dare refuse.

674
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,932
My fury and my friend's sadness.

675
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,461
- I will not let it go. - Sorry?

676
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:23,997
You quit working to be with her because you felt bad, right?

677
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,428
I do feel bad. I'm so grateful and I'm shameless too.

678
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:31,298
I hate people who are all talk and no action.

679
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,542
Show it. Put your words into action.

680
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:34,912
We can't feel one's heart.

681
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:36,107
We're not invisible.

682
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:41,307
Anyway, there's so much I want to say,

683
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:43,522
but I won't for Mi Sook's sake as I'm a third party.

684
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:45,091
That is all I will say.

685
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:48,022
You had better run this show, Mr. Kwak.

686
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:49,517
Or I'll just...

687
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:52,528
I'll take that as a yes. Goodbye, then.

688
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:08,377
Did Mom kick you out?

689
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:10,178
Not at all.

690
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:11,977
The house is in my name.

691
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:13,582
Then why are you here?

692
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,517
My legs hurt. Open the door.

693
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:20,548
Is your dad over there?

694
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,618
He hasn't come home in two days.

695
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,727
Don't worry. He's with me.

696
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:31,528
Don't worry.

697
00:41:31,873 --> 00:41:33,731
I'm about to give him some fruit.

698
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:34,997
Goodnight.

699
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:51,591
Where did you sleep last night?

700
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,448
Some are divorced. Some are widowed.

701
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,417
Lots of my friends live alone.

702
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,428
You said you wouldn't give her anything.

703
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,897
It looks like you'll give her the house.

704
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,658
No way.

705
00:42:03,802 --> 00:42:05,301
Then why did you leave?

706
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:07,068
Everything I do unwittingly...

707
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:10,037
hurt her, she said.

708
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:15,037
It's not like I can kick your mother out.

709
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:19,477
Dad, why don't you just part ways with Mom?

710
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:25,118
- What? - We might think...

711
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:27,647
she's being like this for insignificant reasons.

712
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,258
But that's what makes me feel even worse.

713
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:33,758
The fact that she was bothered by those little things.

714
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:36,401
How was I supposed to know?

715
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:38,057
I never upset her on purpose.

716
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:40,368
Mom loves you.

717
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:42,602
She no longer wants to hate you, and that's why she wants a divorce.

718
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,638
Whose side are you on?

719
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:47,872
Anyway, you're the one who should break up.

720
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:51,408
There will be no failure in my life. That goes for both work and love.

721
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:53,207
I know you love Mom.

722
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:55,818
That's why you're not going home.

723
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:59,318
My goodness. Don't be ridiculous.

724
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:02,787
Why is your face turning red?

725
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:05,531
What's the matter with you? I need to watch the news.

726
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:08,531
Fraud crimes targeting couples are becoming more serious...

727
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,428
as time goes by.

728
00:43:10,503 --> 00:43:13,667
Some even use cryptocurrencies to scam...

729
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:19,607
What's the matter?

730
00:43:19,773 --> 00:43:22,381
"How can Sono do a show for buyers when it's not even a luxury brand?"

731
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,642
Is that what you're thinking?

732
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,247
I never said that.

733
00:43:26,482 --> 00:43:28,682
We're going to combine events and fashion films.

734
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:30,348
It's going to be a new kind of show.

735
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:33,588
It'd be great if you could do this project with us.

736
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:36,622
The people in Paris haven't given us any feedback,

737
00:43:36,623 --> 00:43:38,687
and the clock keeps ticking.

738
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:41,932
"What if we don't get to do anything?"

739
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:45,767
"What if I'm only given one last day?"

740
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,767
"What should I do then?" I asked myself that.

741
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,298
And?

742
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:52,508
I want to design the kind of clothes I want...

743
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:55,977
and work with the person I like.

744
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,977
That's all I want for now.

745
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:05,647
When do I start work?

746
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:07,051
Right now.

747
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:10,318
Gosh, you really are unbelievable.

748
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:13,588
You're the only man I can throw a tantrum to.

749
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:19,098
I'm allowed to do that to you, right?

750
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:33,147
Anytime.

751
00:44:36,152 --> 00:44:37,448
As many times as you like.

752
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:51,031
The stage setting and devices for this show...

753
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:54,031
are going to be very experimental, so make sure you stay on your toes.

754
00:44:54,032 --> 00:44:56,238
- Okay. - Okay. Great.

755
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:02,238
Mr. Kwak, are you back?

756
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,981
- Mr. Kwak. - Sir, I knew you'd come back.

757
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:08,011
- What took you so long? - I'm so glad you're back.

758
00:45:08,012 --> 00:45:10,517
Let's welcome him back with a round of applause.

759
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:22,301
I know I let things come this far by not thinking straight.

760
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,227
But we need to minimize the risks.

761
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:26,002
Do you have a plan?

762
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,272
What plan?

763
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:29,267
Doing a show won't guarantee high sales.

764
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:32,267
What if we make tons of clothes only to have them piled up in stock?

765
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:34,537
The more the stock, the higher the loss.

766
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,111
We're going to receive orders from the buyers at the show.

767
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:40,111
We're only going to make the clothes that they order.

768
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,448
What if they don't make any orders?

769
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:44,252
We'll make nice clothes to prevent that from happening.

770
00:45:44,253 --> 00:45:46,321
How many buyers are coming?

771
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:48,718
Invite as many as you can so we can get enough orders.

772
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:50,318
I need to attend a meeting now.

773
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:01,332
Your size is even smaller now.

774
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,838
Measure her size later. Right now, you should watch this catwalk.

775
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:07,267
I need to measure her size first.

776
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:09,138
Let her measure my size first.

777
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:12,381
The theme of the show is "An urban secret garden."

778
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:16,281
You want to turn a huge studio into a city,

779
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:18,077
and you also want a garden.

780
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,551
With this budget?

781
00:46:20,552 --> 00:46:23,261
A white wall with an architectural and structural look.

782
00:46:23,262 --> 00:46:25,591
There should be special effects for the highlight, right?

783
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:27,191
Yes, don't be stingy and make it look flashy.

784
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:28,428
Goodness, I have a headache.

785
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:30,761
Mr. Kwak, you should go ahead and fill them in.

786
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:33,872
Director Hwang, do you want us to get the jewelry sponsorships?

787
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:36,102
I want the limited edition. There are only three in the country.

788
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:38,341
- Oh, don't forget the shoes. - Okay.

789
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:39,868
Goodness, my heart.

790
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:42,441
I'll be participating in shooting the fashion films,

791
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:45,008
so I want you to pick people who are good and talented.

792
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:47,011
You know I don't work with amateurs, right?

793
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,147
Gosh, I think I need a tonic.

794
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:52,818
I'll ask all my connections for help, sir.

795
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:53,992
Okay, let's give it a try.

796
00:46:53,993 --> 00:46:56,158
I'm sorry you have to reduce the size so much.

797
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:58,187
You don't need to be sorry.

798
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:00,292
I cut fabric and mend them.

799
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:01,827
That's my job.

800
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:04,727
But you really need to stop losing any more weight.

801
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:07,702
Look at her.

802
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:09,801
I bet she weighs 3kg less than I do.

803
00:47:09,802 --> 00:47:11,602
I should lose a bit more weight.

804
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:13,638
- That's enough. - Forget it.

805
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:16,142
Do I not have a good pose? How about I go like this?

806
00:47:16,143 --> 00:47:19,607
That's a bit too much. Instead of doing that, you should...

807
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:24,321
Hey, when are you leaving for Paris?

808
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:25,622
I watched the clip for reference.

809
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:26,992
She's working too hard for someone who's leaving.

810
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:29,562
- I think this will work. - Like this?

811
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:30,821
She won't go.

812
00:47:30,822 --> 00:47:32,787
She won't go?

813
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:36,198
Then what about you?

814
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:38,528
I don't know.

815
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:42,437
What should I do, Do Hoon?

816
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:45,207
I got this from the clips. Look at this.

817
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:49,508
- Show us your walk. - That's better.

818
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:51,908
Soo Ho, look at me.

819
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,551
It's beautiful.

820
00:48:00,552 --> 00:48:02,961
- It looks nice on you. - It really does.

821
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:05,091
- It fits me perfectly. - Do you like it?

822
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:08,227
Of course. It's beautiful.

823
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:11,557
How am I going to break up with her?

824
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:42,127
Soo Wan.

825
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:46,098
Do you hate it that much?

826
00:48:49,572 --> 00:48:51,098
Are you that against...

827
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,008
my relationship with Young Eun?

828
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:06,287
(RIP Yoon Soo Wan)

829
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:26,142
- Mr. Kwak, it's almost done. - Okay.

830
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:28,812
Let's start the rehearsal as soon as we check the order.

831
00:49:28,813 --> 00:49:29,872
Okay.

832
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:32,209
- We're starting the rehearsal soon. - Okay.

833
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:35,383
- Check everything beforehand. - Okay.

834
00:49:35,384 --> 00:49:37,283
- Mom. - Ji Min.

835
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:39,082
You shouldn't be running around.

836
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,348
- What do you think of me? - You look pretty.

837
00:49:41,454 --> 00:49:43,049
My hair looks cool, doesn't it?

838
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:45,819
We just need to have this ready.

839
00:49:46,824 --> 00:49:47,919
Hey.

840
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,993
- Hello. - Hi, Ms. Seo.

841
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:52,499
Can you check that for me?

842
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:56,899
Ji Min, say hello. She's close to your dad.

843
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,538
Hello, Ji Min.

844
00:50:04,514 --> 00:50:07,343
So, you're Ji Min. You're pretty.

845
00:50:07,344 --> 00:50:11,078
Ji Min, you should say hello. Say it out loud.

846
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:13,879
- Hello. - Hi.

847
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:15,848
Let's shake hands.

848
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:22,328
Ms. Seo.

849
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:26,403
I know you're busy, but can you look after her for me?

850
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:28,359
Of course.

851
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:30,769
Don't worry about her. I'll let you focus on the show.

852
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,669
Thank you.

853
00:50:35,114 --> 00:50:38,879
Ji Min, would you like to go and watch your mom's show?

854
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:40,578
Let's go.

855
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:53,359
- He's over there. - Okay.

856
00:50:56,163 --> 00:50:58,328
- Are the lights ready? - Yes.

857
00:50:58,963 --> 00:51:00,962
Is everything okay with the sound system?

858
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:03,129
Let's see the lights move.

859
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,468
Everything looks fine.

860
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:19,319
Ms. Jeon Mi Sook, it's time to put on your outfit.

861
00:51:19,884 --> 00:51:21,279
Okay.

862
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:29,062
Get ready. Keep a distance.

863
00:51:29,063 --> 00:51:31,328
- Is everything good? - Yes.

864
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:40,669
Can you check the time for me?

865
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:43,243
What's the connection rate?

866
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:44,613
Less than 20 percent, sir.

867
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:46,709
None of the buyers is online yet.

868
00:51:47,213 --> 00:51:50,149
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

869
00:51:50,353 --> 00:51:51,948
Check the time.

870
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:54,522
Ms. Ha, this is a live show,

871
00:51:54,523 --> 00:51:56,423
so the buyers might start watching in the middle of the show.

872
00:51:56,424 --> 00:51:58,763
- Okay. - We sent everyone an email again...

873
00:51:58,764 --> 00:52:00,993
asking them to log in when the show starts in 20 minutes.

874
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:02,832
- Is everyone in their outfits? - They're checking one last time.

875
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,328
- Okay. - Let's go.

876
00:52:08,364 --> 00:52:09,629
We're ready.

877
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:13,198
We're about to begin. Everyone, get ready for the show.

878
00:52:13,943 --> 00:52:15,508
Come this way.

879
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:20,642
Here you go.

880
00:52:20,643 --> 00:52:22,082
- Check the sleeves. - Okay.

881
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,879
Sir, you need to come with me.

882
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:28,118
- Excuse me for a bit. - Okay.

883
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:31,819
What's the connection rate? Tell me right now.

884
00:52:38,494 --> 00:52:40,399
The show is about to begin.

885
00:52:41,233 --> 00:52:42,729
Is everything good?

886
00:53:40,463 --> 00:53:42,888
The connection rate is going up.

887
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,598
- What? - It's already over 70 percent.

888
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:48,598
We did it!

889
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:50,499
Kwang Soo.

890
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:06,779
Ms. Ha.

891
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:10,419
Ms. Ha, all the big buyers are watching the show.

892
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:08,948
Olivier has logged in!

893
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:11,249
- Really? - Everyone's watching now.

894
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:06,399
Hey, it's Mom!

895
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,178
Flowers bloom.

896
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:15,649
A new season comes.

897
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:18,709
Flowers...

898
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:20,879
bloom all over.

899
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:26,888
The season continues.

900
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,529
Flowers start to rain from the sky.

901
00:56:32,364 --> 00:56:33,859
It's beautiful but sad.

902
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:38,269
But flowers don't wither.

903
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:41,769
Along with a flower...

904
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:44,738
comes a fruit.

905
00:56:45,813 --> 00:56:47,709
It's a new beginning.

906
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:50,948
It leaves you with a warm memory...

907
00:56:51,753 --> 00:56:53,178
that will stay within you...

908
00:56:54,384 --> 00:56:55,589
for eternity.

909
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,319
I'm not going to sell this outfit.

910
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,519
I only made one.

911
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:07,558
Because it's a gift for my friend, Mi Sook.

912
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:15,198
I made this just for you.

913
00:57:16,443 --> 00:57:17,638
I hope this outfit...

914
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:20,709
makes you happy.

915
00:57:23,454 --> 00:57:26,178
I'm already as happy as I'll ever be, Young Eun.

916
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:28,848
This is more than enough.

917
00:57:30,353 --> 00:57:34,859
I really think I lived a happy life.

918
00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:39,399
Thank you...

919
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:42,368
for letting me be your friend.

920
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:47,439
Thank you for being my friend.

921
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:53,379
I love you so much.

922
00:59:36,483 --> 00:59:37,749
I'm a little thirsty.

923
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:41,948
The buyers...

924
00:59:42,853 --> 00:59:44,618
have started placing orders.

925
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:46,488
Nice!

926
00:59:52,063 --> 00:59:53,999
I was really thirsty, sir.

927
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:08,609
Sono's fashion show ended successfully.

928
01:00:12,284 --> 01:00:14,379
Okay. You may leave.

929
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:25,488
Jae Guk.

930
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:35,339
I went to see...

931
01:00:38,313 --> 01:00:39,879
Soo Wan just now.

932
01:00:48,154 --> 01:00:50,288
- Jae Guk. - Mom.

933
01:00:52,094 --> 01:00:53,419
Just one month.

934
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:54,859
I'll...

935
01:00:56,393 --> 01:00:57,729
break up with her,

936
01:00:58,463 --> 01:00:59,629
Soo Wan.

937
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:10,468
I'll break up with her.

938
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,249
Just give me one month.

939
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:21,419
Let me love her all I want...

940
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:25,419
just for one month.

941
01:01:30,634 --> 01:01:31,888
Then I'll break up.

942
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:35,529
- Great job, Sono! - Great job, Sono!

943
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,403
- I'll treat you all to dinner! - Nice job!

944
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:39,339
Director Hwang is going to buy us dinner!

945
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:41,403
- Nice! - Great!

946
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:45,508
- Director Hwang! - Director Hwang!

947
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,408
- Director Hwang! - Director Hwang!

948
01:02:44,404 --> 01:02:47,272
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

949
01:02:47,273 --> 01:02:49,243
We've been getting tons of calls for Ms. Ha.

950
01:02:49,244 --> 01:02:50,642
What kind of person is Ha Young Eun?

951
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:51,772
Someone I envy.

952
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:53,238
With him...

953
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:58,109
Let's go together. I want to be with you.

954
01:02:58,514 --> 01:03:00,919
I was the one who told him we should break up.

955
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:04,488
But it's getting harder for me.

956
01:03:05,123 --> 01:03:07,562
- Mr. Kwak. - It's just coffee.

957
01:03:07,563 --> 01:03:10,462
All the other guys liked you because of your background.

958
01:03:10,463 --> 01:03:11,463
They loved your money.

959
01:03:11,464 --> 01:03:13,203
We just got an email from Olivier.

960
01:03:13,204 --> 01:03:15,562
- They want to scout someone. - Someone wants my employee?

961
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:16,729
Who?
