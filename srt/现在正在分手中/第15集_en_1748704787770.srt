1
00:00:12,636 --> 00:00:13,900
About your mom...

2
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,000
Should I let her go?

3
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:20,311
As your daughter,

4
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,640
I'd say...

5
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:25,811
I want you and Mom to stay together and live happily for a long time.

6
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:27,680
But you know,

7
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:31,451
as a woman...

8
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:34,891
Dad.

9
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:40,361
I think it would be the right thing to do.

10
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,900
You always take your mother's side.

11
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:55,941
I don't know what to do.

12
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:57,980
With what?

13
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,450
Every February,

14
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,320
I was busy organizing things for students who were graduating.

15
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,620
But I have no idea how I can let your mom go...

16
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:09,260
and graduate from this marriage.

17
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,131
I'm only...

18
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,471
going to ask you this once...

19
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,070
as a man...

20
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:32,680
who loves you.

21
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:40,050
Will you come with me?

22
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,591
Dad.

23
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,830
How did you manage to say goodbye every year?

24
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:56,770
Having to part with your students every year...

25
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:59,070
Wasn't it difficult?

26
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:03,281
Saying goodbye doesn't mean you'll never see them again.

27
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:05,980
They're just no longer at the school.

28
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,811
When they run into a hurdle in life,

29
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:12,320
they might think of my advice. Right, Mr. Ha told me to do this.

30
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:16,420
And from time to time, I wonder how they're doing.

31
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,830
Just like that, you always stay in each other's life.

32
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:30,240
Then why can't you do that with Mom?

33
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:38,941
I just can't let her go.

34
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:46,351
She was my life partner for nearly 40 years.

35
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:49,320
Even if there are tons of things that she resents and hates about me,

36
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,230
I want her to remember at least one good thing about me...

37
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:57,061
and know that our marriage wasn't only filled with bad memories.

38
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,200
I want to...

39
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,601
patch things up with your mother.

40
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:19,320
Some say that love is eternal.

41
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:21,651
What does that really mean?

42
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:36,341
To Paris, August 30, 2021

43
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,181
How do you...

44
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,511
make love last?

45
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:54,355
It is what a woman leaves off, not what she puts on,

46
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:56,261
that gives her cachet. By Paul Poiret

47
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:04,201
Now, We Are Breaking Up

48
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,534
Episode 15

49
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:10,074
The company gave her all the support to grow Sono.

50
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,875
But as soon as he told her to take Sono and run it on her own...

51
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,870
Our sales numbers will take a big hit.

52
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,284
Sono was our best-selling brand...

53
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:17,940
although it wasn't new and exciting anymore.

54
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:20,711
Why didn't you bring Sono's monthly sales report?

55
00:04:21,256 --> 00:04:23,781
Are you soldiers awaiting discharge?

56
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,391
Where did your discipline go?

57
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:27,550
- I was just... - Darn it.

58
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,334
I'm so impressed by President Hwang.

59
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:34,694
To start your own brand,

60
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:36,435
you'd need a factory, fabric, and even an office.

61
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,105
Your severance pay won't cut it.

62
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:40,201
But he's letting us use all the resources.

63
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:43,005
I'm most happy about not having to fight with Mr. Koh anymore.

64
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:46,141
We can do anything we want as long as Ms. Ha is okay with it.

65
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,641
You think I start fights for no reason?

66
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:52,685
You've been visiting our office very often lately.

67
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:54,610
Do you think you made Sono on your own?

68
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:57,524
I supported you and took care of all the risk management.

69
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,050
That's why Sono can be where it is today.

70
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,250
Gosh, you people...

71
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:05,821
Have you no heart? I can't believe you're ditching us.

72
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:09,865
You're not buying us something to drink to cheer us up?

73
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,665
Why should I? Not a chance!

74
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,430
I never stop people who want to leave.

75
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,601
- Now, that's the Mr. Koh we know. - Submit your monthly sales report.

76
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:18,875
And the detailed strategic plan too. By the end of the day.

77
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:21,074
How can we finish them by the end of the day?

78
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,584
- I don't know! - But...

79
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:23,784
- Submit them today. - But...

80
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,081
Just do as I say!

81
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,411
Goodness.

82
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,480
He's back to being his usual self.

83
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,821
Come on. Let's get to work.

84
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:39,190
If Sono becomes an independent label,

85
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,261
there will be many changes within the company.

86
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:45,764
Since Vision PR will now take care of all our advertising needs...

87
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,630
You don't need to do that anymore.

88
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:48,975
What?

89
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:52,841
You don't need to get Vision PR involved because of me.

90
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,214
What are you talking about?

91
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:58,214
Since when did you think so highly of Vision PR?

92
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:00,014
In the past, you had zero interest in the company.

93
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,514
You're doing this on purpose...

94
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:03,024
so things would work out between me and Mr. Seok.

95
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,021
That's what you're paying him for.

96
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,490
What? So you're saying...

97
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,654
I spent all that money on marketing...

98
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,365
and hired Vision PR...

99
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,860
just so I could marry you off to him? Is that it?

100
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,230
Yes, that's exactly what you did.

101
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,161
You foolish brat.

102
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,901
Yes, I am foolish.

103
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:25,540
But whose fault is it that I ended up like this?

104
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:28,815
You always click your tongue at me. You never trust me...

105
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:30,641
and always treat me like a fool.

106
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:33,250
It's not like I want to be a loser.

107
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,284
I don't want to be such a pathetic fool.

108
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:38,581
You see, I tried my best to make it work.

109
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:40,591
You shouldn't have stepped in.

110
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,454
You should've patiently waited.

111
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,221
Instead, you gave him all the ads because you couldn't trust me.

112
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:47,534
Do you have any idea how pathetic I felt?

113
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:49,435
You made me feel like a complete loser.

114
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:51,134
What do you take me for?

115
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,574
You're my dad. What else?

116
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,101
You're really frustrating me here.

117
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:59,005
You've been working closely with me. Shouldn't you know me better by now?

118
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:02,240
Have you seen me treat incompetent people with respect?

119
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,411
Think about the time when you were head over heels for Jimmy.

120
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:08,951
I never even considered that punk a professional model.

121
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:13,021
So I got it all wrong?

122
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,925
I have so many employees,

123
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,665
and they all have families to feed.

124
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,531
I'd never waste the company's money just so you could get hitched!

125
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,961
Did you really think your father could stoop so low?

126
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,500
But I won it with nothing but my hard work.

127
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:29,101
It's true that I liked you,

128
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:31,904
and it's also true that's how I got to know the president.

129
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:33,774
Do you think that made my job easier?

130
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:36,644
No. It made my work harder.

131
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,310
Because I have to do even better so no one says what you did.

132
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,810
And you, of all people,

133
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,451
are doubting me now?

134
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:52,190
I'm done listening to such offensive words.

135
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,800
Please leave my office.

136
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:05,870
Then why did it have to be Mr. Seok of all people?

137
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:10,740
Am I not allowed to work with the guys you date?

138
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:12,811
No. It's not that, but...

139
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,284
Date him or break up with him, I don't care. Suit yourself.

140
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:18,284
I just think that he's a capable, sensible young man,

141
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,125
and I like the way he thinks,

142
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,250
so I'm going to keep working with him.

143
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:35,171
- Why are you so downcast today? - What?

144
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,841
My blood sugar must've hit rock bottom.

145
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,640
It's just one of those days.

146
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:43,715
You wake up with pillow marks all over your face,

147
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,280
and they take forever to go away.

148
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,410
Even the things...

149
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,821
you were able to forget about after a glass of drink...

150
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,921
stay on your mind, and you can't shake them off.

151
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,061
Are you really going to move out?

152
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,490
When will you move out, then?

153
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm not sure.

154
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,471
You won't say you're not leaving.

155
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,605
So I'm really all alone now.

156
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,811
Why are you alone? What about Mr. Seok?

157
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,110
We broke up.

158
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,181
What?

159
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:22,284
A limited-edition...

160
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,780
Hey, it's so easy to give up on a limited-edition.

161
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,394
Gosh, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

162
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:32,260
It's not like he proposed to me, or had a wedding venue booked.

163
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,390
Don't worry. It's fine.

164
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,331
Do you realize that's the fifth one?

165
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,140
You said it was a misunderstanding on your part.

166
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,174
Just apologize to him and...

167
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:48,311
He agreed to end things as if he was waiting.

168
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:51,140
Maybe you said mean things to him again.

169
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:52,855
Sometimes when you talk,

170
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,184
you blurt things out without realizing it.

171
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,880
You can't always say nice things.

172
00:09:57,486 --> 00:10:00,255
So you did say things that you shouldn't have said.

173
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:02,650
Whatever, I don't care anymore.

174
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:10,660
By the way,

175
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,071
are you all right?

176
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,571
With that?

177
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,900
J.

178
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:19,441
Are you sure you'll be okay without him around?

Woori Photo Studio

180
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:44,804
Woori Photo Studio, Open until the end of the month

181
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,900
Woori Photo Studio

182
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,110
Yes.

183
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,980
Right, I'll clear the space by the weekend.

184
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,691
I'll give you the door code. Feel free to show it to people.

185
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,490
Okay.

186
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:15,691
I'm getting another call.

187
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,101
Just a moment.

188
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,331
Okay, thank you.

189
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:25,000
Hello, yes.

190
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:34,110
- Hello, Ms. Ha. - Hello, you're here too.

191
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:36,924
Yes. Cookie is tall,

192
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,784
but he doesn't really know how to get things done.

193
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,154
I'm technically his agent,

194
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,461
and he's like my little brother, you know.

195
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,431
Actually, I saw Chi Sook just before I left the office.

196
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:52,461
I don't need to be too worried, right?

197
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,931
That's right. You don't need to worry.

198
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:57,975
There was a small misunderstanding,

199
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:01,910
but it's something the two of us need to deal with.

200
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:03,644
It may take some time,

201
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,980
but it's one of the things that we need to overcome anyway.

202
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:11,421
Don't leave her alone for too long. She's hurt, so please comfort her.

203
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:12,921
I know, and I will.

204
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,054
Okay. Bye.

205
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:16,825
Did you talk to the realtor?

206
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,325
When can you get the deposit back?

207
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:19,934
Don't return the key until you get it.

208
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:21,365
Okay, I know.

209
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,705
Did you call everyone and tell them to pick up their photos?

210
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,061
I'm doing it now.

211
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:29,130
- I feel frazzled. - You have a lot to do.

212
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,000
I wanted to get the bare minimum,

213
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,240
but I somehow ended up with piles of equipment.

214
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:36,341
- What will this be turned into? - A cafe.

215
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:41,985
It's a different kind of business, so you should get rid of everything.

216
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,620
Too bad you can't keep the lighting equipment.

217
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,191
Mother

218
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,191
I'll be right back.

219
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:59,461
- Yes, Mother. - So you're going back to Paris?

220
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:02,831
Yes, I made up my mind.

221
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:06,711
When do you leave?

222
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,110
Ms. Ha.

223
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:16,311
Are you sure you want to stay in Seoul?

224
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:20,355
I think Cookie is still hopeful...

225
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,591
that you may decide to leave with him.

226
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,730
Can't you just go with him?

227
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:33,831
No.

228
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,171
I'm going alone.

229
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:38,571
I see.

230
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,341
You'll come see me...

231
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:44,280
before you leave, right?

232
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,010
Yes.

233
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:01,630
Here, Mi Sook's photos.

234
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,730
Right.

235
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,274
What are you doing?

236
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,575
Okay, let's try.

237
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,044
- What do I do? - The Miss Korea pose.

238
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:16,410
The Miss Korea pose? Is this too much?

239
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:39,130
These are great. She looks so pretty and happy.

240
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't want to let her go.

241
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:57,654
They'll come...

242
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,054
Woori Photo Studio

243
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:00,791
and pick up all the equipment tomorrow.

244
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:08,291
Then I'll be ready...

245
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:10,900
to leave.

246
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:27,085
Woori Photo Studio

247
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,910
Kwak Ji Min

248
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:32,351
Kwak Ji Min

249
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:34,925
Kwak Ji Min

250
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:37,721
What should she wear to her entrance ceremony?

251
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,860
That one, the one in the middle.

252
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:45,164
This one?

253
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:48,174
It's spring, so she should wear the yellow hairpin.

254
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes, the big one.

255
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,774
- What do you think? - Perfect.

256
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:55,811
- This looks nice. - Mom, I took a shower.

257
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,250
Okay, let's see.

258
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:05,081
You washed all the soap off. Great job.

259
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:08,291
My sweet pumpkin.

260
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:15,534
You're only seven. I'm sorry I made you take a shower...

261
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,201
all by yourself.

262
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:20,870
I have to wash up on my own every day from now on, right?

263
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:24,671
- Yes. - You're sick, so you can't help me.

264
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:26,976
Right.

265
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:30,510
But you'll check every day and make sure I did a good job, right?

266
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,650
You'll be late for your piano lesson.

267
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,081
- Come on. Let's go dry your hair. - Okay.

268
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:02,811
It's spreading quickly.

269
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:06,284
If the blood vessels in the stomach are damaged,

270
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:08,385
you may cough up blood.

271
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:11,680
If the hemoptysis worsens, it may cause an airway obstruction...

272
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,324
or a sudden fall in blood pressure,

273
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,890
which could be dangerous.

274
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:51,220
Kwak Ji Min

275
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:09,571
There are just so many things.

276
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:14,710
There are still so many things that I need to do.

277
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,751
What should I do?

278
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:23,291
I feel terrible whenever I think about Ji Min.

279
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:25,660
I can do it.

280
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,630
I'll do it.

281
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:29,930
It's a piece of cake.

282
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,630
It's so easy.

283
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:01,791
I asked you to bring me your business plan.

284
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,331
Where is it?

285
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,930
I'm still thinking.

286
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,700
You're not sure if leaving The One would be the right thing to do,

287
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:13,001
but you're afraid you'd regret it if you decided to stay. Is that it?

288
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:18,110
How did you know? You read my mind.

289
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:21,751
So? When will you give me your answer?

290
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,791
Could you wait until the weekend?

291
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:31,460
Don't tell me you're thinking of doing something else.

292
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,364
I'll sort through my thoughts and tell you everything...

293
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:37,430
when I report back to you.

294
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,170
Okay, you may leave then.

295
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,755
Hello, I heard you were looking for me.

296
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,420
Yes, Ms. Ha.

297
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:03,791
Just a second.

298
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,364
Oh, boy.

299
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,991
Here, they're Sono's specification sheets.

300
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,334
You kept all of them?

301
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:15,304
You, Ms. Nam, and Ms. An all worked so hard on them.

302
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:18,001
How can I throw them out, knowing that?

303
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,640
You might find them helpful down the road, you know.

304
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:24,741
Thank you very much for always being so precise and thorough.

305
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,955
Sorry I was always so fussy.

306
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:30,255
Thanks to you, our samples always looked so amazing.

307
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:31,920
I wish you all the best.

308
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:34,955
Aren't you done for the day?

309
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:38,321
Me? No, I have a lot to do for Claire Marie.

310
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,731
- What about dinner, then? - I'll grab a quick bite.

311
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:45,200
Do you want a piece of toast?

312
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,101
Sure.

313
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,930
You make the best toast.

314
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,301
That's right.

315
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,110
All right.

316
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,291
Here. You'll miss this.

317
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:21,700
You helped me with my first T-shirt.

318
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,041
I still remember how excited you were that day.

319
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,544
Just keep that spirit alive,

320
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,170
and you'll do just fine wherever you go.

321
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:29,940
Thank you.

322
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,860
Can't you just go with him?

323
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:07,251
You said you'd pack this weekend. I came to help.

324
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,311
I can manage on my own.

325
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,190
What will you do with all this?

326
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,160
I'll only take what I need.

327
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,495
I've been to Europe and China.

328
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:22,135
I'm used to packing for business trips.

329
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,834
To take just what you need and reduce volume.

330
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:26,364
That's all a skill,

331
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:28,301
and it's a must for all designers.

332
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:30,301
What will you take?

333
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,011
It wasn't practice.

334
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,021
I had a good model.

335
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:58,231
Do Hoon said he had a meeting.

336
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:01,301
Did he forget the passcode?

337
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:09,440
Who is it?

338
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:37,370
I heard you're going away for a while, so I bought what you'd need.

339
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,970
Take a seat. I'll make some tea.

340
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,341
I'll let you two talk, then.

341
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:46,440
No. I will leave.

342
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,821
Can you...

343
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:54,051
spare me some time, son?

344
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,670
You said you'd help me pack.

345
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:23,380
Then shall we get to it for real?

346
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:27,995
There's no room for those.

347
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:30,120
You can stick them in-between.

348
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:32,660
- They all fit. - They did.

349
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:37,301
Woori Photo Studio

350
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,440
A moment is passing.

351
00:24:53,686 --> 00:24:56,380
Another moment is urging us.

352
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:02,150
The moment you and I are in love.

353
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:05,920
The moment you and I...

354
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,635
must part.

355
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:10,930
Woori Photo Studio

356
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:15,470
My gosh.

357
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,975
Your dad might barge in again.

358
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,514
If he has bread for breakfast,

359
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:25,241
he has an upset stomach all day.

360
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:29,584
I'll put the beef bone soup in the freezer.

361
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:31,950
Heat it until it boils before you eat.

362
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,425
Are you sure you're getting divorced?

363
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:36,524
I should sign the papers as soon as possible.

364
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,624
I'm bothered when I see him,

365
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,935
and I'm bothered when I don't.

366
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,294
But whenever...

367
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:45,160
I even say the word divorce, he disappears.

368
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:47,935
Why don't you take it back?

369
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:49,804
This isn't child's play.

370
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,541
We can't keep changing our minds.

371
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:56,170
You're right.

372
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,241
I suggested we should break up,

373
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:04,281
but now that I saw his things all packed up,

374
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:07,251
I'm wondering if it's really right.

375
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:09,491
What are you talking about?

376
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,420
Who packed what?

377
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:13,561
Jae Guk.

378
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,091
He's leaving for Paris.

379
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:18,801
What?

380
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:28,541
What I say now...

381
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:32,511
might upset you and you might...

382
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,910
resent me for it,

383
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:36,981
but life is like...

384
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,880
a very swerving road.

385
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:43,690
You will come to forks...

386
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:46,190
and you will reach cliffs.

387
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:48,534
Of the people who walked with you,

388
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:51,031
some will take this path...

389
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,400
and some will take another.

390
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:55,930
You'll feel sad.

391
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,700
You'll want to go with them.

392
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,410
But what can you do?

393
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:05,281
We're all meant to go our own ways.

394
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:07,811
He asked me to come with him.

395
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:11,081
Here,

396
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:16,051
I have you and there's Dad too.

397
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:21,390
All my people are here,

398
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:26,430
and I can't say no, I don't want to go.

399
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:30,200
I'm still wavering.

400
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,110
There are seasons...

401
00:27:34,775 --> 00:27:37,410
and you miss them all once they're gone.

402
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:39,781
Every flower you see,

403
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:43,511
you want to pick so you can keep it close.

404
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:45,351
But...

405
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:47,821
you must let go.

406
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,390
You must leave things be.

407
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,541
Business Plan

408
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:34,301
Young Eun Ha, Incheon to Paris

409
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,551
Request to Order Fabrics

410
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:01,031
Ms. Ha.

411
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,465
We must order the fabrics...

412
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,761
to prepare for the upcoming season.

413
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,304
Do I put it under The One...

414
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:09,430
or Sono now that it's independent?

415
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:14,975
The process stays the same for The One,

416
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,685
but if we go by Sono, we must write up a new contract.

417
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:19,781
They want an update as soon as possible.

418
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,351
Tell them I'll call them back.

419
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:24,051
Okay.

420
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,021
Request to Order Fabrics

421
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:42,900
We're closed. Sorry.

422
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:51,011
You're almost done closing this place too.

423
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:54,410
I just have to remove the equipment later.

424
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:57,380
I'm glad I came by before then.

425
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,150
- You can sit down. - Actually...

426
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:04,120
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

427
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,021
That's why I'm here.

428
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:09,960
Can you...

429
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:15,031
take a photo with me, Jae Guk?

430
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,910
The lights.

431
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,481
Gosh, this looks too old.

432
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,251
Oh, dear. It's about to fall off.

433
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,460
The kitchen needs a lot of fixing too.

434
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:43,591
The sink's too old.

435
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:47,801
When they get old, both people and houses...

436
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:50,331
start to break down.

437
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:52,801
My house is like that.

438
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,415
It looks like you never fixed anything since you moved in.

439
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,811
I was busy teaching the next generation,

440
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:01,251
and had no time to care about the home.

441
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:04,385
I think you should fix the plumbing first and soon.

442
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:06,084
What about the tiles?

443
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:08,824
See if they're too slippery. We can't have someone falling.

444
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,925
Okay. I'll take a look.

445
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:13,294
You're the interior guy from across the road.

446
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:16,531
- Hello. - How are you?

447
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,205
Your husband wants to redo the interior.

448
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,630
- I'll leave for now. - Okay.

449
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:24,745
- Bye. - Goodbye.

450
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:26,975
Give us a good price.

451
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,175
I will. I'll give you a call.

452
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,241
- Okay. Bye. - Bye.

453
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:34,880
You're doing what?

454
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:37,824
Did you enjoy your class?

455
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:41,054
Just because you take classes doesn't mean you're studying.

456
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:43,124
Pay attention to what the teacher says...

457
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,791
What are you doing?

458
00:31:45,825 --> 00:31:49,531
My gosh. You sound like you swallowed a foghorn.

459
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:55,200
Didn't I tell you I put up the house for sale?

460
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,470
Why would you spend money on a house you're going to sell?

461
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:01,574
Young Eun paid the mortgage with her salary.

462
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:03,071
We can't sell it.

463
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:06,781
Must I take you to court?

464
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:10,311
You can live here.

465
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:13,051
I'll move out.

466
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:16,225
I spent a good many years here.

467
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,561
I should fix what isn't working before I move out.

468
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,331
Until then, pretend I'm renting the smaller room.

469
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:26,731
Will that do?

470
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:04,101
To you I may be...

471
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:06,741
a cold-hearted mother.

472
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,470
But that is what...

473
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,281
a mother must be sometimes.

474
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,851
And...

475
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:16,910
until the end,

476
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,920
I will be...

477
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,150
your mother.

478
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,331
I will...

479
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,200
wait here for you.

480
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:37,430
Don't forget that.

481
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:40,870
Okay?

482
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:02,731
Woori Photo Studio

483
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:04,401
Mother.

484
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:10,430
I will call you.

485
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:28,921
Soo Ho

486
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,490
Hi, Soo Ho.

487
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:10,530
It spread to her stomach.

488
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,961
That's where the blood is coming from.

489
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:15,671
We stopped the bleeding from the stomach...

490
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:17,945
with a bronchoscopy for now.

491
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:19,640
What do we do now?

492
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:21,240
Is there another medicine?

493
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:25,140
She could end up losing a lot of blood.

494
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,180
That will be hard to stop.

495
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:30,550
Doctor.

496
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,450
How much time does she have left?

497
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:38,990
If she has family or friends she must say goodbye to,

498
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:42,930
I think it would be best to call them now.

499
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,260
Mi Sook.

500
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:50,001
Mi Sook...

501
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:09,691
You should get admitted.

502
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,521
I will look after Ji Min.

503
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:15,760
I don't want that.

504
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:19,961
You don't get to say what you want or don't want.

505
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:23,104
You're not a doctor. You're a patient.

506
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:25,101
You're being too noisy.

507
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:27,941
Did Soo Ho ask for your help?

508
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,041
He's really worried.

509
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,541
Once I'm done with the IV drip,

510
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:36,280
I'll go home.

511
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:40,780
There's so much left to do.

512
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:44,120
Jeon Mi Sook. Must you be like this?

513
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:46,861
Ji Min's set of coloring pencils has 48 colors.

514
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:50,231
Only half of them have stickers with her names on.

515
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:53,530
I need to write her name with a marker on her indoor shoes.

516
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:57,001
She can't tie her hair herself yet.

517
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:59,771
I said I'd teach her today.

518
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:03,570
She says I'm the best at doing pigtails.

519
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:06,740
She wants me to teach her.

520
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:08,751
Darn you.

521
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,820
Can't I do that?

522
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,320
I'll do it, Mi Sook.

523
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm her mom.

524
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:22,990
I'm still a mom.

525
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:26,361
I'm so upset.

526
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:28,271
Young Eun.

527
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:32,300
Let me be a mom.

528
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:35,740
Will you? Please?

529
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:39,280
This is so upsetting.

530
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,101
Mom!

531
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:25,220
Meeting, living,

532
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:28,731
loving, and parting.

533
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:34,800
Like a scene from an ordinary afternoon,

534
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:37,631
it's just...

535
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:41,811
one part of living life.

536
00:38:55,556 --> 00:38:57,550
That is the path called life,

537
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:00,791
and living means...

538
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,961
even if some things hurt,

539
00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:09,271
we have no choice...

540
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,140
but to go on walking down that path.

541
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:40,131
Jimmy

542
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:43,671
The lunatic.

543
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,921
My gosh!

544
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:05,361
You scared me!

545
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,164
Why are you peeking into my car?

546
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,061
Do you know how scared I was?

547
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,430
What are you doing outside my place?

548
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:17,704
How is this outside your place?

549
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:19,200
Do you live here alone?

550
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:22,144
I just came out for a drive.

551
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:23,345
Here?

552
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:25,140
I can go wherever I want.

553
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:27,184
I didn't come here to see you.

554
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:31,151
I can't vent to Young Eun knowing how upset she must be,

555
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:33,351
and I had nowhere else to go.

556
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:35,390
So I ended up here.

557
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:38,990
Darn it. What am I rambling?

558
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:44,660
Why are you out here when you could come in?

559
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:49,570
What?

560
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:53,070
I missed you a lot too.

561
00:40:55,045 --> 00:40:58,211
Haven't we broken up?

562
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:01,651
Why should I visit you at home?

563
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:03,581
Who said we broke up?

564
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:06,724
I like you too much...

565
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:08,425
to break up over a misunderstanding.

566
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:11,921
I never broke up with you for one second.

567
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,791
And I'd like to keep it that way.

568
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:18,300
For real?

569
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:22,430
Is this really for real?

570
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:47,561
I'm glad we didn't break up.

571
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:50,390
I missed you so much,

572
00:41:50,495 --> 00:41:53,200
but I didn't know how to say so.

573
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,671
I missed you so much.

574
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:59,544
I thought about calling but I just couldn't.

575
00:41:59,545 --> 00:42:04,470
I'm so sorry.

576
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:07,311
Do Hoon.

577
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,030
You leave tomorrow.

578
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:26,800
Yes.

579
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:41,711
We're standing at a forked road.

580
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:46,950
Why won't you ask?

581
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:51,120
You didn't ask...

582
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:53,760
what I'll do.

583
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:57,090
Your position, your situation,

584
00:42:58,266 --> 00:42:59,631
your reasons.

585
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:03,300
I understand and accept them all.

586
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,640
I still bought your ticket and asked you to come with me...

587
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:11,311
because I thought I should...

588
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:14,240
tell you I still feel the same.

589
00:43:18,685 --> 00:43:20,680
Even if I leave on my own,

590
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:24,191
it's not because I have...

591
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,090
fallen out of love with you.

592
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:28,760
I still...

593
00:43:29,665 --> 00:43:31,390
love Ha Young Eun,

594
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:35,401
and tomorrow and the day after that,

595
00:43:36,705 --> 00:43:37,970
I still will.

596
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:41,340
I will keep going.

597
00:43:46,116 --> 00:43:47,740
I thought I should tell you that.

598
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:52,120
Do we really have to break up?

599
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:42,501
Gosh, what's with the feast?

600
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:43,835
You're going there to hold an exhibition,

601
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:45,874
which means you might not be back next year.

602
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,744
Who knows when we'll get the chance to eat together at our place again?

603
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:51,240
This is nothing compared to what I had in mind.

604
00:44:51,415 --> 00:44:53,381
It's not much, but I hope you enjoy.

605
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:55,680
Call me if you ever come to Paris.

606
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,985
Isn't that a given?

607
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,785
When that day comes, I'll be the one taking over your bed.

608
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:02,820
You don't need to drive me to the airport.

609
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:06,120
It's my job to always see you off and greet you.

610
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:07,461
Oh, I see.

611
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:10,590
Is it because you want to go with Ms. Ha?

612
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:12,601
Fine, you punk.

613
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:16,001
Gosh, everything looks delicious.

614
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:19,974
Do Hoon, did you order the food?

615
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:21,814
The soup is hot, so be careful when you eat it.

616
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:23,175
Be honest with me.

617
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:24,370
You caught me.

618
00:45:25,585 --> 00:45:27,410
I'm going to eat the acorn jelly salad first.

619
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:31,311
It's really good.

620
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,021
What? Ms. Ha.

621
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:44,660
- What are you doing? - I'm cleaning my desk.

622
00:45:46,736 --> 00:45:48,401
Did you make up your mind?

623
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,970
Yes.

624
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:54,644
Are you really going to start your own company?

625
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:57,044
Young Eun, we need to be in sync.

626
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,280
You can't just empty your desk without telling us.

627
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:02,155
Everyone, let's begin cleaning out our desks.

628
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:03,751
You guys aren't going anywhere.

629
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,751
You guys should stay at Sono.

630
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,800
Resignation Letter, Ha Young Eun

631
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,211
What is this?

632
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:31,640
I'm sorry, sir.

633
00:46:31,946 --> 00:46:33,280
Young Eun.

634
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:37,081
Thank you so much for everything you've done for me.

635
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:42,651
Are you sure you won't regret it?

636
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:46,990
I might.

637
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:53,101
But if I don't do this,

638
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:58,070
I might end up regretting it even more.

639
00:47:26,236 --> 00:47:27,901
Departures

640
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,941
You are here on the Departures Hall.

641
00:48:04,806 --> 00:48:06,041
You came.

642
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:07,970
Yes.

643
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,114
Mom.

644
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,955
Hey, Ji Min.

645
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:05,154
Did you have fun?

646
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:09,328
Mom, I went to the bathroom all by myself today.

647
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,238
Good for you.

648
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,705
I also told my teacher that I tied my hair all by myself.

649
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,105
Ji Min.

650
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,134
One day, when you come back from kindergarten,

651
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:23,808
I might not be home.

652
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:24,975
Why not?

653
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,089
I'm really exhausted and sleepy,

654
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,848
so I might have to go and get some sleep.

655
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:32,154
Take me with you.

656
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,629
You can't come.

657
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,654
You need to be 100 years old.

658
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,855
Until then, eat well...

659
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,864
and grow tall.

660
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,095
You can take your time.

661
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,069
But you're not 100 years old.

662
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,634
I know. But I'm so tired and sleepy.

663
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,535
I think it's because I didn't eat well.

664
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,575
So make sure you don't ever get picky with food.

665
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,375
- Okay? - Okay.

666
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,214
Good girl.

667
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:12,325
You're such a good girl. I love you.

668
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,595
Is it really that serious?

669
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:25,105
Director Hwang.

670
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:01,375
I came to tell you something.

671
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,314
Just because I'm not going with you...

672
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,444
doesn't mean I don't love you enough,

673
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,685
and it's not because I have no trust in us.

674
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,384
My love for you...

675
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,924
remains the same.

676
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,234
At first,

677
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:33,375
I wasn't sure about the love I had for you.

678
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,145
But...

679
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,544
thanks to you,

680
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,114
I learned that this could work.

681
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,495
That was amazing!

682
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,964
Thanks to your love,

683
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:06,774
I was able to experience something new.

684
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:10,444
You helped me achieve things...

685
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,314
that I never thought I could achieve.

686
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,785
Thank you.

687
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:25,495
Thank you.

688
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,234
You made me so happy.

689
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,734
Our love was overwhelming.

690
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:45,575
I know.

691
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,915
Thank you, Jae Guk.

692
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,955
Thank you for loving me.

693
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,524
Thank you for teaching me how to love.

694
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,495
I will no longer be scared.

695
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:04,964
I will remember how passionately we loved each other...

696
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,995
and use that memory...

697
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,035
to continue on with my life.

698
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,035
That's it. Pull it.

699
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:47,078
Good. Put the hairband...

700
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:48,705
What is this?

701
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,605
Woori Kindergarten

702
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,114
Ji Min.

703
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:55,149
An everlasting love...

704
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,718
- Tell your teacher to leave out... - isn't about staying together.

705
00:53:57,719 --> 00:53:59,314
- the fried egg in your fried rice. - Okay.

706
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:01,658
It's about how much that love changes you.

707
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:03,328
Okay. Oh, right.

708
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:05,058
It's about living...

709
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:07,198
- Let me teach you how to dance. - the rest of your life...

710
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,229
based on the lessons you learned...

711
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,595
from the love you once shared.

712
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:17,134
Soo Ho.

713
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,605
I'm glad we fell in love with each other.

714
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,314
I promised you...

715
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,814
to protect you no matter what.

716
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,285
I promised to be your guardian fairy.

717
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:38,855
I'm sorry I couldn't keep that promise.

718
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,935
You are my guardian fairy.

719
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,268
Whenever I came home angry because of someone,

720
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:52,834
you always took my side.

721
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:57,049
Whenever I got upset because things didn't go my way,

722
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,245
you drank beer with me.

723
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:01,049
Whenever I got angry,

724
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,544
you made ridiculous jokes and made me laugh.

725
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,055
Whenever I was happy,

726
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,725
you always got even more excited.

727
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,024
You were...

728
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,095
my guardian fairy.

729
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,935
I'm sorry you have to leave on your own.

730
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,075
I'm sorry...

731
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:31,915
that I can't go with you.

732
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:37,114
Take good care of Ji Min.

733
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:42,625
I'm sorry for leaving you behind and making you do all the work.

734
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:46,024
Watch over us.

735
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:48,395
When we meet again,

736
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,595
let's make sure to recognize each other right away.

737
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,064
Okay, let's do that.

738
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,154
I want you to mourn for no more than three days.

739
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,024
After that, I want you to put the past behind you...

740
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:20,654
and begin living your life.

741
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,464
There are times when it rains.

742
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,105
There are times when the sky is clear.

743
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,944
Just like that, remember that I was once a part of your life.

744
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,455
The sadness you feel...

745
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,694
will only be temporary.

746
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:01,294
The loneliness you feel will not be with you for long.

747
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,654
Don't let yourself get too emotional.

748
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,225
I just hope that you will sometimes...

749
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,595
remember me from time to time.

750
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,165
Then...

751
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:33,634
continue to carry on with your life.

752
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:45,134
Jeon Mi Sook rests here.

753
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,625
Let us take a moment to give her a silent prayer.

754
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,214
Jeon Mi Sook rests here.

755
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:32,055
I hope you watch over us. Let's meet again.

756
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,464
Goodbye.

757
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:28,178
Ji Min, you're going to be late.

758
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:30,404
- It's time to go to kindergarten. - Okay, Auntie.

759
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,058
Auntie, did I do a better job of tying my hair than yesterday?

760
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:42,455
Say goodbye to your mommy.

761
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:46,654
See you later, Mom.

762
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,209
I'm sorry I keep asking you for help.

763
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,745
I have a meeting this morning.

764
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,178
Go on.

765
01:01:07,179 --> 01:01:10,044
I'll make sure Ji Min gets to kindergarten safely.

766
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:11,484
Thank you.

767
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,259
Ji Min, don't forget to tell your teacher...

768
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,029
I'm allergic to eggs.

769
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,859
I can't eat fried eggs.

770
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,229
Please leave out the eggs in the gimbap.

771
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,464
Is there anything else I can eat other than sponge cake?

772
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,024
- Okay. - Okay.

773
01:01:24,269 --> 01:01:26,464
I'll see you later. Thank you.

774
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,035
Let's go.

775
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:32,105
Goodness, the weather is great. Don't you think so?

776
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:34,674
Gosh, your ribbon is pretty.

777
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,475
I wore it so my mom can see me.

778
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,975
She'll easily be able to find you.

779
01:01:41,179 --> 01:01:42,645
Ji Min.

780
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,359
I'm allergic to eggs.

781
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,388
I can't eat fried eggs.

782
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:51,384
Please leave out the eggs in the gimbap.

783
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:53,698
Is there anything else I can eat other than sponge cake?

784
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:55,765
We have other snacks. Let's go inside.

785
01:01:57,769 --> 01:01:59,435
Everlasting love...

786
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:03,165
is about becoming a part of your loved one's life.

787
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:12,004
A part of you lives inside them and stays there forever.

788
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:16,189
Reports, Business Results for Quarter 1 and 2

789
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,544
FW Dress Designs, SS Blouse Designs

790
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,325
Young Eun.

791
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,395
I mean, Ms. Ha. What did I just hear?

792
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:36,834
You're leaving by yourself?

793
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,038
Ms. Nam, starting from tomorrow, check the sales log...

794
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:41,279
as soon as you come to work.

795
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,549
I'll talk to HR...

796
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,205
and have them send you a detailed report.

797
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:45,614
Listen, you brat.

798
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:48,575
I mean, Ms. Ha.

799
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,218
Sun Ju, if you ever find wrinkles in the fabric,

800
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:53,788
or the color isn't right,

801
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:55,218
make sure you notify the Manufacturing Team,

802
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:56,725
Sales Team, and Development Team.

803
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,558
It's best to gather everyone and solve the issue on the spot...

804
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,725
to keep things quick and accurate.

805
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,524
Ms. Ha, are you sure about your decision?

806
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:05,665
It's not too late to change your mind.

807
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,569
I'll talk to President Hwang...

808
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,734
and convince him to let you stay.

809
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,308
Chi Hyung and So Young.

810
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:14,334
Keep the sample room neat and organized.

811
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,549
Also, make sure the magnetic buttons are stored...

812
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,015
separately from each other to prevent scratches.

813
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,479
Young Eun, what's with you?

814
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,879
You were offered to take Sono.

815
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,549
The answer should've been a yes or no.

816
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,584
Why is it that you always come up with unexpected answers?

817
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:37,265
Instead of leaving with Sono,

818
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,595
I just decided to leave by myself.

819
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,234
Can I ask you why?

820
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:44,738
There are designs I've always wanted to introduce to the world...

821
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:47,435
but was always scared to do so.

822
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:50,504
I was scared I might fail,

823
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,745
and it felt unnecessary to walk a difficult path.

824
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,544
I convinced myself to settle with what I had.

825
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,024
I just came up with excuses because I wasn't confident.

826
01:04:03,389 --> 01:04:06,625
But now, I want to give it a try.

827
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,924
Does that mean you're confident now?

828
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,499
I'm still nervous and worried.

829
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,435
But now, I have the courage to put things to action...

830
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,404
even if that means I might fail.

831
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,305
You'll have freedom,

832
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,645
but it won't be easy.

833
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,285
I'm determined.

834
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,114
Okay, I understand what you mean.

835
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,555
I'm not surprised.

836
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,595
Thank you.

837
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,774
I met someone,

838
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,745
and I loved him.

839
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,814
Although we couldn't be together,

840
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,984
our love showed me the way...

841
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:12,725
and helped me walk that path.

842
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,825
That is how...

843
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:19,165
love continues...

844
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:21,895
and lasts forever.

845
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,415
Special thanks to Kim Jung Young for her special appearance

846
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:08,178
Now, We Are Breaking Up

847
01:06:08,179 --> 01:06:10,415
What did you just say?

848
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,988
- Why? - I want to start doing...

849
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:16,924
what I've always wanted to do but was too scared to try.

850
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:18,658
You did all this?

851
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:20,799
This design is too good to keep to myself.

852
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,569
Then how about I do another fashion show?

853
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,928
This time, you should do it in Paris.

854
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:25,198
You're going to do what?

855
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:26,799
I don't know how long it's going to take.

856
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,038
But this time, I want to do this myself.

857
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,038
Haven't you heard from Jae Guk?

858
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,839
He isn't the type to call just to ask how you're doing.

859
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,808
They decided to end it.

860
01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:39,274
It's up to them to decide whether to get back together or not.

861
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,549
I miss her.

862
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,015
One day, I hope I see you...

863
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:47,384
standing in the corner of a street just like that day.
