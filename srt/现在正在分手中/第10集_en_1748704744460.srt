She was distraught for ten years.

4
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,127
And I was devastated, seeing her go through that.

5
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:31,096
Which is why...

6
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,307
your daughter should stop.

7
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,076
It's not my daughter's fault.

8
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:38,837
It takes two to tango.

9
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:40,647
You know what happened that day.

10
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:44,776
If you feel sorry at all, you shouldn't be like this.

11
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,417
I should feel sorry? Why?

12
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:51,587
You should be begging me on your knees now, if anything.

13
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:55,131
Do you know how long Young Eun waited for him in the rain?

14
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,060
Because of a man she should've never crossed paths with,

15
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:59,831
she had to give up the bright future she had.

16
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,667
She wasted ten years of her life and had to give up so much!

17

My son...

18
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,406
died that day.

19
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,581
He left when he got a call from your daughter...

20
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:15,906
and never came home.

21
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:20,486
Ten years? You're upset about that?

22
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:23,787
I can't even see...

23
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,156
or touch my child.

Fine.

If she can't understand us,

28
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,187
that's fine too.

29
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:01,426
But does it mean...

30
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,826
we can't love each other? Is that enough of a reason?

31
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:10,437
I don't know if it is.

32
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,281
He was two when I married my husband,

33
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:18,836
and I embraced him as my own.

34
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:20,676
And that is why...

35
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,576
my heart utterly breaks whenever I think about him.

36
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,516
Please stop her.

37
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:31,417

I love you.

50

- wants to start a new chapter. - Yes.

51
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,016
Pretty nice, right?

52
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,886
Yes, it's nice.

Aren't you a leading PR expert? Put some thought into it.

I see that you haven't totally lost your reason yet.

I want to live and work where she is so I can be with her...

Who knows?

72
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,337
This could lead to something.

Why don't you try something new too?

74
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,077
You never know. It could lead to something you never even thought of.

75
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,751
- Something new? - I'll open the studio right away,

76
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:37,147
so leave my schedule empty for the time being. Okay?

77
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:06,907
I didn't want to just pass by the building,

78
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,477
so I'm stopping by on my way to work.

79
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,347
I saw this flower that looks just like you.

80
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,046
You look completely different.

81
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,756
Well, do you like it?

82
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,327
This is what I'm talking about. Those big eyes...

83
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,727
and sharp nose.

84
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:28,767
And those smooth lips.

85
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,236
What's with her? Is she sleepy or something?

86
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,106
I'll pick you up later.

87
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:40,606

88
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:42,577
Got it.

89
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,196
How did it go? Did it work?

90
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,866
She dozed off a little.

91
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:03,537
What? She dozed off?

92
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:07,606
Since all this has already happened, why don't you just shave your head?

93
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:10,977
I can't. I haven't adjusted to this hairstyle yet.

94
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,111
You're taking her out on a date in the evening, right?

95
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:17,446
Yes, I did tell her that I'd pick her up later.

96
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:23,017
I started out in a tiny store space, and there were...

97
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:25,917
dozens of fabric stores like mine in Dongdaemun alone.

98
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,731
Over the years,

99
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,900
some of them went out of business,

100
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,760
and some were sold off.

101
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,267
However, I grew my business to what The One is today.

102
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,801

What matters is how you get your job done.

106
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:47,847
What do you mean, sir?

107
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:53,647
Whether this will end in two months or keep going.

108
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:56,017
Report to me again after your date tonight.

109
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:58,787
- Tonight, sir? - There's no need to stall.

110
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,157
You need to convince me...

111
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:04,227
for me to decide whether or not I can count on you.

112
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:09,267
Yes, sir. I will do my very best to earn your trust.

113
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,606
I'm confused.

114
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:23,717
Hey.

115
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:27,587
Would you say kissing is like swimming?

116
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,017
Once you learn it, your body always remembers it.

117
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,616
Sure, you'd remember how to swim if you suddenly fell into a pool.

118
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,756
And it looks like you've fallen head over heels for Mr. Seok.

119
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,227
Gosh, no. Not yet.

120
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,501
So he's taking you out on a date this evening?

121
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,527
His style has totally changed.

122
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:46,097
Seeing him trying so hard when the breakup is predetermined...

123
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,267
reminds me of myself.

124
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,876
You should seriously date him. He's a great guy.

125
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,707
I always have a crush on someone and get rejected, you know.

126
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,417
If I made the first move and got rejected,

127
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,350
I'd have no regrets since I at least got a few dates out of it.

128
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,586
But if I get dumped by someone who likes me,

129
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:06,157
I will be really hurt.

130
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,130
So I'd much rather keep it strictly business.

131
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,956
He's a good guy, and we can stay on good terms.

132
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:16,836
You shouldn't run away.

133
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:20,507
What really hurts is not the broken love,

134
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,206
but the one you love turning their back on you.

135
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,336
That's my advice based on my experience.

136

Shall we have some tteokbokki?

146

So I've decided to change my strategy.

147
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:02,151
I'll keep taking photos until they're happy with the results.

You certainly have no business acumen.

151

People may come, but the business won't be profitable.

152
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:14,391
Oh, I won't enhance or edit any of the photos.

153

so I want to capture the moments candidly.

162
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:47,360
You're right. Even though you can't see them in photos,

163
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,456
you're reminded of how the air felt, smelled, and how happy you were.

Photographs evoke your memories and emotions.

165

166

00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:36,066
If you want to say stuff like that, hand in your resignation first.

180
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:38,507
So many people who want a position like yours...

181
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,380
live on expiring gimbap from convenience stores...

182
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:43,147
and stay up all night to write their cover letters.

183
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,946
Everyone has their own problems and struggles.

184
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:48,617
You pity yourself, thinking you're the only one working hard.

185
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,021
I didn't have to write a cover letter,

186
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,216
so you think my life is easy.

187
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,090
You're awfully prejudiced.

188
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:55,857
Does making excuses help you feel less embarrassed?

189
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:59,326
- What? - It must be hard.

190
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,897
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

191
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,196
What can you do though?

192
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,511
You buy expensive designer clothes in every colour they come in,

193
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,306
but you have no idea...

194
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:11,936
how they're made. You're utterly clueless.

195
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,450
You're out of line.

196
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,380
You try to act all cool and nonchalant...

197
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,147
as if you don't care what people think of you.

198
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,781
But the truth is, you're lazy and all you do is list excuses.

199
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:20,850
Ms. Jung So Young.

200
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,857
Frankly, you're afraid people would find out how incompetent you are.

201
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,826
Let's be honest. I'll be criticized no matter what I do.

202
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,700
Someone already posted about me coming to the warehouse today.

203
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:36,367
"Will that spoiled boy be able to handle it?"

204
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,497
People criticize me even when I do a good job.

205
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,936
Why must I let them walk all over me when I know what will happen?

206
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,507
If you want to keep that victim mentality, go for it.

207
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,546
But here, you're just a junior colleague of mine,

208
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,277
so be quiet and get your job done.

209
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,216
Hey, Jung So Young.

210
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:06,730
I am your supervisor.

211
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:07,826
Whatever.

212
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:10,836
When we're alone, you're just Jung So Young.

213
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:30,761
You do it, Mom!

214
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:33,186
No, you do it. You have to do it on your own.

215
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,031
No, you do it.

216
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,426
You can't watch the cartoon until you do it.

217
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,296
What are you doing?

218
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,537
- Auntie... - Don't look at Auntie Young Eun.

219
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:48,541
Put on your tights, tie your hair up,

220
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,980
put on your jacket, and zip it up.

221
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,407
Then come and show me.

222
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,580
If you don't do it properly, you'll have to do it all over again.

223
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:55,706
No!

224
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,377
Get up. Now!

225
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,090
- Mi Sook. - Young Eun, you should leave.

226
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,287
Jeon Mi Sook.

227
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm going to count to 100.

228
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:07,031
If you're not done by then,

229
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,826
you can't watch any cartoons for ten days. Okay?

230
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,330
It's okay. Ji Min, it's okay. Don't cry.

231
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,137
Gosh, don't cry. It's okay.

232
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:25,107
I have to go home and make dinner for my kid. Make it quick.

233
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,306
Are you really going to quit like this?

234
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,617
I was a jerk.

235
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:32,816
I must've been out of my mind.

236
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:36,720
It's too late, but I have to snap out of it.

237
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:38,720
Are you really not going to come to work?

238
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:42,027
I told you. My wife needs me now.

239
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:46,296
Then what about me?

240
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:50,566
We're near my house.

241
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,936
They put me in charge of La Fayere.

242
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,706
I can't do it alone. I need you.

243
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,206
You know that I'm still a total beginner in French.

244
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:01,346
Mr. Seok put me in charge, but what if I do a bad job?

245
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:04,216
What do I do? I'm a contract worker.

246
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:08,086
Is that why you've been wanting to see me?

247
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,157
I still need you.

248
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,627
I told you to pack your things to take to the hospital.

249
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,397
Why yell at Ji Min?

250
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:23,127
She'll have to do everything on her own when I'm gone.

251
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,897
I should teach her when I still can be around.

252
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,037
- Mi Sook. - Young Eun.

253
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:32,737
At times, I get so angry because I think it's so unfair.

254
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,176
What did I do wrong?

255
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,476
Why me?

256
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,346
What's Ji Min going to do? Why does it have to be me?

257
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,686
She can't even put on her socks on her own. What am I going to do?

258
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,657
Why is this happening to me?

259
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:51,456
So why are you doing this?

260
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:54,931
Ji Min has no idea. Why must you be so mean to her?

261
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,897
Because I've had a wake-up call.

262
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,037
I can't just sit around and keep on complaining.

263
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,171
I don't have time for that. I have so much to do.

264
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,407
I have to take care of everything in this household.

265
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,277
Those who are left behind have to live their lives...

266
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,476
based on their memories of those who are gone.

267
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,521
Don't make Ji Min remember you...

268
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,617
as a scary, angry mom.

269
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:17,157
My body...

270
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,757
keeps sending me messages by making me feel pain.

271
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,527
That I should hurry...

272
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:26,997
because the clock's ticking.

273
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:31,066
That's why I feel rushed.

274
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:40,041
Why is it that I have so much to do?

275
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,176
Oh, right.

276
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,321
I want to take some photos before I lose more weight...

277
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:45,877
from my chemotherapy.

278
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,590
- Photos? - I haven't taken any photos...

279
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:52,617
except for some selfies since Ji Min was born.

280
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:56,291
Soo Ho would just blow up the photo on my ID card...

281
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,397
and use that for my funeral.

282
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,926
That photo will be on display for three days.

283
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:04,596
Hey, I don't want that. It'll be so embarrassing.

284
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,907
- Mi Sook. - I want...

285
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:12,507
to look really pretty in my funeral portrait.

286
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,647
If I was smiling in the photo, it'd be even better.

287
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,426
Is there a restaurant here?

288
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:46,307
Don't tell me...

289
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:51,117
we're going to walk all the way up there now.

290
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,276
We have to leave the car here.

291
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:01,991
Try them on. This model is a limited-edition.

292
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:05,696
I could get my hands on them because I'm the CEO of Vision PR.

293
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,067
There.

294
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:21,506
- I can tie them myself. - My pleasure.

295
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,526
Well...

296
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:38,557
Let's go.

297
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,097
- Are you serious? - Yes.

298
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,867
- Have you never been up there? - Never.

299
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,536
When I was young, we came here on a field trip.

300
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:06,387
There's a cable car?

301
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,186
It's nice to walk, isn't it?

302
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:12,426
Do I look like I'm enjoying this right now?

303
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:15,370
I thought long and hard where I should take you on our first date.

304
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,837
This guy and I really don't click.

305
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:19,966
We're almost there. Let's go.

306
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,307
What is it?

307
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:28,107
This is way too high.

308
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:47,297
Well, there are cable cars and buses.

309
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:51,137
We took the hard way when there were much easier options.

310
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,536
I wanted to.

311
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:56,837
Why? Why on earth?

312
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:00,877
Because I wanted to take a long walk with you.

313
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:03,147
I'm in...

314
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,746
a one-sided love right now.

315
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:09,117
What are you talking about?

316
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:14,090
This is all for show. We signed a contract, remember?

317
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,660
You can keep it strictly business.

318
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,786
I'll just let myself...

319
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,256
be in this one-sided love.

320
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,701
You can dump me whenever you want to.

321
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:27,407
But I'll never dump you first.

322
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:42,186
That's so cute. Give me the lock. I'll do it.

323
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,256
No, I want to throw it.

324
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:46,016
Okay, you do it then.

325
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,731
(Seok Do Hoon, Hwang Chi Sook)

326
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:50,426
No, over there.

327
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:52,357
Okay. Here we go.

328
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:55,827
I threw it. Did you see it?

329
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,676
Remember where the lock is.

330
00:20:12,822 --> 00:20:15,946
When you want to dump me, you can unlock it and throw it away.

331
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:23,226
My pulse is going through the roof.

332
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,026
It's because I walked so far.

333
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:29,827
That's it. That's all it is.

334
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:32,637
There.

335
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:51,456
(My Home: Someone tried to enter)

336
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,526
It was you, Mom?

337
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:02,127
Open the door.

338
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,966
Why didn't you call?

339
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,577
Why are you here this late without calling ahead?

340
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:22,246
I wanted to have a drink with you and spend the night here.

341
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,761
What about Dad?

342
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,057
He's not a child.

343
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,226
He doesn't fear thieves or ghosts.

344
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,701
You can hold your drink.

345
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:41,107
I used to drink it from the bottle.

346
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:44,440
I pretended to be demure because of your dad.

347
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,206
Because you were a vice-principal's wife?

348
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,206
I have just one pair of eyes,

349
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,051
but hundreds of pairs watch me.

350
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:54,246
Who knows which of them have a hidden agenda?

351
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:58,956
I didn't dare litter the street.

352
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,526
You went through a lot. You deserve a drink.

353
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:07,797
I didn't do it because I liked it. I did it because I had no choice.

354
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:12,436
You just had to come to me right then.

355
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:14,766
Is it my fault?

356
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,077
No.

357
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,847
I was blinded by love then.

358
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,716
After a while,

359
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,887
I ended up resenting my dead mom.

360
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,057
She should've tried harder to stop me.

361
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:43,766
She could've shaved my head and grounded me.

362
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:48,167
Then maybe I'd have had a career,

363
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:51,407
learned of the world out there,

364
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:55,246
and lived differently.

365
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:02,147
Young Eun.

366
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:08,256
This is wrong. Don't walk this path.

367
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:12,196
Don't go there.

368
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:16,597
Mom.

369
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,837
I heard he died.

370
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:30,716
I opened a photo studio.

371
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:32,946
And have an ongoing opening event.

372
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,221
Learning to run a business is a good experience.

373
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,420
Do it for a while to learn how things work,

374
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,786
then rejoin the company.

375
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:43,996
"Can I do something like this here?"

376
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,961
"Even if strangers look at me,"

377
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,726
"can I not mind that at all?"

378
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:52,036
It went better than I thought.

379
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:55,407
Today, all day long, I waited for customers.

380
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:01,246
You should stop suffering,

381
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:04,347
holding onto Soo Wan,

382
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:08,047
and let him go now.

383
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:11,786
I can't do that because he's my son.

384
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:15,526
As a mother, there is no way I can...

385
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,397
forget about him.

386
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,897
She won't accept you.

387
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:31,107
I wouldn't be able to if I were her.

388
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,607
He and I are the ones in love.

389
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:36,907
We won't care what strangers say.

390
00:24:36,982 --> 00:24:38,617
Are parents strangers?

391
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:41,317
Can you live without us?

392
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:43,347
If you do,

393
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:47,157
that won't be any good for you at all.

394
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:50,461
For the rest of your life, you will live with the guilt...

395
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:52,627
for making him cut ties with his mother.

396
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:56,067
He will have to watch you feel bad,

397
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,400
and feel bad about that.

398
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:00,266
I did nothing wrong.

399
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:02,637
Why should I feel guilty and sorry?

400
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:06,011
It's her choice not to accept us and turn away from us.

401
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:07,476
Young Eun.

402
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:10,706
That day ten years ago,

403
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:15,286
do you know what hurt me the most?

404
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,387
That he never called back?

405
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,057
That I got ditched?

406
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,387
No, Mom.

407
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:27,157
It was having to end the relationship...

408
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:28,726
when it wasn't over for me.

409
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:34,736
I still loved him so much,

410
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,577
but couldn't see him.

411
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:40,206
That was insanely hard.

412
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:45,016
And you want me to do that again?

413
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,047
Right now, you think you can't do it.

414
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:52,357
You think it will always be rosy and sweet like right now.

415
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:55,360
It won't. When life gets harder,

416
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:59,327
you'll want to gouge out your eyes for choosing him then.

417
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:00,966
Love?

418
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:05,196
You forget about that to go on living.

419
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,940
"This is how I should live."

420
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,167
You give up the rest to just go on.

421
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,936
Then I will break up with him then.

422
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,946
When he and I both don't feel the same.

423
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,847
When it won't hurt as much to break up.

424
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:24,157
I want to break up then.

425
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:27,657
- Young Eun. - If and when I change,

426
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:30,256
or he wants to call it quits.

427
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:33,726
Unless it's either of the two cases,

428
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:36,966
I can't accept any other reason.

429
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,167
And then waste another ten years?

430
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:45,877
How am I to do that? How?

431
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:01,827
I...

432
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:07,057
don't want you to live like me.

433
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:14,807
If you go against your parents to do what you want,

434
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:19,137
even if it's hard, you won't be able to say so.

435
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:23,107
Watching you wither away...

436
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:27,917
That will upset me.

437
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:31,157
Don't do what you'll regret.

438
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:35,486
It'll be much harder later on to set things right.

439
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,256
Just...

440
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:42,797
suffer a bit now and move on.

441
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:11,397
We want to use polyester or suede made in Korea too.

442
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:14,370
But a lot of times, we can't because of the quality.

443
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,930
Domestic fashion companies bring samples of imported fabrics...

444
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:18,701
and ask us to make exact copies.

445
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,701
Not just that. Don't mention quality...

446
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:24,041
when you pay us a third and give us enough time.

447
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,440
Can you make new textures or new prints?

448
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:29,311
We have the best technology.

449
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,051
There are many companies in Daegu.

450
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:32,850
Lots of them closed down too.

451
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:35,387
Eighty percent of domestic brands use imported fabrics.

452
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:38,756
There's no room for domestic fabric makers to grow.

453
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,961
I'd like to make you a suggestion.

455
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:52,797
The factory manager seems optimistic.

456
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:56,436
But will Head Manager Koh sign off on it?

457
00:28:57,072 --> 00:28:59,206
He'll object at first.

458
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:02,776
But we must still do all we can.

459
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:04,617
I'm tired already.

460
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,680
Get some lunch.

461
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:07,917

You can order something for lunch.

467
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:36,776
You shouldn't leave your studio unoccupied.

468
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:43,047
I brought coffee, so get over here.

469
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:44,587
See you.

470
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,857
Jae Guk will be back soon.

471
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,701
In about 10 or 15 minutes.

472
00:29:55,702 --> 00:29:57,667
You'll have to wait until then.

473
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,297
You're very selfish.

474
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:04,907
Not caring how much the man you love has down-scaled,

475
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:06,910
and how small he has become.

476
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,077
You don't mind that and just care about your happiness.

477
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:12,516
That's not love.

478
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:14,216
It's greed.

00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:18,956

I am dating Yoon Jae Guk,

482
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:24,301
and you are not his fianc��e.

483

Don't cross the line.

484
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:28,966
What you're doing is displeasing and offensive.

485
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,041
You don't seem to know.

486

What else don't I know?

487
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:34,041
He met a woman on a trip...

488
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,407
when he had a fianc��e back home.

489
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:39,706
Do you think his mother would've accepted that?

490
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,011
Yoo Jung. That's enough. Please leave.

491
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:47,251
He couldn't say so, so each time he got your call,

492
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:49,486

That day, for not being able to stop him from leaving,

496
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:59,397
I will live with regret forever.

497
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,827
So this time I'll do my best.

498
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:04,297
You don't want me to cross the line?

499

You're the one who crossed the line.

500

What's your intention?

501
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:25,221
Why are you doing this?

502

00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,496
Do you have any reservations?

535
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,814
I thought I'd need to make a reservation.

536
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,058
- Thanks a lot. - Don't thank me already.

537
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,198
You tend to underestimate me.

538
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:08,029
- There's more? - When her makeup's done,

539
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,638
some fancy sample outfits...

540
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,705
from the 2022 spring collection will arrive.

541
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,308
I'm quite capable when it's not about work.

542
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:19,908
I managed to hire the first beauty creator...

543
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,245
and the pioneer who made K-beauty a thing.

544
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:24,475
Here she is.

545
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,049
Hello, Ms. Hwang.

546
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,288
- Hello. - Hello.

547
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:30,055
- It has been so long. - Yes, it has.

548
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,158
Take extra good care of my friend for me.

549
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,355
You bet I will.

550
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,499
Hello. This must be a special day.

551
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,895
She'll be taking photos today.

552
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,665
You said you wanted to take photos before you started chemotherapy.

553
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,435
Let's do that.

554
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,964
You will be the prettiest today, so let's do that today.

555
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:53,205
Make her super pretty. This photo will last forever.

556
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,575
Yes, of course.

557
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,345
Let's begin.

558
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,075
Okay.

559
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:11,359
It feels like I'm getting my bridal makeup done...

560
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,669
because you two are standing in the back.

561
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,129
Who'd have thought you'd be the first to get married?

562
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,299
I was the fastest runner in our class.

563
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,009
I'm good at cutting the tape.

564
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,609
You looked amazing that day.

565
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,805
I admit that now.

566
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:26,975
Where did that Jeon Mi Sook go?

567
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,078
I don't recognize myself.

568
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,544
Your best day...

569
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,114
is any day that you feel good.

570
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:36,614
If today is a good day, it's your best day too.

571
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,819
She's the first participant in your event,

572
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,225
- so take extra good photos. - I'll deal with that.

573
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,254
- Shall we begin? - Do I stand here?

574
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,325
- Oh, dear. - Can you smile a bit?

575
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,364
- Okay. - Look over there too.

576
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,765
Oh, gosh. Okay.

577
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:57,078
You're going too fast. Give me a moment.

578
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,205
This won't do.

579
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,245
What is it? What are you doing?

580
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,884
There. Move your body to the rhythm.

581
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:09,314
Watch me.

582
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,555
- Okay. - Fine.

583
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,125
Like this?

584
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,355
Be cool.

585
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:25,268
I like this colour. It's different.

586
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,504
- It suits you well. - Do you like it?

587
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,364
- It's good. - Right?

588
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,805
Okay.

589
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,455
Go out and dance on your own.

591
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,834
Young Eun, I feel so good.

592
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:01,569
How's that, Chi Sook?

593
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,274
Do you feel the aura of an ex-model?

594
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,944
You are incredibly pretty.

595
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,714
The photos are amazing.

596
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,314
Darn you.

597
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:19,515
The outfit just had to look as pretty as a flower too.

598
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,495
You're right.

599
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,625
She's like a flower.

600
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,524
Why don't you pose with her?

601
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:30,069
Us too?

602
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,899
Regardless of the number of shots,

603
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,364
I charge five dollars until you're satisfied.

604
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:37,875
Are you ready?

605
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,475
What are you doing?

606
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,709
Let's give it a go.

607
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,515
- What do we do? - Like a Miss Korea.

608
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,774
Oh, gosh.

609
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:52,154
In most of the photos, we are laughing.

610
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,725
Good idea.

611
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,229
Did we laugh because we liked what was happening?

612
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,765
Did we laugh because we were in front of a camera?

613
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,794
What is clear is that...

614
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:10,105
at that moment, we laughed,

615
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,035
and we were happy.

616
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:15,875
That memory...

617
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,785
helps us get through the remaining days.

618
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,558
Why is it my fault Young Eun met him?

619
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,259
What's a woman's most important duty in the house?

620
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,359
A woman's duty is to raise children.

621
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,029
If you had raised her well,

622
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,328
this wouldn't have happened.

623
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:35,399
What did you do?

624
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,399
I inhaled chalk dust my whole life.

625
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,368
Whether it rained or snowed, I did my duty as the breadwinner,

626
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:42,004
and I did nothing to be ashamed of.

627
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,979
You're not ashamed of anything?

628
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,535
You didn't fool around?

629
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,549
Fool around? And do what?

630
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,444
I could live without any laws, and that's how upright I am.

631
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,678
Were you the sole breadwinner?

632
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,884
Who else did anything?

633
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,614
Did you ever earn a single cent?

634
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,018
To make you a senior teacher,

635
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:01,658
I went to the principal's house and helped his wife make kimchi.

636
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:04,759
To make you a head teacher, when their daughter got married,

637
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,194
I prepared all the food gifts to give to her in-laws.

638
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,364
Vice-principal?

639
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,968
The director's dog...

640
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,069
ran away from home when they left a door open.

641
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,709
I looked for it for three days and nights, and found it for them.

642
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,975
Do you think I got promoted because you made some kimchi?

643
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,475
- What a show-off. - I'm showing off?

644
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,375
- I'm showing off? - I shouldn't have brought it up.

645
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:30,558
Where are you from?

646
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,788
I live and work in Jeju.

647
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:33,924
I see.

648
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,654
- Were you born in Jeju? - No, I wasn't.

649
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,294
Because of work...

650
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,334
Hi, Mi Sook. It's me.

651
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,205
Are you doing well?

Mi Sook's on cloud nine.

654
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,979
She'd wanted to model since she was in school,

655
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,518
but she quit after she got married.

656
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,419
She won't stop texting me that she got to model...

657
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,745
for Mr. J at her age.

658
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:03,915
Did you tell her that I don't take photos of just anyone?

659
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,725
Most people would choose to be modest at such a time.

660
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,995
If I'm skilled and humble, that's not charming at all.

(Woori Photo Studio)

662
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,314
- Is that the last thing? - Yes, this is the last thing.

663
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,055
That must be very heavy.

664
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,055
Your face has turned red.

665
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:44,325
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

666
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:48,694
- Does that take one or two tries? - Just one.

What are you doing here?

668

Mom.

00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,174
Do you date her to make her do this?

Come inside, Mother.

671
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:03,645
Don't call me that. I'm not your mother!

Your name is Yoon Jae Guk, right?

Yes.

677
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,595
And you're Soo Wan's little brother?

What do you think you're doing?

680
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,738
Do you think this makes any sense?

681
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,504
What? Because you and Soo Wan weren't biologically related?

682
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,578
Is that why you think this is okay?

I heard you were born out of wedlock.

685
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:44,814
Yes.

686
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,629
You see, I have no interest in having a son-in-law...

687
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,529
who was born out of wedlock.

688
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,598
My daughter deserves more than that.

689
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,129
What are you saying, Mom? What's the matter with you?

690
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,595
Am I wrong? Your father had you with another woman.

691
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,504
Yes. He did.

692
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,908
How dare you think that you deserve my daughter?

693
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:07,109
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize for her behaviour.

694
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,075
She came to see me. It's okay.

695

Mom, you should go. Stop doing this. Let's leave.

Go ahead, ma'am.

697
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:21,285
I may not have been able to give her an abundant life,

698
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,229
but I raised her with so much love.

699
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,698
Her father stood surety for someone he shouldn't have,

700
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:27,629
so we couldn't even pay for her college tuition,

701
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,799
but she worked 3 to 4 part-time jobs...

702
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,665
and took care of everything on her own.

703
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:34,964
All I could do for her was massage her legs,

704
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,535
and I felt wrecked inside.

705
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,375
I couldn't help her out financially when she studied abroad,

706
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:44,518
but she still bought me bags and shoes.

707
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,185
Looking at those gifts tore my heart into pieces...

708
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:50,218
because I knew how hard she had to work for them.

709
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,319
Mom, that's enough. Please.

710
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,285
But regardless of all that, she's still standing strong.

711
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:00,564
I'm so proud and appreciative of that.

712
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:03,468
You have no idea how much I care for my daughter.

713
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:05,868
So who do you think you are to sway her like this?

714
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:09,364
Who do you think you are to make a mess...

715
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,238
of my daughter's life?

716
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,839
Can we please go?

717
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,649
You can talk to me.

718
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,444
Please stop seeing my daughter.

719
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,084
I hope we don't ever meet again. Is that understood?

720
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,225
Is that understood?

(Woori Photo Studio)

722
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:42,904
I did the right thing. It was the right thing to do.

723
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,305
I did what I had to do for my daughter.

724
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:48,105
It was for Young Eun's sake.

725
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,515
Mom.

726
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,355
Mom, what's wrong with you? How could you say all those stuff?

727
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,055
Because I'm your mother.

728
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:03,384
It was so you'd end it once and for all.

729
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,294
Mom.

730
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:08,768
I'm going to divorce your father.

731
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:09,828
What?

732
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:11,964
I'm done living my life as his wife.

733
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,868
But I will always be your mother until the day I die.

734
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:17,709
So I need to do my job as your mother.

735
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,935
I won't let you walk this path.

736

738
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,254
Get in.

739
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,859
Do you want me to walk over to his photo studio again?

740
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,529
If you don't do as I say,

741
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,194
I'll have to make sure he does.

742
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:46,995
Jae Guk, I'm sorry. I need to go.

743
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,864
Get in right now.

744
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:50,305
I'll call you.

747
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:39,355
She wanted to show them to you, so she wore them to bed.

748
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:50,995
She put them on so nicely.

749
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:07,515
She did a great job putting them on with these tiny, little hands.

750
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,984
I'm going to let her watch many cartoon shows.

751
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,064
I'm sorry, my sweetheart.

752
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,904
Thank you, my baby.

753
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:45,614
Thank you.

00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:08,475
Hey.

756
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,975
Why did you want to see me here at this hour?

757
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:16,645
I had a lot on my mind.

758
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,114
What?

759
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,825
I'm a professional...

760
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,864
when it comes to having a crush on someone.

761
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,995
So?

762
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,569
It makes you walk on ice, work too hard,

763
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,904
and you get excited only to get disappointed.

764
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:41,049
I'm not interested in going through that again,

765
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,444
and I don't want anyone going through that because of me either.

766
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:46,475
Okay, so what's your point?

767
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,685
Let's check.

768
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:51,214
Check what?

769
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,084
Forget platonic love.

770
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:07,464
If our hearts don't beat, then we can't call it love.

771
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,939
What was the exact meaning...

772
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,009
behind what you just did?

773
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,518
Life is short, so I won't waste my time contemplating.

774
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:53,145
Let's just go for it.

775
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:55,145
That way, I won't regret it.

776
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,114

00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,794

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,154
Goodness.

779
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,509
Hurrah.

00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,538
(Please do not throw the locks or keys...)

(Ha Young Eun)

786
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,283
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize for her behaviour.

787
00:50:06,498 --> 00:50:09,167
The factory has agreed to accept Ms. Ha's offer...

788
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:12,807
regarding the advance payment for the fabric development.

789
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:14,577
Did I just hear that correctly?

790
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,408
We can't just ask them to manufacture the fabric...

791
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:18,247
without promising securing orders.

792
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,287
If the fabric is good enough, we'll obviously buy it.

793
00:50:20,288 --> 00:50:22,988
We don't ask for any discounts when we buy fabric from abroad,

794
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:26,254
but we always lower the price for domestic fabric.

795
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,858
So how are they supposed to use good thread for better quality?

796
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,327
How will we deal with the loss if the quality isn't good enough?

797
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,128
That's a risk we need to take.

798
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,867
Why don't you just start a charity?

799
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:35,868
Why is that?

800
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,863
If we continue to pay a lot of money for overseas fabric...

801
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:41,508
for the upcoming seasons,

802
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:42,807
the price of our products will go up,

803
00:50:42,808 --> 00:50:44,307
and people will start buying things from abroad directly.

804
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:47,048
I heard the Material Team will also be checking the quality...

805
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:49,378
by consistently communicating with the factory employees.

806
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,414
Good quality will give us a competitive edge.

807
00:50:51,879 --> 00:50:54,113
- Did you hear that? - Pardon?

808
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,144
Oh, yes.

809
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:59,057
- Sir. - You need to stop...

810
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:00,584
blaming the situation and being pessimistic.

811
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:03,584
Kwang Soo, back when we used to sell fabric together,

812
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,957
we saw that domestic fabric can be great in quality too.

813
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,367
Did you forget that already?

814
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,468
No, of course not.

815
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,468
Let's use what's ours to expand to Paris.

816
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,263
That way, we can actually call it K-fashion.

817
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:15,303
Yes, sir.

818
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:19,678
Should we bear in mind the change in fabric...

819
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,048
when we sketch our designs?

820
00:51:21,049 --> 00:51:22,278
- Yes. - You heard that, right?

821
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,374
Yes.

822
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:29,243
(Recents)

823
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:34,287
Why did you buy two today?

824
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,858
Who is it for? Is it for Ms. Ha?

825
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,354
It's for Ms. Jung. It's iced-Americano.

826
00:51:38,898 --> 00:51:39,957
Don't ignore your thirst.

827
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,267
What's going on between you two?

828
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:43,763
Did all that fighting make you grow on each other?

829
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,894
- How cute. - It's not what you think.

830
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:50,104
Are you waiting for a call?

831
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:52,673
No, it's nothing.

832
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:54,704
That's right.

833
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,147
Mom, why do you have to do this?

834
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:58,613
My gosh. Come on.

835
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:01,948
What is that?

(Wife: Kang Jung Ja)

837
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:05,314
- Divorce papers. - What papers?

838
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,457
I was worried that getting a divorce might taint your career,

839
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,057
so I waited until you retired.

840
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:12,298
My job is done, so let's split up.

841
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,299
Why?

842
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,164
I don't want to spend the last years of my life being your caregiver.

843
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:18,263
Then I'd feel really sorry for myself.

844
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,537
I signed everything already.

845
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,363
Once you're done signing them, leave it on the table over there.

846
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,544
Why are you going in that room?

847
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:28,943
Did you not hear me?

848
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:31,544
We're getting a divorce, so we should use different rooms.

849
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:40,258
Maybe choosing premium Korean beef was a bit too much.

850
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:41,684
Stop being absurd.

851
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:44,298
I'll even sell our house to buy the stuff you want to eat.

852
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:47,593
No, you won't. Ji Min needs a house to live in.

853
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:49,593
It's all cooked.

854
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,437
Apparently, you can't eat a lot after chemotherapy...

855
00:52:56,438 --> 00:52:59,303
because you're always throwing up and feeling nauseous.

856
00:52:59,478 --> 00:53:00,878
I should eat properly before the treatment...

857
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:01,879
so I can quickly recover.

858
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,843
I can't eat anything six hours before the treatment, so let's eat.

859
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,414
Eat up.

860
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,184
Don't mind me. It's you who needs to eat.

861
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,553
Okay. I'm eating.

862
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:18,227
By the way, make sure...

863
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,358
you sign Ji Min's assignment book every night before you go to bed.

864
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:22,698
You always forget and then try to sign it in the morning.

865
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,198
Also, watch out for her allergies...

866
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:25,564
and make sure she doesn't eat anything made with egg yolks.

867
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,564
Next week, they're having steamed eggs.

868
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:30,508
On Thursday, they're having sponge cake as a snack.

869
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:31,673
Also,

870
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,943
she's going on a field trip next month...

871
00:53:35,578 --> 00:53:36,803
Are you not coming back?

872
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:39,274
You're only getting hospitalized for a day.

873
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:42,084
Why are you talking to me about next week and next month?

874
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:45,553
Did I do that?

875
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,354
Honey.

876
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:56,524
I'll try hard to get treated.

877
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:58,834
I'm going to try my very best...

878
00:53:59,538 --> 00:54:01,564
for you and Ji Min.

879
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:03,604
So...

880
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,334
don't worry too much.

881
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,374
Okay.

882
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:11,814
Okay. Let's eat.

00:54:33,038 --> 00:54:34,204
One, two, three.

888
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,463
You guys look great.

889
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:41,743
Good!

890
00:54:48,248 --> 00:54:49,783
Okay, great. 1, 2, 3.

891
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,787
(Woori Photo Studio)

892
00:54:56,788 --> 00:54:57,827
I hope you come again.

893
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,693
- Thank you. - Bye.

894
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:06,033
Hey, you're here.

895
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:20,914
Did you have to wait for a long time?

896
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,084
I think my first customer from yesterday brought me luck.

897
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,684
Thanks to that, I had a lot of customers today.

898
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:32,028
Some people even came to get a family photo taken...

899
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,193
Jae Guk.

900
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:35,993
Why do you seem completely okay?

901
00:55:39,598 --> 00:55:41,334
Why didn't you call me?

902
00:55:42,668 --> 00:55:44,633
Why aren't you saying anything to me...

903
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:47,374
even after you heard all that from my mom?

904
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:50,144
You should have said something to me already.

905
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:52,878
"What's wrong with your mother?"

906
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:54,713
"How could she say that to me?"

907
00:55:54,748 --> 00:55:59,984
Why didn't you call, come see me, or get angry about what happened?

908
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:01,883
Why aren't you doing anything?

909
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,553
It's not like what she said was wrong.

910
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,093
Jae Guk.

911
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:11,093
It's okay. I've heard it a lot.

912
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:15,064
Some said it to me directly.

913
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,374
Some said it to me with their eyes.

914
00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:23,974
But it's true that my dad had me by cheating with another woman.

915
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:30,084
But it wasn't your fault. You can't just be okay with that.

916
00:56:32,118 --> 00:56:33,754
She's angry at me.

917
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,283
Why would you let people condemn you for that?

918
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:40,024
You did nothing wrong, so why would you put up with that?

919
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:43,763
She's saying things that no one has ever said to me before.

920
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,263
Is it for me?

921
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,763
If that's why you're putting up with this,

922
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:51,033
let's just break up.

923
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:54,178
If you're going to get hurt like this...

924
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:56,073
without even putting up a fight,

925
00:56:58,379 --> 00:56:59,774
I'd rather just end this.

926
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:06,053
(Woori Photo Studio)

927
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:20,734
And how could you be so carefree about opening a photo studio here?

928
00:57:21,268 --> 00:57:23,568
Who opens a studio in an alleyway where no cars can come in?

929
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:25,573
What kind of photo studio doesn't even have a parking lot?

930
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:27,077
How will you get any customers?

931
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,903
Why are you so foolish?

932
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,943
Why are you so nonchalant about everything?

933
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:34,213
She won't stop being angry at me.

934
00:57:36,188 --> 00:57:37,553
I think I've finally met...

935
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,254
the one.

936
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,454
I think I've finally met...

937
00:57:46,228 --> 00:57:47,463
my true love.

938
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:52,263
I love you.

939
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:58,104
I'm going to get angry if I'm not happy with things.

940
00:57:59,038 --> 00:58:00,303
I said I love you.

941
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:04,443
I'm going to get angry...

942
00:58:05,478 --> 00:58:06,713
even when things get tough for you.

943
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:11,684
I will still love you.

944
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,153
If you do this again,

945
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,863
I swear I won't forgive you.

946
00:58:22,828 --> 00:58:25,064
I love you, Young Eun.

947
00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:32,934
I will always...

948
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:38,374
love you.

949
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:45,283
If you insist on staying with Jae Guk,

950
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:47,153
I will...

951
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:50,224
no longer be around.

952
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,153
What do you mean?

953
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:56,597
He will feel guilty for the rest of his life...

954
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:58,193
because of you.

955
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:00,934
But if you're still confident that you'll be happy, then go ahead.

956
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,104
I really mean it.

957
00:59:06,478 --> 00:59:07,977
I'm a mother,

958
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,173
so there's nothing I can't do for my child.

959
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:12,173
So tell me.

960
00:59:12,879 --> 00:59:14,073
What will you choose to do?

961
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,013
Me too.

962
00:59:22,629 --> 00:59:24,084
I, too,

963
00:59:26,299 --> 00:59:27,963
will always love you.

964
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:15,044
(Special thanks to Jung Saem Mool for making a special appearance)

965
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:42,463
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

966
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,108
What's going on all of a sudden?

967
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:46,838
Apparently, a certain foreign company is interested...

968
01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:48,948
in one of the leading fashion companies in Korea.

969
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,207
What do you mean? Me?

970
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:51,278
What would you want to do with me...

971
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:53,448
if we didn't have much time left to spend together?

972
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,687
Nothing lasts forever.

973
01:00:54,688 --> 01:00:57,144
What kind of funeral are you going to give me?

974
01:00:57,248 --> 01:01:01,028
Can you just plan a party instead while I'm still alive?

975
01:01:01,029 --> 01:01:03,823
All I need is for you to come back.

976
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,458
I can't believe this.

977
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:06,858
When can you give me an answer?

978
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:08,327
Are you really not coming?

979
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:11,167
This is a very important project for Ms. Ha and Sono.

980
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,097
We can't accept the terms given to us by La Fayere?

981
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:14,867
Young Eun, go ahead and try everything you want.

982
01:01:14,868 --> 01:01:16,104
You have my full support.

983
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:18,937
Do you have a date with Cookie today?

984
01:01:18,938 --> 01:01:23,443
I'm going to show Do Hoon the true excitement of dating.

985
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:25,818
Are you really not going to give up?

986
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:28,783
- Probably. - Even if you lose everything?

987
01:01:31,018 --> 01:01:33,888
I told her that it can't happen.

988
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:36,187
Why would you tell that to my daughter?

989
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:38,597
- Jae Guk. - How could you say that to her?

990
01:01:38,598 --> 01:01:39,758
How could you say that?

991
01:01:39,759 --> 01:01:42,028
Can't you listen to me?

992
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,224
Jae Guk.

993
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:45,633
I'm sorry.

994
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:48,334
I'm sorry.
