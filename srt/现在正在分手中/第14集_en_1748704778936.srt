CEO Room

2
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,558
This is Olivier's offer.

3
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:18,929
He would like you to come to Paris and work with him.

4
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:24,598
The dream I gave up on ten years ago...

5
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,698
because I fell in love with someone.

6
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:30,868
He's been appointed DPHP's head director,

7
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,309
so he's trying to recruit top talents.

8
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:36,749
I think he was very impressed with your buyer show.

9
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:38,952
Ten years have passed since then and...

10
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:42,323
They'd like you to manage their luxury brand, Duchamp.

11
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:45,422
If you accept the offer, they'll be happy to provide you...

12
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:48,288
with an apartment, a car, and even sales incentives.

13
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:51,628
What should I tell them?

14
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:55,029
Now, that dream is asking me once again...

15
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,729
what kind of choice I'll make this time.

16
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:02,969
If we ever cross paths again by chance,

17
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,639
then I won't make any excuses.

18
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:11,408
I'll just try to believe that we were meant to be.

19
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:13,419
Okay.

20
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,119
When and if that happens,

21
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:19,559
please do that.

22
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:31,298
What should I choose? And what should I let go?

23
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:35,809
How do I know when I should choose...

24
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:38,038
or let go of something?

25
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:42,209
Is there such a thing as perfect timing?

26
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,722
"It's always about timing."

27
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:46,723
If it's too soon, no one understands.

Episode 14

32
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:37,972
To replace the domestic brands in Zone D on the third floor,

33
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,343
we'll get Le Noir and Maison Mihabert.

34
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,643
We're negotiating the details with them at the moment.

35
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:45,908
How are the womenswear brands' numbers looking for this quarter?

36
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:48,782
Compared to last year, it's gone down by 12 percent.

37
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:52,679
Sono is the only brand whose sales numbers have grown.

38
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,728
Have we heard from Sono yet?

39
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:07,002
As for the fee, they'll charge what famous foreign brands pay,

40
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,502
so it'll be brought down to 20 percent.

41
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:11,933
I can't believe we have the upper hand on a department store.

42
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:15,138
Can they also give us a spot in front of the upward escalator?

43
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,809
Yes, they already offered.

44
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:22,008
They're giving us a prime spot, so we'll be expected to sell a lot.

45
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,613
We don't have to do it if you don't want to.

46
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,523
They want to partner with us because we're doing well.

47
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:28,822
Someone who breaks a contract once is capable of doing it again.

48
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:32,489
Ms. Ha, I respect your opinion, 100 percent.

49
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:36,858
What's gotten into you? This is so unlike you.

50
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:40,858
Ms. Ha, you're an indispensable asset to The One.

51
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,029
I highly value your opinion.

52
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,698
What do you say, Young Eun? What do you want to do?

53
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:50,369
What do you think we should do? Stay at Hills or not?

54
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:53,179
I think we should stay.

55
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:57,352
They have to use sales numbers to evaluate each brand.

56
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:59,583
We'll have to increase our sales quota,

57
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,653
but landing such a prime spot on these conditions...

58
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:04,193
It'll set an example for other domestic brands.

59
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,448
I knew you'd be the bigger person.

60
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,763
Shin Yoo Jung insulted you,

61
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:10,828
yet you're graciously putting the company's profit and pride first.

62
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,028
You're really cool, Ms. Ha.

63
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,258
My gosh, I can't get used to this.

64
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,898
Do the people in Paris want to take Young Eun?

65
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:23,369
Why? Am I putting you on the spot?

66
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:26,213
I don't feel comfortable...

67
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,439
sharing this with Ms. Ha's boss first because...

68
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:31,208
How should I put this? I feel like I'm betraying her trust.

69
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:33,078
So someone does want to recruit her.

70
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,018
Who is it? Is it Olivier?

71
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:37,818
I'm sorry, sir.

72
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:41,018
Well, then we'll stay.

73
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:43,088
Let's do that, sir.

74
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:47,528
If you're confident that you can protect our pride, go for it.

75
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,628
What's next on the agenda?

76
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:57,669
- My gosh. - Isn't it so amazing?

77
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:00,482
Finally, Hills has surrendered.

78
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,453
We made this happen with our clothes without lobbying them or anything.

79
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:05,453
The Sono team can take full credit for this, right?

80
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:08,119
Yes, of course. 100 percent!

81
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:11,888
I'm really proud that I'm one of Sono's designers.

82
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,588
- Thank you, Ms. Ha. - Thank you.

83
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:16,729
Very cool, sister.

84
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:26,138
Olivier contacted us again today.

85
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:29,739
I'll let them know that you'll decide...

86
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,508
by the end of the week.

87
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:57,032
As you know, Duchamp only does haute couture collections.

88
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,802
You've been mainly doing pret-a-porter collections,

89
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,968
so it'll be a new experience for you.

90
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,143
That reminds me, Ms. Ha.

91
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:07,643
We should start working on our image map for the next season.

92
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,182
I have some images that I've pulled.

93
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,713
I'll email them to you.

94
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:13,349
Oh, can I send you my ideas too?

95
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:16,749
Sure thing. Show me what you've got.

96
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,349
- Okay! - Okay!

97
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:27,429
Nice, that's great. Could you move to the side?

98
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,568
Great.

99
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,609
You're here. Give me a moment.

100
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:39,068
Get in line behind me.

101
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:41,809
He has so many appointments today. It'll be a while.

102
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:46,148
Your legs must be getting tired. You can sit here while you wait.

103
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,318
Oh, do you work here?

104
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:51,989
Yes.

105
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,388
- Thank you. - Have a seat.

106
00:06:58,564 --> 00:06:59,732
Yes, that looks great.

107
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,398
Woori Photo Studio

108
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:19,479
I want to take photos of people.

109
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,919
Being surrounded by people and bugging them...

110
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:26,722
It feels nice. I want to keep doing it.

111
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:28,919
That looks great. Please look at the camera.

112
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,859
Good.

113
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:45,369
I'm sorry we couldn't have a proper lunch. I have more appointments.

114
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:47,982
Are you sure you're selling the studio?

115
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:52,083
I saw that you're fully booked for the next two days.

116
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,448
I'm putting it off.

117
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,989
It's like homework. You hate it but you have to do it eventually.

118
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,393
Some of the customers must've read my mind.

119
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:01,559
Some came by to tell me how sad they were.

120
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:04,433
"I want to take a photo since I'm here anyway."

121
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,159
"Next time, I'll bring my family."

122
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,259
That's what some customers are doing.

123
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:11,169
And I have to say, I'm happy about that.

124
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:17,309
But what if you end up missing the chance to work in Paris?

125
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,578
Too bad. Then I'll just stay a little longer.

126
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,679
What brings you by? You didn't call me. What's up?

127
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:30,919
Hills wants to give us the best spot that they have.

128
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:32,318
Nice.

129
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,419
I'm not going to lie. It made me happy.

130
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:36,533
When they wanted us out,

131
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:39,362
I felt like the earth was crumbling beneath my feet.

132
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:40,899
I was devastated.

133
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:43,573
But I've managed to hold out.

134
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:44,968
I think I handled it pretty well.

135
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:46,968
That's great.

136
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:48,799
Yes.

137
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:55,009
But can I stay happy without you?

138
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,722
So those guys in Paris. What are the conditions of their offer?

139
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,389
It's not bad.

140
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:07,988
Considering she's just a designer from a no-name brand to them...

141
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:14,433
My apologies, sir. I mean, from their perspective.

142
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,573
So? What did they offer?

143
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:19,203
Full authority over all the designs and HR decisions.

144
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:20,242
And profit sharing.

145
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,203
On top of that, she'll be planning and overseeing...

146
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:24,208
the brand's fashion shows in Paris for two seasons.

147
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:29,238
Frankly, no fashion designer would want to turn down such an offer.

148
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:34,448
Check everything thoroughly and take good care of it for her.

149
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:39,189
You see, Young Eun is like a daughter to me.

150
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,559
The offer already sounds pretty good,

151
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,132
but see if you can make it even better for Young Eun.

152
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,862
You know, maybe not just for two seasons.

153
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:49,769
See if you can get them to agree to a few years.

154
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:53,899
And thoroughly go through the contract as well.

155
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:57,338
Yes, sir.

156
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,583
I'll take good care of it.

157
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,208
All right, then.

158
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:03,779
I'll trust you.

159
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,208
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,799
That man is with your father now, alone.

161
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:33,779
- Mr. Seok. - Director Hwang.

162
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,379
Why are you coming out of there?

163
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,779
I had to speak to President Hwang urgently about something in private.

164
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:43,889
Urgently, in private?

165
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:46,358
About what?

166
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:49,463
I told you I had to discuss something with him in private,

167
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:52,429
which means it's not something I can share with you.

168
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,799
Of course, he can't tell you.

169
00:10:57,603 --> 00:11:01,303
"Urgently, in private." It means they have some kind of deal.

170
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:04,713
I guess they had to talk business as the heads of their companies.

171
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,439
I think they were talking about you though.

172
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:10,982
Well, that's because I am what they have in common.

173
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,818
That's why he's handling all of The One's ads and PR needs?

174
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,722
That's because he's a capable man.

175
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:21,392
Exactly. Isn't it clear to you that he intentionally approached you...

176
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:23,289
to grow his business?

177
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,529
What are you saying?

178
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,203
I like him...

179
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,998
because he's not the kind of man you're talking about.

180
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,429
Okay?

181
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:35,043
President Hwang must really like him.

182
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,769
He offered to increase the retainer fee by 15 percent.

183
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,379
This story you've come up with is quite detailed.

184
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,978
- I give you credit for the effort. - You can check.

185
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,189
What's your deal?

186
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,488
Why are you so confident?

187
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:57,929
I truly love you. That's why.

188
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:06,198
My gosh, I look so nervous.

189
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:09,669
You looked even more stunning than the professional models.

190
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:10,838
Really?

191
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,043
- Tell Mom how cool she looks. - Mom, you look so cool!

192
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:16,213
- She looked so beautiful... - Look here.

193
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,309
- that I couldn't stop recording it. - Right here.

194
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,252
Whenever I see my daughter, my heart feels full...

195
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:23,789
because I think she's so adorable.

196
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,293
Before I got married, it was just me. All alone.

197
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:30,529
Then I met my husband, and there are three of us now.

198
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:33,803
Even in my worst times,

199
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:36,998
they're always on my side. Thanks to them, I'm not lonely.

200
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:41,068
That's what family is for. No one else would do that for you.

201
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,169
That's true.

202
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:48,509
Don't you want to start your own family?

203
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:50,978
I'm not sure.

204
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:55,118
I have yet to meet someone who's as wonderful as Mr. Kwak.

205
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,598
You've been working with my husband for a long time, right?

206
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,368
Yes, ever since I joined the company.

207
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,799
What do you think of him?

208
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:16,809
Sorry?

209
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:19,539
I was curious what he's like at work.

210
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,409
I see.

211
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:26,779
I'm grateful to him.

212
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:29,283
At the beginning, I made so many mistakes,

213
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,848
and we even had some clients who complained about me.

214
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:35,389
But he always said, "It's okay. Things happen."

215
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:38,689
He always comforted and encouraged me.

216
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:41,203
So whenever he's in the office,

217
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:45,328
I feel safe because I know that I can rely on him.

218
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,169
I mean, work-wise.

219
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:57,549
Well, Soo Ho is a good man.

220
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:01,553
My gosh, I'm only giving you some kimchi.

221
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,222
I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.

222
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:06,988
Don't worry. The big show's over, so I'm not busy today.

223
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,858
What do you usually do in your free time?

224
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,563
I go to bookstores to check out magazines...

225
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:12,988
or I'd go to check out cool places.

226
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:15,228
These days, I go to the department stores often.

227
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,899
Even just seeing what's on display helps me study trends.

228
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,338
You could've used this time to study. I'm sorry.

229
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,738
Here are the photos from the show.

230
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,738
- Thank you. - I should thank you as well.

231
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,578
Thank you for the kimchi.

232
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,488
Do not touch!

233
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,098
If I can't swallow the rice...

234
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:08,039
If I can't swallow the rice, I can just put some water in it...

235
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,978
and gulp it down, so it's no big deal.

236
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:16,419
But for nearly 40 years,

237
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:20,259
I just let my resentment grow and harden like hard-boiled rice.

238
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,593
And that is something I cannot swallow...

239
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:25,629
no matter how much water I pour on it.

240
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,899
My feelings are hurt, and I can't let it go...

241
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:33,998
like food that just sits in the stomach.

242
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:38,468
What if this turns into deep sorrow and bitterness?

243
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:41,439
What if I'm left with nothing but hatred?

244
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:44,278
I'm scared.

245
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,079
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:21,419
What was that? What is wrong with you?

247
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,793
Gosh, get out! Go!

248
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,718
- My goodness! - Get out! Unbelievable.

249
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,392
Goodness gracious!

250
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:32,189
- What is this? - Do you hate me that much?

251
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,198
Do you hate everything about me?

252
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:36,298
But you know,

253
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,998
- I loved you! - Shut it!

254
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:43,609
- So Young, take him. - Okay.

255
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,569
- Good work today. - Get home safely.

256
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,278
Ms. Ha.

257
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:52,008
I picked the best images.

258
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,718
Thanks.

259
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:56,652
About our new shop at Hills,

260
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,422
you've given the VMD team a heads-up, right?

261
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:00,122
Yes. They'll check out the store space first...

262
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:02,689
before they come up with the interior design concept.

263
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:04,962
I'll go straight to Hills tomorrow morning.

264
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:06,089
Sure.

265
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,429
Aren't you done for the day too?

266
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,298
I'll leave in a bit.

267
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,998
I'm really happy to be part of your team.

268
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:18,268
Thank you for making sure we can protect our pride as designers.

269
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,278
We did it together.

270
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:25,849
I'll work harder to assist you with our future collections.

271
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:29,179
- Okay, we'll both work hard. - Okay.

272
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,748
I'll see you tomorrow.

273
00:18:58,314 --> 00:18:59,978
You can pick it up tomorrow afternoon.

274
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:01,748
- Thank you. - Thank you. Bye.

275
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:29,313
To-do List: Empty out the studio, return equipment,

276
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,208
get the deposit back, book a flight?

277
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,248
My gosh.

278
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,122
Hey. Be a respectful roommate, will you?

279
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:44,329
Knock before you open the bathroom door. Knock, knock.

280
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,859
Why is it that all grandmas and grandpas wake up so early?

281
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,033
I told them numerous times that the studio opens at 10am,

282
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,569
but they insisted on coming at 8am.

283
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:55,968
Was it their son or daughter's place?

284
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:57,909
Anyway, they have to go there.

285
00:19:58,373 --> 00:19:59,939
Is this your newfound passion?

286
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,882
Was taking ID photos your longtime wish or something?

287
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:05,808
I want my graceful lifestyle back,

288
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,283
so start wrapping things up and book your flight tickets.

289
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:12,119
I'll pack you tons of kimchi and roasted seaweed.

290
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,763
Flight tickets? Who else is going?

291
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,659
I thought you and Ms. Ha were going together.

292
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:23,099
- What are you talking about? - You haven't heard?

293
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,369
She got an offer from Olivier. He wants her to come to Paris.

294
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,008
So she hasn't told you yet.

295
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:38,679
Other than the news about Hills, anything else you want to tell me?

296
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:44,548
No, not really yet.

297
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,018
"Not really yet"?

298
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:52,293
When you decide on your departure date,

299
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,198
you'll tell me first, right?

300
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:08,882
To-do List

301
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:10,978
Woori Photo Studio

302
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,419
Is this Hanguk Air?

303
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:19,488
I want to book a flight to Paris.

304
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:25,228
The duration of the contract will be one year.

305
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,533
They'd like you to oversee everything for their 2022 FW,

306
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,602
2023 Resort and Cruise,

307
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:32,503
and 2023 SS Collections.

308
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,672
They want to see how the three collections do...

309
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,803
before re-discussing your salary with you.

310
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:39,268
And the results will also determine whether you can renew your contract.

311
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:42,038
"Results"?

312
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,478
I guess I'll have to...

313
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,523
prepare for the shows as if I'm studying for college.

314
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:50,122
Well, in this line of work, we're always expected...

315
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:53,319
to generate results and prove ourselves through sales numbers.

316
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,723
If there's anything you want, or if you think of any requests,

317
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:59,028
we can think about it together, so let me know.

318
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,798
I'll try my best to negotiate with them.

319
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,558
I should...

320
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,768
- think about this, right? - Yes, it's a great opportunity.

321
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:11,569
Would it really be a great opportunity?

322
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:15,743
I saw from the sidelines how you developed Sono,

323
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:19,548
and it made me think it's people who create opportunities.

324
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:23,649
That's how well you led Sono.

325
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,619
I was lucky.

326
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,422
I understand how attached you are to the brand.

327
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:31,432
But despite that, I honestly wish that...

328
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,458
you will take this chance.

329
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,728
It's for yourself,

330
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:39,099
and for Jae Guk too.

331
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:44,238
The French photo association offered him...

332
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:47,609
an exhibition at the Pompidou Centre.

333
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:50,478
An exhibition?

334
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:52,412
Only winners of...

335
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,182
the International Photography Awards get such an offer.

336
00:22:55,183 --> 00:22:58,122
He should be working all night every night to prepare,

337
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,349
but...

338
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,058
He's just taking passport photos.

339
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:05,429
The fashion industry changes so quickly.

340
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,432
Things could be hot now, but the trend will change instantly.

341
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,263
Many famous photographers...

342
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,698
now take wedding photos or shoot commercial videos.

343
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,599
Every photographer's dream and ultimate goal...

344
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:20,339
is to put on an exhibition of their own work.

345
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,349
Jae Guk means a lot to me.

346
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,548
I don't want him to miss out.

347
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:33,889
I'd like you to go with him.

348
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:01,218
When does he have to leave?

349
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,788
He should be there before fall.

350
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,548
At any cost.

351
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:08,788
Before fall.

352
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,159
Then...

353
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:15,359
he must leave soon.

354
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:27,639
Woori Photo Studio, Open until the end of the month

355
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:39,048
Woori Photo Studio

356
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:50,099
- No way. - What is it?

357
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,238
A reliable piece of news from Vision PR.

358
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:59,238
It's about Duchamp, the 130-year-old luxury brand.

359
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:01,343
Where? Duchamp?

360
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:03,738
The place that charges over 2,000 dollars for a pair of pants?

361
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:08,523
Is Paris finally acknowledging Young Eun's skill?

362
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:11,448
It's Ms. Ha to us, not Young Eun.

363
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,058
Do we all get to go with her?

364
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,689
But if she kept so quiet until now...

365
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,793
She hasn't decided yet.

366
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:22,033
Why can't she make up her mind?

367
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,932
She'll never get another chance like this.

368
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,273
Is it because I treated her well?

369
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,773
She just made Sono more famous than ever.

370
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:29,669
She wouldn't be able to leave it behind.

371
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:31,813
Still, I think she'll end up going.

372
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:34,743
And she'll definitely take Ms. Nam.

373
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:37,609
A creative director gets a say in who she works with.

374
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:41,483
Well, I have worked with her for a long time.

375
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:42,849
What about you, So Young?

376
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:46,988
I'd be grateful if she would take me along.

377
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:49,922
You're young so this might be a great opportunity for you.

378
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,093
Three or four years of experience there...

379
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:54,632
will boost your portfolio more than anything.

380
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,202
Rather than that, I want to learn more from Ms. Ha.

381
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:58,468
- What? - What?

382
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:00,803
Okay. Then we're going.

383
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,243
- "We"? - "We".

384
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,702
- "We"? - Us.

385
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:06,369
I've been so nice to them and they're all...

386
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:08,579
Oh, my gosh.

387
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:11,813
What are you all up to? Shouldn't you be working?

388
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:13,379
Work, okay?

389
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:17,389
My goodness.

390
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:18,889
Why are you surprised?

391
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,819
I'm a director and the president's daughter.

392
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:25,389
I was told to keep quiet to prevent word from spreading.

393
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:29,958
Will Vision PR do all the promotions for our men's wear?

394
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,698
Yes.

395
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:36,268
The down payment went up 15 percent?

396
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:38,308
Yes.

397
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,983
Did they sign the contract?

398
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:42,313
I believe so.

399
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,808
President Hwang made the decision himself.

400
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,278
Did he?

401
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:50,892
Are you saying that...

402
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:53,718
my father and Mr. Seok are in this together?

403
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:55,859
Is that it?

404
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:05,202
As customers get off the escalator...

405
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:07,869
they automatically turn and look this way.

406
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,743
Then let's put the color hangers here.

407
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:11,909
Okay.

408
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,142
I think we should adjust the lighting.

409
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:16,412
I'll ask the department store...

410
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,349
if we can install some spotlights.

411
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,112
Okay. Please do that.

412
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:21,349
No problem.

413
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:25,119
Ms. Ha, should we tear down this wall?

414
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:26,589
Yes.

415
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:34,429
- Excuse me. - Sure.

416
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:43,968
Hello, Ha Young Eun speaking.

417
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,778
I am Jae Guk's mother.

418
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:52,548
Yes. I'm listening.

419
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:54,922
Would you like a cup of tree if you're free?

420
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,493
You're busy, so I'll go by your schedule.

421
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:58,849
When are you available?

422
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:01,558
Mi Sook

423
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,788
I'm sorry. Can I call you back?

424
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,458
That's fine. Call me when you can.

425
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:12,169
I will do that.

426
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:15,939
Mi Sook, what is it?

427
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,773
Are you crying? Why?

428
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:20,609
- Are you in pain? - What now?

429
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:24,409
It's Chi Sook, not me.

430
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,109
What? Chi Sook?

431
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,649
I need you to come and make her stop crying.

432
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,319
She's been crying for half an hour.

433
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:43,202
Did she and Mr. Seok have a fight?

434
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:46,528
Is she the kind to do that? She got upset on her own.

435
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,238
He was the same after all.

436
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,909
Mr. Seok...

437
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:54,313
approached me for my dad's money.

438
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,882
He's not that kind of guy.

439
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:57,909
Where did you get that idea?

440
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,478
I confirmed it.

441
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:03,018
He wanted to get our promotion contract.

442
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:05,248
That's why he dated me.

443
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:08,962
Then why are you crying?

444
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,263
You should go and pull out his hair.

445
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,629
Did you hear this from Mr. Seok?

446
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:17,929
There's no denying it if I hear it from him.

447
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:21,498
I really liked him a lot.

448
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,909
How am I to break up with him?

449
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:29,579
She's serious this time.

450
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,382
Calm down a bit.

451
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:37,253
Ji Min and Soo Ho will be back soon.

452
00:29:37,254 --> 00:29:38,523
Let's go to my place.

453
00:29:38,524 --> 00:29:39,892
Let her stay, it's fine.

454
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,563
Ji Min and Soo Ho went shopping.

455
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,218
They'll be back after dinner.

456
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:45,829
- Just the two of them? - With Ms. Seo too.

457
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:04,038
What are you doing here, Ms. Seo?

458
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:06,409
Your wife asked me to come.

459
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:10,349
I've been feeling some strong pains today.

460
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:12,952
Ms. Seo said she'd be going to the department store today,

461
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:14,659
and around the same time too.

462
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:18,692
You don't know how to shop for girls' clothes.

463
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:23,228
It takes a woman to know what's right and what suits a girl.

464
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,629
Ji Min, let's go and try this on.

465
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:28,399
Dad, I'll go with Auntie.

466
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,268
Okay.

467
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:35,079
If you feel bad about it, buy her dinner.

468
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:40,208
Me? What would I need?

469
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:42,048
I don't need anything.

470
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:47,922
Don't go to the food court to save money.

471
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:50,122
Eat somewhere nice, okay?

472
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:51,359
Bye.

473
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:56,698
Mi Sook.

474
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,798
You stay right here.

475
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,768
I'll go after them and...

476
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,172
show them what betrayal does to them.

477
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,538
Leave it. You won't do anything.

478
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:09,813
I asked Ms. Seo to help out.

479
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,808
- Mi Sook. - Jeon Mi Sook.

480
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:17,248
Yes, I'm breaking up with them.

481
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:22,389
To be honest, yes, I am angry.

482
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:26,659
If I weren't sick, I'd go after them both and...

483
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:29,329
That's how I feel sometimes.

484
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:31,768
But...

485
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:35,669
It's such a relief he wasn't seeing someone weird.

486
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:42,238
My mood goes up and down. It feels like I'm on a see-saw.

487
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:47,879
But I'm not breaking up with Soo Ho.

488
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,788
My regret.

489
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:54,319
My hope.

490
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:56,919
My greed.

491
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,528
That's what I'm saying goodbye to.

492
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,869
How could you?

493
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:13,738
What if you can't do that?

494
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:20,379
What do you do if you keep hesitating?

495
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:28,258
Don't you think that's the perfect time to part?

496
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,558
When you keep wanting more?

497
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,698
When you get greedy and keep saying...

498
00:32:40,774 --> 00:32:42,798
you want just a little more.

499
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:52,379
You make me feel so bad.

500
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,058
Woori Photo Studio

501
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:10,458
Perfect.

502
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:13,228
Just one more shot.

503
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:16,538
That's it. Well done.

504
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:23,008
Is this your lunch or dinner?

505
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:25,248
How come you still haven't eaten?

506
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:27,753
I can eat now.

507
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:30,152
Close up for a while and eat.

508
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:31,593
You should look after yourself too.

509
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,018
I will. You can pick up the photos tomorrow.

510
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,389
Goodbye.

511
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,759
Woori Photo Studio

512
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,788
Welcome.

513
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:07,589
Thank you for coming.

514
00:34:15,957 --> 00:34:17,853
Why are you here without calling ahead?

515
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,353
What is the matter?

516
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:24,566
Why did your usual sparkly self...

517
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,862
turn this dreary shade of blue?

518
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:29,262
My expectations,

519
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,762
my hope, my yearning.

520
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:36,873
- I came here to let it all go. - What?

521
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:39,072
The fact-checking is complete.

522
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,876
Don't even think of lying...

523
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,373
and look me in the eye.

524
00:35:02,397 --> 00:35:06,032
Why do you keep bringing Ms. Seo into family affairs?

525
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,302
Why did you make her kimchi...

526
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:11,443
and ask her to help buy Ji Min's clothes?

527
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:13,943
Tell me.

528
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:18,987
You'd say a client called...

529
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,012
and take the call on the balcony.

530
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:23,112
Sometimes you went to the bathroom.

531
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:27,722
Each time you did that, you smiled so brightly.

532
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,262
Mi Sook.

533
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:33,992
Ms. Seo.

534
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:39,302
I got to know her and I think she's nice.

535
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,443
Don't make me feel too jealous, though.

536
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:56,213
- Mi Sook. - But Soo Ho.

537
00:35:57,357 --> 00:36:01,052
While I'm still around, can you love only me?

538
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:03,123
Can you?

539
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,233
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,802
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:24,412
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:26,983
I'm sorry.

543
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:33,753
I'm sorry.

544
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,702
Why are the lights all off?

545
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:51,072
He hasn't eaten yet?

546
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,153
My gosh.

547
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,693
Now that we're splitting up he's doing whatever he wants.

548
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,496
Sleeping out is a cause for divorce too.

549
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,862
He'd better know that.

550
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:30,443
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

551
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:36,052
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

552
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:41,893
What did you just say?

553
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,726
I asked why you approached me.

554
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:47,393
Me? I did not.

555
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:50,367
You came to my office like you did just now...

556
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,106
and asked point blank where Seok Do Hoon was.

557
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:55,733
- Don't you remember? - You didn't love me.

558
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:58,646
You loved my father's money. That's the truth.

559
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:00,277
It is, isn't it?

560
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,117
Director Hwang, what kind of an offensive comment is that?

561
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:05,746
How far were you going to go if I let you?

562
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,387
You take all The One's menswear commercials...

563
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:09,253
and once you were done with me...

564
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:12,186
Were you going to dump me then?

565
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:14,052
- Director Hwang! - I'm right!

566
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,827
You dated me to get close to my dad,

567
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,722
and kept coming by for no reason.

568
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,923
Are you pleased you got the contract?

569
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:24,333
Yes.

570
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,103
It's true I got the menswear contract.

571
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:31,777
But I won it with nothing but my hard work.

572
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,577
You'd have had no chance if it weren't for me.

573
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,146
If the contract were about you,

574
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,713
I wouldn't have accepted it!

575
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,516
Because that would be an insult...

576
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,612
to everyone who works at Vision PR!

577
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,023
It's true that I liked you,

578
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:56,262
and it's also true that's how I got to know the president.

579
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,836
Do you think that made my job easier?

580
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,003
No.

581
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:04,072
It made my work harder.

582
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:07,503
Because I have to do even better so no one says what you just said.

583
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:10,112
Other than that,

584
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:13,943
I never used you for my work.

585
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,653
Not once.

586
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:26,822
I'm done listening to such offensive words.

587
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:36,302
Please leave my office.

588
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:02,333
Woori Photo Studio

589
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,202
Woori Photo Studio, Open until the end of the month

590
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:17,912
Woori Photo Studio

591
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:36,662
I won't go to Paris.

592
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,333
It's a one-year contract.

593
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:44,606
Based on my annual performance,

594
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,342
they'll decide whether to extend my contract or not.

595
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:52,213
You know that what Olivier wants...

596
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:55,853
is Ha Young Eun who is a hot commodity just now.

597
00:40:56,917 --> 00:41:00,052
Trends change overnight in this industry.

598
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:03,793
How long will I be hot for?

599
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:08,333
Turn one year into two and then three.

600
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:12,403
Couldn't you do that?

601
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:17,072
A home, a car, a studio.

602
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,643
Nothing's for free.

603
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:24,373
As much as they give me, I must give back in sales.

604
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:26,182
If I can't do that,

605
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,952
I must look for cheaper fabrics.

606
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:30,653
I will end up...

607
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:33,782
giving orders to make something that sells.

608
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:36,353
Is that success?

609
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:40,722
Does going to Paris mean I succeeded?

610
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,032
I still wanted to go.

611
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:49,273
Should I just go?

612
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:51,643
It's just one year.

613
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:53,873
It's just one season.

614
00:41:55,317 --> 00:41:56,472
But...

615
00:41:57,778 --> 00:42:00,342
treating my clothes like that.

616
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:03,882
That's not right.

617
00:42:14,468 --> 00:42:17,963
When is the time to let go of love?

618
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:21,103
I kept hesitating.

619
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:23,333
I keep looking for a reason to go.

620
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:28,043
That's why I'm holding you back.

621
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:31,682
You could end up...

622
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:35,112
losing out on an opportunity.

623
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:47,762
It's not too early...

624
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:50,932
and it's not too late.

625
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,373
For you who must go forward,

626
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,673
I am letting go.

627
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:03,313
I'm not letting go of you.

628
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:06,612
I'm letting go...

629
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:10,782
of my regret and greed.

630
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:26,963
Well done.

631
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:29,572
Before you get more worked up,

632
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,972
before you hesitate even more, it's right to let him go.

633
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,112
You did the right thing, Young Eun.

634
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:11,516
The dumplings were hot,

635
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:13,086
so I wanted to drop them off.

636
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:14,646
Why do you keep asking me to stay?

637
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:17,552
You came to your daughter's this late and you'll just leave?

638
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,057
It's late. Stay the night.

639
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:22,992
Okay, I will. You must be tired. Go to sleep.

640
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,353
I will.

641
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,947
I let Dad stay.

642
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:42,412
Why does he keep sleeping out when he has a home?

643
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:43,717
He's not a child.

644
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:46,182
Stop being mean to him, Mom.

645
00:44:46,388 --> 00:44:47,512
Yes.

646
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,226
Bath Coupon, 9 dollars

647
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:56,322
He read the letters I'd written.

648
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:01,293
He left a note saying he's sorry.

649
00:45:02,198 --> 00:45:04,693
Okay. Don't worry about him, and get some sleep.

650
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:36,362
If you love her, why don't you just try and convince her...

651
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,662
instead of giving up so easily?

652
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:41,162
It's because I love her.

653
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:43,873
They just want to take advantage...

654
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:47,903
of the fame she gained through the fashion show.

655
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,376
I know that's their plan.

656
00:45:51,377 --> 00:45:53,382
But if you think about it,

657
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:55,452
it's also an opportunity for her.

658
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,512
I saw so many people get used like that in Paris.

659
00:45:59,787 --> 00:46:02,193
They seduce designers with their luxury brand name.

660
00:46:02,397 --> 00:46:05,722
Then they use them to their advantage...

661
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:07,762
for a season or two.

662
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,762
Then they tell them that their time has come to an end.

663
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:13,233
They cut them loose very quickly.

664
00:46:13,368 --> 00:46:16,603
Well, I can't deny that there were many designers...

665
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:20,302
who didn't end up very well after they went to Paris.

666
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:23,646
But still, Ms. Ha is very talented.

667
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,813
Those guys think they're the best.

668
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:29,182
They blatantly look down on you and say bad things to your face.

669
00:46:29,317 --> 00:46:32,853
For a female Asian designer to survive there,

670
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:36,722
she'll need to become both fierce and shameless.

671
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:41,023
I can't let the woman I love go through all that...

672
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:45,063
just so I can have her by my side.

673
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:55,112
Are you okay?

674
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:58,273
No.

675
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:03,083
It drives me crazy that I understand her so well.

676
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:08,353
It drives me crazy...

677
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:14,063
that I know everything all too well to ask her to reconsider.

678
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:21,903
But you see, Do Hoon,

679
00:47:25,048 --> 00:47:26,472
just once...

680
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,143
Just once, I want to ask her to stay by my side.

681
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,653
If I don't, I just might lose it.

682
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:50,963
My goodness.

683
00:47:57,238 --> 00:47:58,903
Is it love that hurts?

684
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:01,802
Or is it the breakup?

685
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:25,532
I understand how much you care for each other.

686
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:30,472
I also know that I'm the one breaking you two apart.

687
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:33,943
You may feel upset right now,

688
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:36,673
but after a decade or two,

689
00:48:37,517 --> 00:48:40,882
you'll eventually realize that you made the right choice.

690
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:44,313
You'll learn that I was right all along.

691
00:48:44,517 --> 00:48:47,983
Thank you for understanding me...

692
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:50,793
and ending things.

693
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:56,032
You don't need to thank me.

694
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,193
You're not the reason we chose to break up.

695
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,862
Jae Guk and I...

696
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:04,873
never fell in love to please anyone,

697
00:49:05,678 --> 00:49:07,173
so we're not ending things...

698
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:10,112
to please anyone either.

699
00:49:14,848 --> 00:49:16,782
Jae Guk will go to Paris.

700
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:19,253
That is...

701
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:22,153
the right choice for him.

702
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:25,023
And I will do...

703
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:28,193
what is right for me.

704
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,762
The job that I love.

705
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,063
The people that I love.

706
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:38,532
I'll do what's necessary to love and protect...

707
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:41,503
everything that's precious to me.

708
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,893
What do you think awaits us at the end of that road?

709
00:50:01,328 --> 00:50:02,632
I will probably be there.

710
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:06,833
No matter where you go, I will always be...

711
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:09,532
at the end of that road.

712
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:10,992
I appreciate the job offer from DPHP,

713
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:13,407
but I have decided to remain...

714
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:15,066
at Sono.

715
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,407
I appreciate the job offer from DPHP,

716
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:17,833
but I have decided to remain at Sono.

717
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:20,543
This is my official announcement.

718
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:26,112
Young Eun, you're always full of surprises.

719
00:51:26,218 --> 00:51:28,512
You never fail to shock me.

720
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:31,782
I really thought I might go to Paris this time.

721
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:35,052
Let's keep that passion and use it to get ready for the next season.

722
00:51:35,227 --> 00:51:36,423
How does that sound?

723
00:51:37,098 --> 00:51:40,362
Then I guess I won't get to become the Head of Design anymore.

724
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:44,266
Gosh, you were after my position?

725
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:47,106
The dream was short-lived, but it was great while it lasted.

726
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:49,507
Design nice clothes and get a promotion.

727
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:51,132
I'll be more than welcome to let you take over.

728
00:51:55,618 --> 00:51:57,177
Ms. Ha, President Hwang wishes to see you.

729
00:51:57,178 --> 00:51:59,842
Ms. Ha, President Hwang wishes to see you.

730
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,115
You wanted to see me?

731
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:17,555
I heard you turned down the job offer in Paris.

732
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,155
Why can't you go?

733
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,870
It's not that I can't go. I just chose not to.

734
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:25,296
Exactly. Why?

735
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,709
There's something I hadn't realized until now.

736
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,865
I just thought I worked here because I had no other choice.

737
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:33,376
But...

738
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:36,006
once I was given the choice to leave,

739
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,216
I couldn't imagine living my life without Sono.

740
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:42,390
I learned something...

741
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:44,816
the moment I thought about leaving.

742
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,490
I wasn't the one that gave meaning to Sono.

743
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:50,586
It was Sono that gave meaning to my life.

744
00:52:50,591 --> 00:52:53,555
I know you've been through a lot.

745
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,265
You took care of Chi Sook's mess and work at the same time.

746
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,066
I can only imagine how exhausting that must've been.

747
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:02,466
At first, I thought you were merely motivated by money.

748
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,635
I thought you took care of Chi Sook's mess...

749
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:07,439
just so you could have a stable position at work,

750
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,705
and I thought your only goal was to climb the corporate ladder.

751
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,680
I see.

752
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,946
You always do your best every season and never waste a single day.

753
00:53:16,091 --> 00:53:17,649
All you ever do is make clothes.

754
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,756
You also treat Chi Sook like a true friend.

755
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,526
I learned that I was wrong.

756
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:25,425
I realized that I was completely wrong about you.

757
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,095
It made me feel ashamed.

758
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,166
I also learned something after what recently happened.

759
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,805
Sono is yours.

760
00:53:37,971 --> 00:53:41,106
So I want you to take the brand...

761
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:42,776
and run it on your own.

762
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,550
Sir.

763
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:49,785
You created Sono and made sure it continued to keep its value.

764
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:53,015
Start a separate company and run it as you wish.

765
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,955
Your sincerity has convinced me.

766
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,999
Breaking news. Ms. Ha won't be going to Paris.

767
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,595
President Hwang just asked her to run Sono as a separate company.

768
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:12,340
- What's going on? - She's not going to Paris.

769
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:13,805
Did you read this?

770
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,680
Does that mean everyone in Sono will get to go with her?

771
00:54:15,681 --> 00:54:16,805
Unbelievable.

772
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,979
I heard Ms. Ha decided to stay.

773
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,086
What's going on? What is it?

774
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:29,285
You'll be listed as a completely different company,

775
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:31,186
so you can run it like a personal brand.

776
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,725
Does that mean I'll be signing a licensing contract with The One?

777
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,566
We'll split the revenue in half.

778
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:39,796
What do you say? Will you give it a shot?

779
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:44,370
First of all, thank you for the offer.

780
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:47,740
But to be honest, I've never even thought of this.

781
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:50,006
Do I need to give you an answer right now?

782
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,745
Take your time to think about it.

783
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,046
Bring me a business plan once you're ready.

784
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:29,086
Yes, this is Ha Young Eun speaking.

785
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:30,720
Do you remember me?

786
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:33,216
I'm Kim Seo Yeon, the chief editor at Nouvelle Vague.

787
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,356
I called as soon as I heard the news.

788
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:38,856
I heard you declined Olivier's job offer.

789
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:42,966
This time, I'd really like to get to know you, Ms. Ha.

790
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:47,039
I'd like to interview you again.

791
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,736
Of course, we'll send you a new list of questions.

792
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,175
And like you requested, we can do the interview at your office.

793
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:56,046
I decided to do an interview with Nouvelle Vague.

794
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,015
- My gosh. - That's great.

795
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,745
Are they going to interview you at our office?

796
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:06,256
- My goodness! - Oh, gosh!

797
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:11,189
Hurry up and fill the office with our clothes.

798
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,530
The interview is going to be six pages long.

799
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:15,059
- Nice! - Great!

800
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,095
Let me bring my sketches.

801
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:24,109
Woori Photo Studio

802
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,205
So what you do need?

803
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:28,975
I was wondering if you could take the interview photos.

804
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:31,405
Why would you even ask?

805
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,175
Does that mean you can't?

806
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,316
I'm saying you didn't even need to ask.

807
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:39,885
Just tell me the time and location.

808
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:41,486
I'll be there.

809
00:56:42,591 --> 00:56:45,595
I'm the only guy who can take your photos.

810
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:47,325
Right?

811
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,365
It's tomorrow.

812
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:53,196
The interview will take place in my office.

813
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,666
Okay. Got it.

814
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,035
I'll see you tomorrow.

815
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,120
You did a great job marketing Sono,

816
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:43,890
so we hope you'll do the same with our men's collection.

817
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:46,720
Yes, of course. But there will be a few changes.

818
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:48,120
Based on our analysis,

819
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:51,229
it seems like you wish to target men in their late 30s.

820
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,999
When they settle for a brand,

821
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,725
it's highly likely that they become long-term customers.

822
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,999
So instead of doing excessive online advertisements...

823
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,300
or using celebrities to promote the outfits,

824
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:02,939
we could recommend clothes based on algorithms...

825
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,510
and allow the consumers to pick five outfits and try them on.

826
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:07,979
They can choose one and return the rest.

827
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,975
Our goal is to help consumers experience the brand first-hand.

828
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:12,546
Right.

829
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,946
Director Hwang, is there anything you'd like to say?

830
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,320
No.

831
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:21,120
Okay. Then I guess that's it for today.

832
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:23,026
- Thank you. - Thank you.

833
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:25,430
What do you think about...

834
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:27,729
using online algorithms...

835
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,196
for marketing?

836
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,399
I'll have to take a look at the data first.

837
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,535
I see.

838
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:39,006
- Thank you for today. - Thank you.

839
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,725
Do you really have nothing to say?

840
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,155
No, not really.

841
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,425
I misunderstood you for a reason.

842
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:06,300
You're also at fault for making me doubt you.

843
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:08,070
If you trusted me,

844
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:10,135
you wouldn't have jumped to conclusions so quickly.

845
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,776
Well, if we both have nothing more to say to each other,

846
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:20,876
I guess we should call it an end.

847
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:26,586
Are you saying...

848
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:29,225
we should break up?

849
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,066
I thought that was what you wanted.

850
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:42,936
Okay.

851
00:59:46,741 --> 00:59:47,905
I'll be off now.

852
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:21,736
- Shall we begin? - Sure.

853
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,845
I'll start with the basic questions.

854
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,046
I heard you came up with the name "Sono" yourself.

855
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,745
What's the meaning behind the name?

856
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,655
I wasn't the one who came up with the name.

857
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:40,925
I actually go? the idea from an unknown photographer in Paris.

858
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:49,035
"Sono" means "echo."

859
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:52,506
He wished me good luck and hoped my designs would echo to the public.

860
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,535
Sono was born thanks to that unknown photographer.

861
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:58,649
I really want to know...

862
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,350
why you declined Olivier's offer.

863
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:03,186
I thought all designers dreamed of working with him.

864
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:08,615
Ten years ago, I would've thought the same.

865
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,590
Paris is the birthplace of fashion, so working there...

866
01:01:11,591 --> 01:01:13,256
would've made me feel successful.

867
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:19,265
But now, I have a different definition for success.

868
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,466
What's your definition of success?

869
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:26,675
Choosing my own fabric.

870
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,546
Drawing my own specification sheet.

871
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,379
Staying up all night.

872
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,776
Then waking up...

873
01:01:33,181 --> 01:01:36,115
and seeing a desk with tons of eraser shavings.

874
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,086
Although it may take some time,

875
01:01:42,431 --> 01:01:46,356
I want to break the prejudice and stereotypes...

876
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:49,196
that people have of domestic brands.

877
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:53,865
I want to do what I love in my current position...

878
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:58,365
hoping that my work will echo to consumers all over the world.

879
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:01,376
That is...

880
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:04,205
my definition of success.

881
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:08,120
I bet the photographer who came up with the name "Sono"...

882
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:09,745
will be thrilled to hear that.

883
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,756
Is there anything you'd like to say to that photographer?

884
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,995
Thank you.

885
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:28,196
Thank you very much.

886
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,535
Congratulations on your exhibition.

887
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,506
Congratulations on getting the chance...

888
01:03:04,511 --> 01:03:05,635
to do what you want to do.

889
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:15,245
It's going to become chilly soon. Autumn will be here.

890
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:18,615
You'll have to prepare...

891
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:20,916
for a whole new season.

892
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:27,126
You should go to Paris before autumn comes.

893
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,265
Our relationship that began in spring...

894
01:03:35,471 --> 01:03:37,166
lasted throughout the hot summer...

895
01:03:37,871 --> 01:03:39,635
and is about to come to an end.

896
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,535
I was...

897
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:45,876
passionate...

898
01:03:47,351 --> 01:03:48,716
and happy.

899
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,856
And I loved you.

900
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,425
Me too.

901
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,526
I hope we will both be happy...

902
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,466
as we begin our new journey along with autumn.

903
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:11,236
I actually bought a plane ticket.

904
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:15,975
When are you leaving?

905
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,466
One is for me.

906
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,265
And the other one is for you.

907
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:47,175
- Jae Guk. - You made a decision...

908
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,845
as a designer and the Head of Design at Sono.

909
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,905
I know that.

910
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:53,975
I acknowledge your decision,

911
01:04:55,451 --> 01:04:56,646
and I respect it.

912
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,756
I'm ready to accept that.

913
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,626
But forget all that...

914
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:08,896
and answer me this.

915
01:05:11,531 --> 01:05:15,736
Forget about my brother, mom, your job, and mine.

916
01:05:16,571 --> 01:05:19,776
Let's just put that all aside for a moment.

917
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,876
I'm only...

918
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:28,446
going to ask you this once...

919
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:32,885
as a man...

920
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:37,455
who loves you.

921
01:05:43,531 --> 01:05:44,765
Will you come with me?

922
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:52,066
Come with me,

923
01:05:53,281 --> 01:05:54,405
Young Eun.

924
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:58,070
Now, We Are Breaking Up

925
01:06:58,071 --> 01:07:02,106
How did you manage to say goodbye every year?

926
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:03,606
Wasn't it difficult?

927
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:06,175
I'm almost ready to leave.

928
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:07,450
Are you okay?

929
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:09,950
Do you really think you can live without Jae Guk?

930
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,189
He asked me to come with him.

931
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,689
I couldn't say "no" right away.

932
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,859
Why aren't you asking me?

933
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,555
You haven't asked me for an answer.

934
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:21,896
I figured I should say it.

935
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:24,365
I don't want you to go.
