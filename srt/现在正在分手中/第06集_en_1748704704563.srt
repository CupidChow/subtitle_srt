1
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,704
It's time you changed the background photo on your phone.

2
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,134
Yoon Jae Guk

3
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,074
When I took the photo of that street ten years ago,

4
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,875
I felt...

5
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,585
daunted and unsure like you said.

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,384
I felt clueless.

7
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,824
But I feel sure about this.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,395
I know where I should be headed...

9
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,065
and what's waiting for me at the end of this road.

10
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,134
That photo.

11
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,734
You were the photographer who took it?

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,505
Paris, 10 years ago

13
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:14,024
There was a time when I felt as if I was climbing a never-ending hill.

14
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,324
Trying to strike a balance...

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,464
between my fatigue and survival instinct.

16
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:22,404
I was barely hanging on.

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,025
That moment, I felt understood...

18
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,565
without having to say how I was feeling.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,475
I was comforted...

20
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,074
by a nameless stranger.

21
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,544
Good. Okay.

22
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,655
I'm not him.

23
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,454
The same choice...

24
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,155
could lead to different results.

25
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,824
When I heard that Soo Wan...

26
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,394
was his older brother,

27
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,264
I was worried because of how I felt toward him.

28
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,354
I'm not sure how long it'll take,

29
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,785
but while we're breaking up,

30
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,324
let's allow ourselves to be in love,

31
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,495
Dad.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,394
By the way, do you guys know each other?

33
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,410
- No. - Yes.

34
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,465
- Hey. - He asked.

35
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,685
It gave me the strength to hold out for the past ten years...

36
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,054
and always stayed with me,

37
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,695
yet I lived the past ten years of my life without knowing.

38
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,995
Finally, I learn the truth about the consolation I had received.

39
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,608
The person who was with me every moment...

40
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:41,234
It was you?

41
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,359
You can find inspiration in everything. If you can't,

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,424
then you're not looking properly. by Paul Smith

43
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,465
Now, We Are Breaking Up

44
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,535
Episode 6

45
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,614
What is this? Spot the difference game?

46
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,314
Even the hemline is the same. Only the cutting line is different.

47
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,645
Why do we need two brands if we're going to do this?

48
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,754
It must be a coincidence.

49
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,354
As they say, great minds think alike.

50
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,955
We should soundproof our walls or something.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,468
I bet they overheard us talking about it in our meeting.

52
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,825
Or maybe someone on the development team leaked it.

53
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,598
Even the fabric is exactly the same.

54
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,395
But we haven't even made the design official yet.

55
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,405
How did this happen?

56
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,975
It was you, wasn't it?

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,979
What do you mean?

58
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,044
I happened to see something very interesting last night.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,859
I was wondering why you were staying so late.

60
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,718
Care to elaborate?

61
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:05,059
I understand you did it to transfer to the team that's doing better,

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,054
but that's just wrong. Make some real effort.

63
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,595
- You're suspicious of me? - No, I'm convinced that it was you.

64
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,028
No, it wasn't me.

65
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,569
And what? Make some real effort?

66
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,098
Who are you to belittle my efforts? Do you think you have the right?

67
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,609
Me? Yes, because it's my father's company.

68
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,278
I had to beat 80 other applicants to get this job.

69
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,138
From the pre-screening to my third in-person interview,

70
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,304
I had to work very hard to get this job.

71
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,415
What about you? How did you join this company?

72
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,979
President Hwang got me the job.

73
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,189
That doesn't give you the right to groundlessly suspect someone.

74
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,354
You did something that gave me a reason to suspect you.

75
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,424
You see, I didn't do anything to deserve being suspected...

76
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,254
by someone like you.

77
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,025
Don't you dare falsely accuse me.

78
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,179
What do we do? I have to go report this now.

79
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,004
One of them is a copy, but I didn't copy their design.

80
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,778
I know. You'd never, even if you were threatened at knifepoint.

81
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,015
But what can I do?

82
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,345
Whatever happens with Claire Marie also falls on me.

83
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,254
I can't tell the higher-ups that you came up with the same design.

84
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:10,658
What are you doing?

85
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,624
Claire Marie submitted it first, so I should take their side.

86
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,328
- I can't accept that. - Then what?

87
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,129
We should check the CCTV footage first.

88
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,064
But what if someone actually leaked the design?

89
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,138
You'll both be reprimanded, and I'll get in trouble too,

90
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,369
for mismanagement.

91
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,504
If something did happen, we should take responsibility.

92
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,078
And so should you.

93
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,674
Even if it got leaked somehow, you're partially responsible.

94
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,205
You should've been more careful.

95
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,679
Besides, you said you were confident.

96
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,215
You've designed many collections over the past ten years.

97
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,244
Just pick a piece that sold well and tweak the design a bit.

98
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,285
I can't do that.

99
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,254
Then what do you want to do?

100
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,559
Must you stay stubborn and cause a delay?

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,629
You have no proof. Do you want them to launch an investigation?

102
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,194
Then we'd have to give up on the SS collection altogether.

103
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,895
You're so mean.

104
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,135
What? Me? What did you just say?

105
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,734
Hey, I am your boss!

106
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,338
Yes, you're my boss.

107
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,848
So act like one.

108
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,549
You told me to beat them. How could you do this?

109
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,415
Honestly, you're so mean.

110
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,845
And you're just pathetic.

111
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,814
My gosh, I can't believe this. Hey!

112
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,218
Gosh, unbelievable.

113
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,328
Seriously, Ms. Ha is so on edge.

114
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,398
Let's be honest. Everyone who works in the creative field...

115
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,895
tends to think the same way and likes similar things.

116
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,028
We somehow came up with similar designs.

117
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,968
She didn't have to overreact like that.

118
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:29,194
Shut it, will you?

119
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,778
You see, I've known Young Eun for 20 years.

120
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,174
So I know she'd never copy someone else's design.

121
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,109
I'm letting you off this time,

122
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,718
but if you pull something like this again,

123
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,845
I'll make you regret it big-time.

124
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,314
You got that?

125
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,515
Director Hwang! Wait!

126
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,658
Support them in every way you can, especially with PR and marketing.

127
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,825
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,694
I'm so busy with the collection. Did you have to make me come here?

129
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,194
Were you with him all day yesterday?

130
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,639
With who?

131
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,674
I heard you went to an art show and had dinner with him.

132
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,574
Oh, that. Yes.

133
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,245
By the way, are you sure you know that family well?

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,519
What do you mean?

135
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,488
Well, you were confused between him and his brother.

136
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,855
That's because I only met them a few times when they were kids!

137
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,698
Anyway, we need better distribution channels to grow the company.

138
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,025
See him often and take time to get to know him better, okay?

139
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,535
Why are you all quiet?

140
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,094
Okay, I heard you.

141
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,635
Oh, you picked up.

142
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,704
What's up?

143
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,944
You left something at my place last night.

144
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:51,015
I think this is your scarf.

145
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,515
Oh, that?

146
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,184
You can keep it.

147
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,424
What? This scarf?

148
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,355
What does it mean?

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,794
That we've made some progress?

150
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,235
What kind of progress?

151
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,174
Must you interrogate me?

152
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,174
I wanted to thank you for last night anyway,

153
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,974
so just consider it a gift and accept it, please.

154
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,985
A gift?

155
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,985
For me?

156
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,878
How did you find out about this artist? He's based in the UK.

157
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,745
You're the only one who doesn't see that I'm very good at my job.

158
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,618
That should be enough. I'll now get started with the lettering.

159
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,515
Okay, sounds good.

160
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,855
His solo show last year got amazing feedback.

161
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,424
Everyone will want to go to his upcoming live show in Hongdae.

162
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,498
My gosh, that looks awesome.

163
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,665
This is for the event brochure, so let's pick impactful ones.

164
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,995
Where did you get that?

165
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,105
- Nice, right? - Can you not stand so close to me?

166
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:57,044
I got it as a gift.

167
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,519
If she wanted to thank me, she could buy me dinner next time...

168
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,819
or get me a gift certificate, which would be much easier.

169
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,245
But instead, she left her scarf at my place.

170
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,958
She wants to share it with me.

171
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,958
She's very direct. She doesn't hide her feelings.

172
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,454
What do you think it means?

173
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,924
I guess she likes you.

174
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,794
Right? That is the only possible conclusion.

175
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,564
Who gave it to you?

176
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:21,535
Just someone who I became very close to last night.

177
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,035
I should save up and move out as soon as possible.

178
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,809
I really don't understand you.

179
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,810
What don't you understand?

180
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,248
It's not like you have no savings.

181
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,348
You say you want to earn money,

182
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,049
but turn down fashion shows which pay better.

183
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,485
You say no to fashion editorials but take jobs like this.

184
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,115
Why do you do that?

185
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,084
- Because it's fun. - I see.

186
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,594
There's something else that's fun.

187
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,964
Claire Marie changed their fabric to linen tweed this morning.

188
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,794
I only heard about it on my way here.

189
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,964
All these last-minute changes sure keep things fun.

190
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,304
You'll have to come up with a whole new concept. Have fun.

191
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,279
Na Ri.

192
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,608
Gabardine and linen tweed both look promising,

193
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,245
but the gabardine is a darker color.

194
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,214
Let's go with the linen tweed.

195
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,605
Oh, boy.

196
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Ji Min's Kindergarten Teacher

197
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:03,605
Ms. Jeon, Ji Min didn't bring her notebook today.

198
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,605
Notebook

199
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,059
I asked you to sign her notebook and put it in her bag.

200
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,855
She has more than one notebook, you see.

201
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,858
I put everything in her bag.

202
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,659
Why do you always have to leave your socks like this?

203
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,728
Must I tell you over and over?

204
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,198
Flip them and throw them in the washer.

205
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,299
Is it that hard?

206
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,968
Just flip them and throw them in the washer.

207
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,238
Is it that hard?

208
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:35,039
You made me take out the garbage and drop Ji Min off...

209
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,198
on my way to work.

210
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,704
What did you do?

211
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,304
I have to go into a meeting now. Bye.

212
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,704
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.

213
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,775
Did you wait long?

214
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,275
No.

215
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,915
Hold on, Ms. Seo.

216
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,214
How's it going with The Paul M? Did you come up with an idea yet?

217
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,628
I've been racking my brain trying to figure out a way...

218
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:00,895
to become as competent as you are.

219
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,934
How about an overnight trip this weekend to get some fresh air?

220
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,105
Good ideas come to you when you're relaxed and well-rested.

221
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:14,639
But what about your family? Will you be okay?

222
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,434
Why bring up family? We're at work now.

223
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,204
Where shall we go?

224
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,415
Can we sue the hospital when a diagnosis is wrong?

225
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,289
I got a CT scan done and was diagnosed...

226
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,929
with stage four pancreatic cancer, so I cried so much.

227
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,689
but it was intestinal tuberculosis, which is curable.

228
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,498
My aunt was diagnosed with a malignant tumor.

229
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,899
But turns out, it was just a cyst.

230
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,799
I underwent surgery because I was diagnosed...

231
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,738
with a malignant tumor, but it was a cyst.

232
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,838
Misdiagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer at University Hospitals

233
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,468
The crazy thing was that it was not cancer.

234
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,905
An ulcer in the small intestine was what caused the symptoms.

235
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,179
Make sure you get your blood work and CT lung screening done.

236
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,544
You need to see at least three different doctors.

237
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,344
It's awfully quiet despite our design getting leaked.

238
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,389
It's not like this is the first time.

239
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,458
Every time this happens, we just let it slide.

240
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,424
Darn it. Who leaked the design?

241
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,358
Hey, Sun Ju.

242
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,525
Did you really leave right after I left?

243
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,868
Why are you being like this to me?

244
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,765
I swear, I left right after you did.

245
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,405
Hwang Chi Hyung

246
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,645
The office morale has been ruined.

247
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,659
Jung So Young

248
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,385
I suggest you confess the truth.

249
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,785
Hwang Chi Hyung

250
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,554
How come everyone seems so down?

251
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,998
I know that you're all upset.

252
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,495
But if our teamwork is ruined...

253
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,334
on top of getting our design stolen, I'll be even more upset.

254
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,275
I don't think anyone on our team...

255
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,674
would ever do something like that.

256
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,509
It already happened.

257
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,944
All we can do now is pull off what we originally planned to do.

258
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,375
And do an amazing job.

259
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,748
- Okay. - We have no time to waste.

260
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:06,314
Let's come up with new designs quickly.

261
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,554
I'll find out what kind of fabric we can get.

262
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,324
Let's cheer up, okay?

263
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,468
What about fabrics that the other companies...

264
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,539
had ordered but canceled? Is there anything we can use?

265
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,135
About gauge seven, preferably.

266
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,165
Everyone's using plaid fabric, so there's some of that left.

267
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,434
We don't need plaid.

268
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,645
Right, there was a company that offered to get us...

269
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,984
whatever we needed if we bought their deadstock,

270
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,684
but the Production Team won't let us do it.

271
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:42,085
What's left in our fabric inventory?

272
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,454
Right, we have some jersey left.

273
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,565
Jersey: A lightweight single-knit cotton fabric known for its stretch

274
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,165
You should confess the truth before things get out of hand.

275
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,875
What were you doing at Ms. Ha's desk last night?

276
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:03,845
Why do I have to answer this question?

277
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,105
Shall I release the CCTV footage?

278
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:06,915
Go ahead, if you're that sure.

279
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:08,319
But what if it wasn't me?

280
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,585
How will you make up for falsely accusing me?

281
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:13,754
Why are you all quiet?

282
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,959
I suppose the footage doesn't clearly show what I was doing.

283
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,229
You're dragging everyone down for the sake of your selfish greed.

284
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,325
Is this fun for you?

285
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,434
You're making me look like an idiot based on your groundless suspicion.

286
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,135
Is this fun for you?

287
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,395
What are you doing here?

288
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,418
I wish you had given me a heads-up.

289
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,345
Then I would've come dressed up.

290
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,019
You look great.

291
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,658
It's a very nice scarf. Anyone would notice it first...

292
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,719
before seeing your face, so it's much better.

293
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,024
I should've given it to you sooner.

294
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,454
Well, how about we go to the movies this evening?

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,029
I want to thank you for this gift,

296
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,434
so let me buy the tickets.

297
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,338
Don't thank me yet.

298
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,835
I have more favors to ask.

299
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,338
Favors? Like what?

300
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:41,809
Cookie is so cold to me.

301
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,805
I need to know how I can win his heart.

302
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:48,944
- You said he rejected you. - I never agreed.

303
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,588
- Then what's this? - A token of our friendship?

304
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,059
You said we made some progress. What did you mean by that?

305
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,585
That we've learned a bit more about each other.

306
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,325
Hey, Sook.

307
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,165
Pete! My gosh.

308
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:05,724
Long time no see.

309
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,299
Who's that now?

310
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,295
I heard you and Jimmy broke up.

311
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,739
I dumped him.

312
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,534
Make sure you say that if anyone asks.

313
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,805
By the way, who is he? Your boyfriend?

314
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,674
No, we're just friends.

315
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,774
Say hello. This is Seok Do Hoon, the CEO of Vision PR.

316
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:23,645
This is Pete, a rising freelance model.

317
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,819
I see.

318
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,915
Hello.

319
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,155
Nice to meet you. I'm Pete Park.

320
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,754
I like your style. Please contact me.

321
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,368
What does this mean?

322
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:43,835
Well, it just means that I'd love a one-on-one conversation with him.

323
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,635
My gosh, he's very forward.

324
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:49,908
I've been out of the dating game, so I forgot how to pick up on hints.

326
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,944
I should've left a while ago because of my schedule.

327
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,615
Anyway, enjoy your in-depth conversation.

328
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,014
You two would make a cute couple. I'll see you another time.

329
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,284
No.

330
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,855
- What? - You got the wrong idea.

331
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,924
He's straight.

332
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,428
No way.

333
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,595
He said he didn't like women.

334
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,934
Am I wrong, Mr. Seok?

335
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,974
Then, is that why you gave me this scarf?

336
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,434
Yes, that's right.

337
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:33,855
What? Why...

338
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:35,784
Mr. Seok!

339
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:38,459
Tell me!

340
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,229
What did I get wrong? And why are you so upset?

341
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,325
My gosh!

342
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:47,494
Why do you always make assumptions and jump to conclusions about me?

343
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,368
I'm sorry if I offended you.

344
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:51,239
I'm not offended by your wrong assumption,

345
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,908
nor am I prejudiced against homosexuality.

346
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,135
Then why are you being like this?

347
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,335
I'm hurt.

348
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,375
You never once...

349
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,585
tried to see me for who I am or get to know me better.

350
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,615
So the fact that I got the wrong idea...

351
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,055
It just makes me so angry.

352
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,024
The wrong idea?

353
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,524
Forget it.

354
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,494
I'll be off, then.

355
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,799
Gosh, this is so frustrating. Just tell me,

356
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,934
so I can...

357
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,284
Listen.

358
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,625
I have emotions and a heart.

359
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,795
I am a man.

360
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:59,105
A man?

361
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,635
He was born in Korea,

362
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,504
but he's based in Bristol where he first became famous.

363
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,345
A fashion photographer does this too?

364
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,014
Look.

365
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,514
I have nothing to lose.

366
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:20,155
Guts over fear.

367
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:28,895
Learn how to fly with broken wings.

368
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,264
The moment these words are put on a bare wall,

369
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,075
they gain meaning.

370
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,075
That's a lot like us.

371
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,279
It might be an item someone wears for just a season,

372
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,115
but each time, we try so hard to give it a new meaning.

373
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,855
People are the same.

374
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,825
It may seem like we brush past,

375
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:54,724
but to someone,

376
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,764
we leave something significant.

377
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,165
Because of that person,

378
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:02,494
one's life can change.

379
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:04,335
In my case,

380
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,504
it was a woman who bought my photo...

381
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,075
when no one else noticed me.

382
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,674
I had almost given up photography,

383
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:18,815
but I didn't.

384
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,754
Thanks to that photo,

385
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,655
I got through some tough times.

386
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,655
That was all me, then.

387
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,724
That's how great my taste is.

388
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,138
Don't you think it's a rip-off...

389
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:39,368
to charge 20 euros for an amateur's photo?

390
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:41,504
I had to starve because I had no money.

391
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,504
It was 15 euros and my friend asked for 20 by mistake.

392
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:48,145
- Excuse me? - It's too late for a refund.

393
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,014
Just a moment.

394
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,395
What is it?

395
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,534
Learn how to fly with broken wings.

396
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,264
They're all from La Mon.

397
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,838
She'd be used to working with them.

398
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,938
This is why they say connections pay off.

399
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:51,905
Claire Marie gets everything they want.

400
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,719
I wish I could join that team.

401
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,115
So Young's not on the list.

402
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,118
An Sun Ju. What's going on?

403
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,645
Is it just me who doesn't get it?

404
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:06,125
- Let's make it work. - Okay.

405
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,494
What happened?

406
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,135
Did the design walk over there on its own?

407
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,004
There's no way to refute we had the same idea.

408
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:23,734
This is just unbelievable. I feel a headache coming on.

409
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,774
There's nothing we can do. We can't prove it now.

410
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,145
Let's get back to work.

411
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,915
An Sun Ju. What's the matter?

412
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,504
- What's wrong? - Let go.

413
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:56,438
- Explain what this is about! - It was me.

414
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,805
What was...

415
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,174
Yes, it was me. The leak!

416
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,319
I wanted to join a better team,

417
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,454
so I gave them our design!

418
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,395
What... You...

419
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,575
Ms. Ha.

420
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,024
Hey. Is this how you work?

421
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,795
Excuse us.

422
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,469
What's this about?

423
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,239
Why are you in my office?

424
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,199
You stole our factories and fabrics.

425
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,464
You need to beat your competition, so I'll let that slide.

426
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,309
But you shouldn't toy with people.

427
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,049
Can I even make an offer? I proposed an option...

428
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,979
and it was Sun Ju who accepted it.

429
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,474
That's not an offer. That's abuse.

430
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,585
You weren't going to hire her anyway.

431
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,559
Do you hire everyone whose resume you accept?

432
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,059
Sun Ju wasn't good enough.

433
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,284
Are you that anxious?

434
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,825
That you can't beat me?

435
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,529
- What? - You took everything,

436
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,569
but you're still anxious and uneasy.

437
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,739
No matter how hard you think, you don't think you can win.

438
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,168
Listen, Ms. Ha.

439
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:31,638
Don't just design clothes. Design your mind too.

440
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,608
Greed, anxiety, alienation, betrayal.

441
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:36,578
Do you think you can make good, pretty clothes with that?

442
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,578
You make with what's in your heart.

443
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,274
Must you talk like that?

444
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,045
If you come after my team again,

445
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:48,714
however long it takes, I will take you to court,

446
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,055
so that you will never make clothes again.

447
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,645
Go on, then. You asked to see me, so talk.

448
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,244
I wanted to know...

449
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:17,115
what you were doing at Ms. Ha's desk.

450
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,484
Ms. Ha's sketchbook.

451
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,355
Use this for reference.

452
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,769
I drew these sketches...

453
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,764
for my graduation work back when I was your age.

454
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,299
She said I could take a look...

455
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,704
whenever I got stuck trying to draw.

456
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,178
So I was going to study it in my free time.

457
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,809
Why would you take sneak peeks at night on your own?

458
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,204
I didn't want people to see.

459
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,979
I'm way below everyone else when it comes to skills,

460
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,549
and I lack good ideas.

461
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,848
I make up for it with effort,

462
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,784
so I need more time than others.

463
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,484
But people take that to mean I'm not good enough.

464
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,754
Still, isn't it better to be honest than to be misunderstood?

465
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,125
Misunderstandings can be explained,

466
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:06,665
but lack of skill can be an evaluation that sticks.

467
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,964
They accumulate and become my future.

468
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,434
But as the president's son, your skills and people's opinions...

469
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,835
don't matter one bit.

470
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,444
- It's Ms. Ha. - The Fabric Sample Room?

471
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:36,855
An Sun Ju.

472
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,964
She called you too.

473
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,174
It's jersey cloth. What will you do with this?

474
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:52,774
A collaboration.

475
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,545
A collaboration? With whom?

476
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,944
With these.

477
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,684
Learn how to fly with broken wings.

478
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:03,815
With jersey cloth?

479
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,328
It's just inner-wear material. Won't it be too simple?

480
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:10,295
It's simple but we can say it has more potential.

481
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,868
Coco Chanel made outerwear with jersey cloth...

482
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:14,194
that was only used in underwear.

483
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,964
What will be the main outfit?

484
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:25,045
The shirt-like one-piece that So Young came up with.

485
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:29,319
Of the designs that Claire Marie didn't take,

486
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,014
I like this the most.

487
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,744
What do you say?

488
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,514
I like it.

489
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:37,428
I don't think it's a bad idea.

490
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:38,655
Sun Ju, what about you?

491
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,828
Why won't you say anything?

492
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:42,299
Do you not even want to work now?

493
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,855
It's not that.

494
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,665
I don't think I can stay at Sono.

495
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,464
Even if you end up leaving, apologize properly first.

496
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,565
I apologize.

497
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,209
Not to me.

498
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,575
To your teammates.

499
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,148
Your seniors and juniors.

500
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,319
We all wanted to do so well.

501
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,148
We were all so excited about this.

502
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:06,449
See what your greed did to all that.

503
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,855
Face it and make proper apologies to your teammates.

504
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:14,055
Don't just say you're sorry. Show it to us with results.

505
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:17,595
Work hard on your designs, pull off a great season,

506
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,724
and apologize to us properly.

507
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,434
I'm not giving you an opportunity. I want you to apologize.

508
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:26,305
Your teammates will decide whether or not to accept it.

509
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,845
Why won't you answer?

510
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,575
She asked what you think of So Young's design.

511
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,454
I like it too.

512
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:48,699
It's unanimous.

513
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,799
Then let's get to work and hire some influencers.

514
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,699
Na Ri, you call Im Soo Ah.

515
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,239
Sun Ju, you call Park Ha Mi.

516
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,638
I'll call An Hye Rang too.

517
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:00,305
Who else is popular these days?

518
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,774
I know someone.

519
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,805
Hye Rin's so pretty

520
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,349
I love Hye Rin

521
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,378
Goddess Hye Rin

522
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,615
- You're the prettiest! - I love you!

523
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,655
What are those looks about? Don't you believe me?

524
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:21,328
Come on, people. I'm very popular myself.

525
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:22,799
I don't know if you're hot,

526
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,224
but I do know we'll never work with Hye Rin.

527
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,034
Let's start by contacting the influencers we just mentioned.

528
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,365
Okay.

529
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,474
Can you really hire Hye Rin?

530
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:40,974
- Why do you ask? - If you can get her,

531
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,944
I'll forgive you for suspecting me.

532
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,184
As you requested, we did a CT, MRI, lung CT,

533
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,194
and a full blood panel.

534
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,065
Do you see this on the screen?

535
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:00,494
It is pancreatic cancer.

536
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,204
Is there no chance at all...

537
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,835
of a mechanical malfunction or misdiagnosis?

538
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,174
That would be zero.

539
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:15,545
You need to get admitted for chemotherapy.

540
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,494
This is crazy.

541
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,675
Call history

542
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,715
My honey

543
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,235
Can you take this?

544
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,844
Please look over here!

545
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,378
- I love you! - I love you.

546
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,418
Please look over here!

547
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:34,688
Please look over here!

548
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:36,114
Thank you.

549
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,654
The One, Hwang Chi Hyung

550
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,525
Hi, Hye Rin.

551
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,264
Okay, Mr. Choi. Take care.

552
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,275
The food will be served shortly. Slow down.

553
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:02,815
That's so refreshing.

554
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,114
Will repairs cost a lot?

555
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,489
The bonnet's wrinkled, the bumper's bashed,

556
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,315
and the engine oil's old.

557
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:12,525
You should've asked for a discount.

558
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,184
Leave that to me.

559
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,025
How can you drink when you just crashed your car?

560
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:21,864
Why not? It's fun.

561
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,395
And I get to spend time with you.

562
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:29,105
You are so incredibly positive.

563
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,974
So, why did you call me, and not Young Eun?

564
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,675
Did you two fight?

565
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,175
Young Eun is busy.

566
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,815
You took her factory and fabrics, and she even got her designs stolen.

567
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,485
She must be out of her mind right now.

568
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,025
Did she tell you all that?

569
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:47,255
What else did she say I did?

570
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,795
Did she tell you she cursed me out?

571
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,724
That's on you.

572
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,634
You should treat her better.

573
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,965
She's the only friend you have left.

574
00:36:58,109 --> 00:36:59,569
Why is she my only friend?

575
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,835
There's you too.

576
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,045
Yes. You still have two right now.

577
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:15,054
What's gotten into you?

578
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,509
Soo Ho, did you do something terrible?

579
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,634
Me?

580
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:39,244
No.

581
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:42,175
I'm blameless and innocent in every way.

582
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,445
Mi Sook got crazy drunk, and she's never been like this.

583
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:47,344
She's been drinking all evening.

584
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:49,684
We all want to do that every now and then.

585
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,224
Tell her to come home before Ji Min goes to kindergarten.

586
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:57,654
What's going on?

587
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,395
Did she tell you anything?

588
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,708
She crashed her car and got drunk happily.

589
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,764
She doesn't want to see her husband or kid, she says.

590
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:08,938
She refused to go home,

591
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:11,304
and kept begging for another drink.

592
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,445
What's going on?

593
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,474
It's a woman.

594
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,418
Soo Ho wouldn't cheat on her.

595
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:21,458
This is how little you know about men.

596
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:22,855
See, men...

597
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,384
Listen. I have emotions and a heart.

598
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,494
I am a man.

599
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,469
Anyway, didn't you watch The World of the Married?

600
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,969
The guy cheated on his wife, then yelled at her.

601
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,938
It's not a crime to fall in love!

602
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,904
That's what men are like.

603
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,049
Young Eun, you have alcohol, right?

604
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,445
Let's go for round two.

605
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:28,485
Sorry for contacting you this late.

606
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,184
If I'm to sue them for fraud,

607
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,688
I need proof that I wired money to the travel agency,

608
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,425
and the text messages.

609
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,795
They want copies of all that,

610
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,195
but I don't know how to do.

611
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:42,795
If I ask my daughter,

612
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,409
I'll have to tell her how much I lost.

613
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,934
I don't want her to worry.

614
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,534
I see.

615
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:52,204
- To get a screen-grab... - Yes.

616
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,279
you press this.

617
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,878
- Like that? - Yes.

618
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,248
- Press the bottom button. - This?

619
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:58,949
- That's right. - I see.

620
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,889
Why does it say confirm?

621
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,219
You must press this to save it.

622
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,355
I see.

623
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,054
- That's right. - It's all done.

624
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:11,224
Are you a photographer?

625
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,965
Pardon?

626
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:16,165
- Oh, yes. - Where is your studio?

627
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,304
I don't have one.

628
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,864
I just go to whoever will hire me.

629
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,534
- You're a freelancer? - Yes.

630
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,344
I see.

631
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,005
You don't have a regular job.

632
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,315
I don't.

633
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:35,654
Are you free two Mondays from today?

634
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,654
Do the police need a statement?

635
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,485
It's for a part-time job.

636
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,330
Pardon?

637
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:45,829
There is a photographer we usually hire on sports day,

638
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,525
but there's a special event that day.

639
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,895
I'd like to recommend you.

640
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:53,739
I have that much say in how things work.

641
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,034
I'm the vice-principal.

642
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,634
Are you free tomorrow?

643
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:00,404
- Will you work part-time? - Do what?

644
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:03,545
I'm a designer for The One.

645
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,085
I can't pay you a lot, though.

646
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,518
You know what a school's budget is like.

647
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,284
Okay. Call me when the time's set.

648
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,585
You're in?

649
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,724
Okay, good.

650
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,364
Thank you so much.

651
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:21,338
You can slide your hand to get a screen-grab too.

652
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:22,735
- Oh, really? - Like this.

653
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,074
He has a woman. That's what my gut says.

654
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:32,545
Look into him.

655
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:37,045
If he were that capable, I wouldn't worry about him.

656
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,625
Why won't you ask a thing?

657
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,855
About what?

658
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:53,965
I took your factory, fabrics, and design from your team.

659
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,094
But you never once asked me why I did that.

660
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,895
Why did you do it?

661
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,934
Mr. J.

662
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,175
You like him, don't you?

663
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:08,315
I know you've had a thing with him ever since you met him in Busan.

664
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,014
How could you not tell me about it?

665
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,784
If I had told you, would that have changed anything?

666
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,585
No, nothing would've changed because I like him.

667
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:22,855
Still, we're friends. You should've told me.

668
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,665
Anyway,

669
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,864
I didn't know back then, so I decided to let it go.

670
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,804
But now that I know about it, you'd better stop hitting on him.

671
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,069
What a bunch of nonsense.

672
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,175
Hey.

673
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,338
It's up to them whether to like each other.

674
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:39,579
Who are you to tell her what to do?

675
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,449
She's already going through enough.

676
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,248
Why can't you be considerate of my feelings instead?

677
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:45,114
She's doing just fine.

678
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,645
Gosh.

679
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:54,085
What's going on? What's with the ambiance?

680
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:56,094
What is it?

681
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:58,665
Once again, am I the only one who doesn't know?

682
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,695
Gosh. What is it? Tell me.

683
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,304
Yoon Jae Guk...

684
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,474
is Soo Wan's little brother.

685
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,204
Soo Wan? Who's that?

686
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,175
My goodness.

687
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:22,355
Are you saying...

688
00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:26,355
he was the older brother that died ten years ago?

689
00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:32,864
- Young Eun. - What a lousy twist of fate.

690
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:36,034
I know.

691
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:37,934
Gosh.

692
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,838
Hey, what's there to think about?

693
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:43,708
Why can't you be with him? Just sleep with him if you want to.

694
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:47,074
And as for you, just give up on him already.

695
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,074
Gosh. Listen, guys.

696
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,344
Life...

697
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:57,315
is so darn short.

698
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:36,094
Are you sleeping?

699
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,025
Should I...

700
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:45,704
really just give it a shot?

701
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,275
Forget about Soo Wan.

702
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:54,904
So what if he's Soo Wan's brother?

703
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,614
Should I just go with it?

704
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,844
Yoon Jae Guk

705
00:45:29,879 --> 00:45:32,415
It's time you change the wallpaper on your phone.

706
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:42,855
It's time you change the wallpaper on your phone.

707
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:50,295
Yoon Jae Guk

708
00:45:58,109 --> 00:45:59,244
Were you sleeping?

709
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,744
I just...

710
00:46:05,749 --> 00:46:07,915
wanted to hear your voice.

711
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,594
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

712
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,625
Good night.

713
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:25,764
Can we meet right now?

714
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,275
I want...

715
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,614
to meet you right now.

716
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,154
- Why are you smiling? - I'm happy...

717
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:25,264
that you called.

718
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,235
This thing we have began ten years ago,

719
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,605
so let's just say that we're now breaking up.

720
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:36,605
Okay.

721
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,904
Let's do that.

722
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:45,715
Let's break up.

723
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:51,284
I finally know...

724
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,684
which path I'm standing on.

725
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:57,525
But while we're breaking up,

726
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:02,295
let's allow ourselves to be in love,

727
00:48:08,169 --> 00:48:09,775
Happy moments...

728
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,675
will pass by too quickly.

729
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,844
You might get sick of me...

730
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,184
and find me annoying.

731
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:26,454
You might even regret your decision.

732
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,025
Yes, let's do that.

733
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,695
Let's at least try that.

734
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,465
We should...

735
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,605
at least give it a try.

736
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,605
Okay.

737
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:45,904
Let's do that.

738
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:32,994
Young Eun! Stop what you're doing right now!

739
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,125
You're going to work with the place that copied our design?

740
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,268
Have you lost your mind?

741
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:40,538
Ms. Choi's factory is the only place that can meet the deadline...

742
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:42,505
and guarantee the quality of the clothes.

743
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,835
All we did was make a realistic decision.

744
00:49:45,879 --> 00:49:47,308
What if she causes trouble again?

745
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:49,005
Are you trying to ruin the SS collection?

746
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:50,209
This won't work.

747
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:51,209
You know you can't work with any factories...

748
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,875
without the production department's consent.

749
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,114
I won't approve of this! Never!

750
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,489
You picked that place yourself.

751
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,685
When did I ever...

752
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:04,054
When did I do that, sir?

753
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:07,128
You gave me a list of factories that day.

754
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,029
- I did? - Why did you add it to the list...

755
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,565
if you weren't going to approve of it?

756
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,935
I did?

757
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:13,165
How long will it take?

758
00:50:13,939 --> 00:50:15,134
Seven minutes?

759
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,764
No, five minutes.

760
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,275
Choiheeja Apparel

761
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,978
It's not going to be a problem, right?

762
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:24,074
Pardon?

763
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:27,614
No, of course not. It won't be a problem at all.

764
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,585
Let's hurry.

765
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,429
Make sure you space them out evenly.

766
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,594
- Okay. - Okay.

767
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,565
Sir, the artists will need separate lights.

768
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,134
Cameras 1, 2... Okay.

769
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,505
Ms. Seo, where are the models?

770
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:51,339
I asked them to be ready in 15 minutes.

771
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,538
- I'll go check. - Okay.

772
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:53,804
Sun Ju, bring us a bigger one.

773
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:55,648
Let's check the order.

774
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:56,878
We replaced her.

775
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:59,045
- Hye Rin will be the last. - How about the third slot?

776
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,125
Goodness, Hye Rin.

777
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,025
It's nice to see you working with Sono again.

778
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,339
What's the matter? You don't seem too glad to see me.

779
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,498
Goodness, don't be absurd.

780
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:23,308
I'm just curious...

781
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:27,735
as to why you suddenly changed your mind.

782
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,204
You came because you need me?

783
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:31,344
Yes.

784
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,219
- On one condition. - Of course.

785
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,145
I didn't expect you to say yes right away.

786
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,188
From now on, answer my calls before the bell rings three times.

787
00:51:39,189 --> 00:51:41,889
Whenever I ask you to come see me, I want you to show up...

788
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,855
within 30 minutes regardless of the time and location.

789
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,395
For how long? Will one week do?

790
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,965
For 100 days. That's how long it took...

791
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:52,299
to get over you after you dumped me.

792
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,668
No. We might get a bit too close.

793
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:55,904
How about six months then?

794
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:57,804
I think 100 days will do. Okay.

795
00:51:58,879 --> 00:52:02,304
One. Two. Three.

796
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,105
- He's not picking up? - Hey, Hye Rin.

797
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,179
That took you a while.

798
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,748
Instead, I showed up in person.

799
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:10,018
I had to do two things at once.

800
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:12,014
Try to cut me some slack.

801
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:14,288
- Do you have plans after this? - We're having a team dinner.

802
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,454
Let's eat dinner together.

803
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,485
Okay.

804
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,625
- What about the other side? - Oh, right.

805
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:25,969
They're photos from Claire Marie.

806
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,268
If you choose a few,

807
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,804
we'll make final edits and upload them on our webpage banner.

808
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,409
How are things going with Sono?

809
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,009
They're going to do a live show on the Internet today.

810
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,978
Then they're going to upload a post on Hye Rin's social media page...

811
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:38,645
and receive primary orders from the first 70 customers.

812
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:41,045
Ms. Ha really knows how to sell things.

813
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,915
It's going to begin soon.

814
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:02,869
An short moment...

815
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,474
can last a lifetime.

816
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,585
Let me introduce to you, A Flow,

817
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,424
the graffiti artist that paints city walls with art and stories.

818
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:12,839
It's a simple dress with no distinct characteristics,

819
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,509
but that's why it can turn into anything.

820
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,078
We can try layering clothes.

821
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,909
It can be worn underneath a coat,

822
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,248
and it can also be outer clothing.

823
00:54:20,249 --> 00:54:21,719
The graffiti is going to be sprayed right onto the clothes, right?

824
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,784
Yes, each outfit will be unique with no other copies in the world.

825
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,054
On top of that, the photos on stage will be taken by Mr. J?

826
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,228
People at Claire Marie are going to be really jealous.

827
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:33,424
They deserve it.

828
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,715
Should I turn it off?

829
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,685
Leave it.

830
00:55:10,629 --> 00:55:13,735
Aren't they your photos?

831
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,605
What do you think? Do you like them?

832
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:20,474
Didn't you take those photos for your exhibition?

833
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:24,344
I thought it'd be nice to promote them beforehand.

834
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,815
Was that Ha Young Eun's idea?

835
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:29,915
I suggested it.

836
00:55:30,149 --> 00:55:32,788
Jae Guk, what are you thinking?

837
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,114
How far do you think you guys can go?

838
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,685
I haven't thought that far.

839
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:41,255
We're just going to focus on the stuff we have control over.

840
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:06,114
We're getting a nice number of views.

841
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,784
It's going nicely.

842
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,485
Great.

843
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:24,864
Number of viewers in real-time, special event for 70 pre-orders

844
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:32,514
This is going great.

845
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,915
Ms. Nam, how are things going?

846
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:43,985
Unbelievable. The 70 pre-orders were made in just 2 seconds.

847
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,529
We got 20,000 pre-orders.

848
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,195
The viewers are loving it.

849
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:53,739
We already have more than 70,000 views.

850
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,904
This is amazing. This really is a huge success.

851
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,704
This is so exciting.

852
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:03,344
My goodness.

853
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,978
- I'm so excited. - This is amazing.

854
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:08,474
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

855
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,915
Great work, everyone.

856
00:57:12,189 --> 00:57:13,415
You guys are beautiful!

857
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,704
This is going to make everyone miserable.

858
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,978
I'm sure...

859
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:33,979
10 years ago

860
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,605
your feelings for her won't last.

861
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,344
You're just being impulsive, and your feelings will disappear.

862
00:57:38,479 --> 00:57:39,518
Yoo Jung.

863
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:41,878
Think about your family. Your mother's expectations.

864
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,449
What your family, friends, and acquaintances will think.

865
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,659
Are you really willing to throw everything away...

866
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,185
just for something that's only lasted for two months?

867
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:56,895
I can't just sit back and watch her ruin your life.

868
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,195
That's my way of loving you.

869
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,554
Thanks. It was all thanks to you.

870
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,154
I miss you.

871
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,724
Me too.

872
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,748
- Cheers. - Good work, guys.

873
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:47,179
- Cheers! - Cheers!

874
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,384
Good work, everyone.

875
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,685
Great work.

876
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,185
- Good work. - Great work.

877
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,824
Here. I want soju.

878
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,259
Once again, I'd like to thank...

879
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,469
everyone at Sono and Vision PR. Thank you. You're the best.

880
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:06,094
- Cheers! - Cheers!

881
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:08,235
This is great.

882
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,139
- One more time. Cheers. - Cheers.

883
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,935
Cheers, guys.

884

885
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:24,185
Yoon Soo Wan

886
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:37,465
Yoon Soo Wan

887
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,445
Yoon Soo Wan

888
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,545
Are you...

889
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:58,715
doing well?

890
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:16,704
Yoon Soo Wan: Are you doing well?

891
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:38,429
Special thanks to RECTO and Baek Hae Yong...

892
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,695
for helping with the fashion show

893
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:06,458
Now, We Are Breaking Up

894
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:07,558
Tell me how you're doing.

895
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:10,728
I heard you told your mother about your girlfriend.

896
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:11,828
What is she like?

897
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:14,628
She's a nice person. She's someone I care about a lot.

898
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,328
Why now?

899
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:18,299
Jae Guk's family and my family...

900
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,898
have been close ever since we were young.

901
01:01:20,899 --> 01:01:22,435
Soo Wan, too.

902
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:24,569
He's Jae Guk's older brother.

903
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:27,208
He died due to a car accident ten years ago.

904
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:30,009
It was a rainy day.

905
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:32,179
He left to meet someone.

906
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,418
Who's Shin Yoo Jung?

907
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,315
What kind of relationship do you guys have?

908
01:01:36,919 --> 01:01:39,915
When did you start having feelings for me?

909
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,284
Gosh, not again.

910
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,659
Who is this?

911
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,924
I think my dad has a hunch.

912
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,054
What are you going to do about Yoon Jae Guk?

913
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,369
What do you mean?

914
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:53,235
I got a call from Soo Wan.

915
01:01:54,499 --> 01:01:56,534
At what point does love begin?

916
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,605
And at what point does it end?
