1
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,423
What are clothes?

2
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:17,563
Every single day, I ask myself this question.

3
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:21,693
What kinds of clothes will you wear?

4
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:25,803
What is the life you want? What kind of person do you want to be?

5
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,873
- Young Eun. - Yes, sir.

6
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:33,013
Upon graduating from vocational high school,

7
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:35,077
I started working at the Dongdaemun Market right away.

8
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,983
But that was before spring, so it was still very cold.

9
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,656
But what made the cold weather worse...

10
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:42,013
was the fact that there were no walls or even a roof...

11
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:43,786
to protect me.

12
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:45,727
I had to fight the cold...

13
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,192
just to make ends meet.

14
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,423
That experience really taught me how hard that is.

15
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:54,497
The life that is given to you. A safe choice.

16
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:56,362
I want to challenge myself.

17
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,002
Versus the life that you want.

18
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,972
The courage to challenge yourself, be vulnerable,

19
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:01,933
and allow yourself to fail.

20
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:05,573
Young Eun!

21
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:10,242
I mean, Ms. Ha. What is going on? You're leaving on your own?

22
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:14,713
Some might say you're falling behind the latest trends.

23
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:18,782
And some might say the clothes don't suit you.

24
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:24,222
But good clothes...

25
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,793
are the ones that you want to wear...

26
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,532
and fit you the best.

27
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:32,103
Thank you, Jae Guk.

28
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,532
For loving me.

29
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,103
And for letting me love you.

30
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:43,783
I'll no longer be scared.

31
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:49,152
With the strength and energy I felt when we were in love,

32
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,592
I will move on with my life.

33
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,492
Okay.

34
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,902
An outfit that had been sitting in a corner of my closet...

35
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:10,242
asks me this question.

36
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,173
How do you want to live your life?

37
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:19,652
I answer, I want to be myself.

38
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,627
Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are.

39
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,353
By Gianni Versace

40
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:35,332
Now, We Are Breaking Up

41
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,736
Final Episode

42
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,973
Young Eun, are you really leaving?

43
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,242
Thank you for everything.

44
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,642
Young Eun, I'll ask you one last time.

45
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,872
Why are you leaving?

46
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,646
I want to do my own designs before it's too late.

47
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,216
Yes, do it.

48
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:55,257
Whether you stay here or go do your own thing with Sono,

49
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,853
you can still do that.

50
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:59,522
Sono's colour palette and signature designs...

51
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,926
Keeping all of that and starting something new...

52
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,193
is realistically impossible. You know that.

53
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,932
I want to start with a clean slate, with an empty sketchbook.

54
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:13,533
If it was that easy, everyone would go and do that.

55
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:15,633
I suppose she's getting a nice severance package.

56
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,977
From securing a factory to getting fabric and other supplies...

57
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:19,646
Even if you were to order the bare minimum,

58
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:22,176
you'd end up spending tens of thousands of dollars.

59
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:24,016
Here, both President Hwang and Director Hwang...

60
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:25,746
always praise her and speak so highly of her,

61
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,056
and she thinks it'll be the same everywhere she goes.

62
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,157
She always acted fiercely loyal,

63
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,223
so I thought she couldn't live without Sono.

64
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,823
I guess that wasn't the case after all.

65
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:36,862
Then what about Sono?

66
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,736
You launched the brand and have been spearheading it.

67
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,697
President Hwang acknowledges that.

68
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:43,802
That's why he put you in charge.

69
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,202
Right.

70
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,103
I thought so too.

71
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,343
But I was wrong.

72
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,112
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:58,512
Na Ri and Sun Ju spent their entire 20s here.

74
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,353
The seamstress, the patternmaker,

75
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,423
Director Hwang, Head Manager Koh...

76
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,723
have all spent the past ten years with Sono, just like I have.

77
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:10,163
So why do you think Sono is mine? It's ours.

78
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,026
That is true.

79
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,692
Speaking of which,

80
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,202
do you see these two lines here? I got them because of Sono.

81
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,237
- That is not true. - What are you talking about?

82
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,706
You didn't get those lines because of Sono.

83
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,437
I got one of them because of you, Ms. Nam.

84
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,077
- What about my wrinkles? - Look at this.

85
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:25,577
This is all your fault.

86
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,843
What about all the wrinkles that I got because of you?

87
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,473
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

88
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:35,016
Hey, we're turning 40 soon.

89
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:36,786
When you're in your 20s,

90
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,083
you can sleep off anything thanks to your good metabolism,

91
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:41,356
but you'll quit and start your own label at your age now?

92
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:42,997
Why would you put yourself through that?

93
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:45,463
Thank goodness I'm doing it before I turn 50, right?

94
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:51,062
You're so mean. You don't think of me as your real friend.

95
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:54,432
Because I made this decision without talking to you about it first?

96
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,773
- Chi Sook. - What?

97
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:01,413
Throughout my 20s...

98
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:03,543
and 30s,

99
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,983
I struggled. It was very stressful.

100
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:10,252
Without you, it would've been even more stressful.

101
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:14,052
Are you sure I didn't make it harder for you?

102
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:19,423
I came to your rescue whenever you got yourself in trouble,

103
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,997
but I didn't do that...

104
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:23,302
to curry favour with the General Director.

105
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:27,333
I did it because it was you, because you're my friend.

106
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,942
Because they were mistakes that my friend made.

107
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,143
Thanks to you,

108
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,783
I got to do so many things.

109
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,483
You did more for me...

110
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:42,413
than I did for you.

111
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:45,322
Thanks.

112
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:53,062
We'll no longer work together, but I'm not going anywhere.

113
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:56,233
I'll always be your friend, your best friend.

114
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,103
How come everyone's looking so downcast?

115
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,913
- Ms. Ha. - Thank you for everything, guys.

116
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:12,312
I couldn't have done what I did without you guys.

117
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,853
Ms. Ha.

118
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,783
Why won't you ask us to come and work for you?

119
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,096
Starting my own label sounds great and all.

120
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,896
But in reality, I'm starting over with nothing.

121
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:25,867
It could disappear in a year, or even before that. Who knows?

122
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,062
At the moment, I don't know anything for sure.

123
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,966
You're all doing a good job here, so I don't want to burden you...

124
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,336
for such selfish reasons.

125
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,033
Young Eun, you know...

126
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:37,476
I have a personal question,

127
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:40,776
as someone who has known you since elementary school.

128
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:43,117
- What? Do I have a plan? - I'm sure you do.

129
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:46,112
You're a realist, one who is very wise.

130
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:47,413
Yes, I do have a plan.

131
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,783
Everyone will say it's not possible,

132
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,952
but I want to do it.

133
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:54,153
So do you have a plan or not?

134
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,663
I trust that...

135
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,293
you guys will take good care of Sono.

136
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,877
- What about the price tag? - It's here.

137
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,673
Hold on, then...

138
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,382
Don't you think we should fix the waistline?

139
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:23,122
Hang on. If that's the case...

140
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,353
We should change the button.

141
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,956
- Change the button? - Yes.

142
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:29,353
Look. It doesn't go with this colour.

143
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,862
You're really something.

144
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,762
I can't believe you're leaving Sono.

145
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:40,372
You and I are so different, Ms. Ha.

146
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,242
But we both want to do a good job...

147
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:45,877
and want to make good clothes. That we have in common.

148
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:48,473
I'll keep being jealous and envious of you.

149
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,442
So I'll keep an eye on what you're up to.

150
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:54,983
I'll take that as a word of encouragement.

151
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:05,263
An Sun Ju

152
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:11,663
An Sun Ju

153
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,663
I wish you all the best.

154
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,376
Have some.

155
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:58,712
All the sugar will definitely lift your spirits.

156
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,116
I really don't get it.

157
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:04,527
Why not keep her cushy job and slack off a little now?

158
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,057
Why must she leave?

159
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:10,123
When you're on salary, the feeling of stability only lasts a month,

160
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,797
but it's still not easy to give up on it.

161
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,466
It must've been a difficult decision.

162
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,966
Now that she's on her own,

163
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,437
how's she going to secure a factory and all the fabric she needs?

164
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:20,832
She'll have to run around and figure it all out.

165
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,403
Even so, she'll be happier this way.

166
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:24,976
Because she's doing what she wants to?

167
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:28,817
Exactly. So stop worrying and just show her your support.

168
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,116
You said she's your best friend.

169
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:33,613
I couldn't even stop her because that was exactly what she said.

170
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,626
Anyone can worry,

171
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:38,756
but sincerely wishing her only the best...

172
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:41,023
is something that only true friends can do.

173
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,293
I'll do my best for Sono.

174
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:48,192
Young Eun and I started and grew the brand together,

175
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:50,533
so she'll be worried if the brand suffers without her.

176
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,403
That's great.

177
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:58,706
Doing your best and living your life to the fullest...

178
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:02,043
is the best thing you can do to show your support for her.

179
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:07,283
I'll be rooting for you with all my heart.

180
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:11,123
My feelings for you are real too, you know.

181
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:20,732
By the way, how's Soo Ho these days?

182
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:37,543
I wouldn't even dare try...

183
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,582
to understand the depth of her love...

184
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,783
for Ji Min and you.

185
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,893
And now, I can't even apologize to her.

186
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,332
Same here.

187
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,702
If Ji Min ever needs a big sister...

188
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:03,133
as she's growing up, I'll come and help anytime.

189
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,913
Let me at least do that so I can apologize to your wife.

190
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,413
And...

191
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:14,452
I'll just think of you as a good colleague of mine.

192
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,613
The jar of pickles should not be opened right away.

193
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:46,116
Hey, don't confuse the fish sauce with the plum extract.

194
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:49,482
Okay, all right. I can tell them apart now.

195
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,626
When making soup, don't use the store-bought soy sauce.

196
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:56,423
The one that my mom made will make the broth more flavourful.

197
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,996
Dad, I'm done!

198
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,232
Okay, just a moment! I'll bring you fresh underwear!

199
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:19,682
Step 1 for when breast buds start growing around 3rd grade

200
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:32,793
Step One is for when breast buds start growing...

201
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:34,932
around third grade.

202
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:39,302
Happy birthday, Ji Min.

203
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:42,673
Happy birthday, Ji Min.

204
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,102
Happy birthday, Ji Min.

205
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:58,082
When your adolescence begins around fifth grade,

206
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:00,493
use this secret diary with a lock.

207
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,592
Use this secret diary with a lock.

208
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:10,966
If you ever have trouble with friends...

209
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:13,133
after you enter middle school, you should read this.

210
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:22,913
You had lots of friends,

211
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,043
and you were always loved.

212
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,253
Dad, hurry!

213
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,092
Yes, I'm coming!

214
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,062
I'll never be as good of a parent as you were.

215
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:42,832
But you know,

216
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,332
I'll do my best.

217
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:51,043
Don't worry about a thing.

218
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:53,712
Okay?

219
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:06,222
What did you just say?

220
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:07,993
I quit my job.

221
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,923
- When? - Today was my last day.

222
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:12,623
Why did you quit?

223
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:14,763
The same reason as yours.

224
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:16,692
What?

225
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:20,273
If I look back on my life, it wasn't all too bad.

226
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:24,602
There were happy and rewarding moments,

227
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:27,013
but I want to start doing...

228
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:31,043
what I've always wanted to do but was too scared to try.

229
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:34,086
Sorry I no longer have...

230
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,952
a high-profile position at a big company.

231
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:38,982
Don't be silly. I never asked you for such things.

232
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:47,692
You've done a great job.

233
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,633
Working so hard...

234
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:52,102
while doing your duty as our child.

235
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,373
You're the best daughter anyone could ask for.

236
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:55,972
Mom.

237
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,873
The thing is, I have nothing now.

238
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,072
Nothing's been decided.

239
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:04,043
Then what will you do?

240
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,082
Right, Mom? I'm so reckless.

241
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:12,552
But you know what? I'm so happy right now.

242
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:17,393
I feel as though I finally got to take off...

243
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,793
this tight outfit I had on for a long time.

244
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:24,562
I can finally breathe. I feel like I can run around freely now.

245
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,403
You know, it might not work out.

246
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:30,102
I might fail.

247
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:33,873
But I know that I at least won't have any regrets.

248
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,143
And if I fail, so be it.

249
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:41,283
Mom, you know...

250
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:48,052
I'm full of confidence, and I can allow myself to be reckless now.

251
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,893
And I'm proud of myself for that.

252
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:57,562
No matter what you decide to do, I'm happy as long as you're happy.

253
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:01,102
My gosh, I feel so supported.

254
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:04,643
You're the best, Mom.

255
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:07,972
Come on.

256
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:11,147
Gosh, Mom.

257
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:13,812
My dear daughter.

258
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:17,523
Team Leader Team Leader Ha Young Eun

259
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:28,163
Team Leader Team Leader Ha Young Eun

260
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:01,893
I don't know how long it'll take.

261
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,403
But this time, I want to do it all on my own.

262
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,972
Hopefully, the clothes that I design...

263
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,012
will take me to you.

264
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:31,492
I don't want to renovate the house.

265
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,692
If we say we're completely redoing the d��cor,

266
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:37,063
it'll stress Young Eun out.

267
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,633
Are you worried about the cost?

268
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,737
Don't worry. I have enough money to pay for it.

269
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:44,106
Why would you waste it on the house?

270
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:46,472
Keep it until we have to divide your property for our divorce.

271
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,346
We've had the same wallpaper for 15 years.

272
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,416
The owner of the interior design shop said...

273
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,247
that we'd for sure find mold if we removed it.

274
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:55,217
And you always said you wanted a new sink.

275
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,987
Why do we need to change the wallpaper?

276
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,186
It's not like a kid...

277
00:17:58,187 --> 00:18:00,727
doodled on it or ripped it.

278
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,692
And the loose cabinet door under the sink?

279
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:04,666
We can tighten the screw.

280
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,792
I don't want to hear you resent me anymore.

281
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:09,893
I'll fix everything that's broken before we split up.

282
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,563
Forget it.

283
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:14,073
The wallpaper...

284
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:17,673
Young Eun generously paid for the whole thing...

285
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,573
when she got a bonus.

286
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,717
And we bought that under-sink cabinet...

287
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,782
instead of our trip to Thailand.

288
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:26,042
When I see them, I think of our daughter...

289
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:29,613
and what could've been my first trip abroad.

290
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:32,053
Who says you can replace them?

291
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:37,292
In life, there are times when you get soaked in the rain...

292
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,462
or end up with blisters. All of that is only natural.

293
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,037
Nothing is all good...

294
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:48,073
or all bad.

295
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,176
Does that apply to me as well?

296
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:53,146
Don't even dream of it.

297
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:54,972
Just hurry up and sign the papers.

298
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,823
It's boiling. Keep the lid open now.

299
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:16,863
Now, put in the tofu.

300
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:31,782
You can do it on your own, right?

301
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,017
Now that you got a little practice,

302
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:38,222
make sure you cook for yourself at least twice a week.

303
00:19:58,147 --> 00:19:59,272
Hello?

304
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,477
The fabric?

305
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:02,942
About that...

306
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:07,883
Just a moment. You're cutting out. I can't hear you.

307
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,012
Hello, this is Sono's design office.

308
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:13,926
Right, about that. We actually gave you the wrong info.

309
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,626
It should be...

310
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,522
Make the collar bigger

311
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,196
Make the collar bigger and shorten the sleeves.

312
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:21,863
- Got it. - Let's check the sleeves.

313
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,133
How much shorter?

314
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,936
- Just a little. - Right?

315
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,303
- Ms. Ha! - My gosh!

316
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:29,803
Did you have to sneak up on us like that?

317
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:32,903
Right, she's not here.

318
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:34,512
Ms. Nam.

319
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:36,676
Here's the reorder list.

320
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,512
Contact the factory before they sell out.

321
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:40,442
Got it.

322
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,287
Right, Team Sono is getting a bonus.

323
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,757
- Really? - Seriously?

324
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:45,883
- How much is the bonus? - My gosh!

325
00:20:50,197 --> 00:20:51,663
She did all the work.

326
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,032
Too bad she's not here to rejoice in her own achievement.

327
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,762
All right.

328
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,272
Done!

329
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,053
I wonder how Young Eun is doing.

330
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,853
Mr. Kang, are you well?

331
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,692
I'm launching a label of my own.

332
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:29,567
Hi, it's Ha Young Eun.

333
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:32,207
It's about the mini line I mentioned before.

334
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,232
Can you not take on any more?

335
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:35,972
Too bad, then.

336
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:38,843
Head Manager Koh Kwang Soo

337
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,446
Who's this? It's Mr. Park.

338
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:44,682
Is Ms. Ha launching her own brand?

339
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:46,646
You decided to work with her?

340
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:49,252
She gave me a call, but you know...

341
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:51,287
mini lines don't turn a profit.

342
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:54,027
I didn't have much to say, so I didn't take the call.

343
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:57,866
Mr. Kim, is the minimum 1,000 yards even though I'm buying for myself?

344
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,227
She's launching her own brand.

345
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:01,866
There's no way she can afford 1,000 yards.

346
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,502
So did you say you won't supply the fabric?

347
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,507
Hello. How have you been?

348
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:17,586
You told me last time that you know someone who is good with patterns.

349
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,913
You need to print at least in units of 100 to leave a profit.

350
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,353
They only deal with companies?

351
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:25,126
It's about a print.

352
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,522
Yes, I have them in a separate folder.

353
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:30,593
I'll come over right now. Bye.

354
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,037
I didn't think you'd really come over.

355
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,007
I thought you were just being pushy.

356
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:44,472
I'd take the job even today if you would order enough.

357
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:48,212
I know you're working on your own, but this is too little.

358
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,977
How much do you need, then?

359
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:53,047
It costs at least 300 dollars to make one drawing and stencil.

360
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:54,787
I need to print at least 3,000 of those...

361
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:57,053
if I'm to pay my staff.

362
00:22:58,157 --> 00:22:59,287
I see.

363
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:01,893
- Sir? - I'll be right there.

364
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,653
You should go.

365
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:15,633
Woori Photo Studio

366
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:22,972
Woori Photo Studio

367
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:25,083
Woori Photo Studio

368
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:30,057
Woori Photo Studio

369
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,682
Not one customer?

370
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,823
You must be terrible at business.

371
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:36,053
What do you think people see in photos?

372
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:38,722
In my case,

373
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,093
it was a woman who bought my photo...

374
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,563
when no one else noticed me.

375
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:49,133
I had almost given up photography, but I didn't.

376
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:52,472
Woori Photo Studio

377
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:55,313
Now, I will no longer be afraid.

378
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,242
Just like when we were in love,

379
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:00,853
with that energy,

380
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,712
I will keep going.

381
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:14,492
Hello, sir. It's Ha Young Eun.

382
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,803
I'm launching my own brand.

383
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:20,932
Yes.

384
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:23,103
Yes.

385
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:25,472
She's boxed in on all sides.

386
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:28,247
It's money that's the problem.

387
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:31,982
Yes. Prices go up if you order too little.

388
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,987
Some suppliers demand cash because they don't trust you.

389
00:24:34,988 --> 00:24:38,557
They hold your supplies ransom if you pay a day late by mistake.

390
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,123
So no one wants to work with her?

391
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:43,393
No.

392
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,563
Let's get to work.

393
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:55,373
- My gosh. - Darn it. Oh, gosh.

394
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:57,646
Why do you keep walking in the shadows?

395
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,077
Mr. Koh. What are you doing in someone else's office?

396
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:01,212
It's someone else's?

397
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:03,942
Am I someone else?

398
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,217
Until when? Why am I someone else?

399
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:08,982
Am I not allowed to be here?

400
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:12,553
Forget about that. Hands up if you saw Young Eun's sketchbook.

401
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,823
Her sketchbook?

402
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,497
She's doing what?

403
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,436
My gosh. She's out of her mind.

404
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,696
No wonder no one wants to work with her.

405
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:26,507
Would it sell if she completely ignores the trend?

406
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:29,237
Brands churn something out and put them on celebrities,

407
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,906
making everyone else want to copy them.

408
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:34,217
When everyone wears the same thing, that becomes a trend.

409
00:25:34,218 --> 00:25:37,987
But do you think wearing that will make me special?

410
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:41,287
No. Someone who pulls off their own style well...

411
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:42,583
is special.

412
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:44,386
Were you a lecturer in your past life?

413
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:46,757
That's logic you'd find in a textbook.

414
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:50,692
If you completely ignore the trend, no one will buy it.

415
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:53,262
Is what everyone will say.

416
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:56,163
That's what I was told when I started Vision PR.

417
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,883
What do you think Ms. Ha needs right now?

418
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,423
A factory or fabric?

419
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:23,923
A friend.

420
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:28,563
I know it's a stretch.

421
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,063
That's fine.

422
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:33,803
Bye.

423
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:44,212
It's okay. I can try again.

424
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,163
Am I not taking enough care of myself?

425
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:24,353
Young Eun

426
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:32,563
You're independent now, so for that, I congratulate you.

427
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:38,563
Thanks.

428
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:45,673
How interesting. Ramyeon and champagne.

429
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,482
You have no fabric or factory to work with?

430
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,682
I'll keep looking.

431
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:01,853
What if you're still stuck?

432
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:03,792
I'll keep trying.

433
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,262
What if you fail?

434
00:28:05,697 --> 00:28:07,022
It'll be a good experience.

435
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:09,063
It's hard work.

436
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,732
Yes. It is hard work.

437
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:13,603
I feel anxious and uneasy.

438
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:16,803
But so far, I'm having fun.

439
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:19,073
Nothing's working out and you're having fun?

440
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:21,442
You're dreadful.

441
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,772
Why are you here?

442
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:26,313
If Mi Sook were here, she'd say...

443
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:30,583
you and I only have each other to talk to now.

444
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:32,553
I should have your back at least.

445
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:36,823
I feel so reassured.

446
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,596
It's so salty. How is it salty even after it's matured?

447
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,502
We'll just have to eat a little bit at a time.

448
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:46,833
Aren't you glad I said she'd added enough salted shrimp?

449
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:48,307
The pickles tasted fine.

450
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:50,333
Mi Sook liked these noodles too.

451
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:52,502
Let's drink.

452
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:05,257
Mi Sook's kimchi is perfect with ramyeon.

453
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:06,482
It is.

454
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:33,512
You are just the same here.

455
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:38,653
You are unable to step even a foot outside of the screen,

456
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:43,653
but everyone else is moving on from their time with you.

457
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,123
Soo Wan.

458
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:51,462
I still miss you so much.

459
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,363
I want to see you.

460
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,507
Wow, this looks great.

461
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:01,702
Eat up.

462
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,972
Thank you.

463
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,603
Have you heard from J?

464
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:11,643
Cookie's not the type to call to say hi.

465
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:14,613
I call him Cookie, but he's not at all sweet.

466
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:16,282
He's a non-sweet cookie.

467
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,522
There's Young Eun. Doesn't he wonder about her?

468
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:23,452
Not at all. He hasn't called.

469
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,323
What about Ms. Ha?

470
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,863
Did she ask about Cookie?

471
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,962
No, not at all.

472
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,732
They're both so tough.

473
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:36,403
How can they fold on love just like that?

474
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:40,343
If I can't see or reach my boyfriend for just one day,

475
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,317
it takes a toll on me.

476
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,742
If we're both too busy and we can't meet,

477
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:49,212
it hurts right here, where my heart is.

478
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:56,823
Did even your heart hurt?

479
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,022
That's how I knew...

480
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:03,393
I must really love Mr. Seok with all my heart.

481
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,002
This is delicious.

482
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:11,803
What...

483
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:14,643
did you just say?

484
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,472
That this is delicious?

485
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:23,712
That I love you with all my heart? That?

486
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:25,252
Yes, that.

487
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,153
Is that...

488
00:32:29,228 --> 00:32:30,393
really true?

489
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:33,962
It is.

490
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:35,833
How many times must I say?

491
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:40,303
This is really good.

492
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:03,312
You did all this? In one month?

493
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:05,153
Yes.

494
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,562
How did you manage to keep all this in?

495
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,933
I wonder myself.

496
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:24,437
I didn't know I was so talented...

497
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,403
or full of inspiration.

498
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:28,843
I felt like Mozart.

499
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,372
Are you a genius too?

500
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,812
These are a waste to keep to yourself.

501
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:38,522
Shouldn't you call buyers and celebs...

502
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,553
and show them to anyone who will look?

503
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:42,597
Should I?

504
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,622
Should I put on another fashion show?

505
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:45,823
Why not?

506
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,062
How about in Paris this time?

507
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:39,234
Shouldn't you be at work? Why...

508
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:45,809
Why are you here at this time of day?

509
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,079
I'm here because I want to work with you.

510
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,579
- What? - Me too.

511
00:35:56,093 --> 00:35:58,563
Stop being naive and go to work.

512
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:00,963
- I resigned. - Our resignations were accepted.

513
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:03,128
They didn't even need to hire replacements for us lackeys.

514
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,199
Chi Hyung. So Young.

515
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:08,132
You said you didn't want to put pressure on us.

516
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,498
You never said you didn't want to work with us.

517
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,739
Please accept us.

518
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,208
I get what you mean.

519
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:23,648
But this is a tough road.

520
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,318
I can't promise you anything.

521
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:28,918
Nothing's easy.

522
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,719
But I know who I want to learn from.

523
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:34,989
I want to be a designer who can be proud of her work.

524
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,389
Give me a shot.

525
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:38,599
I'm thinking of investing.

526
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:40,773
Young Eun, I don't want a stake.

527
00:36:40,774 --> 00:36:42,132
I have only one condition.

528
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,143
I demand to be above So Young.

529
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:46,273
You can be the CEO, I'll be the head manager.

530
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:47,469
So Young can be...

531
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,438
head of design, okay?

532
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:53,239
That depends on how much you'll invest.

533
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:56,509
Ms. Jung, I like how decisive you are.

534
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,518
What should we do first?

535
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,219
Do you have materials and a factory lined up?

536
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,048
No.

537
00:37:04,624 --> 00:37:05,663
Still not yet?

538
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,559
You will make clothes, won't you?

539
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,728
Hello, come right over.

540
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:18,639
Some else is coming?

541
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:33,679
Let's move it.

542
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:59,878
- Hello. - Young Eun.

543
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,782
What got into Chi Sook now?

544
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,949
What about Chi Sook?

545
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,358
Hooray!

546
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:14,329
She's here.

547
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,958
Chi Sook's throwing you a farewell party.

548
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,402
She rented out the whole place,

549
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:22,329
so rack up some sales for me.

550
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,802
What I served so far is on the house.

551
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,009
- Wow. - Thank you.

552
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:30,568
I resigned ages ago.

553
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:34,612
Exactly. The people here are incredibly busy.

554
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,552
Do you know how hard it was...

555
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:38,123
to get them all here?

556
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:39,248
I know.

557
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,023
The people here could make an outfit from start to finish.

558
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,219
Let me pour you one.

559
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:46,418
Did you find a factory?

560
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:49,063
They're all too full to take on more work.

561
00:38:49,064 --> 00:38:50,362
They can't make room...

562
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,433
for a small amount in mid-season.

563
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,398
You rarely supply private buyers, right?

564
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:58,373
You need to order at least 1,000 yards to make it...

565
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,242
worth hooking up the machine.

566
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,972
What fabric supplier...

567
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,739
would sell 50 yards at a time?

568
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:06,012
Subsidiary materials are sold in small amounts.

569
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,882
Only if you pay well enough.

570
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:10,152
But I can't sell for 50 cents a piece...

571
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,119
like I do to large buyers.

572
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:14,148
I have to pay extra for casting.

573
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,449
Isn't this a farewell party?

574
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,858
Can't you offer some words of support instead?

575
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:23,463
You all said you respect Young Eun.

576
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:25,358
None of you are offering to help her out.

577
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:27,402
Respect and livelihoods are separate.

578
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:31,139
Yes. Workplaces are a battlefield, but outside, it's even worse.

579
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:33,068
The alcohol tastes bitter.

580
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:35,873
I'll supply the fabric for Ms. Ha's personal brand.

581
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,509
Whether it's 50 yards or 30, I'll do it.

582
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,608
I'll only charge you 50 cents a piece at the beginning.

583
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:44,748
Once you become famous, I'll charge you way more.

584
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:46,922
If you needed a factory,

585
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:48,652
you should've come straight to me.

586
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,748
Will you not hire me because you're independent?

587
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,889
You all work for Sono.

588
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,259
I can't take you away from that.

589
00:39:58,303 --> 00:40:00,032
Do you think we work just for Sono?

590
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:02,068
We take on other projects too.

591
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,369
I was so upset I almost didn't come here.

592
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:06,199
Seriously...

593
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,369
Do you have to make me cry?

594
00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:12,139
I'll stay.

595
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:17,648
I'll stay put and make sure Sono stays the way it always did.

596
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:19,382
So Young and Chi Hyung left,

597
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,152
so Ms. Nam needs someone to make up for them.

598
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,688
I'll have to stay too.

599
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,728
Thank you so much. Do that for me.

600
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:31,433
You need to thank Mr. Koh too.

601
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:33,458
He called everyone here tonight.

602
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:35,929
Director, that was...

603
00:40:36,203 --> 00:40:39,498
something you should drag on and embellish a bit.

604
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:42,009
Yes, I set this up.

605
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:46,338
Thank you.

606
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:48,748
I'll accept all your help.

607
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,389
I'm so desperate I don't care about saving my face.

608
00:40:54,723 --> 00:40:57,989
And now I have two employees I need to feed.

609
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,329
I will accept your offers gladly and with gratitude.

610
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:04,329
Thank you.

611
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:06,362
You'll do great.

612
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,168
I'll supply you with the best fabrics.

613
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,873
Call me even if it's for one item or two.

614
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:13,869
I'll sew it together even if I must sleep less.

615
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,143
- My gosh. - What?

616
00:41:16,144 --> 00:41:17,543
A toast!

617
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:19,183
- Yes! - A toast!

618
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:21,282
- What should we say? - We'll say...

619
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:22,579
For Ha Young Eun.

620
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:26,882
Who is no longer Head of Design but a CEO herself.

621
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:28,293
- Cheers! - Cheers!

622
00:41:28,294 --> 00:41:30,219
- Cheers. - Thank you.

623
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,838
I got you something expensive.

624
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,838
Not you too.

625
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:53,413
Open it quick.

626
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:55,579
Chi Sook spent a lot for once.

627
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,248
Go on.

628
00:41:58,553 --> 00:42:00,478
Come on, open it.

629
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,918
Okay, I will.

630
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:08,092
Gosh, Hwang Chi Sook.

631
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,329
What an awesome gift.

632
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:12,628
Your time is starting over.

633
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:16,369
Is what the brat up there would say.

634
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:18,702
Right.

635
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,938
This is how you show your love at our age.

636
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:25,608
Try it on, Young Eun.

637
00:42:38,593 --> 00:42:39,759
Thank you.

638
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:43,628
I'll spend my time well.

639
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:44,958
Okay.

640
00:42:45,164 --> 00:42:48,728
It suits you so well. Don't I have an amazing taste?

641
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,998
I'm proud of you.

642
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:57,168
I'm so proud of you guys.

643
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:06,748
- It's the first snow. - It's snowing.

644
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:11,889
Gosh, it's beautiful.

645
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:18,059
When there was spring in my life, it was radiant...

646
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:19,898
but short.

647
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,329
Then summer came...

648
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,438
and left me with a burning passion.

649
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:36,079
Passion turned into yearning.

650
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:40,918
Yearning turned into longing.

651
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:46,518
Longing turned into aspiration.

652
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:48,759
And aspiration...

653
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,759
gives me a reason to live.

654
00:44:16,694 --> 00:44:18,318
Summer is gone.

655
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,898
The memories of love from the summer of that year...

656
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:36,568
motivate me to live my life.

657
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,722
You stir the egg after you add it to your ramyeon, right?

658
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:21,688
- No, I don't. - Gosh, we really don't click.

659
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:24,088
It looks like we're going to fight a lot.

660
00:45:49,254 --> 00:45:50,809
Do you want more soup?

661
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:52,523
- Gosh, that's hot. - Don't get the soup...

662
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:53,619
on the bathrobe. It's expensive, you know.

663
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:54,624
It's not like...

664
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,652
- you're going to wash it. - Okay.

665
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,719
Eat up. Then we'll wash your clothes so you can leave.

666
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:09,268
My yearning for her is here to stay.

667
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:42,969
I left my love there,

668
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:47,898
but life still goes on.

669
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:07,889
There, I left a love...

670
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:10,858
that never changes.

671
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:50,228
I miss you.

672
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:52,369
One day,

673
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,139
One day, I hope I see you...

674
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,679
standing on the corner of a street just like that day.

675
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:09,119
And when that day comes,

676
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:14,088
I hope neither of us will let go of each other.

677
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:38,123
Hello, Mr. J. I'm calling from Formelain.

678
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,949
I called to ask if you'd be open to doing a photo shoot...

679
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,722
Hello, Mr. Yoon Jae Guk. I'm calling from Sharif Art Museum.

680
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:45,559
We loved the photo you submitted to our magazine...

681
00:48:46,294 --> 00:48:48,429
Hey, J. This is Cedric.

682
00:48:48,664 --> 00:48:50,259
Why aren't you answering your phone?

683
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:53,659
DPHP is launching a new brand. Why don't you...

684
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,443
The person you've called cannot answer the phone.

685
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:05,409
Please leave a message after the beep. Thank you.

686
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:08,409
Hello, Mr. Yoon Jae Guk.

687
00:49:08,754 --> 00:49:10,612
My name is Gwak Hyo Jin.

688
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:12,452
I work for the Korean Fashion Industry Association,

689
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:15,789
and we're in charge of the upcoming third Fashion Week in Busan.

690
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,893
For this year's fashion week, we want to do a project...

691
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:22,489
with a leading fashion brand and rising designer.

692
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:24,858
- Where are you calling from? - Pardon?

693
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,259
Oh, right.

694
00:49:30,403 --> 00:49:31,568
Okay.

695
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,708
Yes.

696
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:40,708
Okay.

697
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,552
I'd normally invite you to stay at my place,

698
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,688
but I can't do that anymore, Cookie.

699
00:49:53,263 --> 00:49:55,389
I'm living with someone now.

700
00:49:55,564 --> 00:49:56,793
You got married?

701
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,862
Gosh, you didn't even send me a wedding invitation.

702
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,563
You're one loyal friend.

703
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,068
We're not married. We're just living together.

704
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,543
Hello, this is Seok Do Hoon, the CEO of Vision PR.

705
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:10,568
Hey, Mr. Seok. I'm calling from Sono.

706
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:12,043
Hey, Ms. Nam.

707
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:13,382
How is our product placement going?

708
00:50:13,383 --> 00:50:16,253
Mr. Kwak Soo Ho will be in charge...

709
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:18,422
of this year's product placements.

710
00:50:18,423 --> 00:50:20,282
Yes, don't worry.

711
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,119
Have a good day.

712
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,029
Ms. Ha quit her job...

713
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:31,228
to start her own brand.

714
00:50:32,664 --> 00:50:34,798
It's been about two years.

715
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:37,228
I see.

716
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,438
That was it?

717
00:50:45,144 --> 00:50:46,279
Yes.

718
00:50:47,184 --> 00:50:48,583
Why didn't you tell him...

719
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:50,809
where Young Eun is and what she's doing right now?

720
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:53,279
They decided to end it.

721
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:56,889
It's up to them to decide whether to get back together or not.

722
00:50:57,024 --> 00:51:00,663
Meanwhile, let's just focus on what we need to do.

723
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:03,259
Gosh, the day just started.

724
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:05,458
Dad

725
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:10,199
It's my dad.

726
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,708
- Gosh. - I want both of you in my office.

727
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,265
Get married first. Then you can live together.

728
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:24,638
We want to try living together first.

729
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,334
If it works out, we'll have a magnificent wedding.

730
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:29,205
Are you also on the same page?

731
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:35,519
Marriage is a process of 2 different people becoming 1.

732
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,484
They should be given time to overcome their differences.

733
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:41,555
What are other people going to think?

734
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,354
Who cares what other people think?

735
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:46,589
Marriage is between a man and woman.

736
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,354
I don't think anyone has the right to interfere.

737
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,294
I can feel you breathing from your nose.

738
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:27,194
Get off me.

739
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:38,004
I could've just called someone to fix it.

740
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,578
Why waste money on something like this?

741
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:42,475
I don't even live that far away.

742
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:46,084
It takes less than ten minutes to get here by foot from my studio.

743
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:49,615
Are you really not going to move?

744
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:51,288
You had to live in the dark for two whole days...

745
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:52,828
because you couldn't fix this.

746
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:54,694
I can't just leave you here and move somewhere far away.

747
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,754
You hate the dark.

748
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:02,095
Are you leaving?

749
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,834
Yes, I should head back to my place.

750
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,234
That was all I wanted from you.

751
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,075
I never asked for anything grand. That was all you had to do.

752
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:17,615
I just wanted you...

753
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,044
to be concerned about me every now and then.

754
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:24,854
I wanted you to care about me.

755
00:53:27,929 --> 00:53:30,395
Call me whenever a light bulb burns out.

756
00:53:30,429 --> 00:53:32,029
You don't even sleep that much now that you're old.

757
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,995
You can't just stay awake until the sun comes up.

758
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:36,095
Did you eat dinner?

759
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,439
I cooked something last night.

760
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,968
It'll last me until tomorrow.

761
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:41,134
Wait here.

762
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,185
I ended up making a bit too many side dishes.

763
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:56,515
If I keep them here, they'll end up in the trash.

764
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:02,555
Take them with you, Mr. Neighbour.

765
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,995
You can't let food go to waste.

766
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,334
I won't have to worry about making side dishes for a few days.

767
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:12,904
Thank you.

768
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:27,984
A year, or two years from today...

769
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,484
If I ever get to walk a path like this...

770
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,754
on this day, I will think of you.

771
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,194
And us, today.

772
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,935
I'm texting you from Busan. Did you arrive safely?

773
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:50,234
I'll see you tomorrow in Busan.

774
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,258
This is the third K-fashion week being held in Busan.

775
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,484
Let us begin the magnificent event.

776
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:09,495
So Young.

777
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,328
You got invited to Busan as a designer.

778
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:12,694
Are you excited about that?

779
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,365
- Yes, I am. - Congratulations.

780
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,404
Congratulations to you too.

781
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,075
This is nice. What should we eat?

782
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:32,245
- I was going to ask you that too. - Really?

783
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,814
- Should we eat sashimi? - You read my mind.

784
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,995
Dad.

785
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,694
Hurry.

786
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,138
I need to show Mom my award certificate.

787
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,908
We need to bring coffee.

788
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:53,808
- Your mom loves it. - Let's hurry.

789
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,678
Hurry up. Come on.

790
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:57,109
- Just give me a minute. - Hurry.

791
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,075
- I'm almost done. - Hurry.

792
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,424
When you come to me,

793
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,095
I hope the wind blows.

794
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,104
- Mom! - So that I can hear you coming...

795
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,535
and be the first one to greet you.

796
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,205
Mom, I won an award certificate.

797
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:35,915
Do you see this?

798
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,089
Ji Min, let her have some coffee first.

799
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,090
Oh, right.

800
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:42,319
You wanted to find a four-leaf clover for her.

801
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,455
You're right. Mom, I'll go find one for you right now.

802
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,299
Meanwhile, read this.

803
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,899
Award Certificate

804
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,029
Honey, Ji Min is really good at drawing.

805
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,265
Here you go.

806
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,538
- Dad. - Let's go.

807
00:56:59,539 --> 00:57:01,064
Let's go together.

808
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,375
Come on. Help me find a four-leaf clover.

809
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,145
- It's a four-leaf clover. - That's not a four-leaf clover.

810
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:10,075
How about this one?

811
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,078
Oh, I like it.

812
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,004
Here. No, never.

813
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:14,845
I'll have a churro.

814
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,214
Enjoy.

815
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,214
When we meet,

816
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,154
I hope the wind blows.

817
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,354
So that my yearning can reach you...

818
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:42,095
and show you the way.

819
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,095
Young Eun.

820
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,064
Jae Guk.

821
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,274
Young Eun.

822
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,685
Say Hello. He's Yoon Jae Guk, a photographer.

823
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:39,285
Hello.

824
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,084
Hello.

825
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,895
I'm Kim Soo Min, the person in charge of this year's fashion week.

826
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,365
You're going to the party later, right?

827
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:49,595
How about we take my car?

828
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,435
Sure.

829
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,234
Honey.

830
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,234
Oh, hey.

831
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,575
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

832
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,424
Have you been well?

833
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:17,794
Yes.

834
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:21,365
I saw your exhibition...

835
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,234
through the photos in the magazine.

836
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,734
You really did a great job.

837
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,415
How are you doing?

838
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:44,555
Ms. Ha... I mean...

839
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:46,455
President Ha.

840
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,725
What's the name of our brand?

841
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,754
Would you like me to come up with a name as a director?

842
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,165
- I already have something in mind. - What is it?

843
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:01,365
Hwa

844
01:02:01,909 --> 01:02:03,334
Hwa?

845
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,305
What does it mean?

846
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,475
Reciprocation.

847
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,845
The promises we made...

848
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:12,988
and your love showed me the way.

849
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:14,448
If you're a rookie designer who got invited to the show,

850
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:15,888
come this way.

851
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:17,115
- Okay. - Okay.

852
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,955
Hwa.

853
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,924
And walking that path...

854
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,294
is my way of reciprocating...

855
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:26,294
to you.

856
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,424
How are you doing?

857
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:42,814
And even now,

858
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,245
we're still in the process...

859
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,285
of breaking up with each other.

860
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,205
Now, We Are Breaking Up

861
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:26,745
Thank you for watching Now, We Are Breaking Up.

862
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,920
Now, We Are Breaking Up
