1
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:26,719
What we'll do in the future...

2
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,339
If we'll keep meeting or not...

3
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:35,186
That's yours to decide

4
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,162
But...

5
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:40,712
...answer me this.

6
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,272
Did you...

7
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:47,442
missed me?

8
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:15,009
There are things we miss as we move on.

9
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:23,589
Things we didn't know then,

10
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,759
but that we know now.

11
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:39,169
I just want to be free and independent.

12
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:42,173
What are you, dandelion fluff that travels all over the world?

13
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:43,340
Carpe Diem.

14
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm just trying to live in the moment.

15
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:48,850
It was just a one-night stand.

16
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,889
It can happen, you know.

17
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,959
It's lame to dwell on it.

18
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:09,199
And we slid by each other...

19
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:11,900
without being able to meet...

20
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:14,410
so many times.

21
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,513
- Can you... - What?

22
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,280
give this to someone on my behalf?

23
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,650
The name and school are written right there.

24
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,079
- Do me a favor. - Oh, okay.

25
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:28,949
Don't be late. Make sure you give it to her.

26
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,220
It's really important to that student. Okay?

27
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:34,130
Whose photo is that?

28
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,259
It's an unknown photographer's work.

29
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,633
The exposure is dreadful, and the composition is poor.

30
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:39,904
It's definitely an amateur.

31
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:41,370
The light is a haze.

32
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,109
You knew I wouldn't be able to leave,

33
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:51,380
didn't you?

34
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,019
Right now,

35
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:00,620
I'm afraid of you.

36
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,889
I'm not confident about my decisions.

37
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:09,400
Let's not try to do anything.

38
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,539
Do you have a job for me?

39
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:21,109
I think I'll be staying here for quite a while this time.

40
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:32,049
Did you meet someone?

41
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:35,320
Cookie, how did you fall for a lady who's so hard to get?

42
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,190
I'm waiting for her right now.

43
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,889
When she makes up her mind,

44
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:41,729
you can meet her then.

45
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,170
Let her decide...

46
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:52,940
whether to end it or not.

47
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,870
If you love her.

48
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:57,279
By any chance,

49
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:58,810
is it Ha Young Eun?

50
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:05,279
- Jae Guk. - I know what you're going to say.

51
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:07,290
But Soo Wan...

52
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,490
is no longer here.

53
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:13,490
If I cannot turn back yesterday,

54
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:17,230
there is only one thing I can do.

55
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,570
To live today.

56
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:21,561
Answer me this.

57
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:26,040
Did you...

58
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,380
miss me?

59
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,149
I...

60
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,490
missed you.

61
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,734
I don't remember anything.

62
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,890
Starting from zero is my style. by Karl Lagerfeld

63
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,741
Now, We Are Breaking Up

64
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,940
Episode 5

65
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:12,315
Should we go with the flow or find something new?

66
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,580
I'm always torn when we prepare for a new season.

67
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,354
Photos taken wearing clothes...

68
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,924
and makeup that were trending become an embarrassment later.

69
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:21,161
Will you try something new?

70
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,664
If we follow everyone else, we'll be late to the party.

71
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:27,330
Let's stay true to Sono and stick to the classic basics.

72
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:31,101
Na Ri, follow up on the fabrics we ordered.

73
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:34,471
Sun Ju, list up what fabrics we have left from last season.

74
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:37,474
So Young, I asked the Material Team to order some raw materials.

75
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,315
See how much we can get.

76
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:40,611
- Okay. - Okay.

77
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,611
Claire Marie's going to use all that.

78
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:48,121
It's a rushed brand.

79
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:51,851
The season's almost on us and there's no time to call Italy...

80
00:05:51,855 --> 00:05:53,994
to place orders then ship it to South America to be sewed.

81
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,731
Sono placed the orders six months ago.

82
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,094
We talked to the Material Team,

83
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:01,161
and you approved of it yourself.

84
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,601
Then take it up with Director Hwang.

85
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:14,280
So? What do you need?

86
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,181
Span linen and summer tweed fabrics.

87
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:20,181
We need it for the jackets and skirts.

88
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,221
That's for Claire Marie.

89
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:25,991
What else?

90
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:29,190
Then we'll use the seersucker with gingham check pattern.

91
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:31,431
That came out of our budget,

92
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:33,601
and it's agreed that we'd use that fabric.

93
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:36,530
It's practically impossible to find another supplier...

94
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,001
and meet the deadline.

95
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:40,570
Too bad. That's for Claire Marie too.

96
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,674
- Director Hwang. - Right.

97
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,275
The Paju factory that worked with Sono.

98
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:47,911
From this season onward, they'll work with Claire Marie.

99
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:51,715
- Chi Sook. - Don't get too serious.

100
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,221
It's just one factory.

101
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:54,755
Who'd be more scared?

102
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,751
You or me who has to launch a new brand?

103
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:00,190
Didn't you decide to stay because you knew you could survive?

104
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,664
I've worked with the manager there for ten years...

105
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:03,960
since their assistant days.

106
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,460
We helped each other get this far.

107
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,061
It's The One, not you.

108
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:13,005
You may think you put up with me this far,

109
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:14,705
but I put up with a lot from you too.

110
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,145
Fabrics, raw materials, factories.

111
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,575
Why do you think it was all you?

112
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:20,681
It was possible because I had your back.

113
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,085
And?

114
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,751
I'm done looking after you now.

115
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:27,354
So without my help, with your own capabilities,

116
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:28,721
on your own,

117
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,121
try and beat me.

118
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:34,491
Can I do that?

119
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,291
Can I really beat you?

120
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:46,840
Director Hwang.

121
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,145
The Vision PR people are here.

122
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,411
Oh, right.

123
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,811
- Hello. - Mr. Seok.

124
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,054
Welcome, J.

125
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,255
We are very, utterly honored and pleased...

126
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:05,290
that you allowed The One to work with you.

127
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:08,424
Cookie, you finally got some work.

128
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:09,425
One week ago

129
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:12,595
It's your first job since you registered...

130
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,235
as Vision PR's artist.

131
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,331
Who is it with?

132
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,875
- The One. But... - I'll do it.

133
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:21,871
But it's Director Hwang who wants you, not Ms. Ha.

134
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:26,280
It doesn't matter. I decided to stay in Seoul.

135
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,680
I must earn a living.

136
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:33,821
It's been a while.

137
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:39,520
Mr. J agreed to collaborate with us.

138
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:42,961
I'll let you get to it.

139
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,481
Mom

140
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:10,420
Hi, Mom.

141
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:13,890
Your dad retires in two days, so I'm getting a perm.

142
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:16,831
I can't go after him looking like this.

143
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:18,995
Mom, I'm at work right now.

144
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:21,030
He's so gullible and I'm worried!

145
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:26,441
He just left saying he has to take care of something.

146
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,900
I have a bad feeling about it.

147
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:34,680
He's been saying he'll make me live in luxury once he retires.

148
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,581
I'm worried he might invest and lose his entire severance pay.

149
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,184
He wouldn't do that again.

150
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:44,890
That's why I need you to go and see him.

151
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:47,290
See who he's with and what he's up to.

152
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,260
I'm not able to do that right now.

153
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:50,934
I'm busy. I have to go.

154
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,334
You're my only child!

155
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:55,735
He won't pick up so I had to call you!

156
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:57,574
I don't have any other choice!

157
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,201
I'll give him a call.

158
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,201
Bye.

159
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:05,410
Calling, Dad

160
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,910
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

161
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,550
Young Eun, why are you sighing? It breaks my heart.

162
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,390
Good morning.

163
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:20,060
You just got to work?

164
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,595
Come on. I'm the president's son.

165
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:25,265
If I were to come to work on time every day,

166
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,831
I would look too well-taught.

167
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,635
I need to slack off a bit...

168
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:31,304
so that those who work hard will have something to gossip about.

169
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,701
I'm trying to be the public enemy.

170
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,375
Ask the Production Team for a list of our factories.

171
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,871
I just came in and I'm tired already.

172
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:40,714
Can't I finish my coffee first?

173
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:43,951
Shall I ask the president to transfer you to a quieter team?

174
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,951
What floor is the Production Team on?

175
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:48,680
The sixth floor. You have 30 minutes.

176
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:50,194
We have to go out to hire factories.

177
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:51,290
Got it.

178
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:54,191
- Wrong direction. - Got it.

179
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,430
Production Line for 2021

180
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,201
The list of our factories, right?

181
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,800
Yes, and the factories we can rely on.

182
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,900
I'll leave out the places we marked as delinquents.

183
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,944
They stole our labels and missed deadlines.

184
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,341
They're a headache.

185
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,044
Remember that.

186
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,981
Oh, I see.

187
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:23,390
- How long will it take? - How long will it take?

188
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:25,191
Seven minutes?

189
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:27,861
No, five minutes.

190
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,691
No, wait.

191
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,260
Seven minutes.

192
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:35,136
There are a lot.

193
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:36,971
Delete

194
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:39,571
Give me seven minutes.

195
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:44,910
Did you come alone?

196
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,410
Yes.

197
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:50,150
Why? Is it a serious issue?

198
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:55,184
Your blood test showed elevated levels of CA 19-9...

199
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,821
which is a tumor marker.

200
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,290
That's why I asked you get a CT scan and biopsy.

201
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,020
The results show...

202
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,260
you have pancreatic cancer.

203
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,530
Adenocarcinoma, a kind of pancreatic cancer...

204
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,831
is a cancer of the gland.

205
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm sorry to say that...

206
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:17,270
pancreatic cancer is very hard to diagnose in the early stages.

207
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:21,581
Based on the test results, I must say it looks like...

208
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:24,650
the cancer has spread to multiple organs.

209
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,351
Let's go.

210
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,050
- Bye. - Bye.

211
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:33,991
Sorry.

212
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,121
Hi.

213
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,101
- You got back from a meeting? - Yes.

214
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,900
There's something on your tie.

215
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,540
I'll have it dry-cleaned for you.

216
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,341
Thanks.

217
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:50,910
Min Kyung.

218
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:54,810
I left some papers for you to go through in the second drawer.

219
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:56,581
Okay.

220
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,255
- Ms. Seo. - Yes?

221
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,461
Finish the report by today.

222
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:08,790
Okay.

223
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,920
My honey

224
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,861
Mi Sook

225
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,605
- Hello? - I'm so sorry.

226
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:50,275
Mr. Kwak just went into a meeting.

227
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,831
He must've left his phone behind.

228
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,601
Oh, I see.

229
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:57,140
Is it urgent?

230
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:02,611
No, it's not. I wanted to ask if he'll be late tonight.

231
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:05,050
I'll ask him to call you as soon as the meeting is over.

232
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,020
Okay. Thank you.

233
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,890
- The bills are paid. - Great.

234
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:19,334
From midnight the night before, don't eat, drink, or even chew gum.

235
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:22,804
Even if you make an appointment, you might have to wait for a while.

236
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,731
I hope you understand.

237
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:26,701
So...

238
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,020
Hello, sir.

239
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,060
- How are things going? - We're doing our best.

240
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,635
Even if we're launching a new brand,

241
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,831
Sono is still the main one that represents us.

242
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:57,170
- Make sure it sells. - I will.

243
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:59,170
Who's that in there?

244
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:00,900
How about a magazine spread?

245
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:04,571
Using nature as a backdrop, the rough textures...

246
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,380
- should stand out. - Rough? What a rough man.

247
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,910
He's the photographer collaborating with Claire Marie.

248
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:14,855
A photographer?

249
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:18,155
He's the man you suggested she meet in Busan.

250
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:19,251
Busan?

251
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:22,591
Jae Guk?

252
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,461
Yes.

253
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:32,530
Now only I get to see you sitting side by side.

254
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:35,670
Whenever I had a drink with your father,

255
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:38,910
we'd talk about becoming in-laws when our kids were old enough.

256
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:42,140
That would be my older brother, not me.

257
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,680
- What? - Oh, you have an older brother?

258
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,621
What a loss.

259
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:49,725
If not for that accident, he'd have become...

260
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:51,221
a great doctor like his father.

261
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:53,794
When you were in middle school,

262
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:57,034
you entered the Math Olympiad and won first place.

263
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,691
Your father bragged so much.

264
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:02,560
- That was also my older brother. - What?

265
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,430
I was in Paris the whole time.

266
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:09,005
That's where I studied,

267
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:11,910
and I visited Seoul only a few times during the holidays.

268
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,111
Yes, well, it was a long time ago.

269
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,880
Is your mother well? I haven't seen her in a while.

270
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,390
Yes. She's fine.

271
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,790
Good.

272
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,161
Your father's dead,

273
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:37,901
your mother isn't.

274
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:39,701
What else?

275
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,971
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

276
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:48,981
Do you want more wine?

277
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:51,881
Yes, sounds good.

278
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:54,951
Here.

279
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,350
Come to think of it,

280
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:02,520
Soo Wan never spoke of his brother.

281
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:09,731
Why were you in Paris all alone?

282
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:18,510
Ms. Ha, any update on our fabrics?

283
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:21,981
- Na Ri. - Yes?

284
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:25,385
Gabardine and linen tweed both look promising,

285
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:27,981
but the gabardine is a darker color.

286
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,194
Let's go with the linen tweed.

287
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:33,151
We can use patches to give it a different look.

288
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:36,260
- Okay. - Bye.

289
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:42,760
I came to see the swatch colors.

290
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,401
I see.

291
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:34,381
My brother and I have different mothers.

292
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,820
But I was never discriminated...

293
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,191
or resented.

294
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:43,590
My current mother's a good person.

295
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:54,471
You looked curious earlier.

296
00:18:58,515 --> 00:18:59,641
Weren't you curious?

297
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:01,540
Well...

298
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,580
Just a bit.

299
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:10,850
You cared, at least, then.

300
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,290
Me, I mean.

301
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,201
Do you get off late today?

302
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:27,441
- Why? - Let's have dinner.

303
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:32,414
Instead of a place on social media, take me to a local hot spot.

304
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:36,381
It would be even nicer if you'd show me around.

305
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,580
She has a prior engagement with me.

306
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:43,350
Young Eun, the factory list.

307
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,254
I told you to wait just for seven minutes.

308
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:46,451
Was that too long for you?

309
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,895
We'll leave right away. Be ready in three minutes.

310
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:53,231
It's just us two? Perfect.

311
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:58,770
I heard you work with the other team.

312
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,045
Stick to that other team.

313
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,241
Don't come after my boss.

314
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,770
Young Eun. Wait up.

315
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,921
Saebit Apparel

316
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,724
Once it's approved,

317
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:21,221
can you finish in 15 days?

318
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:22,991
We're not machines.

319
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,530
We need a month at least.

320
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,830
We'll miss the deadline, then.

321
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:33,805
We're making this for someone else.

322
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm letting just you take a look.

323
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:39,211
- Sir. - What is it?

324
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,340
- Excuse me. - Sure.

325
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:45,411
If he shows us the other clients', he'll show them ours too.

326
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:49,754
Production Line

327
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:52,120
Oh, my goodness. Silly me.

328
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,191
I can't put a whole design in my brain.

329
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,300
- Where's the next factory? - Dongdaemun.

330
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,845
The option belt goes in a pouch size 25...

331
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,370
and needs to be delivered with the hangers.

332
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,711
We have extra orders to handle.

333
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:16,244
Are they long-term or short-term workers?

334
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,350
We don't work with short-term workers who are too unpredictable.

335
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,285
Our staff are all long-term and paid monthly.

336
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:22,855
- Really? - We can deliver partially too.

337
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,921
We make at least 80 a day.

338
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:37,570
What is it?

339
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:39,300
Nothing.

340
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:49,385
How can they tell a designer to hire factories?

341
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:51,254
Or we have to work with whatever place we get.

342
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:53,050
That will bring our quality down.

343
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,350
Ms. Choi's factory.

344
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:58,951
We can't go there, right?

345
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:01,320
I'd rather work with other factories.

346
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:04,360
It would be crazy if we went to a place that stole our design.

347
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,494
Claire Marie doesn't even have a team in place,

348
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:07,901
and they already have Mr. J.

349
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:13,070
He's a big deal, so I'm getting worried.

350
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:16,501
Are there still openings?

351
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,171
It looks like it.

352
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,820
Why did you want to meet me?

353
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:37,491
I thought it'd be nice for you to make good memories in Seoul.

354
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:39,461
There's a great exhibition in town.

355
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:43,870
You should come with me. I'm sure it'll inspire you.

356
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:48,201
- Director Hwang. - Why don't we...

357
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:51,211
start over again?

358
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:56,381
I made a mistake by not showing up that day.

359
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:59,411
But I can't turn back time.

360
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:02,285
You see, I won't let the past bother me.

361
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,751
What matters is the future.

362
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:06,494
I don't want to live my life the way my parents want me to.

363
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:09,421
I used to feel the same way. That's why I didn't show up.

364
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:13,530
But it turns out, our parents only want the best for us.

365
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,431
I mean, look at me. I regret not having listened to my dad.

366
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,671
Let's just be friends.

367
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,540
I have friends. What I need is a man.

368
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:32,951
I already have feelings for another woman.

369
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,260
What's going on?

370
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:50,974
You said it was urgent,

371
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,830
so I rushed over here on my way back to the office.

372
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:55,241
Have you secured a factor yet? No?

373
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:58,414
There's one factory that seems okay,

374
00:23:58,415 --> 00:23:59,810
but I don't think it'll work out.

375
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:03,684
But why are you buying so many clothes?

376
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,484
I realized that I never got clothes for Ji Min at a department store...

377
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:08,684
unless they were on sale.

378
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,595
They're too big for her.

379
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:14,491
You have no idea how fast kids grow. It's fine.

380
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:19,360
What's gotten into you? You're unbelievably frugal.

381
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:23,335
If you're currently working,

382
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,701
you should quit and get ready to get hospitalized.

383
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:31,310
I just suddenly got annoyed and upset.

384
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,815
I don't get why I was always so hesitant...

385
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:36,510
to buy clothes for my kid at a department store.

386
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:41,221
Is there something going on?

387
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:43,850
What's the matter?

388
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:47,820
Did your husband cheat on you?

389
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:51,434
Gosh, he doesn't have the guts to do that.

390
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:52,830
He's too much of a coward.

391
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:55,701
Do your in-laws want to go on another trip abroad?

392
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:59,171
No, it's not that.

393
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,105
Let's wait until Ji Min is older.

394
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:03,800
Let's wait until I withdraw my savings next month.

395
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,070
Let's wait until we move to a bigger house.

396
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:08,481
I kept telling myself that.

397
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:10,441
Look where that got me.

398
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:13,481
My daughter doesn't even have a decent jacket,

399
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,580
and I'm a mess too.

400
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:17,891
Everything seemed pointless, and it made me angry.

401
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,360
You were only trying to save money.

402
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:27,431
Maybe this is depression caused by menopause.

403
00:25:29,806 --> 00:25:32,731
From now on, I'm going to live however I want to.

404
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:36,870
So no matter what I do, just try to bear with it.

405
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:43,481
I think I'll buy this one for Ji Min.

406
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:47,451
If you want to do something, then do it.

407
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,721
You listen to me.

408
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:53,320
You should do the same.

409
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:55,264
Who cares if he's Soo Wan's little brother?

410
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:56,721
If you like him, then that's all that matters.

411
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:58,931
It's your life.

412
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:04,600
Excuse me.

413
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:08,174
I'd like to buy all of these.

414
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,270
Okay.

415
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:17,751
Nice.

416
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:20,881
You never got new bedding after you guys got married.

417
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:25,251
You're right. Maybe I should buy the entire set.

418
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,494
Don't you think this one's better? It's like for newlyweds.

419
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:30,595
We're not newlyweds. Don't be gross.

420
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:32,060
Who knows? You might get pregnant with a second kid.

421
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,600
Do you need anything? You should take a look too.

422
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,504
I don't need this. I live alone.

423
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:38,701
This is pretty.

424
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:20,441
Thank you.

425
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:24,181
It's due tomorrow, right?

426
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,510
They're going to use it as a banner on their webpage.

427
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:28,754
By the way, the client is really fussy.

428
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:30,721
So make sure you have plenty of A-cuts ready.

429
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:32,151
What's the next schedule?

430
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:36,560
A photoshoot for a kitchen brochure. But you don't do that kind of stuff.

431
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,461
- I'll do it. - Okay.

432
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:42,764
Listen. You'll be taking photos of frying pans.

433
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:44,370
I told you I wouldn't be picky.

434
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:46,035
I need money to settle down.

435
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:48,274
Then do things that will make you a lot of money.

436
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,201
You're getting tons of offers for photo book shoots.

437
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:51,810
That's not fun.

438
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:54,045
Mother

439
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,610
Do Hoon, I'm getting a call. Text me when you have a job for me.

440
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,850
- Hey, Mom. - Are you busy?

441
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:04,921
I thought you might be with your girlfriend.

442
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,961
Are things getting serious between you two?

443
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:11,860
Why are you laughing?

444
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:15,431
It's weird that you're asking me these questions

445
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:17,830
It also feels new.

446
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:21,701
It's natural to be curious about the girl that my son likes.

447
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:24,070
I'm trying hard hoping things will get serious.

448
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:27,075
I can't wait to meet her. I wish you good luck.

449
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:29,984
Hey! Stop right there! Stop!

450
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:31,251
Stop right there, you punk!

451
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:32,850
Stop there!

452
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,421
Okay, you should get back to work.

453
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,090
Ms. Min?

454
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,661
Have you been doing well?

455
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,835
Yes, I'm doing great.

456
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:50,234
Is everything good with you too?

457
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:52,600
If I knew you attended classes at our culture center,

458
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:54,671
I would've treated you to a meal a long time ago.

459
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,174
I know how busy you are, so you don't need to bother.

460
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:58,375
It's fine.

461
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:00,211
Let's meet again with Jae Guk.

462
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:03,610
Yoo Jung.

463
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:07,550
I think Jae Guk has a crush on someone.

464
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:14,790
Have you met her?

465
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:18,065
No. Apparently, she doesn't feel the same way yet.

466
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,060
Jae Guk is the only one who's head over heels right now.

467
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:23,431
It's the first time he's ever talked to me about a girl.

468
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:30,204
Let's take a video. You're filming a video, right?

469
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:31,411
Yes, of course.

470
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:32,616
Yes. Can you turn around?

471
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,115
- Let's shoot the background. - This is so much prettier.

472
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:36,444
Hello! Say hi!

473
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:38,355
Try pressing this.

474
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,711
I will kiss you before I press the button.

475
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:44,694
I want to concentrate.

476
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,491
I'm going to concentrate on this. Stay still.

477
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,020
What are you doing? Get away.

478
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,671
I've never seen him so happy.

479
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:02,241
I wonder what she's like.

480
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,981
This time, I'm going to approve of her no matter what.

481
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:12,110
No matter what kind of woman she turns out to be?

482
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:14,080
Jae Guk likes her.

483
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:17,020
That's what's important. Nothing else matters to me.

484
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:20,550
I'm not going to hurt him because of that again.

485
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,421
I want Jae Guk to be happy.

486
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:26,790
I want to live my life seeing him happy.

487
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:51,850
Ms. Ha.

488
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:54,421
Which button do you think is better?

489
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:57,224
I like the one that doesn't shine.

490
00:30:57,225 --> 00:30:58,661
- This one? Okay. - Yes.

491
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:02,231
How long is this going to take?

492
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:04,901
Don't you want to work in a more promising team?

493
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:08,671
You're not the only junior who wants to work at La Mon.

494
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,110
I can't wait too long.

495
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,941
Bring me Ms. Ha's plans by tonight.

496
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:36,961
Interesting.

497
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:39,931
I was minding my own business,

498
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:42,540
and he suddenly beat me up for no reason.

499
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:44,615
I didn't beat you up.

500
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:47,375
You fell and rolled down the street while running away, you fraud.

501
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:49,785
I can't believe this. Do you even know me?

502
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:52,181
You tried to run away after stealing my money.

503
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:53,914
I've never seen you in my life.

504
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:55,855
You beat me up for no reason,

505
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:57,790
and now you're telling me that I'm a fraud?

506
00:31:57,896 --> 00:31:59,295
I can't believe this.

507
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:00,951
- Did you check? - I found nothing.

508
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:02,191
- Nothing? - That's right.

509
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:06,131
There are no CCTVs nearby, so this is going to take a while.

510
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:08,734
You two will have to come with us to the police station.

511
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:10,330
Sure. Let's go.

512
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:13,830
I don't care that you're an elder. I swear I won't let this slide.

513
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:16,274
I'll have you get locked up in prison for assault.

514
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:19,310
- I'm not going to settle. - Goodness.

515
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:20,870
Excuse me.

516
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,411
- Can I help you? - I got something on camera.

517
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,320
I have it in high-resolution. Nice and clear.

518
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:30,151
Stop right there!

519
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:51,610
Okay, I got it.

520
00:32:57,046 --> 00:32:58,850
Everyone, bring me your sketches.

521
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,651
Not bad. It looks nice.

522
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,790
Ms. Nam, you never disappoint. It's great.

523
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:10,260
Don't you think it's too simple?

524
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:12,590
How about you use printed inner fabric?

525
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,001
Can you check mine too?

526
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:23,600
I wanted to get picked, so I did everything I wanted to do.

527
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,411
How did you manage to hold it in?

528
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:26,941
I don't know.

529
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,540
So Young, what about you?

530
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:31,981
Mine's not ready yet.

531
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:34,310
Why? Are you stuck?

532
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:36,381
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:40,091
Then why don't you use this for reference?

534
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,095
I drew these sketches...

535
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,990
for my graduation work back when I was your age.

536
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,905
Gosh, that's great.

537
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,700
You did all that at So Young's age?

538
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:56,774
No wonder you got a job so quickly.

539
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:57,870
Exactly.

540
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,611
You feel impatient, don't you?

541
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:03,240
Pardon?

542
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:06,551
You want to do well, and you don't want to miss out on opportunities.

543
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:10,850
But there's no need to feel impatient, So Young.

544
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,220
So what if you're a little slow? So what if you need improvement?

545
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:17,990
Just focus on making beautiful and good-quality clothes.

546
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,231
Then opportunities will naturally come to you.

547
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,734
You have a long career ahead of you.

548
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,805
You don't need to feel anxious about missing out.

549
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:25,935
Don't feel anxious.

550
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:28,001
I have tons of work for you.

551
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,540
Let me know if she asks you to do anything absurd.

552
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:37,140
A good mentor will only go after your talent,

553
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:39,350
not ask you to do what's wrong.

554
00:34:43,726 --> 00:34:46,151
Make everything is revised by tomorrow morning.

555
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:47,694
Keep up the good work, everyone.

556
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:48,990
- Okay. - Okay.

557
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:53,194
You're so naive, Young Eun.

558
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:55,060
That's not going to keep So Young from leaving you.

559
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:00,870
You saw and heard nothing, okay?

560
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:02,674
If you're too considerate, people think they've earned it.

561
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:03,845
If you're too nice, they take it for granted.

562
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,575
If you let them lie to you, they lie again.

563
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:06,671
That's how humans work.

564
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:08,615
Fine. If you're late again,

565
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:10,044
I'll make sure it's reflected on your performance record.

566
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:11,180
Gosh.

567
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,611
You shouldn't be so harsh to an informant.

568
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:19,495
What is it this time?

569
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:21,660
I told you to check on your father.

570
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,921
He's at the police station right now.

571
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:28,961
That's right. Okay, sir.

572
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:36,841
Dad.

573
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,450
What...

574
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:03,430
It's a fraud and assault case.

575
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:06,830
Your father bought a tour package for a trip around Europe...

576
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,905
and wired the money to a travel agency,

577
00:36:08,906 --> 00:36:10,270
but it turned out to be a paper company.

578
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:14,075
I wanted to travel around Europe...

579
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:17,011
with your mother after my retirement.

580
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:20,111
They gave me a 50 percent discount on additional services...

581
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:22,151
and promised a big discount.

582
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:24,995
I didn't even get to touch any of that money.

583
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:27,194
My job was to call people and tell them about the package.

584
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:29,220
I was just a part-timer.

585
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:33,694
But what's he doing here?

586
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,861
Oh, he's a witness.

587
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:39,671
If it weren't for him, I would've been in big trouble.

588
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:49,640
You shouldn't have gotten yourself involved.

589
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,080
Because I did, I was able to run into you again.

590
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:54,751
He could've broken your camera.

591
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:56,620
Are you concerned about me?

592
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:58,620
No, I'm not concerned.

593
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:01,961
I see. I guess you cared about me again, right?

594
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,830
Gosh, okay. I get it.

595
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:13,531
It's your mother.

596
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:16,071
It's not a big deal.

597
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,941
Stop yelling at me.

598
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:22,381
I heard he's a vice-principal.

599
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:24,854
- He's getting retired soon. - Everything's fine.

600
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:26,314
You take after your father.

601
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:28,580
Okay, let's talk about it at home.

602
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:31,455
Your mother is furious.

603
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:32,790
Safety leads to happiness.

604
00:37:32,895 --> 00:37:34,624
They told me to file a separate report for fraud,

605
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,794
so I did.

606
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,225
It's going to take 2 to 3 months...

607
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:39,495
for the police to finish investigating their bank account.

608
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:41,405
They're also going to reinvestigate the assault case,

609
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,761
so just keep that in mind.

610
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:46,575
Your parents raised you well.

611
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:49,374
People rarely help others these days.

612
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,475
I'd like to treat you to a meal. What do you like?

613
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,644
He's a busy man.

614
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:55,140
It's okay. I'm not busy.

615
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:58,981
I only just came back to Korea, so any kind of Korean food will do.

616
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:02,220
I need to eat anyway.

617
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,390
It's your mom again.

618
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:08,825
You should go home for today.

619
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:10,595
Still, I owe him one.

620
00:38:10,596 --> 00:38:12,394
I can't just leave.

621
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,761
I'll treat him to a meal instead.

622
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:16,830
Aren't you busy?

623
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:19,370
Just go home. Mom's going to be worried.

624
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:20,531
Okay, fine.

625
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:22,841
I'll repay your kindness next time.

626
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:24,501
Thank you for today.

627
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,155
By the way, do you guys know each other?

628
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,281
- No. - Yes.

629
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:37,751
- Hey. - He asked.

630
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,850
The secretary's office scheduled this.

631
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:09,551
So they're bound to check whether or not I came.

632
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,321
I'm glad you came.

633
00:39:12,795 --> 00:39:16,825
As someone who also oversees a business of art,

634
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:18,635
I recharge myself by going to exhibitions...

635
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:21,435
and listening to music every now and then.

636
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:23,761
And today just happened to be that day.

637
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:26,930
Did I ask you to come amid your busy schedule?

638
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,470
If I did, I apologize.

639
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:33,515
I'm not busy.

640
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:36,781
I had nothing planned for the day.

641
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,921
Where are you? There are tons of documents to be signed.

642
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:46,055
Are you even coming back?

643
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:47,095
Kwak Soo Ho

644
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:48,861
Power Off

645
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:00,501
Director Hwang.

646
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:08,841
You see,

647
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:12,011
I don't ask for a lot.

648
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,881
I just want to meet a guy as if we were destined to meet...

649
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:17,151
and live life as we love each other passionately.

650
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:19,890
That's all I need.

651
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:24,890
But am I asking for too much?

652
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:28,761
No, of course not.

653
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,901
It's not too much to ask.

654
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:33,600
Then why is it so hard?

655
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:35,841
Why can't I get that?

656
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:39,711
It's just so hard.

657
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:47,180
Maybe it's because I'm really sad...

658
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:49,651
or because my life is bitter,

659
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,020
but this wine tastes bland.

660
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:54,595
There are times...

661
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:56,961
when things get tough.

662
00:40:56,965 --> 00:40:59,531
Just forget about it.

663
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:03,430
You have feelings for Young Eun as well, don't you?

664
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,805
Gosh, no.

665
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,405
I mean, Ms. Ha?

666
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:11,611
No, I don't.

667
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:13,071
Why not?

668
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,481
Did you decide to back off because of Mr. J?

669
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:18,481
Why do you keep talking to me like I'm your friend?

670
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:21,584
Plus, I never had feelings for her.

671
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:23,751
She's not my type at all.

672
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,524
She's not your type?

673
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:29,060
No, she's really not my type.

674
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:38,870
I got dumped today.

675
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:43,140
I got dumped before anything even started.

676
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:46,144
It's okay. This isn't my first time.

677
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:48,111
I'm not going to give up either.

678
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:51,481
But I'm just so angry.

679
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:54,781
I'm jealous and annoyed.

680
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,321
I'm so angry at Young Eun.

681
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:03,220
No, wait. Why should I be jealous?

682
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,160
It's not like I'm less attractive than her.

683
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:10,464
The more you get to know me, the more charming I become.

684
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,301
Mr. J just doesn't know that.

685
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:15,401
You're right.

686
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:18,611
People need to get to know you to like you more.

687
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,071
You just wait.

688
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:25,511
He'll end up falling for me.

689
00:42:57,386 --> 00:42:58,481
Row 1, Row 2, Row 3

690
00:43:00,116 --> 00:43:01,881
Formulas for tables and cells

691
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,941
Do you really have to...

692
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,075
cut your toenails here, right now?

693
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:28,714
This time, you're learning computer skills?

694
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:32,584
I told you. There's a family I want to marry Young Eun off to.

695
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:35,180
I want to take computer classes with that lady.

696
00:43:36,286 --> 00:43:38,890
She's good at everything, so I'm sure she's good at this too.

697
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:41,591
Are you trying to make up for not going to college?

698
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,825
Why must you learn everything?

699
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:45,394
It's not uncommon to live to 100 these days,

700
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:47,790
so who knows what will happen?

701
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:50,261
I should take every single class offered at the community center.

702
00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:52,874
In case you fall for another scam and blow all our money.

703
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,144
Goodness. I told you that it wasn't a scam!

704
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:57,901
It was just a small squabble. Will you go on about it?

705
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,341
You're retiring very soon.

706
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,785
Unless you want to retire dishonorably,

707
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:06,910
you must always be careful. At all times!

708
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:10,220
Gosh.

709
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:12,751
Darn it.

710
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:15,294
Witness.

711
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:16,821
Witness

712
00:44:19,465 --> 00:44:22,901
This is my number. Feel free to call me if you ever need my help.

713
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:26,975
Ms. Wit

714
00:44:26,976 --> 00:44:28,504
Ms. Wit.

715
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:30,571
Ms. Wit

716
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:10,910
You put her to bed early today.

717
00:45:11,016 --> 00:45:12,111
Yes.

718
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:21,455
Did you give her instant noodles?

719
00:45:21,456 --> 00:45:23,290
It's okay to give it to her once or twice a week.

720
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:34,435
- Separate the recyclables. - I'll do it later.

721
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:36,245
Later? When?

722
00:45:36,246 --> 00:45:38,674
If we don't take them out today, we'll have to wait another week.

723
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:41,575
Hey, it's not like I was out partying all day.

724
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:43,080
Are you the only one who works?

725
00:45:43,145 --> 00:45:45,484
Everyone works and still manages to separate their recyclables.

726
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:46,580
Hey!

727
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:49,055
What about you? What did you do all day?

728
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:50,481
Oh, you were out shopping?

729
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:53,555
Nice life. Is that why there's no food at home?

730
00:45:53,556 --> 00:45:55,490
Instant noodles were the only thing I could find.

731
00:46:01,436 --> 00:46:02,564
You could've cooked something.

732
00:46:02,565 --> 00:46:04,100
And you need to clean up after yourself.

733
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:05,930
Will you keep relying on me to do everything?

734
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:08,100
Will she always eat instant noodles if I'm not around?

735
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:12,671
This was the first time I gave her instant noodles.

736
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:17,281
Client

737
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:23,421
Gosh, seriously.

738
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:33,961
No.

739
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:36,560
I was going through some reports for my meeting tomorrow.

740
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:38,700
I just stepped out to get some fresh air.

741
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:42,001
I have a lot on my mind these days.

742
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:45,001
What a beautiful night.

743
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:50,481
Yes.

744
00:46:51,315 --> 00:46:53,151
The sky is clear, with no fine dust at all.

745
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:54,711
By the way,

746
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:57,881
how did you know that I had been eyeing this?

747
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,091
Of course, I knew.

748
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:05,361
That's right, naturally.

749
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:08,160
Shall I pick you up tomorrow morning?

750
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,031
I see.

751
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:15,944
Where should we meet?

752
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:17,171
Patient Bill

753
00:47:32,795 --> 00:47:34,890
This is not a restaurant.

754
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:38,120
Thank you.

755
00:47:40,835 --> 00:47:43,231
This will help it heal without scarring.

756
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:45,301
Apply it on the wound as soon as you get home.

757
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:48,801
What about dinner?

758
00:47:49,105 --> 00:47:52,040
I'm sorry, but I have things to take care of.

759
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:54,745
We haven't even found a factory yet.

760
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,881
I desperately need to get it sorted out.

761
00:48:26,576 --> 00:48:28,071
Why are you hesitant?

762
00:48:28,315 --> 00:48:30,781
I told everyone on my team not to worry,

763
00:48:31,016 --> 00:48:32,611
but I'm really stressed out at the moment.

764
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,520
If I went with the factory that the company chose,

765
00:48:35,556 --> 00:48:38,281
I'd at least have an excuse even if things didn't go well.

766
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:41,290
If I go with the factory that copied our design,

767
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:42,990
everyone will go bonkers.

768
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:45,220
But you want to work with that lady?

769
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:47,191
To be honest, yes.

770
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:49,531
Then why hesitate?

771
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,174
There must be a reason you want to work with the person...

772
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:53,631
who copied your design.

773
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,600
You came all the way here because you want to work with her.

774
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,211
So just go for it.

775
00:49:01,846 --> 00:49:04,810
I want to, but I'm not sure if I can handle the rest.

776
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:07,950
But what if we get into trouble again?

777
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:09,520
I'm worried I'd regret my decision.

778
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:11,821
What would you regret more?

779
00:49:13,156 --> 00:49:15,091
Having to work with the factory chosen by the company...

780
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:17,265
because you have no other option?

781
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:20,591
Or not being able to do what you wanted...

782
00:49:20,636 --> 00:49:22,430
because you're afraid the same thing would happen?

783
00:49:33,815 --> 00:49:35,015
BI Apparel

784
00:49:35,016 --> 00:49:37,211
Okay, bye.

785
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:50,261
Did you pick up a temp job at BI?

786
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:52,930
To pay for your daughter's art lessons?

787
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:54,790
I received the certified mail.

788
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:57,660
I need to do whatever I can to have the money for the lawsuit.

789
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:00,770
All the brands have stopped contacting me.

790
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:03,100
They appreciate it when I copy a good design for them,

791
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:05,770
but they're afraid I'd copy their designs for their competitors.

792
00:50:06,445 --> 00:50:07,941
It's only natural to think that way.

793
00:50:10,846 --> 00:50:12,180
Would you like to work with me?

794
00:50:14,355 --> 00:50:17,484
But I can't defend or protect you,

795
00:50:17,485 --> 00:50:19,651
and there's nothing I can do to help you win the lawsuit.

796
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:21,220
If you're okay with that,

797
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:23,520
come and work with me.

798
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,731
Don't trust anyone. You've been through enough to know better.

799
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,600
I'm giving you an opportunity to make up for what you did.

800
00:50:32,036 --> 00:50:33,631
I know you've been feeling terrible about it.

801
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:56,024
Yoon Soo Wan and Shin Yoo Jung

802
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,220
Join us in a celebration of our marriage.

803
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:06,135
You are cordially invited.

804
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:07,531
12pm, Saturday May 14, 2011

805
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:11,205
Yoon Soo Wan and Shin Yoo Jung

806
00:52:11,206 --> 00:52:12,870
Yoon Soo Wan and Shin Yoo Jung

807
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:15,700
This time, I'm going to approve of her no matter what.

808
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:17,841
Jae Guk likes her.

809
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:26,354
Let's take a video. You're filming a video, right?

810
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,885
Yes. Can you turn around?

811
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:30,354
- Let's shoot the background. - This is so much prettier.

812
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,520
Hi! Say hi!

813
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:37,421
By any chance, is it Ha Young Eun?

814
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:41,060
- Jae Guk. - I know what you're going to say.

815
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:43,531
But Soo Wan...

816
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:46,770
is no longer here.

817
00:52:58,855 --> 00:53:01,611
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

818
00:53:03,186 --> 00:53:05,551
Why don't we call it a day?

819
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:07,091
All right.

820
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:10,861
Let's tidy up.

821
00:53:12,895 --> 00:53:14,060
Hey, So Young.

822
00:53:14,596 --> 00:53:17,001
Worry about the rest tomorrow. Let's go home.

823
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:21,674
I'll leave in a bit. You should get going.

824
00:53:21,675 --> 00:53:24,171
It's nice to see you work so hard. Take it easy.

825
00:53:30,886 --> 00:53:32,180
See you tomorrow.

826
00:53:34,755 --> 00:53:36,455
You're working really hard.

827
00:53:36,456 --> 00:53:38,555
You've been sketching designs all day.

828
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:40,921
If you're done for the day, you should get going.

829
00:53:41,755 --> 00:53:42,861
Why?

830
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:46,231
Is there a reason I can't stay? Do I make you uncomfortable?

831
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:51,861
All right. I'll be off, then.

832
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:59,171
Sorry? Which team are you on?

833
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:03,341
Hwang Chi Hyung from Sono?

834
00:54:04,386 --> 00:54:05,386
Okay, how can we help?

835
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:07,655
I suppose you haven't heard the rumors yet.

836
00:54:07,656 --> 00:54:09,785
Everyone's been talking about the president's son...

837
00:54:09,786 --> 00:54:11,285
who joined the company thanks to his father.

838
00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:14,051
Whether you're his son or not, it's none of my business.

839
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,890
That's Sono's design office, isn't it?

840
00:54:19,496 --> 00:54:20,660
Sorry?

841
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:35,910
You've been busted.

842
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,100
This darn beast!

843
00:54:59,536 --> 00:55:01,830
Or not.

844
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,080
You woke up.

845
00:55:16,786 --> 00:55:18,251
Honey tea for you.

846
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:21,551
And chamomile tea for me.

847
00:55:21,996 --> 00:55:23,660
It helps calm the mind.

848
00:55:29,136 --> 00:55:31,600
A man and a woman peacefully drinking tea together...

849
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:35,770
in the middle of the night with no one else around.

850
00:55:36,505 --> 00:55:38,274
I must say, I'm pretty impressed.

851
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:40,475
There was a small accidental mishap,

852
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:43,841
but I never do anything reckless.

853
00:55:44,585 --> 00:55:46,584
And I see that you have elegant taste.

854
00:55:46,585 --> 00:55:48,854
I appreciate elegance in everything.

855
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:53,091
Elegance, class, and beauty should be appreciated.

856
00:56:06,806 --> 00:56:08,604
Ms. Ha?

857
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:10,540
She's not my type at all.

858
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:22,751
That's why?

859
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:24,781
Sorry?

860
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:27,191
Do you mind repeating that a little more loudly?

861
00:56:27,795 --> 00:56:31,091
I think I can fully understand you now.

862
00:56:31,565 --> 00:56:32,691
What?

863
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:36,430
- What do you mean? - I'm not so slow-witted.

864
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:41,100
I feel much better now.

865
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,770
I don't like it so sweet.

866
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:45,301
Does it suit your liking?

867
00:56:45,545 --> 00:56:47,770
It's not perfect, but I should respect it...

868
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:49,881
because everyone's preferences are different.

869
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:11,731
I was happy to see him again.

870
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:14,470
It's been a while.

871
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:18,270
I was curious.

872
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:22,711
And I wanted to know.

873
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,810
I guess you cared about me again, right?

874
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,381
This will help it heal without scarring.

875
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:33,251
Apply it on the wound as soon as you get home.

876
00:57:37,025 --> 00:57:39,761
I can't get him off my mind.

877
00:57:45,136 --> 00:57:46,600
My emotions...

878
00:57:48,036 --> 00:57:50,001
are beginning to rule over my logic.

879
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,941
You know, the ending is very predictable.

880
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:57,240
The affection...

881
00:57:57,645 --> 00:57:59,685
and the passionate emotions that make you feel...

882
00:57:59,686 --> 00:58:02,381
as though you can't live without that person are short-lived.

883
00:58:04,226 --> 00:58:06,520
Eventually, you start fighting and become exhausted.

884
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:09,490
Then you wonder, Why did we fall for each other?

885
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,520
Was this love?

886
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,761
Is this the kind of person she really is?

887
00:58:14,735 --> 00:58:16,961
You'll be disappointed and start regretting your decision.

888
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:21,801
That is probably what will happen,

889
00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:25,970
and I don't want to go through that again.

890
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:36,720
How do you know when you haven't even tried?

891
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,921
Don't all romantic relationships and love...

892
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:45,020
begin and end like that?

893
00:58:45,835 --> 00:58:47,160
We could be different.

894
00:58:47,596 --> 00:58:50,830
Everyone gets into it thinking they'd be different.

895
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:57,941
Anyway, bye.

896
00:58:58,246 --> 00:58:59,874
Thanks for everything today,

897
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,611
although I never meant to inconvenience you like that.

898
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:21,995
Yoon Jae Guk

899
00:59:21,996 --> 00:59:24,930
It's time you changed the background photo on your phone.

900
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:28,370
Yoon Jae Guk

901
00:59:34,145 --> 00:59:36,111
When I took the photo of that street ten years ago,

902
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:38,881
I felt...

903
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:42,511
daunted and unsure like you said.

904
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:48,620
I felt clueless.

905
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:01,830
But I feel sure about this.

906
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:04,700
I know where I should be headed...

907
01:00:05,545 --> 01:00:07,310
and what's waiting for me at the end of this road.

908
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:11,410
That photo.

909
01:00:13,286 --> 01:00:15,350
You were the photographer who took it?

910
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:18,580
Thanks to the woman who bought that photo,

911
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:21,051
I could hold out for the past ten years.

912
01:00:22,556 --> 01:00:25,361
Then when I met her by chance, my heart fluttered like crazy.

913
01:00:27,235 --> 01:00:30,060
So I canceled my flight like a crazy fool because of her.

914
01:00:32,105 --> 01:00:33,531
And because she's here,

915
01:00:40,145 --> 01:00:43,180
I decided to stay.

916
01:00:46,516 --> 01:00:47,981
Now, if that's not enough...

917
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,180
If you say that you really can't do it,

918
01:00:51,686 --> 01:00:52,821
then let's...

919
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,220
break up.

920
01:01:03,266 --> 01:01:05,330
This thing we have began ten years ago,

921
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:11,600
so let's just say that we're now breaking up.

922
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:17,481
I'm not sure how long it'll take,

923
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:20,680
but while we're breaking up,

924
01:01:24,355 --> 01:01:25,551
let's allow ourselves to be in love,

925
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:31,961
Ha Young Eun.

926
01:02:35,895 --> 01:02:38,924
Now, We Are Breaking Up

927
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:40,564
What is this? Spot the difference game?

928
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:41,794
Even the fabric is exactly the same.

929
01:02:41,795 --> 01:02:43,905
- It was you, wasn't it? - You're suspicious of me?

930
01:02:43,906 --> 01:02:45,935
- What do we do? - One of them is a copy,

931
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:47,100
but I didn't copy their design.

932
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:50,504
It's awfully quiet despite our design getting leaked.

933
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:54,415
I don't think anyone on our team would ever do something like that.

934
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:56,685
I think this is your scarf.

935
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,245
You can keep it.

936
01:02:58,246 --> 01:02:59,655
She's very direct.

937
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:01,115
She doesn't hide her feelings.

938
01:03:01,116 --> 01:03:02,314
What do you think it means?

939
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:03,325
A man?

940
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:04,326
I guess she likes you.

941
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:06,124
Why do you always have to leave your socks like this?

942
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,725
Just flip them and throw them in the washer.

943
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:09,020
Is it that hard?

944
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:11,765
Is there no chance at all...

945
01:03:11,766 --> 01:03:13,464
of a mechanical malfunction or misdiagnosis?

946
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:14,834
Make sure you space them out evenly.

947
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:16,234
The artists will need separate lights.

948
01:03:16,235 --> 01:03:18,104
Cameras 1, 2... Okay.

949
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:19,705
Ms. Seo, where are the models?

950
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:20,734
Let's check the order.

951
01:03:20,735 --> 01:03:21,905
We switched her.

952
01:03:21,906 --> 01:03:23,144
How are things going with Sono?

953
01:03:23,145 --> 01:03:25,504
They're going to do a live show on the Internet today.

954
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:27,115
Ms. Ha really knows how to sell things.

955
01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:29,345
It's a simple dress with no distinct characteristics,

956
01:03:29,346 --> 01:03:31,111
but that's why it can turn into anything.

957
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,955
- Should I turn it off? - Leave it.

958
01:03:32,956 --> 01:03:35,055
Aren't they your photos?

959
01:03:35,056 --> 01:03:37,524
Jae Guk, what are you thinking?

960
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:39,624
How far do you think you guys can go?

961
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:40,955
I haven't thought that far.

962
01:03:40,956 --> 01:03:44,990
We're just going to focus on the stuff we have control over.
