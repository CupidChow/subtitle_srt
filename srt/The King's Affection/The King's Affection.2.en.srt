1
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,629
How could this happen?

2
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,556
Your Highness.

3
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,293
LONGING

4
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,175
What are you doing here
by yourself without any accompaniment?

5
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,890
Well… um…

6
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,561
I… wanted to get some fresh air
after my reading,

7
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,104
so I came out for a walk.

8
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
Does this perhaps belong to you?

9
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,906
What?

10
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,408
That, um…

11
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,701
NOT

12
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,704
Yes. That's mine.

13
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,415
Commoners play
with childish toys like this.

14
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,125
So why might you have it?

15
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,673
There you are, my lord.

16
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,475
So tell me.

17
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,604
Were you… able to see her off?

18
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:52,982
Yes, I was.

19
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,864
I recommend you return to your quarters.

20
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,285
His Majesty made it clear
that you were to stay there, did he not?

21
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,789
He… did.

22
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,586
Hold on.

23
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,967
Huh?

24
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,594
Why are you in such a hurry?

25
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,973
You forgot this.

26
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,684
Oh.

27
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,894
Right.

28
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,605
NOT

29
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,155
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.

30
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,579
We must go back, Your Highness.

31
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,039
I have been looking all over for you.

32
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,875
Escort him
to his quarters now.

33
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,131
He is not to leave his room
for the rest of the day.

34
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,008
-Understand?
-Huh?

35
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,344
Yes, my lord.

36
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,073
NOT

37
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,994
I'm… sorry.

38
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,749
I really was going to come back
right after I gave these to him.

39
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,835
I'm telling on you
once His Highness comes back.

40
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,255
I am going to tell him that you snuck out
when he told you to stay inside.

41
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,222
Hey, Bok-dong.

42
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,599
Bok-dong.

43
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,757
Mother, I… wasn't told you'd be here.

44
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,767
Who else… knows about this?

45
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,521
Sorry? What…
what do you mean, Your Highness?

46
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,981
That this child…

47
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,151
swapped their clothes
with the ones the Prince wore.

48
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,111
Who else knows about this?

49
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,029
Please spare us.

50
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,908
The Prince, Dam-i, and I
are the only ones who know.

51
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,287
Please forgive me.
I was just following the Prince's order.

52
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,545
From now on, you are…

53
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,840
the Prince, okay?

54
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,516
Listen to me…

55
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,103
you can never share
what happened today with anyone else.

56
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,233
You must… take this secret to your grave.

57
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,778
Tell me you understand.

58
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,874
EPISODE 2

59
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,502
My dear Prince…

60
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,404
Your Highness, where are you going?

61
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,948
Your Highness.

62
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,618
Your Highness!

63
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,162
Your Highness.

64
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,748
Your Highness.

65
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,874
Your Highness!

66
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,630
Your Highness, what are you going to do?

67
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,340
Go back where I belong. Okay?

68
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,184
It's the Crown Princess.

69
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,354
Come on.

70
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,449
I understand
you have the body of the girl.

71
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,868
My only daughter
was taken away because of you.

72
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,664
And there's nothing more
that you, or anybody, can do to me.

73
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,125
-Show me her body at once.
-Why?

74
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,587
Do you not trust your man,
Jung Seok-jo, anymore?

75
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,174
I was under the impression

76
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,512
that if you asked him to,
he'd kill even my child without thought.

77
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,418
You can take her with you
if that will help you feel reassured.

78
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,629
I brought her into the world.

79
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,966
So naturally,
she must carry some of your blood as well.

80
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,011
So if you want to send her off yourself

81
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,139
then, father, do it alone.

82
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,599
No parent…

83
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,936
ever wants to hurt their child in any way.

84
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,358
Everything I am doing
is for you and our family's sake.

85
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,861
Find it in your heart to let this go.

86
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,932
PASSAGE GRANTED

87
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,434
Go ahead.

88
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,202
-I-wol, wait up.
-Yeah, wait up.

89
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,330
What took you so long?
I thought you left without me.

90
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,498
Anyway, did you hear about--

91
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,208
-Excuse me.
-Goodness me.

92
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,751
You're I-wol, right?

93
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,628
Do you know me?

94
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,798
Of course I do.
Dam-i works with you, isn't that right?

95
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,260
Can you give this to her when you go back?

96
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,266
I'm Jung Ji-un. Wait.
Tell her it's from "Jwajeon."

97
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,019
I can't help you out.

98
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,231
Please, I wanna give it to her in person,

99
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,482
but I can't go inside.

100
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,234
Can you please just give it to her?

101
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,194
It's not that.

102
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,573
Dam-i isn't at the palace anymore.

103
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,616
Wait, she isn't?

104
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,118
She disappeared.

105
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,455
And no one knows where she went, either.

106
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,083
Wha… what do you mean?

107
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,385
She left to attend
the banquet for the elderly,

108
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,720
but never came back.

109
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,182
And nobody has spoken to
or heard from her,

110
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,100
not even the court ladies or maids.

111
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,896
It's not like she has
any place to go outside the palace.

112
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,318
Father.

113
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,572
Were you at the palace again?

114
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,908
Uh, yes.

115
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,410
I wanted to see that girl.

116
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,870
The court maid girl?

117
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,459
Father, I need a favor.

118
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,128
Do you think you could
ask around about my friend

119
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,172
the next time you're at the palace?

120
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,425
She went to the banquet for the elderly
and no one's seen her since.

121
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,763
But you might have better luck finding her
as an inspector and all.

122
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,558
Do you really think tracking down
some girl is my responsibility?

123
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,977
-That's not what I--
-Enough.

124
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,105
Don't you ever bring her up
in front of me again. Understood?

125
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,695
Did you really
not eat anything at all today?

126
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,044
Eat.

127
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,922
Eat even if
rice tastes like sand in your mouth.

128
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,049
And drink water
even if it tastes like you're…

129
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,343
drinking bitter medicine.

130
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,680
I don't want to.

131
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,768
And I… hate everything.

132
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,607
If you give up and stop trying,

133
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,151
it will mean death
for everyone around you.

134
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,903
For you and me.

135
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,113
For everyone.

136
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,586
Are you awake?

137
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,589
We have brought some water for your face.

138
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,216
From now on,

139
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,260
Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong
will be taking care of you.

140
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:11,971
So do not worry.

141
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,978
Maids will bring water and help you

142
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
-wash yourself in the morning.
-Please stop.

143
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,066
You don't have to do a thing.

144
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,777
-Let the maids handle everything.
-Your Highness.

145
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,826
Your schedule is fairly simple.

146
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,496
Every morning,
you will go to the King's quarters

147
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,541
as well as the Queen's quarters
to offer your greetings.

148
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,837
And then, you will come to our quarters
to say hello to the Crown Prince and me.

149
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,517
The Prince is here.

150
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,151
I was concerned when I heard that
you hadn't been feeling well for a while.

151
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,695
Are you feeling better now?

152
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,908
Yes. Sorry to have made you
worry about me.

153
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,410
You don't sound as strong as before.

154
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,081
Is it because you've been dealing
with this sickness recently?

155
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,334
No, Your Majesty. I am perfectly fine.

156
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,884
This isn't good.

157
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,346
I will have one of the court physicians
deliver some tonics to you.

158
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,390
To energize you.
Make sure to drink it every day.

159
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,976
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,561
It's time for the morning assembly.

161
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,772
This is enough for morning greetings.

162
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,649
You may all leave now.

163
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,725
I keep stepping on my robe
because it's too long.

164
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,310
And this is also big.

165
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,103
I will have them altered for you today.

166
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,024
We'll go ahead, come with me.

167
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,031
No, not there.

168
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,282
It's around the other way.

169
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,213
Your Highness,
I have the herbal tonics from the Queen.

170
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,978
It is hot. So please be careful.

171
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,025
Hot!

172
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:35,943
Oh!

173
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,570
Sorry. My fault.

174
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,364
Oh. Oh, no.

175
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,950
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
I'll get another bowl right away.

176
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,667
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

177
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,879
No. It's fine. I'm all right.

178
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,964
Don't worry about that.

179
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,466
Bok-dong!

180
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,221
You asked for me?

181
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,890
Get some ointment from the royal pharmacy.

182
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,351
-Huh?
-Go on.

183
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,024
Your Highness.

184
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,032
Please forgive me.
It was my mistake, Your Highness.

185
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,419
All of you may leave now.

186
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,555
It looked like a deep cut.
Please call her a physician.

187
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,639
There's no need.

188
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,975
It is not your place to worry about her

189
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,311
even if her finger is cut
or completely severed.

190
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,857
She was hurt because of me
because I dropped the bowl.

191
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,066
No.

192
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,819
It was her fault.

193
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,488
You are never to apologize.

194
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,782
You are not to worry about other people.

195
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,409
You can only think of yourself.

196
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,412
You are not to care
about what others might think of you.

197
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,747
Because you…

198
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,917
are the Prince.

199
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,338
There's no need to show respect to others

200
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,256
or even feel bad for them.

201
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,760
There are two people
you will show respect to, the King

202
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,220
and the other is the Crown Prince.

203
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,058
Do you understand?

204
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,977
But…

205
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,104
why do I have to do that?

206
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,733
That's not how I want to live.

207
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,735
It is only fair that I apologize

208
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,821
to whoever
deserves my apology when I'm at fault.

209
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,948
No matter what my title may be.

210
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,005
They must know their place.

211
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,008
You have to make them fear you.

212
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,513
Which means
you can't let them get close to you.

213
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,309
Or you won't survive.

214
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,863
Even your shoulders.

215
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,615
And widen your stance.

216
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,367
Who are you?

217
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,162
It's me, Hyun.

218
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,915
Hyun?

219
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,215
What's going on?
You two aren't training together, are you?

220
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,926
What? Does it look like training to you?

221
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,013
Well, since the Prince's good cousin,
Prince Jaeun, is here,

222
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,057
I'll get some refreshments right away.

223
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,767
No. Don't worry about it.

224
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,106
I'm sorry. I may have been
out of line with my prank.

225
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,568
By the way, what brings you here?

226
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,153
Isn't it obvious?

227
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,530
Your birthday is fast approaching.

228
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,616
So I came to ask
what you'd like me to give you

229
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,826
for a gift.

230
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,830
My birthday?

231
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,780
He's the brother of the King
and the son of Queen Consort An,

232
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,449
Lord Hyeonun.

233
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,993
Congratulations, Your Highness.

234
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,290
Lord Geumjeong of the Sinbin Kang clan.

235
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,583
Congratulations, Your Highness.

236
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,555
They are the sons
of the late Prince Dohyeon.

237
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,642
They are Prince Wonsan
and Prince Jaeun.

238
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,143
You've met him before.

239
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,271
Congratulations to you.

240
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,359
Thank you very much.

241
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,319
Well, I hope you aren't confused today.

242
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,363
It's me, Hyun.

243
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,032
I was just playing around before.

244
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,243
What were you confused about?

245
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,542
So good to see you.

246
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,552
Congratulations.

247
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,102
This fine weather must be proof

248
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,146
that everything on earth

249
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,692
is joining together today
to celebrate your birthday.

250
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,279
Thank you so much.

251
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,615
It is truly an honor to witness

252
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,828
such magnificent growth in you.

253
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,212
I understand
you have the body of the girl.

254
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,510
Everything I am doing is
for you and our family's sake.

255
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,304
Find it in your heart to let this go.

256
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,309
Please remember that you

257
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,854
shape the destiny of Joseon.
We rely on you.

258
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,232
I will devote my life to serving you

259
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,777
as I've been doing
every day before this one.

260
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,291
Anxiety is getting to you.

261
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,253
You saw enough guests.
It's best if we stop here for now.

262
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,094
I can handle it.

263
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,474
The son of Jung Seok-jo,
from the Office of the Inspector General,

264
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,934
asks for an audience, Your Highness.

265
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,853
Okay.

266
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,961
My name is Jung Ji-un, and I am
the son of the Inspector Jung Seok-jo.

267
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,507
Thank you for granting me
a private audience with you.

268
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,900
I heard that
today is your birthday.

269
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,404
This may sound presumptuous,

270
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:22,075
but after hearing about
how amazing you are from a girl I knew,

271
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,787
I decided that I wanted to meet you
and wish you a happy birthday in person.

272
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,585
From what she told me,
you aren't authoritative

273
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,045
or arrogant,

274
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,716
but a generous prince
with a loving heart for his subjects.

275
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,261
Ever since then,
I have been hoping that one day,

276
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,555
I would be able
to serve by your side, Your Highness.

277
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,691
Soon I will be
going to Ming for my studies.

278
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,070
And I will do my best while I am there

279
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,949
to keep this promise to you and to return
as a subject you will be proud of.

280
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,411
Please stay healthy until I return.

281
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,558
Wait.

282
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,485
Was the girl who you spoke to

283
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,488
named Dam-i, by any chance?

284
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,533
That's right. Do you know her?

285
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,712
LONGING, NOT

286
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,341
She said to give these to you
if I ever met you.

287
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,737
LONGING, NOT

288
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:29,285
She told me they would help you
stay strong when things get hard

289
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,788
just like they had been helpful…

290
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,165
for her.

291
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,668
Do…

292
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,713
do you happen to know where she went?

293
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,551
I do not.

294
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,348
Please let me escort you out.

295
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,562
LONGING, WAIT

296
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,533
LONGING, WAIT

297
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,151
Your Highness!

298
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,947
Your Highness!

299
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,366
Your Highness!

300
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,099
Aren't you the inspector
who was looking for Dam-i

301
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,350
the day she disappeared or…

302
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,233
Please excuse me.

303
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:20,581
Since the day of the banquet
Dam-i hasn't been back to the palace,

304
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,544
I was wondering
if you met her that day, sir.

305
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,466
I did not. And I haven't since either.

306
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,263
I see.

307
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,183
Thank you for your time, anyway.

308
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,477
Wait.

309
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,522
Do you think you could do me a favor?

310
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,524
Sorry?

311
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,776
I was actually looking
for someone to help me out.

312
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,540
That girl…

313
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,027
Where exactly are we headed to, sir?

314
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,905
The court maids
will be looking for me.

315
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,657
I should be getting back to my post now.

316
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,965
We just arrived.

317
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,935
Why?

318
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:08,272
Why are you… Why are you doing this?
Can't you spare me, please?

319
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,067
I'm sorry. I'll try to make it quick.

320
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,904
No!

321
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,782
No, father. Please, stop.

322
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,700
Ji-un, what are you doing here?

323
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,410
Why are you trying to kill her?

324
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,412
What did she do?

325
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,414
This has nothing to do with you.
Now move aside.

326
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,707
Stop it!

327
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,002
Father, stop it. Please!

328
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,088
Move!

329
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,881
Father!

330
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,425
Father!

331
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,367
No!

332
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,906
Your Highness!

333
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,366
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

334
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,911
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

335
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,204
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

336
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,209
Where is the Prince?

337
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,337
I don't know. I searched everywhere
in the Prince's quarters,

338
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,588
we're looking, but nothing yet.

339
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,469
We must find the child
before anyone finds out.

340
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,805
I will never forgive myself…

341
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,434
if something were to happen
to that child as well.

342
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,064
Your Highness, please do not worry.
Everything will be all right.

343
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,024
No!

344
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,151
No, father. Please, stop!

345
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,196
Why are you trying to kill her?
What did she do?

346
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,615
This has nothing
to do with you. Now move.

347
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,075
Stop it!

348
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,911
Father, stop it. Please, father!

349
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,954
Move!

350
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,006
No!

351
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,253
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

352
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,422
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

353
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,215
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

354
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,134
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness, where are you?

355
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,348
Eunuch Hong, go check over there.

356
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,516
-Where are you, Your Highness?
-Your Highness!

357
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,602
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

358
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,937
-Where are you?
-Your Highness!

359
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,148
Your Highness!

360
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,864
Where are you?

361
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,007
Your Highness!

362
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,635
Your Highness!

363
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,513
Your Highness!

364
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,982
Why are you sitting here doing nothing?

365
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,110
Go and help find the Prince, won't you?

366
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,787
My heart breaks for the young Prince.

367
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,874
She must have been so scared.

368
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,462
I wouldn't have lasted a day
if I were in her shoes.

369
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,881
The Prince's own grandfather
had him killed.

370
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,219
Being forced to live around those people

371
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,179
must have taken a toll on her.

372
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,183
But I couldn't do anything
to lessen her burden.

373
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,478
All I did was cry
in front of her out of fear.

374
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,490
You have to be brave now, Bok-dong.

375
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,784
Especially for the sake
of the young Prince.

376
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,121
The day the King finds out the truth,

377
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,583
it will be the death of everyone.

378
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,259
I'm here.

379
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,475
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

380
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,562
Where on earth
have you been, Your Highness?

381
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,195
It's all my fault.

382
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,030
Everything.

383
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,202
The Prince and I-wol were killed

384
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,455
because of me.

385
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,755
Please stop crying.

386
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,716
This is not your fault.

387
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,636
None of this,

388
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,847
Your Highness, is your fault.

389
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,947
The moon is certainly bright tonight.

390
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,370
When I was pregnant with you,

391
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,206
I had a dream.

392
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,126
A very big moon slid underneath my dress.

393
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:12,131
And soon after the moon split
into two beautiful pearls.

394
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,259
One of the pearls was your brother.

395
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,928
And the other

396
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,848
was probably you.

397
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,020
I was happy…

398
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,315
when I had you and your brother.

399
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,900
I was…

400
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,945
I was truly happy.

401
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,324
Why…

402
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,578
aren't you scolding me?

403
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,875
I ran away.

404
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,712
Why are you not scolding me?

405
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,592
Because you came back.

406
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:02,514
Because you came back to your mother.

407
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,645
I-wol…

408
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,814
is dead.

409
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,903
I cannot…

410
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,656
forgive…

411
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,867
the man who killed her.

412
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,872
And now, that boy…

413
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,920
I won't be able to forgive anyone now.

414
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,267
Then don't.

415
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,648
Be it hatred or resentment.
No matter what it is.

416
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,275
Learn to live with it.

417
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,113
As long as it gives you the will to live…

418
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,032
that is enough.

419
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,371
I promise

420
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,666
I'll be responsible for everything.

421
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,169
And you…

422
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,422
I want you to live.

423
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,675
Even when it's hard…

424
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,803
just live your life.

425
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,432
Mother.

426
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,692
You said mother…

427
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,404
you called me Mother after everything.

428
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,657
Thank you.

429
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,493
I am truly grateful.

430
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,337
Never forget…

431
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,966
that you are the Prince, all right?

432
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,145
You are so special.

433
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,691
Your life is important.

434
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,152
You are the chosen one.

435
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,238
Mother.

436
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,282
I'm sorry.

437
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,704
I had promised to always protect you.

438
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,875
But that's a promise I can't keep.

439
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,547
I failed you as your mother
and made your life…

440
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,883
harder than it had to be.

441
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,470
And thinking…

442
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,432
about how you have been forced

443
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,310
to live in this endless anguish…

444
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,649
I am filled with so much regret.

445
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,904
But I believe in you.

446
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,532
And if anyone…

447
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:53,495
can do this, I have no doubt it's you.

448
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,594
Remember what I told you?

449
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,179
You are…

450
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,142
very special.

451
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,644
Don't forget that.

452
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,565
My beautiful…

453
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,069
daughter.

454
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,031
Mother.

455
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,785
Mother.

456
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,338
The Crown Prince
shall now enter.

457
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,804
Your Highness.

458
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,932
Everybody out.

459
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,435
I wanna be alone with the Crown Princess.

460
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,362
Mo… Mother. Please, Mother…

461
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,783
Mother. Please.

462
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,005
I have one wish, Your Highness.

463
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,300
Please protect

464
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,970
the Prince…

465
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,349
our child.

466
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,052
-Your Highness.
-Mother…

467
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,223
Mother.

468
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,976
Mother.

469
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,811
-Your Highness!
-Mother…

470
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,933
All who are present!

471
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,936
Bow down four times!

472
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,286
10 YEARS LATER

473
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,163
Move!

474
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,207
Get out of my way!

475
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,375
Clear the way!

476
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,339
Open the door! It's very urgent.

477
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,716
JASEONDANG

478
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,595
Your Highness, it's Bok-dong.

479
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,098
Bok-dong, did you find any?

480
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,225
Yes. Here you go. Yes.

481
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,616
That's silk.
Is there a reason you brought me silk?

482
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,497
Yes, Your Highness.
I looked for it everywhere, I swear,

483
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,582
but I couldn't find the cotton one.

484
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,000
Would you please forgive me?

485
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,710
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

486
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,505
My room was cleaned by a new maid and…

487
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,715
Well, she threw out
all of the cotton covers.

488
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,033
Only do the tasks assigned to you.

489
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,953
If you aren't sure of something,
don't do it.

490
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,247
That's the rule here

491
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,291
for the Crown Prince's quarters,
understand?

492
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,402
SAMGAEBANG

493
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,737
Do you know
how Samgaebang came about?

494
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,282
How, exactly?

495
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:49,035
You see, we've got
a remarkably important man from here.

496
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,120
Oh.

497
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,455
This distinguished man

498
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,041
passed the state exam at the age of 15!

499
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,545
He is the legend who saved
the Vice Minister of Rites of the Ming

500
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,548
-with his miraculous touch.
-He saved the Vice Minister?

501
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,091
How'd he do that?

502
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,635
-How did he do that?
-Yeah, how?

503
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,845
-Allow me.
-Of course.

504
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:15,061
This even took place
in the most famous inn in Yanjing.

505
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,732
The Vice Minister
played a major role

506
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,775
in the Emperor's succession to the throne.

507
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,902
And one day when he was having his meal…

508
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,572
-Oh!
-…some food got stuck

509
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,781
and he began to choke.

510
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,491
Goodness.

511
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,453
Sir, what's wrong? Are you okay?

512
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,663
Sir, what's wrong?

513
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,378
Sir!

514
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,922
I think something's stuck in his throat!

515
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,508
Someone help!

516
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,303
Hurry! We need some help!

517
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,888
What is stuck in his throat?

518
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,058
What are you doing? Do something!

519
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,898
Sir!

520
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,109
Who was that?

521
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,612
Get him!

522
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,842
Knock him down!

523
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,720
Who sent you?

524
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,114
He survived.

525
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,382
Wait.

526
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,558
Are you from Joseon?

527
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,855
I am, yes.

528
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,316
I'm from Joseon also.

529
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,610
I don't know how to thank you for this.

530
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,239
Don't thank me.
I just did what anyone would do.

531
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:35,160
The man you just saved
is the Vice Minister of Rites.

532
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,370
You saved an important man's life.

533
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,498
I'm sure the Emperor
will give you a generous reward.

534
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,625
Everyone's life is important.

535
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,920
I would have done the exact same thing
if it turned out

536
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:50,341
he was a sad beggar on the street,
and not the Vice Minister.

537
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,345
Goodbye.

538
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,313
Yup. "I would have done the same thing."

539
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,694
All right. Okay. Now, do you all
wanna know who this man is?

540
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,279
Tell us.

541
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,489
-It's…
-Tell us.

542
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,532
Physician Jung!

543
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,119
Physician Jung! Physician Jung!

544
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,913
Where is Physician Jung, huh?

545
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,539
Where is he? Where has he run off to?

546
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,583
Just calm down. What's wrong?

547
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,336
The Minister of Personnel,
we went to his house.

548
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,963
His daughter's face is totally ruined.
It's a disaster.

549
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:33,218
Physician Jung! Physician Jung!

550
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,345
Move out of the way.

551
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,805
Step back!

552
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,391
Be quiet.

553
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,902
Tell us at once where the physician is.

554
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,328
What's going on out here?

555
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,372
What?

556
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,915
-Uh, help.
-What's going on?

557
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,892
There's always a chance of side effects.
It's rare, but it happens.

558
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,395
So I'm just unlucky?

559
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:26,980
Don't worry yourself.

560
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,191
With the medicine that I provide you,
it will be gone in half a day.

561
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,069
Okay. Now, let me see.

562
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:36,573
Where is the herb for a rash?

563
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,709
-Jil-geum.
-Yes.

564
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,839
What… what do you need from me?

565
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,634
Go out to the herb storage and fetch me
those dried blackish yellow flowers, okay?

566
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,971
Uh, those flowers?

567
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,767
We don't have any.

568
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,231
We do. Just go check
the third shelf over on the right.

569
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,566
We don't.

570
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,944
We don't?

571
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,203
Just give me five days.

572
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,914
Once I get the herbs,
I'll bring you the medicine right away.

573
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,423
-Yeong-ji.
-Yeong-ji.

574
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,967
You have until the end of today.

575
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,219
And if you should happen to fail in this

576
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,723
I can't promise that your shop
or that girl will be safe.

577
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,018
Is that clear?

578
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:41,948
Damn it!

579
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,751
Bullseye!

580
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,560
Sure is one arrogant Crown Prince,
don't you think?

581
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,438
He wouldn't be
if my arrows weren't defective.

582
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,607
Or if he didn't have
his grandfather to thank.

583
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,777
You know without him,
he never would have been the Crown Prince.

584
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,197
The Queen has the King
wrapped around her little finger.

585
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,366
So he only adores Prince Jehyeon.

586
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,204
That explains his need to compensate.

587
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,463
Please watch your tongue, Uncle.

588
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,466
We're not in private.

589
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,636
What? So they hear.

590
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,887
I wasn't making up any of it.

591
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,687
You know what? I should catch
one of those deer for myself as well

592
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,233
so that I can also benefit
from the graces of Lord Sangheon.

593
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,279
Who knows? He might be someone who prefers

594
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,907
a man like me who is full of vigor,

595
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,951
to someone
who looks like a delicate flower.

596
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:54,747
Hey!

597
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,107
Who did this?

598
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,984
What crazy bastard…

599
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,826
You said you wanted
to catch something for my grandfather.

600
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,334
The next time
you're impetuous with your words,

601
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,503
I will not be as forgiving with you,

602
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,424
even if you are my uncle.

603
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,491
So you wanna play this game, huh?

604
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:03,894
Huh?

605
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,900
What on earth?

606
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,987
He looks like a woman.

607
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,563
What is going on?

608
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,519
The Crown Prince has vanished?

609
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,480
We must find
the Crown Prince before anyone else does.

610
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,274
-Jump.
-What?

611
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,401
A court maid at the royal hunting?

612
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:58,319
An assassin?

613
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,987
An assassin attacked the Crown Prince?

614
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,073
She had a delicate face,
porcelain skin and dark brown hair.

615
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,408
Hyun?

616
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,327
Why did you spare
that young the man?

617
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,246
The one who saw you
there in the woods at the royal hunting?

618
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,916
I must kill him. I will.

619
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,003
What is your name?

620
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:20,174
-Jung Ji-un is my name.
-Jung Ji-un is my name.
