1
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,489
I do not care what the position is.

2
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,951
I just need to find a way
to be at the palace as often as I can.

3
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,496
Please help me.

4
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,251
What made you change your mind?

5
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,545
Why are you asking for my help?

6
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,547
I want to…

7
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,259
protect His Majesty.

8
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,099
Is it out of loyalty?

9
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,437
You…

10
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,273
do not belong in the palace.

11
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,650
You should leave.

12
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,236
What do you mean? Why not?

13
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,240
Why would you say now
that I don't belong in the palace?

14
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,200
Because…

15
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,996
I know that you are capable
of telling what's right from wrong.

16
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,748
At the palace,

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,418
what's right may not always
actually be the right answer.

18
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,006
Do you really think
you can survive in the palace

19
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,093
with a mere sense of loyalty?

20
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,100
I'll adapt to that world…

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,563
if that's what it takes.

22
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,907
I would like my son
to be near His Majesty.

23
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,368
But your son

24
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,330
tried to take His Majesty and run away.

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,545
You should think
about showing some gratitude

26
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,505
that I'm not chastising him more.

27
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,966
Yet you want him to be by his side?

28
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,970
You made me a promise the first time
I took someone's life for you.

29
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,264
You promised me that

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,351
my family and I would not
have to answer to anyone else

31
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,937
if I followed you.

32
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,064
So keep your promise to me.

33
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,776
Seeing as now you've achieved your goal,

34
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,906
I believe it is my turn to be rewarded.

35
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,593
Two months is enough time.

36
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,598
I won't say anything
and I will keep my feelings to myself.

37
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:32,814
I will stay by your side, Your Majesty,
until your wound gets better.

38
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,282
Please just pretend I'm not here.

39
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,828
And I… will do the same.

40
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,717
EPISODE 14

41
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,012
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness. Please stop.

42
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,681
-Please, Your Highness.
-Wait, Your Highness.

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,600
Please stop running,
Your Highness.

44
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,852
Your Highness.

45
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,815
I was told I could find
His Majesty here. So, have you seen him?

46
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,902
Oh. His Majesty went back to his quarters
after the royal lecture, I'm afraid.

47
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,655
Thank you for telling me.

48
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,866
Oh, uh…

49
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,536
does he have
a lot of state business to attend to?

50
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,413
Huh?

51
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,207
Oh, nothing.

52
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,143
Well, look who is here.

53
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,816
So what brings you here today,
Your Highness, if I may ask?

54
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,985
-Father.
-Please.

55
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,238
You can't address me like that.

56
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,282
Remember royal etiquette.

57
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,495
Hello, Left State Councilor.

58
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,873
Hello. What's that you're holding?

59
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,667
This?

60
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,134
My love letter to His Majesty.

61
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,302
A love letter?

62
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,890
So you've been writing
a love letter every day in your room, huh?

63
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,809
Not every day. Only some days.

64
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,854
Some days… way more.

65
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,902
Although, I'm not sure
if he's reading any of them.

66
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,071
He hasn't responded yet.

67
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,740
Of course he is reading them.

68
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,619
I'm sure he's reading
the letters over and over again.

69
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,830
Square your shoulders and look confident.

70
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,209
Do not forget
that Lord Sangheon handpicked you.

71
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,503
You must always show confidence.

72
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,214
Like this?

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
You look absolutely perfect.

74
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,096
Well, Father, I suppose
I'll go now and see His Majesty.

75
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,773
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness. Please.

76
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,942
I beg of you. Please be careful.

77
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,121
SEUNGJEONGWON: ROYAL SECRETARIAT
THAT HANDLED THE KING'S ORDERS

78
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,926
Hmm.

79
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,479
"A section chief
at the Ministry of Personnel,

80
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,023
Kim Sa-heon,
took bribes and sold positions."

81
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,067
Kim Sa-heon?

82
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,739
He's Lord Sangheon's
second cousin once removed, isn't he?

83
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,284
I decline.

84
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,748
"Han Gi-jae, the Chief State Councilor,
has taken over the royal court

85
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,791
using his position
as His Majesty's grandfather."

86
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,295
This too.

87
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,840
DECLINED, ACCEPTED

88
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,135
"Oust him quietly…"

89
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,099
"Follow the public opinion
by excluding him…"

90
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,727
Get these out of here.

91
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,021
These are all the same appeals.
Take them away.

92
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,898
Gosh. What a traitor.

93
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,780
You see that there is a flood of requests
for Lord Sangheon to be impeached here,

94
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,406
but you turn a blind eye to them.

95
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,909
My, how you've changed,
Royal Scholar Yang.

96
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,370
Oh, no, Chief Royal Secretary.

97
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,497
After all, you were His Majesty's tutor.

98
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,461
Remind me exactly
what you are doing here again, huh?

99
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,965
Go back to the Ministry of Taxation.
You're section chief.

100
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,925
Yet, you're always here.
What do you need now?

101
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,221
If you plan to handle everything
in the Chief State Councilor's favor,

102
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,098
why do we need a Chief Royal Secretary?

103
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,599
Right, Scribe Jung?

104
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,644
Can't be helped.

105
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,146
Well…

106
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,191
I will go and dispose of them now.

107
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,659
I was wrong about him.

108
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,454
What happened to the man
who made the lotus analogy

109
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,123
to teach Lord Sangheon a lesson?

110
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,377
You know his father, Commander Jung,
is the one who got him that gig.

111
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,046
That must be why
he rarely goes to the palace.

112
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,340
All he does is deliver these reports.

113
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,052
Having to be by His Majesty's
side writing the royal diary,

114
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,095
it must be hard on him.

115
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,767
Just remember
not to jump to conclusions. Hmm?

116
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,021
Think you'll be different, do you?
We follow orders.

117
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,772
You know I have a point.

118
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,898
Why is he here as a scribe

119
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,901
if he won't work
on the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat?

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,362
Right.

121
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,366
You're distracting me. Go on.

122
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,201
Back to work.

123
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,494
Stop wasting time.

124
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,463
I heard you moved back home.

125
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,798
Did you make up with your father?

126
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,384
Yes.

127
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,347
You said you would never forgive him.
So what happened?

128
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,517
I have to get going.

129
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
Oh…

130
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,858
What's gotten into him?

131
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,173
For a while after your ascension,
your pulse was very unstable.

132
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,343
It's much stronger now, Your Majesty.

133
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,178
That's good to hear.

134
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,347
You may take your leave.

135
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:58,050
Your Majesty, the reports
from the Royal Secretary are here.

136
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,177
Let him enter.

137
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,267
Remember, you only have 30 minutes.

138
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,242
Are you leaving
after His Majesty's health exam?

139
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,036
Yes, Commander Jung.

140
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,539
And how is His Majesty today?

141
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,291
How is his wound?

142
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,625
Has it healed yet?

143
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,379
Sorry? He has a wound?

144
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,124
Your wound
has significantly healed.

145
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,336
We will need to observe it
for another three or four days.

146
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,422
The royal physician told me that

147
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,925
my pulse has gotten more stable too.

148
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,552
And to be honest,

149
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,223
I am feeling quite a lot better.

150
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,566
Now try to move your arm a little bit.

151
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,235
Let me know if it hurts.

152
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,990
It feels just fine.

153
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,298
Thank you…

154
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,848
for always treating me, Scribe Jung.

155
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,990
Oh!

156
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,289
You… You… Your Highness. Why did you…

157
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,133
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

158
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,153
How could you open the door?

159
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,532
You just barged in without
waiting for me to announce your presence!

160
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,951
Oh, so sorry.

161
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,746
I forgot
we're not supposed to do that here.

162
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,708
What do I do?

163
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,510
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty the Queen is here.

164
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,553
Let her enter.

165
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,280
Your Majesty, forgive me.

166
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,160
I still am not used
to the finer points of royal etiquette.

167
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:37,997
I am sorry.

168
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,917
It's okay, Your Highness.

169
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,296
Your Majesty, I should be going.

170
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,722
Please come and sit.

171
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,076
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

172
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,703
Well…

173
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,303
I saw a pair of beautiful skylarks
up in a tree last night.

174
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,140
They were sitting together
outside of my room, so…

175
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,561
I guess I just couldn't help
but be reminded of me and you,

176
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,396
so I decided to write that.

177
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,949
Thank you.

178
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,744
I… will have to read it.

179
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,621
You mean it?

180
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,209
Also, the Royal Astronomer
is going to pick our special day soon.

181
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,379
I… didn't know if you'd heard.

182
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,509
That's good to hear.

183
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,142
DAY 23 OF MONTH 12

184
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,903
Rumor has it that you will follow
Lord Sangheon's order

185
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,575
instead of just picking
what's best for His Majesty and the Queen.

186
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,203
Wait… wait a minute.

187
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,206
Lord Sangheon has been
on our backs and scolding us every day.

188
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,750
It's all because he thinks
it's taking too long for me

189
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,502
to schedule their night together.

190
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,171
What choice do I have?

191
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,090
You're not the only ones
in a tough spot here.

192
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,886
Then how do you explain this?

193
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,220
How did you…

194
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,057
My goodness. Look how much is in here.

195
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,103
Did you take the money so you could buy
nice dinners with your colleagues, huh?

196
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,065
-Goodness.
-Don't kill me! Please spare my life!

197
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,817
Please spare me.

198
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,777
Please spare me.

199
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,615
Right. That's enough.

200
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,034
Why would we kill you?

201
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,203
The King is incredibly busy,

202
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,205
he won't be able
to tend to the Queen right now.

203
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,790
I just came here to tell you that.

204
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:19,384
All right. However,
I must decide on a date soon, because

205
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,304
if I don't, there is no doubt about it…

206
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,556
I'll be killed by Lord Sangheon--

207
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,394
You might not have to wait for that
if we take this matter into our own hands.

208
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,107
Yes, but he just said
I wouldn't be killed though, so…

209
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,902
I guess he just
had a different idea in mind.

210
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,279
Oh, a different idea?

211
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,864
I do have a different idea.

212
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,324
Where did I put that stick again?

213
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,534
Wait, you… You know what?

214
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,288
Here. Let me just take this back

215
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,706
right now. Please forgive me!

216
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,000
Hey!

217
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,008
Oh no! Lord Sangheon!

218
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,179
You're in charge
of picking the special days.

219
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,932
So tell me. Has a date been selected?

220
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,810
Well, about that…

221
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,483
The energy of the heavens
is not good this month,

222
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,027
the balance of yin and yang is all wrong.

223
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,531
Therefore, my feeling is
it'll be hard to choose the right day--

224
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,366
That does not concern me.

225
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,828
Choose a date and bring it later today.

226
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,955
Yes, my lord.

227
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,925
Come here. Now.

228
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,434
Inspector General Cho Yeong-ho
who led the scholars to protest

229
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,394
with Great Lord Changcheon
has been banished.

230
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,815
So now a recommendation for his successor
must be chosen, Your Majesty.

231
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,108
Who banished him?

232
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,280
The banishment was executed properly

233
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,408
based on the royal edict you had given me.

234
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,955
Huh.

235
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,458
I see.

236
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,920
Your Majesty, due to this year's
prolonged rainy season,

237
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,840
the ground around
the placenta chamber has grown unstable.

238
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,259
Many people have raised concerns.

239
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,305
I believe that it would be
a good idea to consider relocating it.

240
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,351
Quite a responsibility.
But who should take on this role?

241
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,727
I recommend Prince Wonsan,

242
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,356
superintendent of
the Office of Royal Genealogy.

243
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:42,444
In order to succeed, this issue
will require a continued strategy.

244
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,363
A regional official should be in charge--

245
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,281
This is a royal matter.

246
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,407
Do you not agree

247
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,869
that it ought to be taken care of
by a member of the royal family?

248
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,590
I'll do the best I can, Your Majesty.

249
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,133
I swear.

250
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,076
Did I upset you?

251
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,790
I should have informed you

252
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,418
before handling the situation myself.

253
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,586
It was just such an urgent matter.

254
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,131
I see.

255
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,217
And it is appreciated.

256
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:53,515
Please let me continue to handle
these burdensome matters

257
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,228
so that you are able to give
your full attention to producing an heir.

258
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,024
No matter how big the tree is,
the people at the palace

259
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,654
will want to go and chop it down,
to plant a new one

260
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,865
if it does not yield any fruit.

261
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,661
Politically, you must strengthen
where you stand now

262
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,622
for the sake of the late King.

263
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,295
I'll keep that in mind then.

264
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,423
Grandfather.

265
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,052
YOUR MAJESTY…

266
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,763
You mean the date has been set for us?

267
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,474
Yes.

268
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,278
I've been writing a little poetry.

269
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,324
I heard that His Majesty
is known to enjoy reading it so…

270
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,958
Is that the letter? With the date?

271
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,045
Yes.

272
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,385
The Royal Astronomer…

273
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,306
sent this over today.

274
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,866
Oh. Today?

275
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,912
-It's happening?
-Yes.

276
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,330
Oh, my.

277
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,585
Oh, Court Lady Kim.

278
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,841
GANGNYEONGJEON

279
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,391
Are you sure
you want to proceed with this?

280
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,727
Give them an excuse.
You tell them you're not feeling well.

281
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,396
It is not too late, you know.

282
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,982
That was the excuse for the wedding night.

283
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,526
I will take care of it this time.

284
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,320
I'll find an empty storeroom
and set it on fire.

285
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,699
-And so then, with all the commotion--
-Enough.

286
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,286
I will go to the Queen's quarters.

287
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,163
You'll escort me there.

288
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,291
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

289
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,293
What are you going to do?

290
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:27,877
Wait.

291
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,215
His Majesty and the Queen
are spending the night.

292
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,009
Is that why it's so quiet around here?

293
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,595
You're right.
It certainly is quiet.

294
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,481
Are you all going home now?

295
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

296
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,236
You must be heading
to the Queen's quarters now.

297
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,742
Yes. Good night.

298
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,527
What is it, Your Majesty? You all right?

299
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,141
Sorry, Your Majesty.

300
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,685
I am just nervous.

301
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,814
It is all right.

302
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,483
Leave it.

303
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,414
Is tonight something
you've been waiting long for?

304
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,332
Sorry?

305
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,335
You know.

306
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,255
On our first night,
I left after helping you with your hair.

307
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,383
So this is the first time
we are sitting down…

308
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,886
where it's just been me and you.

309
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,182
I'll admit, the one and only desire I have

310
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,310
is to produce a son
and to see you as happy as possible.

311
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,692
That sounds strange.

312
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:59,195
I'd just like you to know there's not
some hidden intention or anything.

313
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,873
I'm sorry, I won't.

314
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,709
Huh?

315
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,754
Please believe me
when I say I have no intention of…

316
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,050
disrespecting you.

317
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,303
Majesty.

318
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,972
I could leave this room right now
without another thought.

319
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,057
I won't do that to you.

320
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,018
Moreover…

321
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,647
know that I cannot give you an explanation
why I choose to do something that is…

322
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,026
humiliating to you.

323
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,612
And so…

324
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,199
if you resent me and grow to hate me

325
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,911
for what I am about to do tonight…

326
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,957
I will accept it without issue.

327
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,379
Your Majesty, why so suddenly…

328
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,348
Enter.

329
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,403
On this night…

330
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,490
we made love as a married couple.

331
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,535
And on the days we sleep together,

332
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,996
just like today,
there shall be two sets of blankets.

333
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,250
And of course, all of this,

334
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,460
will remain a secret
that never leaves this room.

335
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,838
So I ask that you…

336
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,675
keep up with this ruse.

337
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,012
What's wrong?

338
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,391
Why are you doing this, Your Majesty?

339
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,211
May I enter?

340
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,640
You're still awake.

341
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,144
I need to ask you a question.

342
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,314
You know, during the procession

343
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,025
that His Majesty was shot with an arrow.

344
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,155
However, there's no record His Majesty
was ever treated for this wound.

345
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:34,452
So, I was wondering
if you'd been tending to it at all.

346
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,289
I haven't, no.

347
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,668
He has a royal physician.
Why would he need me to treat him too?

348
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,922
Perhaps the wound
wasn't deep enough to require treatment.

349
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,719
Really? That's a relief.

350
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,389
Get some rest.

351
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,029
More blood over here!

352
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,878
GANGNYEONGJEON

353
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,354
If you don't mind my asking,

354
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,773
why were you
honest with the Queen last night?

355
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,526
You could have
made up an excuse.

356
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,778
And I know that girl
would have believed you,

357
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,697
regardless of what you said.

358
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,452
Her affection is sincere.

359
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,455
I know she certainly cares about me.

360
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,584
She is always pouring out her heart to me.

361
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,670
I just couldn't let myself
lie to her like that.

362
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,674
Because I know that is not right.

363
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,302
Your Majesty.

364
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,934
Your Majesty, it is time
for you to greet the Grand Queen Dowager.

365
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,791
The old bodyguard,
I wonder where he ran off to.

366
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,751
He was starting to grow on me.

367
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,753
Even though he seemed a bit off,

368
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,047
he was better than this guy.

369
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,594
CLOSED

370
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,347
Oh, one of the King's eunuch's
hanged himself. Did you hear?

371
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,642
Don't get me started on that.
He poisoned the late King's herbal tonic.

372
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,684
He did?

373
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,854
That's right. I've heard
the place is apparently haunted.

374
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,314
We should get going.

375
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,377
Did you have a good night's sleep,
Grandmother?

376
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,548
I heard you spent
last night with each other.

377
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,466
Did everything go well?

378
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,308
You are surprisingly blunt this morning.

379
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,854
I know you think it's just
an old nosy woman asking, but

380
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,606
the two of you know just how much I

381
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,110
would like to see
my great-grandson before I pass on.

382
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,945
I hope you understand.

383
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,284
Also, I heard that you're

384
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,163
sending Prince Wonsan
to relocate the placenta chamber.

385
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,416
I have to be honest,

386
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,543
thinking of Prince Jehyeon being banished

387
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,171
after losing his parents
at such a young age,

388
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,507
it keeps me awake
at all hours of the night.

389
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,386
Now that Prince Wonsan
is going to be so far away from here,

390
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,096
it's really quite strange.

391
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,767
I just feel burdened
by the whole situation.

392
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,063
I am very sorry, Grandmother.

393
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,065
Why do you think the Chief State Councilor

394
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,194
is so determined
to drive out my entire family?

395
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,779
Perhaps I have just…

396
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,283
simply lived for much too long.

397
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,805
Oh, well thank you.

398
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,158
Listen. We always send
the correct amount of rice to the armies.

399
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,619
Why does Hamgil Province
always tell us they got less?

400
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,290
Someone must be
secretly hoarding some of the rations.

401
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,252
Either that or someone decided
to load less rice so they could use

402
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,379
the ship for some other secret purpose.

403
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,589
It must be
the Minister of Taxation.

404
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,718
I mean, how many people have access
to cargo ships? It's not a lot.

405
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,261
Yes. Precisely.

406
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,722
Look, come here.

407
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,685
Inside his office,

408
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,021
he has a stationery chest that he adores.

409
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,148
And it's filled with demons.

410
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,274
The moment you open it--

411
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,986
Are you trying to ruin my life?

412
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,988
You want to gossip?
Then go outside and do it.

413
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,197
I do not want any part of it.

414
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,742
And why are you
discussing that here, anyhow?

415
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,619
Look who wants to live
a long life all of a sudden.

416
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,834
You two. You'd better watch your mouths.

417
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,545
The Minister of Taxation
is on Lord Sangheon's side.

418
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,341
Everyone in the royal court
is on Lord Sangheon's side.

419
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,303
When it comes to state affairs,
just pretend you're deaf and blind.

420
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,474
Unless you have extra lives,
you better watch your tongues.

421
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:16,354
The two of you are still pretty young.
Don't you want to work here a long time?

422
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,818
Scribe Jung.
These are for the Royal History Archive.

423
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,737
Go take them there.

424
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,825
Sure, I will be back.

425
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,095
-Wait right here for now.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,294
Your Majesty.

427
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,925
So how are things going in Yeoyeon?

428
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:15,639
As we expected, he's using cargo ships
to transport weapons.

429
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,144
My grandfather must have been using
the Minister of Taxation.

430
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,607
I'll look into it
and let you know what I dig up here.

431
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,235
Swear to me you'll be very careful.

432
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,864
If Lord Sangheon finds out,
you'll be in danger, Your Majesty.

433
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,870
Do not worry.
He will not be able to see this coming.

434
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,500
That man thinks
I'm nothing more than his puppet.

435
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,005
My grandfather is probably
still hiding the soldiers in Yeoyeon

436
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,966
so he can seize the palace
whenever he wants.

437
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,261
We have to find a way
to expose his private army however we can.

438
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,890
With that and the evidence
that he poisoned my father,

439
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,477
it should be more than enough
to take him down.

440
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,356
Did you find
Eunuch Cho's missing wife?

441
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,652
No, but I have been
asking around, so we'll find her soon.

442
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,573
I'm sure she knows something
about the poisoned tonic.

443
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,158
That's why she ran away.

444
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,828
-Please make sure to find her.
-I will, Your Majesty.

445
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,437
Wait a minute before you go.
It isn't safe yet.

446
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:51,026
Eunuch Hong, may I ask
what you're doing here at this hour?

447
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,031
Taking a walk. It's perfect outside.

448
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,451
And this area has a nice walking trail.

449
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,038
Say, why don't the lot of you
join me for a walk?

450
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,416
I'll show you something amazing.

451
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,626
-Come on. Let's go right now.
-Wait. We can't.

452
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,128
We're on patrol right now.

453
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,505
Come on. Why can't you go, huh?

454
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,465
Just follow me. I promise you'll like it.

455
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,761
You all work too hard, you know that?

456
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,471
So this part of the palace has a great…

457
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,063
You're doing something dangerous.

458
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,899
I heard that Lord Sangheon

459
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,736
banned Officer Yoon
from entering the palace for any reason.

460
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,616
Listen, I need you to forget…

461
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,286
everything you heard tonight.

462
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,581
And should I forget…

463
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,585
the look on your face too?

464
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,260
Let's go to your quarters.

465
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,971
And I will…

466
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,808
check your wound just once more.

467
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,502
You should be in the countryside.
So why are you here instead?

468
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,881
What about you?

469
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,218
I didn't know that you came here still.

470
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,939
From what I hear,
Lord Sangheon's shuddering all contact

471
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,358
between every region.

472
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,736
And he's been dismissing
anyone against him,

473
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,863
even locking away scholars.

474
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,282
How far do you think he's willing to go?

475
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,869
I don't know.
Why are you asking me that question?

476
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,668
Do you recall
what you told me here a long time ago?

477
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,212
Don't live lives

478
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,382
we would regret in our old age.

479
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,051
Tell me.

480
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,389
Have you ever regretted your decision?

481
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,268
Standing with Lord Sangheon

482
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,645
is a choice you're happy with then?

483
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,191
That's not something I chose.

484
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,653
That decision was made for me.

485
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,615
But you don't know anything about that.

486
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,247
People like you who were…

487
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,793
born into noble families,
got to make decisions.

488
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,504
In the end,
there was no other path to take.

489
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,007
So all I could do was walk it.

490
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,553
Even if I could do it all again,

491
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,805
if this is the only path that remains,

492
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,433
I would walk it again.

493
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,692
I will let you go tonight as a friend.

494
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,196
But I won't be able
to turn a blind eye the next time.

495
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,081
Fortunately,
there's no scar to worry about.

496
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,253
But please continue to apply ointment
until it's fully healed, Majesty.

497
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,257
I will. Thank you.

498
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,828
And please don't get hurt.

499
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,707
Again.

500
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,608
Thank you for everything you've done.

501
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,569
Don't mention it.

502
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,782
It still should be looked at once every
couple of days, just so you can be sure.

503
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,308
-Oh, Ji-un.
-Hyun.

504
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,817
You and I need to talk.

505
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:15,786
It's been a while since we've had drinks,
just you and me like this.

506
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,331
It has.

507
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,054
I know you asked
your father to get you a position

508
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,889
because of His Majesty.

509
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,852
I was relieved
that you treated His Majesty's injury.

510
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:45,023
After all, you are
the only person I can trust in the palace.

511
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,782
Did you know
the King's secret the whole time too?

512
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,049
There was that one-sided love I had.

513
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,552
You asked me who it was,

514
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,470
how come I didn't go after her.

515
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,809
It's His Majesty.

516
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,815
I have also wanted someone
that I could never have.

517
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,445
I couldn't show my affection
and had to suppress my feelings

518
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,196
so no one could suspect I had any.

519
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,368
I couldn't get close to her at all,
even if I wanted to.

520
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,120
And had I,

521
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,582
I'd have made things dangerous.

522
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,503
What I had were just feelings.

523
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,548
Yet those feelings…

524
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,468
could end up hurting her instead.

525
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,934
And so, that's why
I watched her for so long.

526
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,062
I told no one.

527
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,439
And that includes you.

528
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,900
I had to keep it to myself.

529
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,403
-Hyun.
-But that is the price paid

530
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,364
for having a love… you shouldn't have.

531
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,617
So…

532
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:23,038
if you really have
the same feelings that I do,

533
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,123
then I hope that

534
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,168
you'll put an end to it, before it hurts.

535
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,975
Ji-un you are… the person
that I can trust the most in this world,

536
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,979
and His Majesty is the only person
I'd sacrifice my life for.

537
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,315
I will lose my mind

538
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,235
if anything happens to His Majesty.

539
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,513
It's the same for me, Hyun.

540
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:09,686
His Majesty has become my whole world now.

541
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,956
Did the cargo ship leave
for Hamgil Province?

542
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,874
Yes.

543
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,626
I loaded everything you asked for

544
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,628
and, as you instructed,
shipped them there.

545
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:48,516
As we expected, he's using cargo ships
to transport weapons.

546
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,105
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

547
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,068
What is this you've brought?

548
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:01,029
Well, that… that… that's the…

549
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,405
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

550
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,740
This is…

551
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,875
It's the daily log of the ship
that sends the army's rice.

552
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,795
What are you doing with this?

553
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,923
The manifest of the cargo
entering and leaving

554
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,008
Hamgil Province is inconsistent.

555
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,011
I… I saw a big discrepancy
between the amount of rice

556
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,097
listed in the ledger
and the documented records.

557
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,689
As someone who served
as your former royal tutor,

558
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,982
I thought you needed to know,

559
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,192
so I decided that
I would take this task upon myself.

560
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,661
I'll be taking my leave now, Your Majesty.

561
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,269
Did you deliver it?

562
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,858
Could you hear it?
I thought my heart would explode in there.

563
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,861
I was always afraid of His Majesty,
even when I was his tutor.

564
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,404
How could you ask this of me, huh?

565
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,423
Do you have extra lives or something?

566
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,258
I thought that
you were done acting virtuous.

567
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,927
That's why I confided in you
about the Minister's corruption.

568
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:52,140
Why did you steal
the ledger so foolishly? Really.

569
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,977
You're certain
nothing will happen to me, right?

570
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,520
Yes, don't worry.

571
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,273
It will get dealt with by His Majesty.

572
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,942
If this was so important to His Majesty,

573
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,403
why didn't you give it to him
instead of me?

574
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,616
I made a promise, and it's one
I intend on keeping as well.

575
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,787
I need to know I can trust you.
Please keep this secret for me.

576
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,667
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

577
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,988
Commander Jung. To what do I owe
such a visit at this hour?

578
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,949
A long time ago,

579
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,244
I heard there was a way to use acupuncture

580
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,372
to momentarily stop someone's breathing.

581
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,127
Is that possible or not?

582
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,336
Sorry?

583
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:15,432
Everything is done. I made sure
that Officer Yoon got the ledger safely.

584
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,893
That's great to hear.

585
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,522
But may I ask
why you seem so down, Your Majesty?

586
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,691
Did something happen this afternoon?

587
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,152
No, nothing.

588
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,197
There's a lot to think about now.
I just want to walk in peace.

589
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,034
Should I escort you to your usual path?

590
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,664
I'll be all right. Nobody ever goes there.

591
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,709
But it can be dangerous at night.

592
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,550
Huh?

593
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,059
What? Who on earth
put these lanterns here?

594
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,020
Wow.

595
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,233
I mean, who would…

596
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,656
Wow.

597
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,744
Goodness. All these lanterns…

598
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,461
You're here.

599
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:31,359
So then, why did you light the lanterns?

600
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,531
If you were to trip and fall,
then you would be hurt.

601
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,242
So I decided

602
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,203
that I would light the way for you,

603
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,165
since you always choose the unsafe path.

604
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,822
The wound I had…

605
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,911
it's healed completely.

606
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,957
Yes, you're right.

607
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,464
It's all healed now.

608
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:55,652
Well, I can't be certain,
but a pulse, they say, could be stopped

609
01:00:56,235 --> 01:01:00,323
by blocking the acupuncture point
on the back of the neck.

610
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,509
I know that I'm healed…

611
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,307
but you can stay
a bit longer at the palace.

612
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,395
If it is all right with you…

613
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,732
I would like…

614
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,656
to be here with you for a little longer.

615
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,216
I've been waiting to hear that.

616
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,552
I mean it.

617
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,932
Had you taken any longer…

618
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,698
Actually…

619
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,909
I would have waited anyway.

620
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,539
As long as it took.

621
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,860
His Majesty is so handsome.

622
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,778
You must have been very tired.

623
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,447
Are you actually jealous right now?

624
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,284
You swore
that you wouldn't get angry with me.

625
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,618
Was Dam-i her name?

626
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,412
Did you meet her when you returned?

627
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:38,374
I am the assassin
who attacked you at the royal hunting.

628
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,792
What is it that you saw?

629
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,295
You are sure
that it's the only way?

630
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:46,382
That's why I can never
forgive even a single mistake.
