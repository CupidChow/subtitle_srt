1
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,874
I'm late. Darn it.

2
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,975
Your Highness.

3
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,604
Where has your mind wandered off to?

4
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,107
You couldn't hear me
even when I tried to get your attention.

5
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,567
Hmm.

6
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm going to be late.

7
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,405
I should go if we're done.

8
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,374
Did you enjoy your drinks last night?

9
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,294
How could you have let him accompany you
instead of me?

10
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,755
I must say I felt left out.

11
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,089
Don't feel that way.

12
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,008
Next time I'll include you, all right?

13
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,092
Thank you, Your Highness.

14
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,555
-Who's conducting the lecture today?
-I heard it's Tutor Jung.

15
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,556
Oh.

16
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,809
Oh, dear.

17
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,729
Your Highness, is something wrong?

18
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,109
Not at all.

19
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,029
Five steps, remember?

20
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,785
EPISODE 9

21
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,451
Why did I do such a crazy thing?

22
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,288
I blame all the alcohol.

23
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,082
Why did I have to drink so much?

24
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,959
Why aren't you heading inside?

25
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,504
Oh, uh…

26
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,215
I was enjoying the fine weather

27
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,384
and all these beautiful flowers.

28
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
Royal Tutor Jung is here, Your Highness.

29
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,275
NONEO

30
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,695
THE MASTER SAID…

31
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,294
Last evening--

32
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,629
I deserve to die, Your Highness.

33
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,924
Uh, I'm afraid alcohol
got the better of me

34
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,927
which led to an unforgivable act
on my part.

35
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,889
I seek your forgiveness, Your Highness.

36
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,266
Oh…

37
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,854
Yes. I understand.

38
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,191
Yes?

39
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,236
Well, that's how it is with alcohol,
don't you agree?

40
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,407
Everyone makes a drunken mistake
at least once in their lives.

41
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,036
So don't be too concerned about it.
We can…

42
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,830
just agree to laugh it off.

43
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,421
Of course.

44
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,343
You're such a generous man
who understands the effects of alcohol.

45
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,887
I'm not usually one to make such mistakes,

46
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,098
I don't know what came over me.

47
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,769
You just seem so stunning and beautiful
under the moonlight and I…

48
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,270
Uh…

49
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,565
Uh…

50
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,861
No… Uh, I…

51
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,072
That isn't what I meant.

52
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,120
Also,

53
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,624
I have something for you,
Royal Tutor Jung.

54
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,554
They are candies.

55
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,307
I hope it is the right amount
of sweetness for your liking.

56
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,686
Why would you give me this?

57
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,314
You went through a great deal
regarding the envoys.

58
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,194
I seem to only be receiving your help,
which is why I prepared a gift.

59
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,282
I hope that it suits your palate.

60
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,484
Oh! I see you're back, Royal Tutor Jung.

61
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,865
Did you get yours?

62
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,576
Get mine? Get what?

63
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,540
Uh…

64
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,795
Oh, good. He did. You got one too.

65
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,049
This is what His Royal Highness said
as he handed it to me.

66
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,261
"You went through a great deal
regarding the envoys.

67
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,349
I seem to only be receiving your help
which is why I prepared a gift."

68
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,353
How benevolent is that?

69
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,563
His eyes were warm,
and when he said he hoped

70
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,482
I'd enjoy the candies, so sweet.

71
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,027
He was also concerned
that they may be too sweet for me.

72
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,696
He is extremely considerate.

73
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,241
Ah! The first in 20 years.

74
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,035
The first time in 20 years
my hard work was acknowledged.

75
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,453
I can finally understand

76
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,331
why you broke out into a speech
to give him high praise.

77
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,294
The sweetness is perfect. Mm.

78
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,213
Hmm. Mine's bitter.
Could it be bellflower?

79
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,791
Everyone's been dismissed at home,
you do not need to be concerned.

80
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,147
I'm curious
as to what brings you by, Your Majesty.

81
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,816
Lord Changcheon.

82
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,568
Yes?

83
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,322
Using the Ming envoy as his leverage,

84
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,741
Lord Sangheon now has
development rights at Yeoyeon.

85
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,786
What do you suppose
its function will be now?

86
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,623
I don't quite follow.

87
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,043
Yeoyeon is constantly invaded
by barbarians.

88
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,796
So under the pretense of tighter security,

89
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,466
he will try and grow his army there.

90
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,552
Then what--

91
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,264
Build an army of your own.
We need a force that can match his.

92
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,892
You…

93
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,062
will have my full support.

94
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,774
Your Majesty!

95
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,200
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

96
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,743
Yeong-ji, eat up.

97
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,372
Mm. Oh!

98
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,790
-Mmm.
-Oh…

99
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,795
-Why have you been so out of it?
-Huh?

100
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,882
Aren't you gonna have any?
We'll happily finish them.

101
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,804
Sure. Go ahead.

102
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,390
Don't be like that. Come eat with us.

103
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,935
They are from His Royal Highness.
We feel bad eating them alone.

104
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,603
She's right. Have some. Come on. Mm?

105
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,689
What?

106
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,107
Listen.

107
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,861
Forget it.

108
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,614
What is it?

109
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,909
Don't just keep it to yourself.
Come on, tell us.

110
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,285
Well…

111
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,667
So it's like this.

112
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,503
A guy I know drank too much

113
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,215
and kissed the person
sitting next to him on the cheek.

114
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,761
The person that he kissed didn't seem like
they were fazed in the least.

115
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,267
But the person who kissed them, they're
mad with how the other person reacted.

116
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,019
They basically acted like
nothing happened.

117
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,150
And, uh, turns out
he wasn't the only one that

118
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,195
the person had showered
with kindness and generosity.

119
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,783
And that upset him too.

120
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,829
Can, can you tell me
what you think that is?

121
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,080
Really?

122
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,499
Hang on. So who is this?

123
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,252
Are you talking about you
or someone else you know?

124
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,963
Of course it's someone else I know.

125
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,882
Does that someone…

126
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,633
like the one they kissed?

127
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,803
-What?
-Isn't that what provokes jealousy?

128
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,348
You want that person
to only have eyes for you,

129
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,517
and you get upset
when they don't realize it.

130
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,729
With expectation comes disappointment.

131
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,024
No way.

132
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,486
I doubt it.

133
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,526
From what I hear,

134
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,362
His Majesty left the palace last night

135
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,073
and wasn't back even at the end of curfew.

136
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,995
Eunuch Cho, as the servant
he trusts most of all,

137
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,705
I think you'd know why.

138
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,707
I have no idea what you're saying.

139
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,961
His Majesty decided to retire
to his chambers early last night.

140
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,381
He went to bed and didn't set foot outside
all of last night.

141
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,553
Again, you choose to play dumb?

142
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,889
Why do you keep doing this to me?

143
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,393
Don't you know that I'm a loyal servant
dedicated to His Majesty?

144
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,523
Ten years ago,

145
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,234
you came here to me in tears

146
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,904
begging me to save your dying wife.

147
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,780
Did you forget about that?

148
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:11,327
I do believe that I have already
paid that debt back in full.

149
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,163
Yes, quite handsomely, I might add.

150
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,750
And if you hadn't done as I asked,

151
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,547
and gone in to plant that letter
in Preceptor Kang's house back then,

152
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,551
then I couldn't have eliminated
His Majesty's loyal followers like I did.

153
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,471
And if he should ever find out about it,

154
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,310
I know he would really be so touched
by that show of loyalty.

155
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,899
Why not just tell me to go pay
that debt off with my life?

156
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,319
Stop this.
I'd be happy to do that instead.

157
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,238
Ah, your life?

158
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,327
You should hold onto that
for the sake of His Majesty.

159
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,862
Tutor Jung.

160
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,783
You okay? What's wrong?
You, you're not feeling well?

161
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,827
I'm okay. I…

162
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,454
It's nothing. No, it's nothing.

163
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,125
Oh, no. I hardly think that's the case.
Your skin is flushed.

164
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,335
How, how do you feel?
Describe your symptoms.

165
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,545
Tell me.

166
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,092
Well, well, it feels like…

167
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,178
There's something…

168
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,557
squeezing hard deep in my chest.

169
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,561
And every single day,
I can feel my heart just pounding.

170
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,104
Just like that.

171
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,734
And I feel unfocused.
And I can't even think straight.

172
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,779
Wait. They sound like the symptoms
I came across in a book.

173
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,824
Really? Then what is he suffering from?
Tell us, please.

174
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,411
You're blushing a lot,
but you can't control it,

175
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,664
and your mood swings
back and forth from excited

176
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,666
to suddenly depressed, doesn't it?

177
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,462
You've been seeing and hearing
strange things as well,

178
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,965
and a certain someone is endlessly
haunting all your dreams at night.

179
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,258
-Is that the case?
-Yes!

180
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,635
You're exactly right!

181
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,180
-Yes, sir. I knew it.
-What is it?

182
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,723
You are lovesick!

183
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,933
Wait, what?

184
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,063
Who is it? Who is the young lady
who's been driving you crazy?

185
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,109
There's no young lady.

186
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,527
That, that can't be it. No way.

187
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,363
Come on. There's no need
to be embarrassed.

188
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,657
-Now come on, give us a name--
-Uh, hold on!

189
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,953
Uh… I forgot I need something
from the library so I better get going.

190
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,205
Hey, hold on!

191
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,873
-Royal Tutor Jung.
-Tutor Jung!

192
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,249
Tutor Jung!

193
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,002
I'm sure I'm right.

194
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,879
Who is it?

195
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,172
Any ideas?

196
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,770
Hey, Ji-un!

197
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,856
You look terrible.
Is something wrong with you?

198
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,110
Uh, it's nothing.

199
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,904
I'm all right.
I'm fine, I'm good. I'm totally fine.

200
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,156
I'm fine.

201
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,201
Yeah, right. Huh! You're unbelievable.

202
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,329
Oh, uh…

203
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,373
Take a look there, huh?

204
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,709
They're the dancers
for the upcoming banquet,

205
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,380
and they've had all the men
within the palace gawking at them.

206
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,264
No way!

207
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,100
No way.

208
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,520
No, it can't be. Nah-uh. It can't.

209
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,022
What do you mean?

210
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,232
What's up with him?

211
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,704
No way.

212
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,542
Find inner peace.
Just read a book or something.

213
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,843
Okay, let's see.

214
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,127
Why do I keep seeing…

215
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
What--

216
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,138
Why do you keep appearing?

217
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,807
Leave.

218
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,767
Go away!

219
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,103
Go. Go.

220
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,480
Have you lost your mind?

221
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,365
Is… Is it really you, Your Highness?

222
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,123
What brings you here?

223
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,418
What do you think?
I was trying to find a book.

224
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,130
Ah.

225
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,299
I see.

226
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,050
So.

227
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,929
Did you get a chance
to try the candies I gave you?

228
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,764
I hope they were to your liking.

229
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,979
Yes. Yes, um, uh…

230
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,939
They tasted great.

231
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,400
Hmm.

232
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,319
I'm glad.

233
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,216
Uh, I…

234
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,262
Uh, please forgive me, Your Highness.

235
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,891
I'm not feeling well and must excuse
myself, I'm sorry. So sorry.

236
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,396
Go ahead. You can go first.

237
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,856
Oh, uh, right.

238
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,529
What's with Tutor Jung?

239
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,698
Anyway, here are your books.

240
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,577
Where could my daughter be going

241
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,455
after dolling herself up this beautifully?

242
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,456
Do I look pretty?

243
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,667
I didn't recognize you at first.

244
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,795
I thought a heavenly angel
had come to our house.

245
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,923
Hey. Come on, Dad. Will you stop?

246
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,886
Now that you mention it, though,
I see a resemblance.

247
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,143
My lady,

248
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,521
Lady So-eun has arrived.

249
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,440
She's here?

250
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,739
Not so fast.

251
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,741
So-eun!

252
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,413
Goodness, are you all right?

253
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,542
Not a second goes by
without me worrying about you.

254
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,755
You're early.

255
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,300
-Ready to go?
-Mm-hm.

256
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,220
Where exactly are you going
that has her this excited?

257
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,848
I'm going to the palace
to run an errand for my father,

258
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,142
-and Ha-gyeong wanted to join me.
-The palace?

259
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,060
We're going now, Dad.

260
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,858
Be sure to stay close to So-eun
and don't go wandering off.

261
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,318
Do you hear me?

262
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,407
Wow, this is amazing.

263
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,826
I wonder what it'd be like to live here.

264
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,995
GEUNJEONGJEON

265
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,872
Could you wait for me out here?

266
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,625
I'll take this in to my father
and come right back out. Okay?

267
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,127
Mm-hm. Don't worry, you can go on in.

268
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,262
Who are those two young ladies?

269
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,389
I don't recognize their faces.

270
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,435
Ah. One is the daughter
of the Minister of Personnel,

271
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,396
the other is the daughter
of the Minister of War.

272
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,704
Uh…

273
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,157
You seem to be from a noble family.

274
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,576
Why are you here in the palace alone?

275
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,997
Oh, I just followed the scent of flowers.

276
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,541
There is nothing for you to see here,

277
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,668
so perhaps you should go.

278
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,724
Your Highness.

279
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,187
The Queen Dowager requests your presence.

280
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,314
-The Queen Dowager?
-Yes.

281
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,075
Your Highness?

282
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,202
He's the Crown Prince?

283
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,721
I don't believe it.

284
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,355
Selecting a princess?

285
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,582
I thought we were done speaking of this.

286
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,838
As things are now,
I stand by what I said about this matter.

287
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,716
The Crown Prince is still unwell.

288
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,551
We'll revisit the idea another time.

289
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:44,097
How long will you allow others to question
the weight of the crown upon his head?

290
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,226
We must hold a royal marriage,
so he can produce an heir.

291
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,563
This can't be postponed any longer.

292
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,157
Commander Yoon accompanied him

293
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,659
while on a trip
to visit his father-in-law.

294
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,079
That is all. That is all I know.

295
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,374
Crown Prince, what is your opinion?

296
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,711
Is marriage what you desire?

297
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,178
The envoy reception has only just ended.

298
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,514
Another large event
such as a royal wedding would just be

299
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,976
an undue burden to put upon our people.

300
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,730
Please be more considerate of them.

301
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,484
Could we wait a little to start making
our plans for this wedding?

302
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,366
Regarding the selection of a princess,

303
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,205
I ask for a bit of patience with that
until I readdress this matter.

304
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,334
Is it because…

305
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:03,343
you have in fact already made up your mind
to pass on the crown to Prince Jehyeon?

306
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,221
If you tell me that is not
the situation here,

307
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,225
then why are you in constant opposition
to His Royal Highness' marriage?

308
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,061
Lord Sangheon,
I suggest you watch your words.

309
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:17,524
You were already married
and a father to the Crown Prince as well

310
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,777
when you were the age he is now.

311
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,323
If it's the people
that Your Majesty wishes to please,

312
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,827
then a royal marriage and the birth
of an heir is a priority.

313
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,664
The people and all the members
of the royal court

314
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,252
are eagerly awaiting
His Royal Highness' wedding.

315
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,881
That is enough.

316
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,301
The princess selection

317
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,263
has always been done
by the ladies of the royal palace.

318
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,557
I will take matters into my own hands.

319
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,191
JAGYEONGJEON

320
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,418
I'm returning to my quarters.

321
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,813
Is something wrong, Your Majesty?

322
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:41,983
It's nothing.

323
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,145
What should we do,
Your Highness?

324
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,190
The Queen Dowager
is clearly adamant regarding this matter

325
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,902
which means it's not possible
to postpone your marriage.

326
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,072
Fear not, Your Highness.

327
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,700
You've been preparing
for what you know is inevitable.

328
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,994
You know what to do.

329
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,958
You will take the hand
of your betrothed and clasp it like so.

330
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,755
And say, "Now…
Now my heart belongs to you."

331
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,340
I'd rather just be alone.

332
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,759
Please leave me now.

333
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,971
-Yes.
-Mm-hm.

334
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,105
This would definitely work.

335
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,037
The Crown Prince?

336
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,039
That's what I said.

337
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,210
You should have seen the amazing way

338
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,088
he took me by the waist
to stop me from falling.

339
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,174
I wonder if this could be destiny calling.

340
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,638
Nah. I have a new goal.

341
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,017
You will see,
I'm going to be the Crown Princess.

342
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,518
I will.

343
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:47,984
Oh, Jan-i.

344
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,696
I'll get going then.

345
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,991
And make sure you get back, okay?

346
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,202
Don't get destructed on the way there,
Crown Princess-to-be.

347
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,539
Crown Princess-to-be? Stop that.

348
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,291
Take care.

349
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,717
Lady So-eun!

350
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,514
Ooh.

351
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,518
Oh! Oh!

352
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,270
No.

353
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,438
-How could this be?
-What…

354
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,441
Forgive me, my lord. Are you all right?

355
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,610
Are you kidding me?

356
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,280
S-Sorry, my lord.
Let me wipe it clean, please.

357
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,240
Stop that, you dirty wench.

358
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,034
Hey, you, come here.

359
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,495
How dare you lay your hands on me?

360
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,375
Jan-i, are you all right?

361
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,502
My lady.

362
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,587
What do you think you're doing?

363
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,632
What? What am I doing?

364
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,258
Really?

365
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,678
Talk about having a lousy day.

366
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,233
Hmm. I'm glad.

367
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,646
Let me apologize for the trouble
that my maid has caused you.

368
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,650
I truly hope that my apology
is enough to appease you.

369
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,695
Compensation will be made
for your ruined clothes.

370
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,739
Sure. Do I look like I need money?

371
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,782
Do I?

372
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,245
How exactly will you pay me back, huh?

373
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,333
With that sweet little face of yours, huh?

374
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,377
Please stop making trouble.

375
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,299
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to, you crazy wench?

376
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,554
Who are you?

377
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,683
Lord Jung?

378
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,019
Hey…

379
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,980
Let go of my hand. Drop it.

380
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,276
We have spectators, Lord Changun.

381
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,986
Please be careful.

382
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,073
Do you have any idea who I am?

383
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,951
Hey.

384
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,662
Aah…

385
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,124
I know you. You're the tutor
for the Crown Prince, huh?

386
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,460
Did being in his good graces
make you think

387
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,421
you have some sort of authority, huh?

388
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,175
Who are you to give me orders
and tell me to be careful?

389
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,720
You must have a death wish today, huh?

390
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,097
Let's make it come true. Huh?

391
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,943
Hasn't your house arrest
only recently been lifted?

392
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,989
Causing trouble will only put you
in a bad position.

393
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,119
Yeah, you… you brazen rat.

394
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,372
You think you're brave, huh?

395
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,041
Push your luck again, huh?

396
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,001
I dare you. Huh?

397
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,586
That's enough.

398
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,845
You are out of line.

399
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,848
How dare you block the path
of the royal family?

400
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,353
Yeah. This is quite the party
we are having. Right?

401
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,275
Uncle, you should also show dignity
as a member of the royal family.

402
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,859
I'm glad you mentioned that.

403
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,737
That's why I need to teach these lowlifes

404
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,740
about the custom and order
of our class system.

405
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,536
So stay out of my way today. Huh?

406
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,913
Here.

407
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:20,298
I specifically told you
you've done enough for today.

408
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,514
Goddamn it!

409
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,434
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

410
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,355
You may take her home now.

411
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,286
Hey there, nephew,
you made a huge mistake today.

412
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,289
You stopped me from teaching
those lowlifes a lesson.

413
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,292
You stood in my way
with everybody here watching.

414
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,837
You're the one who almost made
a huge mistake here.

415
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,883
She's the Minister of Personnel's
daughter.

416
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,594
It'd be unwise to create complications.

417
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,887
What?

418
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,473
Oh, damn it.

419
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,768
Why are they all chummy
and friendly anyway?

420
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,562
Has marriage been suggested between them?

421
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,301
You might have been hurt, my lord.
Why did you just intervene?

422
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,931
The fact that it was dangerous
is why I took action.

423
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,646
I see a different side to you
every time we meet, Lord Jung.

424
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:04,568
And I'm very curious to discover
what else do you have to offer.

425
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,367
Expressing my gratitude
with words is not enough.

426
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,163
Jan-i… really she's almost like my sister.
I care for her.

427
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,795
You've been through a lot today,
so please get some rest.

428
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,091
Jan-i, don't feel too bad about it.
Get some rest as well.

429
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,956
I hear you had an audience
with the Queen Dowager.

430
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,838
Being a Crown Prince

431
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,508
can feel a little bit futile at times.

432
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,428
One must accept a loveless marriage

433
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,889
just because it's an affair of the state.

434
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,018
But maybe…

435
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,354
could you perhaps put in a word for me?

436
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,735
You could petition that the wedding
be postponed for your cousin's sake.

437
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,030
I'd like to take advantage
of your influence for once.

438
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,282
Your Highness…

439
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,998
I was only making a joke.

440
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,543
There's no need to take it so seriously.

441
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,756
It's impossible to joke
or kid around with you, you know?

442
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,773
Do you mind…

443
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,067
if I ask you something?

444
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:19,411
Your Highness, have… have you ever been
in love with someone?

445
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,039
W-What?

446
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,213
Hyun, don't be silly.

447
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,760
Here you are insisting
on making fun of a groom-to-be.

448
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,848
That's why I'm asking.

449
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,894
Have you ever had
romantic feelings for anyone?

450
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,856
You've never mentioned it before.

451
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,413
Of course, there was somebody once.

452
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,920
It was back when I was young.

453
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,009
One day there was a scuffle at the palace

454
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,095
that led to us falling into a pond.

455
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,724
I was the only one who could swim

456
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,643
so I saved the young child.

457
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,490
"Yeon-seon"?

458
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,534
Dam-i is a pretty great name,

459
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,788
but I wanted to give a name to you
that is more meaningful.

460
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,169
Although it was a brief encounter,

461
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,130
it's still a memory…

462
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,009
I haven't been able to forget.

463
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,012
I suppose that…

464
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,684
you could say that child
was my first love.

465
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,441
Tutor Jung?

466
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,860
Uh…

467
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:02,157
What brings you here to the palace
this early in the morning?

468
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,204
I have a favor to ask, Your Highness.

469
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,875
Just this once…

470
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,463
would you give me a hug?

471
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,008
What?

472
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,390
Uh, Royal Tutor Jung, are you feeling ill?

473
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,101
Yes, I'm unwell. It's true.

474
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,938
I'm a mess, you see.

475
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,816
So please…

476
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,944
Indulge me this once.

477
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,867
You're obviously not thinking clearly.
How could you ask him that?

478
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,203
Here. Let me embrace you instead.

479
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,126
I hope you find strength,

480
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,420
Tutor Jung.

481
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,990
Do you feel better now?

482
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,164
Come on, let's go.

483
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,483
Why on earth did you do that,
Your Royal Highness?

484
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,111
How could you have granted
that ridiculous request?

485
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,446
There were people there that saw you both.

486
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,616
He said he's a mess and he's under stress.

487
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,703
Exactly! How could he
ask a favor for such reasons,

488
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,830
and how could you indulge him like that?

489
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,791
Why the two of you acted in that matter,

490
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,585
I just can't comprehend why!

491
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,589
Because I like him, that's why.

492
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,466
Liking Tutor Jung is one thing but…

493
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,385
Oh, dear.

494
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,470
Really?

495
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,975
They're forcing the royal wedding…

496
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,230
so I should be allowed
to do that while I can.

497
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:21,940
Agreed?

498
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,568
Your Royal Highness!

499
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,279
Don't you worry…

500
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,032
I'll soon lose these feelings.

501
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,080
Did you hear about
the upcoming princess selection?

502
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,998
Ah, a princess selection.

503
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:27,631
Is our Crown Prince finally growing up
and entering adulthood? Ooh!

504
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,801
You'll soon be busy
once the princess selection begins.

505
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,345
-Of course.
-What did you just say?

506
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,889
A princess selection?

507
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,558
The Crown Prince is getting married?

508
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,852
Why are you surprised by this?

509
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,481
His Royal Highness
is at the marrying age, isn't he?

510
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,733
Yes, of course.

511
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,194
This will excite maidens
across the country.

512
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,700
His Royal Highness is aloof and cold,
but he is quite handsome.

513
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,535
You bet he's handsome.
Just like me.

514
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,788
Royal Scholar Yang,
you have the face of a jester.

515
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,914
A jester, you say?

516
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,624
A jester…

517
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,808
So are you still feeling unwell?

518
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,020
If that's the case, then the lecture--

519
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,272
I hear a wedding is imminent.

520
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,442
Oh…

521
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,404
Yes.

522
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,908
It's taking longer than anyone thought.

523
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,369
It's time it finally happened.

524
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,540
Congratulations, Your Highness.

525
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,753
I'm happy to hear such great news.

526
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,384
I appreciate it, Tutor Jung.

527
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,055
Please let me know if I can be of help

528
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,765
in any way to assist you.

529
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,770
I doubt you'll find anybody
with more knowledge regarding women.

530
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,565
I'll consider it.

531
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,944
Once we start the process,

532
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,073
I will look forward to your help with it.

533
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,485
Well…

534
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,697
I know that
it couldn't have gone anywhere.

535
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,700
What could come

536
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,953
of caring for…

537
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,668
a man who is the Crown Prince
with a wedding underway?

538
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,589
Get a grip on yourself, Ji-un. Get a grip.

539
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,259
Get a grip.

540
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,223
What's with the serious look on your face?

541
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,309
You came.

542
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,854
How are wedding preparations going?

543
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,043
That one-sided love you mentioned once,

544
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,753
why didn't you confess?

545
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,803
Because I thought the feelings
would never be returned.

546
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,142
And I was worried that telling her
would put distance between us.

547
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,480
You should have told her, though.

548
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,567
Who knows how people will react?

549
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,739
Maybe I should have.

550
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,785
Actually,

551
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,829
that's pretty rare.

552
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,292
For two people to feel like that,
you don't see that a lot.

553
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,046
So I'd rather stay quiet.

554
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,423
I won't burden her…

555
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,134
or regret my choice.

556
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,262
That's how it'll be.

557
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,811
That sounds a bit corny, Lord Jaeun.

558
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,857
What? That's what you say when I open up?

559
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,443
How dare you!

560
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,282
You did that on purpose
knowing I'm afraid of water.

561
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,576
Okay. Come on, I'll stop it.

562
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,334
Hold on a second.

563
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,921
Didn't you fall into the palace pond
when you were younger?

564
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,799
I told you many times before.

565
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,051
On the banquet day, when I met Dam-i.

566
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,345
She actually saved my life.

567
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,559
One day there was a scuffle at the palace

568
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,229
that led to us falling into a pond.

569
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,441
I was the only one who could swim,

570
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,360
so I saved the young child.

571
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,530
That's right.
When did the girl disappear again?

572
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,449
What makes you ask now?

573
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,288
She was an orphan taken in by monks
who came to stay at the palace.

574
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,709
-I have to get going.
-Huh?

575
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,919
Hyun!

576
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,155
Where did they go?

577
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,332
Oh.

578
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:51,765
NOKUNGAK

579
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,595
WAIT

580
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,307
LONGING, WAIT

581
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,440
REST, STAY

582
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,028
It wasn't…

583
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,449
just a dream.

584
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,440
That was… uh…

585
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,025
I…

586
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:30,029
The… The alcohol must have gotten
the better of me.

587
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,366
For… Forgive me, Your Highness.

588
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,118
Please forgive me.

589
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,787
It's all right.

590
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:43,042
It seems as though
I've become quite approachable to you.

591
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,212
Uh… Well, uh, that's not what it is.

592
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,358
Those things in your hand…

593
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,153
What?

594
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,489
Do you think you'd mind
if I gave it a look?

595
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,494
Oh…

596
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,652
She said to give these to you
if I ever met you.

597
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,779
She told me

598
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,949
they would help you stay strong…

599
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,409
when things get hard

600
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,954
just like they had been helpful for her.

601
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,806
For a long time, I wondered about…

602
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,811
the man you came to be.

603
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,367
LONGING, WAIT

604
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,103
NOT

605
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,680
WAIT

606
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,811
I thought I dreamed it.

607
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,356
I believed my impure feelings for you

608
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,609
had begun to haunt my days now.

609
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,488
But, no…

610
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,494
it wasn't…

611
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,164
STAY, LONGING

612
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,915
…just a dream, though.

613
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,463
I'll believe you if you tell me that

614
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,175
the feelings were momentary, but…

615
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,554
they aren't for me.

616
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,640
It's not regard from your subject.

617
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,768
I thought it was my loyalty to you.

618
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,562
Instead, it was my affection.

619
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,486
Deep affection, Your Highness.

620
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,283
Although you're a man
and also the Crown Prince of this nation,

621
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:09,952
I know…

622
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,542
I'm in love with you.

623
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,170
What do you mean
His Highness isn't at the palace?

624
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:05,007
I'm sure he knows that the Queen Dowager
is coming this afternoon.

625
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:10,513
So His Majesty finally
gave his blessing for the royal marriage?

626
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,266
You are So-eun,
the daughter of the Minister of Personnel?

627
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,600
I will endure it.

628
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,770
Whatever people might say,
I will endure it all.

629
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:23,317
Maybe, everything would have been
better if we had never met again.

630
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,195
Are you ordering me to leave?
