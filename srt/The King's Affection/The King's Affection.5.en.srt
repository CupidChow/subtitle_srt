1
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,562
You never had
to tie it yourself before.

2
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,815
Please stay still for a moment.

3
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,882
How dare you!

4
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:15,927
Hyun?

5
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,304
Jung Ji-un?

6
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,265
What are you doing here?

7
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,016
Wait.

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,353
Do you two know one another?

9
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,438
Ah…

10
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,607
Well…

11
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,695
We're… we're good friends.

12
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,864
Very good friends, actually.

13
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,825
Wait, you are?

14
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,203
How are you finding your new lecturer?

15
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,331
He is sly and always looks for shortcuts.

16
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,543
He's more interested
in just talking his way out of everything.

17
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,129
To befriend someone like that man

18
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,714
is a proof of ignorance.

19
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,883
Uh…

20
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,890
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were friends earlier?

21
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,474
If I'd known, I…

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,727
Forgive me.

23
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,355
I just didn't want to burden you.
Please don't be upset.

24
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,193
The two of you didn't…

25
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,697
talk about me behind my back now, did you?

26
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,159
Only a guilty person would ask about that.

27
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,413
Hardly. It seems like Your Royal Highness
is more guilt-ridden than anyone.

28
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,498
What did you say?

29
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,666
That's enough, you two.

30
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,343
Lord Jaeun, it seems as though
you were in quite the hurry.

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,262
This one doesn't even have
a string of beads.

32
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,098
Which means that…

33
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,060
it should be reserved for someone like me

34
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,479
who looks good in anything.

35
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,282
Wait. That book…

36
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,578
It's the one I asked
Royal Scholar Yang to transcribe.

37
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,622
I don't understand, why do you have it?

38
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,374
Actually, this one's mine.

39
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,125
Sure it is. Come on, hand it over.

40
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,086
Why should I? I told you it's mine.

41
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,379
Hand it over now.

42
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,506
You already have one.
Why do you need mine?

43
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,632
I just want to check.

44
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,343
Ah, there's nothing to check.
I'm serious, this is my copy.

45
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,096
-It's, uh…
-Are you really using him for cover?

46
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,266
-Of course not. I have nothing to hide.
-Your Royal Highness!

47
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,185
What on earth?

48
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,022
Looks like work is catching up to you.
Have fun, you two.

49
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,525
But wait… Hold on. I…

50
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,494
Oh! So…

51
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,621
this is where you decided to run off to?

52
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,208
Do you have any idea
how worried I was about you?

53
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,585
Let me ask you something.

54
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,505
Why weren't you by His Royal Highness'
side to protect him?

55
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,173
Well, I just, uh…

56
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,466
Sorry, my lord.

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,094
Uh…

58
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,499
EPISODE 5

59
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,093
I wish you weren't so close.

60
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,304
Well, I don't know
if you'll run off again.

61
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,058
We're at the palace gates,
where could I possibly go?

62
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,204
I was blessed with your company today.

63
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,334
Nonsense. Thanks to you,
I had a great time for once.

64
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,338
Oh.

65
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,097
I suspect you will have more use for it.

66
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,517
When the time arrives
and a special someone steals your heart,

67
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,768
you should give it to them.

68
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,740
Good night.

69
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,618
Ugh. I can't believe it.

70
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,581
Where were you earlier though?

71
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,792
Can we please drop it?

72
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,253
I looked for you everywhere.
Seriously.

73
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,005
If you knew how worried I was…

74
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,882
Oh, silence.

75
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,153
You certainly seem happy.

76
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,906
Did you have fun outside
of the palace walls?

77
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,034
As if that could really happen.

78
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,678
Is something wrong?

79
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,389
-Why?
-Oh!

80
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,099
Because your cheeks are flushed.

81
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,768
It looks like you're coming down
with a mild fever.

82
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,020
-Hmm.
-No, I'm not.

83
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,315
I guess I'm still a little…

84
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
overheated from walking.

85
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,535
-Wait, that…
-Hm?

86
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,706
Uh, has to be returned
at tomorrow's lecture.

87
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,459
So try to be careful with it.

88
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,376
Sorry?

89
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,463
Hmm.

90
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,135
Oh. As you wish, Your Highness.

91
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,749
Where exactly did your mind wander off to
while on that horse

92
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,544
that you made such a foolish mistake?

93
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,631
I… I apologize.

94
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,427
You haven't been yourself these days,
Your Highness.

95
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,025
You are my grandson
and you are very precious to me.

96
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,612
But that means
that you must also be perfect.

97
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,196
Do you understand?

98
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,658
Yes, Grandfather.

99
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,617
I apologize. I am not that familiar
with horseback riding.

100
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,661
I know that.

101
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,664
And I'm sure you're nervous
being in front of my father.

102
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,043
I'll go ahead and ask Guard Yoon
for private lessons.

103
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,754
There's a chance you may not get
as good as your late brother,

104
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:16,050
but you have to be good enough that
no one notices any difference between you.

105
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,053
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,471
Don't call me that.

107
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,186
Your injuries look pretty serious.

108
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,647
But first thing you need to do
is change clothes.

109
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,276
CROWN PRINCESS CONSORT HAN

110
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,240
You know, you didn't have to return it.

111
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,659
From now on, please do not do anything
you're not ordered to do.

112
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,537
What you did might have seemed like

113
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,248
only a simple matter of courtesy to you.

114
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,751
But in my eyes, they just seem like
unnecessary attempts at flattery.

115
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,628
You think I'd do that?

116
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,756
That's not who I am.
Why would I even bother with doing--

117
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,883
That's precisely
why you shouldn't have done it.

118
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,651
Was this always here?

119
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,405
Did Your Royal Highness
attach these beads?

120
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,117
You think I'd do that?

121
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,618
Those beads have always been on there!

122
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,371
Then just say "no."
You don't have to yell at me.

123
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,497
When did I…

124
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,755
When did I yell?

125
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,636
That reminds me.

126
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,308
I can't believe
you're actually friends with Lord Jaeun.

127
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,018
I must say it surprised me.

128
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,442
"Birds of a feather flock together."

129
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,280
So it's only natural we'd be friends
given how much we have in common.

130
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,160
Whatever. Let's just get on
with today's lecture.

131
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,666
Okay. It was just a joke, though.

132
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,085
It's cold in here.

133
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,588
Ice cold.

134
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:26,193
What? What do you mean
the Crown Prince seems like a woman?

135
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,778
Shh! Okay?

136
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,447
Do you even know how much trouble
you'd be in for saying that?

137
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,533
It's not like that.

138
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,996
I'm just saying that
he kinda reminds me of

139
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,749
the court maid I saw at the royal hunting.

140
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,209
It's the same thing.

141
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,420
No, it's actually way worse.

142
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,505
His Royal Highness is sacred.

143
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,718
And you must have some sort of death wish.

144
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,848
You think that too, don't you?

145
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,746
What happened here?

146
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,665
Why is everything broken?

147
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,095
Father.

148
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,680
Yes, So-eun.

149
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,563
I heard you went to Minister No's
to see Ha-gyeong.

150
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,606
And you're back already?

151
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,067
Uh, yes.

152
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:54,406
Father, you don't know anything about
the Samgaebang clinic, do you?

153
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,284
Samgaebang?

154
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,621
Well, now that you mentioned it,

155
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,833
I think I heard it was torn down
by the Inspector General's Office.

156
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,003
Tell me,
why the sudden interest in the clinic?

157
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,132
You are the one who always said

158
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,719
no matter what, I should never go back
on the promises I make to others.

159
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,558
Truth be told, there's a girl who works
at the clinic who I need to apologize to.

160
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,686
And I also made a promise to the physician

161
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,940
that I would go back there
to apologize to the girl as well.

162
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,566
So what are you saying?

163
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,445
I really need your help, Father.
To keep my promises.

164
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,117
Do you think you could introduce me
to the physician? Please?

165
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,828
-Let's go!
-I'm open, I'm open! Here! Here!

166
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,873
Reading all night will be the death of me.

167
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,295
Oh-ooh!

168
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,965
Your Royal Highness, watch out!

169
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,448
Which one of you kicked it?

170
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,118
Please forgive me, Your Highness.
I committed a mortal sin.

171
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,913
That…

172
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,540
That was admirable.

173
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,710
The way you just reacted like that.

174
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,463
Thanks to you,
His Royal Highness wasn't injured.

175
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,383
Don't you agree, Your Highness?

176
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,683
Uh, if I may,

177
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,935
seeing this ball reminds me…

178
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,397
of the good old days, you know?
What do you say?

179
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,525
So would His Highness
like to kick the ball?

180
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,028
Go ahead and have your fun, Tutor Jung.

181
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,451
I should probably
warm up a little bit, huh?

182
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,872
Hey, why are you still on the ground?

183
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,832
Come on, let's go.

184
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,550
He's right, huh?

185
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,093
Get up. Go and play.

186
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,303
Go on! Huh!

187
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,429
Have fun.

188
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,687
-Come on!
-Yeah!

189
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,650
Yeah!

190
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,902
-Yeah! Kick it! Kick it!
-Oh, oh!

191
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,863
All right, there!

192
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,578
That's cute.

193
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,102
"According to Zengzi…

194
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,398
sibmoksosi, sibsusoji, gieomho."

195
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,952
"On you are the eyes of ten men.

196
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,834
Pointing to you are the hands of ten men.

197
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,961
So how could it not be terrifying?"

198
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,798
That is what he said.

199
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,222
"Buyunok, deokyunsin."

200
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,139
DAEHAKJANGGU

201
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,435
"Wealth brings prosperity to families

202
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,522
while virtue enriches a soul."

203
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,906
"Gogunjapilseonggiui.

204
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,411
For a wise man, it should always be true."

205
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,529
What are you doing?

206
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,575
"Simgwangcheban."

207
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
You skipped this passage.

208
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,956
SIMGWANGCHEBAN

209
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,173
You got all sweaty earlier!

210
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,300
I'd prefer if you stayed away.

211
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,218
Oh, right.

212
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,309
"Simgwangcheban.

213
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,270
Being generous

214
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,440
will ease the body…"

215
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,028
Just stop doing that, would you?

216
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,822
I just didn't want to inconvenience you
in any way.

217
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:55,160
That is what you get when you run around
with a bunch of eunuchs in training.

218
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,288
Who knew that royal tutors
had so much free time?

219
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,539
But actually it's…

220
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,752
it's really a way of developing
one's physical and mental strength.

221
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,048
Never mind.
Not that you even know about that.

222
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,902
Susinjega, chigukpyeongcheonha.

223
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,781
"One can only rule a nation
if all is well at home."

224
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,784
Gahwamansaseong is

225
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,288
"All goes well
when one's home is harmonious."

226
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,458
Hold on a second.

227
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,420
Wait, was that meant for me?

228
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,883
The palace is home to Your Royal Highness.

229
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,178
So what could be more important
than understanding

230
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,305
the people who reside within it?

231
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,516
Ha!

232
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,394
So you're saying

233
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,188
that I'm clueless as to what is going on

234
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,275
in the place I was born and raised?

235
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,071
Well, that could be so.

236
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,119
All right, then. Come on.
I have something to show you.

237
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,413
Wait, sho… show me?

238
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,123
You don't think I know
what goes on around here?

239
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,250
I'll show you how much I know
about the palace.

240
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,544
Hold on.

241
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,672
While we're at it…

242
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,759
let's start with the Royal Institute.

243
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,179
Your Royal Highness, wait!

244
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,021
You dare to stand there
and stop me from getting by?

245
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,397
No, that's not it.

246
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,783
Excuse me.

247
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,036
Gosh, it sure is dusty in here.

248
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,788
Okay, it's my turn.

249
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,373
Good. Those are good numbers.

250
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,043
Yes!

251
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,004
Nice!

252
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,130
Man-dal!

253
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,677
Nice!

254
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,805
Your Royal Highness, please. Wait!

255
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,766
Your Royal Highness, wait!

256
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,644
Your Royal Highness, this is wrong.

257
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,978
Please, Your Highness.

258
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,774
Uh, oops.

259
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,235
Uh, did you trip?

260
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,363
Get up. On your feet.

261
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,944
Is there something that might be
troubling you perhaps, Your Highness?

262
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,487
I'm not troubled at all.

263
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,573
I can't say the same for Royal Tutor Jung.

264
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,826
Oh?

265
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,705
Since the palace is my home,

266
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,249
I should know everything
that happens within its walls.

267
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,459
He taught me about that.

268
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:37,132
So I decided to take his lesson to heart
and have a good look around the palace.

269
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,676
Sure, yeah. Go right ahead.

270
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,891
This way.

271
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,935
How are the Confucian classics
being stored?

272
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,646
Correct me if I'm wrong,

273
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,359
but didn't I ask for the footnote at once
to be given special attention?

274
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,821
Oh, yes. The classics.
Yes, of course. This way.

275
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:04,033
Here we go.
They're all right inside this cabinet.

276
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,536
Don't!

277
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,709
Please don't mind him.
I promise you're not going to believe

278
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,836
how well organized the books are.

279
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,046
Here we are. Oh, what on earth?

280
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,052
What… Huh? Wha…
No, no. No, no, no. No.

281
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:34,397
Well done. Pleased to know
that they're in such caring hands.

282
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,566
I…

283
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,573
Your… Your Royal Highness?

284
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,878
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

285
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,422
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

286
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,385
I… I deserve to die, too.

287
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,975
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

288
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,108
The Royal Infirmary is responsible
for the well-being of palace residents,

289
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,444
but not even the herbs
are properly stored.

290
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,782
-We deserve to die!
-We deserve to die!

291
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,245
You know, you're right. So you will all
take your last breaths…

292
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,830
today!

293
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,226
What is going on here?

294
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,854
With his lecturer, His Royal Highness

295
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,731
is conducting an inspection
of the entire palace.

296
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,527
What? An inspection?

297
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,936
Are you all right?

298
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,355
Yes, my lord.

299
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,831
Is that you, Commander Yoon?

300
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,420
Your Highness.

301
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,716
And what might you be doing here?

302
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,842
Uh…

303
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,055
I heard that you were
conducting inspections.

304
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,433
Oh, not really. It's just a…

305
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,978
just a part of my lesson today.

306
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,822
I must be getting back.
His Majesty awaits.

307
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,156
Mm-hm.

308
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,461
Who takes that long on a toilet break?

309
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,422
Be sure to drink
a lot of water when you can.

310
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,716
Trust me, I speak from experience.

311
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,509
And it hurts.

312
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,650
Do you have any sense
of what hygiene even is?

313
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,195
Your Royal Highness, you see…

314
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,072
Forgive me, Your Highness.

315
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,866
My hands are dirty because…

316
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,387
This seems like quite enough for now,
Your Highness.

317
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:45,685
Why? Come on,
don't tell me you're tired already.

318
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,020
It's not that.

319
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,153
Would you mind if I ask you
to go somewhere with me?

320
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,117
Where exactly would we be going?

321
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,096
Isn't it just remarkable?

322
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,770
Why did you bring me here out of the blue?

323
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,899
Because from up here,

324
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,527
you can see the entire palace.
Every corner.

325
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,817
Do you happen to know what these are?

326
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,406
Aren't those daisies?

327
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,325
That's correct.

328
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,285
Daisies are easy to find

329
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,164
which is why they're frequently used
for medicinal purposes.

330
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,877
The dirt covering the roots
can't be easily washed off.

331
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,421
They have to be scraped off
in order to be cleaned,

332
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,676
which means that one's nails
will always be dirty.

333
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,846
No matter how hard you try,
you cannot scrape them clean.

334
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,103
Is all this because of what happened
at the royal kitchen?

335
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,356
Because I scolded the court maid
without knowing the full story?

336
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,985
Of course not.

337
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,824
All I'm saying
is that they are human too,

338
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,743
so you can't expect them
to be perfect all the time.

339
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,290
Rather than scolding others
because of your own assumptions,

340
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,001
why not, instead,

341
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:20,840
trust in the love and the loyalty
they have for you and your people?

342
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:29,598
Every day, they try their best
to be of service to you and His Majesty.

343
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,891
Not only that,

344
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,562
they probably care for the people
of Joseon more than anyone.

345
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,605
MEDICINE

346
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,947
Not the palace itself,
but the people within its walls.

347
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,575
That is what I wanted you to see,

348
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,953
but you just couldn't resist.

349
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,421
You sure are naive, aren't you?

350
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,634
Trust people's love and loyalty,
seriously?

351
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,470
There is nothing in the world

352
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,765
that is harder to trust
than the emotions of humans.

353
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,809
Deceiving others for selfish reasons

354
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,855
and killing others to protect oneself.

355
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,860
That is simply human nature.

356
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,914
You are not
to worry about other people.

357
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,582
They must know their place.

358
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,378
You have to make them fear you.

359
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,381
You can't let them get close to you.

360
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,801
Or you won't survive at all.

361
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,887
For once at least.

362
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,103
For once at least,

363
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,190
can't you put your trust in people?

364
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,236
Not for anyone else, but yourself.

365
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,948
For Your Royal Highness.

366
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,130
Don't distance yourself too much.

367
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,465
It will only make you lonelier.

368
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,353
Oh, my.

369
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,272
Oh, no!

370
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,526
What's going on out here?

371
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,278
Well…

372
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,450
I believe that one of the court maids
suffered some sort of dizzy spell.

373
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,537
She'll be fine. You should head back
to your chambers, Your Highness.

374
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,851
Take her to her chambers immediately
and have a physician look at her.

375
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,061
Yes, Your Highness.

376
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,287
You should probably go with her as well.

377
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,039
Your Highness.

378
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,752
But I should be serving you
at your chambers.

379
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,171
As if you'll possibly be
of any help anyway.

380
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:51,258
Thanks to you all
succumbing to fatigue so easily,

381
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,594
I'm not able to read my books in peace.

382
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,847
I do not wish to be bothered
by you any further.

383
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,933
So everyone should leave right now.

384
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,976
And don't come back the rest of the night.

385
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,478
But Your Highness…

386
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,689
I'm afraid that can never be allowed.

387
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,066
It can and it will.

388
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,071
If you are that worried, then I suppose…

389
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,243
you two may stay
and keep watch over my chambers.

390
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,337
You are all dismissed for now.

391
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,966
Go on!

392
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,538
MILITARY SERVICE DIRECTORY

393
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:14,508
KIM GA-ON FROM UIRYEONG
JOINED THE MUNICIPAL ARMY AT 17

394
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,342
My lord!

395
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,595
Somebody, please help!

396
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,647
I can't believe this.

397
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,155
I don't understand.

398
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,990
What happened?

399
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,202
One.

400
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,788
Two.

401
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,248
Three.

402
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,062
Wait. Un-am is dead?

403
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,107
It's the second incident this month.

404
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,151
Now, two men
who testified against Preceptor Kang

405
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,028
ten years ago have mysteriously died.

406
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,908
They say he hanged himself,

407
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,577
but that doesn't seem right, does it?

408
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:12,167
I figured you'd have some information
regarding this case,

409
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,129
but I guess I was wrong then.

410
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,175
You haven't come to see me

411
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,928
in nearly ten years, Seok-jo.

412
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,226
Not that I expect a heartfelt reunion
with a fellow classmate,

413
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,854
but we could have exchanged greetings.

414
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,649
I doubt you actually care about
how I'm doing.

415
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,277
Jung Ji-un, is it?

416
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,448
I heard your son was appointed
as a royal tutor for His Highness.

417
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,787
If he takes after you when you were young,

418
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:53,208
and of course, he will serve greatly
as the prince's tutor.

419
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,006
I've wasted your time.

420
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,342
My apologies. Good day.

421
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,568
So…

422
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,987
What did you find out?

423
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,323
He is the son of Inspector Jung Seok-jo.

424
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,659
He replaced one of the royal preceptors
as a royal tutor.

425
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,369
The inspector's son?

426
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,331
So he's one
of Lord Sangheon's people, huh?

427
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,291
Ugh…

428
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,793
Perhaps it's the reason
for their friendship.

429
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,211
Friendship?

430
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,635
At the age when the Crown Prince
should have been chasing skirts,

431
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,679
the boy started pulling away
from other people.

432
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:52,017
So a male friend he meets with secretly?

433
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:56,688
Don't you find that a little odd, huh?

434
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,690
Sorry. Not sure I follow.

435
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,654
Hold on, what if…

436
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,573
-the Prince likes men?
-Wha--

437
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,579
-That's absurd.
-Ah, why did I never think of this before?

438
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:17,251
Of course! Just how often do you see
a man in the Crown Prince's age

439
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,419
not fooling around with a girl!

440
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,548
He even lives in a palace.
He can have any woman he wants, huh!

441
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,508
But still, that's…

442
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,639
Huh?

443
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,018
What's this?

444
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,942
If he really isn't into men,

445
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,445
then one whiff of this

446
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,991
and he won't be able to resist
women at all.

447
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,830
JASEONDANG

448
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,755
Your Royal Highness,
your bath has been drawn.

449
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,174
Okay.

450
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,266
Your Highness,

451
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,936
maybe it'll be a good idea
to skip your bath tonight.

452
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,646
Huh?

453
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,696
I can't.

454
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,450
It's not just today
he'll be guarding my chambers,

455
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,369
so I won't be able to avoid him forever.

456
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,289
You're not wrong about that.

457
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,541
However…

458
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,358
You will wait right here, understand?

459
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,704
And you may leave as well.

460
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,207
Yes, Your Highness.

461
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,804
I'll take it from here so you two go
and check that his bed is made.

462
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,847
-Yes, Court Lady Kim.
-Yes, Court Lady Kim.

463
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,743
Why is the smoke heavier than usual?

464
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,916
What is that smell?

465
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,691
What are you doing?

466
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,026
Your Highness!

467
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,708
You…

468
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,127
What on earth do you think
that you're doing in here?

469
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,754
Well,

470
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,923
I have an incense
that increases a man's vigor…

471
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:56,219
No, that's not… I just wanted to help you
regain your strength and energy--

472
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,345
How dare you!

473
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,265
Who gave you this preposterous order?

474
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,725
Well…

475
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,812
I deserve to die!

476
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:11,651
But it was Lord Changun
who gave the order to me.

477
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,281
He said it would get me
into Your Royal Highness' favor.

478
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,920
Please forgive me, Queen Dowager.

479
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:34,132
I was only worried for the Crown Prince's
lack of interest in women.

480
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,760
In the name of being a loyal subject--

481
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,606
And how can I possibly face
His Majesty now?

482
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:54,319
How could you possibly do something
so mindlessly immature, Changun?

483
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,862
I apologize.

484
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,823
Beg for His Highness' forgiveness.

485
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,785
Beg until your knees ache
and your hands burn like fire.

486
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:02,744
Do you hear me?

487
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,080
Over such a frivolous thing?

488
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,458
But what about my dignity as his uncle?

489
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,168
-You heard me!
-I'll get right on it.

490
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,548
I'm okay.

491
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:24,141
Your gift was greatly appreciated.

492
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,936
If that were the case,

493
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,814
then why didn't you spend
the whole night with her, huh?

494
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:37,404
You think I'd spent the night with her
knowing you had your share of her first?

495
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,824
We both know that would be a mortal sin.

496
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,827
I don't know about that.

497
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,082
But I do apologize, though,
and I'm deeply ashamed

498
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,501
of my impertinence.

499
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,503
You had better be.

500
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:03,305
Do you remember when I warned you

501
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,183
to tread lightly with me?

502
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:16,484
Don't tell me you're still upset about
what happened during the royal hunt, huh?

503
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,779
Come on. That's all in the past now.

504
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,743
I doubt anyone saw.

505
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,162
Plus bringing up that incident

506
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,373
wouldn't actually be in your favor.

507
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,591
Uh, Lord Sangheon.

508
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,891
Lord Sangheon.

509
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:52,479
I should have buried you, you imbecile,
when the former king was put to rest.

510
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,982
-Imbecile?
-You dare tried to murder the Crown Prince

511
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,818
under the Queen Dowager's protection?

512
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,657
What? Why would I try to murder him?

513
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,658
That's absurd!

514
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:14,292
Please, Lord Sangheon, forgive me.
I have committed a mortal sin.

515
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,928
Challenging the Crown Prince's authority

516
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,306
is the same as challenging mine.

517
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,517
Do you understand?

518
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,312
Yes, of course. Of course I know.

519
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:39,484
Understand also that after this, you won't
have the Queen Dowager's protection.

520
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,823
Do anything like this again,
assuming that she'll be there to save you,

521
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,910
and I will remove your head myself.

522
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,042
Of course.
I will keep that in mind, Lord Sangheon.

523
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:10,390
I will make a request to His Majesty,
and have him placed under house arrest.

524
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,559
Now, please calm down.

525
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,229
Hold on. House arrest?

526
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,872
Being this soft, Your Royal Highness,

527
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,625
will only hurt your chances for greatness.

528
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:44,132
As for me,
I am not afraid to shed any blood

529
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,218
if it's in the name
of defeating your enemies.

530
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,638
Whoever it may be.

531
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,589
What? Did I startle you?

532
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:28,259
Well, that's exactly why
you shouldn't sin.

533
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,721
You really have lost it.

534
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,431
Lower your sword.

535
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,058
I said lower it!

536
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:46,111
My beads… How dare you!

537
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,405
If I find you harassing
the Crown Prince one more time

538
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:52,325
then be assured my sword
will cut off a lot more than some beads.

539
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,494
Do you understand me?

540
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,211
Do you really expect to live
to tell the tale

541
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,630
after mistreating
the Crown Prince's uncle?

542
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,633
After all, nothing happened
to Lord Sangheon.

543
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,594
Right?

544
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,763
So why would I be in trouble?

545
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,269
It's not like anyone saw me.

546
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,696
His Royal Highness is too noble
to play childish games with you.

547
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,870
But I'd be more than happy
to join you whenever you want.

548
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,835
What? Childish games?

549
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,588
Ugh! That little prick.

550
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,009
Damn it!

551
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,815
I am not afraid to shed any blood

552
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,943
if it's in the name
of defeating your enemies.

553
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,112
Whoever it may be.

554
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,332
You must still be in shock,

555
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:26,836
so why don't you rest a little
before the morning lecture?

556
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,637
Thanks to Lord Changun
and everything he pulled last night,

557
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,223
you barely got any shut-eye at all.

558
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,558
I'd rather not rest.

559
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,645
Being in my chambers
will just cloud my mind

560
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,396
with more unnecessary thoughts.

561
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,234
Exactly. Which is why a nap
could be helpful.

562
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,403
Are you worried
about having nightmares again?

563
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,867
Are you really just going to stand there?

564
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,539
All right.

565
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,418
Go on. Request that the morning lecture
be pushed back.

566
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,380
In the meantime, I'll stay here and rest.

567
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,925
Yes, Your Highness. Be back in a moment.

568
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,280
Oh, going out?

569
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,781
Ah, Tutor Jung.

570
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,908
It's almost time for the morning lecture,

571
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,245
but His Highness is still in his office.
So I was just heading over.

572
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,204
As you were.

573
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,418
Ooh.

574
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,752
Are you all right?

575
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,713
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I'm fine.

576
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,464
Guess I drank too much last night.

577
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,137
I'll go to His Royal Highness.
You should go and rest.

578
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,556
No, that's not necessary. I can--

579
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,391
Oh. Ooh.

580
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,001
It's almost time for your lecture,
Your Highness.

581
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,671
Your Highness?

582
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,202
Could he have a cold?

583
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,713
Your Highness, it's just me.

584
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,174
It's me, Your Highness. Tutor Jung.

585
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,848
Tutor Jung?

586
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,582
Your Highness, are you… okay?

587
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:06,592
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un
is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?

588
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,344
-Oh, no.
-Your Highness!

589
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,221
Why do you have
this particular book?

590
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:14,350
That girl must have been
someone special to you.

591
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,852
She was my first love.

592
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:20,731
Well, the Minister of Personnel
lodged a demand for your resignation.

593
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,483
He deceived me
and the Crown Prince.

594
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,110
The degree of his crime is quite severe.

595
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,278
I'm in need of your help.

596
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,572
You are the only person
who can help me now.

597
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,532
There is nothing I can do for you.

598
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,159
So I advise you to stop asking.
