1
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,774
Just a little more. Come on.
Push, Your Highness.

2
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,653
You are doing great, Your Highness.
Come on.

3
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,584
It's a baby boy.

4
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,878
You welcomed a prince, Your Highness.

5
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,271
Something's wrong.

6
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,409
Twins within the Royal Family
are an abomination.

7
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,620
Will anyone within this kingdom

8
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,748
accept a prince
that shared a womb with a girl?

9
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,626
I understand. But, Father--

10
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,711
I've already accepted your daughter
as Crown Princess

11
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,005
because you played a part
in making me king.

12
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,340
But this I cannot condone.

13
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,259
How do you plan at cleaning this up?

14
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,387
If my status is threatened,
you will pay the price with your life.

15
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,098
You and everyone else who sides with me.

16
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,226
And I am sure you are well aware of that,
aren't you, Hyejong?

17
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,816
Tonight, the Royal Family
welcomed one child.

18
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,902
He will be the eldest son born
to the Crown Prince.

19
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,323
No one will ever know
that he was born a twin, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,785
So please set your worries aside.

21
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,891
Please let her live,
Your Highness.

22
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,934
Just because she's a girl,

23
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,730
should it mean
that her life means nothing?

24
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,107
Please do not take her life.

25
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,776
It is beyond my control.

26
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,405
But she is your daughter.

27
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,782
The daughter who was born on the same day

28
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,202
and at the same hour as your boy was.

29
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,413
The King has already given
his final order.

30
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,082
And the Royal Family concurs.

31
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,961
No, that's not true.

32
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,924
What really matters…

33
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,343
is the decision of the Crown Prince.

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,054
You're her father, tell me.

35
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,764
What choice will you make? I wish to know.

36
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,224
I am no different.

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,353
If this child is not an asset
to our kingdom, then…

38
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,315
It has to go.

39
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,328
Terminate all witnesses
at the Royal Maternity Directorate.

40
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,456
Not a single person should be left alive
without my permission.

41
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,582
Identify yourselves!

42
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,607
Lord Sangheon?

43
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,697
In serving His Majesty,
you did well, Chief State Councilor.

44
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,747
The Crown Princess, where is she?

45
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,083
Uh, she's in her chambers
with the royal physician.

46
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,689
The Crown Princess
is recovering after giving birth.

47
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,691
How dare you come in here and--

48
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,734
Enough!

49
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,129
It is a boy.

50
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,007
The eldest grandson of the King…

51
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,387
that you've been hoping.

52
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,431
And what about the girl?

53
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,641
The girl, she…

54
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,852
didn't make it.

55
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,983
The newborn princess stopped breathing
seconds after she was born.

56
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,155
Burn it to ashes.

57
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,073
Yes, sir.

58
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,853
Your Highness.

59
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,566
Hurry. Check that the baby's okay.

60
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,567
Yes, Your Highness.

61
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,978
I want you to burn all bodies
and dispose of the remains.

62
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,474
Her pulse is weak.

63
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,936
Will you take her to a doctor
once you leave royal grounds?

64
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,604
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,731
EPISODE 1

66
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
Only those who pass
the parrot blood test

67
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,545
will be eligible to serve His Majesty.

68
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,949
-All right, let's go!
-Come on! Yes!

69
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,160
All right, all right.
Pass over here!

70
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,579
Hit it, hit it.

71
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,917
That's it!

72
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,794
Here!

73
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,171
Just pass the ball!

74
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,840
-Pass, pass. Come on!
-Yeah!

75
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,509
Seriously! I was open!

76
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,552
Whoa!

77
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,056
Look at him running
and charging so powerful.

78
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,226
That gentleman
is a king in the making, right there.

79
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
Don't you agree?

80
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,939
Yeah.

81
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,738
Over here! Over here!
Pass over here! I'm open!

82
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,824
No! Stop him, stop him!

83
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,957
Goal!

84
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,210
Good job!

85
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,879
That's how you do it.

86
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,482
I told you we have to go.
I'm leaving without you.

87
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,193
Give me just a minute. I almost have it.

88
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,363
When you're scolded for being late,
don't blame me, okay?

89
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,617
I-wol! I-wol, wait!

90
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,322
Can you hand me the ball, please?

91
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,208
Thank you.

92
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,172
What?

93
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,842
Do I have something on my face?

94
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,179
Uh, it's not that.

95
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,809
How long does it take
to fetch a ball?

96
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,590
So there's a girl… who looks like you?

97
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,841
It's true, I swear!

98
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,551
If we had the same hair,

99
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,429
I'm sure just about anyone
would think we were twins.

100
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,806
Don't you agree, Bok-dong?

101
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,349
Sorry?

102
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:54,935
It's true.

103
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,104
Never speak of this again.

104
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,814
Seriously, a twin?

105
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,483
Why would you even think
of saying such nonsense?

106
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,485
I was just startled.

107
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,572
You'd be startled too
if you saw the court maid. I'm sure of it.

108
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,615
I've heard enough.

109
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,910
How dare a court maid
resemble a noble prince like you.

110
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,329
It's something no one
should ever hear about.

111
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,250
Listen. Don't you ever
mention this to anyone.

112
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,628
Do you understand?

113
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,588
Yes. Yes, Mother.

114
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:38,062
You clearly told me that my daughter
was taken outside of the Capital.

115
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,939
Yes, I'm absolutely sure of it.

116
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,150
The Crown Prince's guard left her
at a small temple outside the Capital.

117
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,612
I must speak with him right away.

118
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,198
Meanwhile,

119
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,076
you look for the girl my son saw.
Can you do that for me?

120
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,869
Yes.

121
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,128
His Highness takes after you
in his cleverness and boldness, sir.

122
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,840
His tutors at Gangseowon
see it as an honor

123
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,219
to be provided with the opportunity
to serve His Highness.

124
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,014
No need to flatter him for my sake.

125
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,476
From what I hear,
rather than reading books,

126
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,396
you've been more interested in soccer

127
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,273
and enjoying outdoor activities
with eunuch trainees.

128
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,317
Is that true, son?

129
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,906
If my mentor is correct
about taking after you, it'd be false.

130
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,742
If I didn't, then it would be true.

131
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,952
What's that?

132
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,127
-You can't come in here!
-Step aside!

133
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,131
How dare you barge in here.

134
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,008
Forgive my impudence, Your Royal Highness.

135
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,553
-Take him!
-Yes, sir.

136
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,849
-Wha-- What is the meaning of this?
-Master!

137
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,393
I order you to let go of him this instant!

138
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,272
We have an order from His Majesty
to arrest the Royal Preceptor.

139
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,859
Arrest him?

140
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,330
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

141
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,592
What is the reason
for the Royal Preceptor's arrest?

142
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,348
Your own grandson trusts him
and is fond of him as a master.

143
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:43,187
So please, I ask that you reconsider
your royal command of arrest.

144
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,858
He has been disrupting the Royal Court
with his absurd asinine appeals.

145
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:52,488
Someone like him should not be
put in charge of His Highness' education.

146
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,282
The preceptor's concerns
for this nation and people

147
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,951
surely can't be viewed
as disrupting the peace.

148
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,081
He slandered me
and those His Highness greatly respects.

149
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,125
In desecrating
His Majesty's bestowal of merits,

150
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,585
he's encouraged rebellion.

151
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,213
I ask you, what could possibly
be more criminal?

152
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
In regards to punishment,

153
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:20,349
I'm truly worried about the distress that
may incite in His Majesty's grandson.

154
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,725
That's why I dare propose

155
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,021
that his quarters be sealed off
until the dust settles.

156
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,856
So be it.

157
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,320
Are you okay?

158
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,117
It's not too late to head back
to your quarters.

159
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,829
Master has been absent
for several days now.

160
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,413
And none of the people at the institute

161
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,999
will tell me where he has been.
Not even my father.

162
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,794
So what else can I do except seek him
outside the palace alone.

163
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,007
But couldn't you at least
give me my clothes back?

164
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,806
The main gate is right outside.

165
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,392
This is the only way
I can make it out undetected.

166
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,647
Boost me up higher, will you?

167
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,985
That's it. Just a little bit more.

168
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,028
A little more.

169
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,496
-Down. Go down.
-Sorry?

170
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,497
Go down, go down.

171
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,208
Whoa!

172
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,725
I hear you've been asking for me.

173
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,894
You're finally here.

174
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,877
Whoa! We look exactly alike.

175
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,795
Right?

176
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,797
I guess it's true.

177
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,507
Go get the clothing.

178
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,469
But what if someone figures it out?

179
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,346
No way someone would.

180
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,847
Go get the clothes this instant.

181
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,534
Are you still not done?

182
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,120
I don't have all day,
so pick up the speed now.

183
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,383
-Now, hand me your clothes.
-Huh?

184
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,386
Why would you want
those shabby rags I wear?

185
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,014
Also, try to talk
with a lower and deeper voice.

186
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,517
-Huh?
-So, um, they're over there?

187
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,368
Stop right there.

188
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,666
I've never seen her around
this court before.

189
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,587
She's still in training.
She only came here to run an errand.

190
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,714
I was showing her the way back.

191
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,300
It's through this gate. You may exit now.

192
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,259
Did the prince make it out?

193
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,471
He, um, he just got out to the main gate.

194
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,439
Your Highness,
the Bureau of Special Foods

195
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,275
-has brought over some snacks.
-Get ready.

196
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,406
Ye… Yes, all right.

197
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,301
We have brought you your favorites,
sikhye and maejakgwa, Your Highness.

198
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,056
Uh… uh, that's great. You may leave now.

199
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,624
Uh, want some of these?

200
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,209
Uh, no.

201
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,669
Uh…

202
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,463
No, Your Highness.

203
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,635
Uh, don't be like that. Come and eat.

204
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,929
No, Your Highness.

205
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,162
It's sweet, isn't it?

206
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,081
I hear the King's grandson sent you.

207
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,000
Do you happen to know how he's doing?

208
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,420
Doesn't he resent me for leaving…

209
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,673
without saying goodbye?

210
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,098
I was concerned, not angry.

211
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,850
I know you wouldn't do anything
that would warrant resentment.

212
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,062
Your Highness?

213
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,983
Your Highness, is that actually you?

214
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,736
How did you get here?

215
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,780
What on earth are you wearing?

216
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,286
You're like a father to me, Master.
I'm sure you know that.

217
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,830
His Majesty wouldn't allow me
to leave the quarters.

218
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,999
I had to improvise so I could see you.

219
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,673
Your Highness,

220
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:36,052
will you please forgive me
for not being able to serve you fully.

221
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,306
Master.

222
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,510
Whoa.

223
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,640
He reads this book every single day?

224
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,769
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

225
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,009
I hear you suffered
from an acute stomach illness.

226
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,844
Are you fully recovered now?

227
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,648
Yes. Thankfully, I am doing better.

228
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,848
According to your tutor, Kwondok,

229
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,308
you completed reading Jwajeon
all by yourself.

230
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,560
Huh?

231
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,982
Uh, ye… yes, I did. Yes, Your Majesty.

232
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,066
That's good.

233
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,570
Then which sentence
resonated with you the most?

234
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,529
Huh?

235
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,909
Uh, well…

236
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,750
Well…

237
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,839
Uh, what about you, Father?
What's yours, huh?

238
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,842
Uh, uh…

239
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,848
Uh, I mean, I'm… I wish to know
which sentence resonated with you most.

240
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,526
"Injabulwoo, jijabulhok, yongjabulgu."

241
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,696
"The benevolent shall not worry,

242
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,324
the wise will not be entrapped,

243
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,327
and the brave will not be afraid."

244
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,288
Analects of Confucius.

245
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,252
That was the first lesson
my Royal Preceptor ever taught me.

246
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,630
Owning what you studied

247
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,342
is of more importance
than simply reading all the words.

248
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,347
My advice to you, take your time
to read Jwajeon once more

249
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,766
and ruminate on the meaning
of the words within.

250
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,523
Is something wrong?

251
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,236
No, nothing. I just think you're great.

252
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:36,251
Uh, what I meant was…

253
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,379
that, um… uh, um, it's just that you, uh…

254
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,923
that I admire the way you spoke, Father.

255
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,124
Your Highness!

256
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,295
What took you so long?
You have no idea how worried I was.

257
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,427
The attire suits you.

258
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,470
Sorry?

259
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,389
You did well.

260
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:42,859
Father.

261
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,031
Shall we?

262
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,659
-We'll head out.
-Sure.

263
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,131
I can't believe
I'm at the palace for the banquet.

264
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,674
It's almost like I'm dreaming.

265
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,512
Soon enough, you will also be serving
His Majesty within these walls.

266
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,682
Ji-un.

267
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,645
Oh, Hyun!

268
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,737
That is not how you address Prince Jaeun.

269
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,449
It's quite all right. I was the one
who suggested we speak informally

270
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,825
since we're good friends.

271
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,912
Hyun.

272
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,793
You'll be at the banquet hall tonight,
right? I'll see you there.

273
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,714
See you later.

274
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,273
Wait here for a moment. Okay, son?

275
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,733
Yes, Father.

276
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,057
Hold on!

277
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,481
Hey, hey, wait!

278
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,610
Just a second, please.

279
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,257
Well, where could she have gone to?

280
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,831
"Mokbaekyeoje sibingeonryeya.

00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,407
It's giya.

289
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,918
Uh, how did… How did you get in back here?

290
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,212
I'm pretty sure the door is locked,
you know.

291
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,174
Ah… Oh, I didn't mean to bother you,
I was just…

JWAJEON

293
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,344
Oh, that's Jwajeon?

294
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,346
So all the court maids read this book too?

295
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,351
Wait!

296
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,856
Oh. My book!

297
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,359
Oh… I'm sorry.

298
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,575
Are you insane? What are you doing?

299
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,535
I borrowed it from someone important.

300
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,745
I have to get it back.

301
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,791
The pages will all be soaked by now.

302
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,293
I'll try and get you another one.

303
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,212
Let go of me. I have to give it back.

304
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,297
Going in there is absolutely insane.

305
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,133
Let go of me! Let go of me!

306
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,653
Hey, Young Master. Young Master!

307
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,160
What do I do?

308
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,892
What are you doing?

309
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,938
Don't you train in the fighting arts?

310
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,649
How did you lose your balance so easily?

311
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,444
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

312
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,968
Oh, oh, oh!

313
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,977
Ji-un, what are you doing?

314
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,025
I was just trying to improve my balance.

315
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,026
Your balance?

316
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,532
A sword isn't something
you should use for leisure, son.

317
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,077
Its purpose is
to protect those you cherish.

318
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,289
Then, Father,
I'd like to receive your guidance.

319
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,768
Oh! Ji-un.

Here you go.

323
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,345
Oh, is this…

JWAJEON

325
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,979
I said I'd get you a copy,
didn't I?

326
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,319
This book is easy to find
so the dive was unnecessary.

327
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,752
Did you hang up all these yourself?

328
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,839
Huh? Uh…

329
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,175
Yeah, but it's not that much.

330
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,512
Let me get that.
At your speed, it'll take all day.

331
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,182
-Uh, no, it's fine. I'll do it.
-Give me a chance.

332
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,641
Is this how you do it?

333
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,060
It's really not necessary.

334
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,993
My name is Dam-i.

335
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,953
Dam-i?

336
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,705
The reason I was given that name is

337
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,749
because I was found by the wall.

338
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:49,048
So, um, does that mean that you have
never met either of your parents before?

339
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,227
Anyway, thanks for today.

340
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,562
What? You're leaving already?

341
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,148
I-wol will be worried if I'm late.

342
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,233
I-wol?

343
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,110
Yeah. She's a court maid that I work with.

344
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,413
Wait a minute.

345
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,583
Uh…

346
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,505
Do you have plans for the festival?

347
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,465
Huh?

348
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,716
Um…

349
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,398
JONHYUNGAK

350
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,036
So tell me, who was it that transcribed

351
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,580
the book while also adding footnotes?

352
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,040
Huh? It was transcribed?

353
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,335
Judging by his neat handwriting,

354
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,963
surely he's not an average guy.

355
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,799
This will be for my ears only.

356
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,926
Which family is he from?

357
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,639
Uh, I don't know what family,
Your Highness.

358
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,602
Romantic feelings for a court maid?

359
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,146
That could be quite dangerous.

360
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,398
Uh, uh… Romantic feelings?

361
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,734
Don't be scared. It's okay.

362
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,194
It's not a problem. My lips are sealed.

363
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,411
Your Highness, horrible news.

364
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,664
The King's eunuch trainee informed me that

365
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,751
His Majesty ordered the beheading
of the Royal Preceptor.

366
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,919
What?

367
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,188
Oh! There she is.

368
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,731
Dam-i, come here, quick.

369
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,535
Your name is Dam-i, right?

370
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,038
Yes, it is.

371
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,584
Follow me.

372
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,918
Ever since
my son mentioned running into you,

373
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,088
I have been wanting to meet you as well.

374
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,175
From what I hear, you…

375
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,722
lived in a temple without parents
for a long time.

376
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,184
So how did you come to be a court maid?

377
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,645
Well…

378
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,110
half a year ago, there was a fire
and the chief monk passed away.

379
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,947
A lady took pity on me while
I wandered the streets and begged for food

380
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,240
and helped me get a spot.

381
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,538
It must have been difficult.

382
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,002
Hasn't life been lonely for you?

383
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:01,341
You had to live deep
in the woods without parents.

384
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,472
Don't you resent the people…

385
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,350
who brought you into this world?

386
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,897
I never had family to start with,

387
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,234
so I don't know what being lonely
or what missing someone is like.

388
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,111
I see.

389
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,239
I never thought to resent those people.

390
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,037
Could you…

391
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,873
could you come a little closer?

392
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,061
So it was the King's grandson
who lent you that book?

393
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:45,857
That's right. I said I wanted to read it
so he lent it to me.

394
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,777
That's actually amazing.

395
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,405
Both of the young prince
lent you the book,

396
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,241
and that you wanted to read it too.

397
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,910
Truth is,

398
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,539
there's someone who inspired me
into wanting to read it.

399
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,749
Oh, yes? Who's that?

400
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,210
Mm…

401
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,545
I'm sorry, but that's a secret.

402
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,422
Oh.

403
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,177
You know, today,
I set a new goal for the future.

404
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,973
When I take the state exam,
I'll do my best

405
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,225
so that I could always be
by the Prince's side.

406
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,602
It is now my goal to serve him.

407
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,939
But what, um, just made you decide that?

408
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,983
I now admire him even more.

409
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,820
Wasn't he the one who helped you
get out to the festival tonight?

410
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,865
It was only thanks to His Highness' grace

411
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,492
that the two of us
were even able to meet tonight.

412
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,911
And I'd like to repay his kindness.

413
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,375
Oh, also…

414
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,503
Here. Open it.

415
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,179
YEON-SEON

416
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,181
"Yeon-seon"?

417
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,391
What is this?

418
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,143
Dam-i is a pretty great name,

419
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,980
but I wanted to give a name to you
that is more meaningful.

420
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,651
Lotus flowers brought me to you,

421
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,737
so I thought that the name
would be fitting.

422
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,655
YEON-SEON

423
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,240
Yeon-seon.

424
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,454
It truly is a beautiful name.

425
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,915
Yeon-seon.

426
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,800
YEON-SEON

427
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,306
-Good night.
-Sir.

428
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,547
Yeah! Good job!

429
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,597
Uh, Father.

430
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,975
Are you heading back home?

431
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,810
Why are you here at this hour?

432
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,729
Uh, that's because--

433
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,064
Who is that girl?

434
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,823
She was in the palace. I met her
when I visited for the banquet.

435
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,408
She's a court maid, then?

436
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,423
Burn it to ashes.

437
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,291
YEON-SEON

438
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,753
"Yeon-seon."

439
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,263
In three days,
a banquet for the elderly

440
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,806
will take place outside the palace.

441
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,684
I'll meet you right where the two of us
floated off our lanterns.

442
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,855
There's… There's something
that I wanted to give you too.

443
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,441
WAIT, STAY

444
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,558
Time is of the essence.

445
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,312
The girl and my son
can no longer be this close to each other.

446
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,856
So then…

447
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,652
You must take her far away from my son.

448
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,445
As soon as you can.

449
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,116
Yes, at your command.

450
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,356
Uh, Father.

451
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,662
Father, please.

452
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,209
How dare you try to fool the King.

453
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,129
How long did you think
you can keep this a secret?

454
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,965
Have you forgotten the King's order
that twins are not allowed?

455
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,925
She doesn't know about it.

456
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,386
Just let her go. Please, Father.

457
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,806
She will soon be sent to Yanjing.

458
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,600
I've been making sure no one knows.

459
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,478
And I guarantee that she'll stay a ghost.

460
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,897
So please…

461
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,485
Just please drop this.
Just this once, please. Father.

462
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,739
I won't let that girl threaten
everything that I have built up.

463
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,369
It doesn't matter where she goes.
As long as she's breathing,

464
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,163
I will have the duty
to find her and kill her.

465
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,915
As long as she's alive,

466
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,794
the secret can always end up
coming to light.

467
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,550
The court maid Dam-i,
do you know where she is?

468
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,060
I heard that she was chosen
to help out at the banquet for the elderly

469
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,813
right outside the walls of the palace.

470
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,757
"Perpetrator Kang Hwa-gil
colluded with traitors,

471
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,385
thus jeopardizing
the Royal Family and the nation.

472
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:57,098
The investigation led to statements
that identified him as the mastermind.

473
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,516
And for those reasons,

474
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,645
traitor Kang Hwa-gil
now must have his head cut off."

475
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,557
Hey! Stop right there!

476
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,406
Please, Dam-i. This will be the last time.

477
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,161
Your Highness, we were almost caught
in the act by the Crown Prince that day.

478
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,955
But he didn't actually catch us.

479
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,874
Not even my own father
could tell it wasn't me.

480
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,126
There's no way someone will catch us.

481
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,378
But, Your Highness…

482
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:15,760
Actually, I have already made
important plans for that day.

483
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,348
My master is like a father to me.

484
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,184
I can't simply let him die like this.

485
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,144
That's why I'm asking you to help

486
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,773
so that I may able to say
a proper goodbye. Mm?

487
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,297
You're in grave danger. Follow me. Quick.

488
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,300
Let go of me. I said, let go of me!

489
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,325
Did someone order you to find me?

490
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,201
Was it my father?

491
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,620
Huh?

492
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,960
Please let me go. Let me at least say
a proper goodbye to him.

493
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,841
Wait. Your Highness, is that you?

494
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,060
Oh, my god! What happened?

495
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,645
It's an arrow!

496
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,133
We have to get you to safety.

497
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,864
Please hurry back to the palace.

498
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,658
Why on earth is he trying to kill me?

499
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,993
No, wait. Is it me he's after?

500
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,537
Or is Dam-i the one he wants?

501
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,918
If it's Dam-i, why would he want her dead?

502
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,505
I'll answer your questions
once you're back at the palace.

503
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,058
Hurry!

504
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,977
Stop right now. I am…

505
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,413
No! Hold on!

506
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,767
Will you wait for me?

507
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,937
I will.
I won't leave until you come.

508
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,581
I'm afraid I must go
to the Office of Eunuchs.

509
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,417
Will you be all right on your own?

510
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,585
Huh?

511
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,129
Uh… Uh-huh.

512
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,940
WAIT

513
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,083
Your Highness!

514
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,752
Your Highness! Stop!

515
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,964
I mean, wait! Hold on!

516
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,801
Wait, wait! Hold on.

517
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,513
Please, stop!

518
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,557
Your Highness, stop!

519
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,644
Your Highness!

520
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,572
Your Highness.

521
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,408
Your Highness!

522
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:21,370
Your Highness!

523
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,217
LONGING

524
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:52,044
Please forgive me.
I was just following the Prince's order.

525
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,964
As of this moment,
you are the Prince.

526
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,300
Soon I will be going to Ming
for my studies.

527
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,720
And I will do my best while I am there.

528
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,724
Don't do anything that you aren't sure of.
That’s the rule here in my quarters.

529
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,935
Is the Crown Prince
really that temperamental?

530
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:08,936
You have no idea.

531
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:12,273
Just as you wish,
you will all take your last breaths today!

532
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,400
Calling him a dog
would be fitting.

533
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,735
The Crown Prince
seems to be hiding something.

534
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,072
For some reason,
there's a womanly mood to him.

535
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,116
You. You are…
