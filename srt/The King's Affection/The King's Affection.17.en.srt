1
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,872
Take it.

2
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,591
No, don't!

3
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,823
Commander Yoon…

4
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,451
Where is he?

5
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,122
He didn't make it.

6
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,630
But he told me
to make sure this was delivered to you.

7
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,904
Commander Yoon said that…

8
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,323
you two were friends.

9
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,827
He's resting peacefully by the stream…

10
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,872
that leads from Yanghwajin

11
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,333
right to Mount Jeoldu.

12
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,420
You should visit him.

13
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,735
Uncle, how are you even…

14
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,468
Your Majesty.

15
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,669
Father.

16
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,691
Get them!

17
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,656
Stop him!

18
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,121
Protect His Majesty.

19
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,499
What? Damn it.

20
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,610
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

21
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,903
Were you injured?

22
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,032
I'm okay.

23
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,161
What about the assassins, where are they?

24
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,829
Please forgive me.

25
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,086
My uncle. I'm sure he's responsible.

26
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,212
Wait, but…

27
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,049
Lord Changun died by suicide months ago.

28
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,223
It would be wise to keep this between us
for the time being.

29
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,976
Even if we say
my uncle is behind the attack,

30
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,812
no one would believe us anyway.

31
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,147
Of course, Your Majesty.

32
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,735
I will scout up ahead.
Follow me and stay alert.

33
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,924
EPISODE 17

34
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,474
Well, is His Majesty a woman?

35
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,685
I don't…

36
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,479
It seemed like it, but…

37
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,149
I don't know. Maybe not.

38
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,817
What?

39
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,408
Don't scare me like that.

40
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,411
Uh, well, you see,

41
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,955
Commander Jung came out of nowhere.

42
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,134
What do you mean Lord Changun
attacked His Majesty?

43
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,762
That's impossible.
We all know that he died.

44
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,639
I was thinking about that too.

45
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,725
It's not like he can come back to life.

46
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,194
Are you sure that you are
not injured at all, Your Majesty?

47
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,322
Mm-hm.

48
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,786
Why was Commander Jung there, though?

49
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,293
But wait. Do you think it's possible
that he's aware of your secret?

50
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,421
I don't think so… yet.

51
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,257
Even if he saw anything,

52
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,968
he wouldn't be able to tell anyone.

53
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,681
The fact that I exist
could very well be the thing that

54
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,017
brings him down as well.

55
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,854
He'll stay silent for no other reason

56
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,358
than to cover up his mistake.

57
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,735
I see.

58
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,324
Your Majesty,
Lord Jaeun shall enter.

59
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,300
Word is an assassin attacked
at Officer Yoon's burial site.

60
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,053
Yes.

61
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,558
However, the public can't know.
It will only lead to panic.

62
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,143
I understand.

63
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,148
Still, they say your uncle led the attack.
Is that true?

64
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,318
I know it seems impossible,

65
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,321
but I am certain of it.

66
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,907
I will look into this matter.

67
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,286
Lord Changun and my brother
have always been close,

68
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,706
so perhaps he is already aware.

69
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,625
Thank you for looking into it.

70
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,053
Were you also there
visiting Commander Yoon's grave?

71
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,226
Mother told me that you two
have been friends a long time.

72
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,315
Is His Majesty well?

73
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,609
Yes.

74
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,238
Let him know that I will report back

75
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,449
once I find out more.

76
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,243
Then will you also…

77
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,747
be informing Lord Sangheon?

78
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,880
You expect me to believe that

79
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,383
a man coming back from the dead?

80
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,969
Once I look into it,

81
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,056
if anyone has more to inform
the Chief State Counselor about this,

82
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,600
it should be His Majesty.

83
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,991
How was your conversation?

84
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,202
Does Commander Jung…

85
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:52,039
He was his usual calm self, so it's
probably likely he didn't see anything.

86
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,045
I see. Hmm. That's good to know.

87
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,350
Here you go.

88
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,770
The attack must have alarmed you.

89
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,105
This will help with that.

90
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,495
So, uh, I wanna ask about Kang Eun-seo.

91
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,665
Would it be all right if I suggest
that he stay at Samgaebang?

92
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,709
Samgaebang?

93
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,462
Yes. From what I can gather,
he needs time to heal.

94
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,131
There is no better place for that.

95
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,468
While he's there he can also help my
friends to look into the poisonous herb.

96
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,264
I have been worrying a lot
about him lately,

97
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,309
so that would definitely ease my mind.

98
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,235
Mm.

99
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,289
Have we met before, huh?

100
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,710
I was born in the Year of the Snake.

101
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,754
So I'll drop the formalities, okay?

102
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,382
No?

103
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,094
Uh, it was Ji-un who sent you here.

104
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,805
It was, wasn't it?
So you can make yourself at home.

105
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,850
Yeah?

106
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,394
I brought this for you.

107
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,897
The tea is sure to warm you up--

108
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,190
Oh!

109
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,869
Are you all right?

110
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,208
Uh, please let me know
if you like any more.

111
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,834
I've brewed an extra batch.

112
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,086
That'd be great.

113
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,550
Are you kidding?
Yeong-ji, this tea is not cheap!

114
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
Well, hurry up and drink.
It's time you earn your keep.

115
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,767
Okay?

116
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,812
Hurry. Come on. Now, now. Let's hurry.

117
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,210
Aah! Anyway, the palace
has lots of herbs suppliers,

118
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,295
but this is the largest.

119
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,341
Welcome. So what can I get for you today?

120
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,801
Oh, well…

121
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,805
From what I hear, you sell the good kind.
Isn't that right?

122
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,390
Good kind? For what?

123
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,392
The liver or for the eyes?

124
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,769
No, that's not what I mean.

125
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,815
You know. The sort of herb that's rare…

126
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,443
My lord, it is good to see you.

127
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,280
Have you brought in
the herbs that I requested?

128
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,961
As if you need to ask.

129
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,838
Uh, this way, my lord.

130
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,313
So, are they for the royal infirmary
or are they for Lord Sangheon?

131
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,607
They are actually for me this time.

132
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,195
Ah, I see. Well, we have a fresh batch
of dried foxglove and barberry root

133
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,113
which are of good quality.
Please take a look.

134
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,122
The umbilical cord of twins?

135
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,418
I happened to stumble on His Majesty's
while moving his placenta chamber.

136
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,879
According to the physician
who examined it,

137
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,798
it undoubtedly came from twins.

138
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,636
Are you saying that you
were not aware of this at all?

139
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,264
But that is preposterous.

140
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,767
The physician must be mistaken.

141
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,311
Twins within the royal family?

142
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,815
He should pay with his life
for even uttering those words.

143
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,817
You have him brought to me right away

144
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,778
and he will be punished severely
for insulting His Majesty.

145
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,905
Your Highness, please forgive me.

146
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,118
I did not mean to cause any disturbance.

147
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:46,208
It would be wise of you not to speak
of such preposterous matters either.

148
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,046
One might think you are hoping to lead
a rebellion against the King.

149
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,425
I would never hope for that.

150
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,931
I wish to see you
because I have been away for a while.

151
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,060
I apologize if this unnecessary concern
has troubled you, Grandmother.

152
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,119
The girl is dead, then?

153
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,290
His Majesty has ordered
the death of everyone

154
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,417
who knows about the twins,

155
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,086
so please bear that in mind.

156
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,508
This secret must be taken to the grave.

157
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,952
Why are you visiting
with the Grand Queen Dowager?

158
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,746
I would think you would know.

159
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,500
I have been away from the Capital,
so it is my duty to greet her.

160
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,046
I hope all is well with you.

161
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,007
Has His Majesty also been
in good health lately?

162
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,905
No. No, wait.
He's a woman. I'm certain of it.

163
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,950
Rather than attacking me,
the man took His Majesty in his arms.

164
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,328
Don't you think that's a little odd?
Unless he has a serious death wish.

165
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,207
-I need to get to the palace now.
-Are you out of your mind?

166
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,501
His Majesty was almost assassinated.

167
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,294
The palace must be on full alert.

168
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,963
Do not draw attention to yourself--

169
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,965
What if everything is quiet at the palace?

170
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,926
It would prove he is what you say he is.

171
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,096
Because he'll want to keep
today's attack a secret.

172
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:19,861
Anyway, what did you mean
about being able to

173
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,697
return to the Capital sooner than planned?

174
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,990
Uh…

175
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,495
Well, it seems as though things
will go better than I was expecting.

176
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,455
Ha.

177
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,141
By the way,
did you hear the rumor?

178
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,058
What?

179
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,310
No. What rumor?

180
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,769
His Majesty and the royal scribe,

181
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,772
someone saw them returning together
just before dawn.

182
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,149
Just before dawn?

183
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,775
-Together?
-Uh-huh!

184
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,193
Oh? Where did they go?

185
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,697
Who knows?
Probably a secret rendezvous point.

186
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,949
-Are you serious?
-No way! No way!

187
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,868
My goodness. Two of them together?

188
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,663
Hey, you know, that may be why he's been
avoiding sleeping with the Queen?

189
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,914
My gosh!

190
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,833
Right. I can't believe it.

191
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,044
-I thought so too. I know.
-I think that's pretty weird…

192
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,378
-So weird.
-No wonder.

193
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,758
Get back to work.

194
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,099
Are you saying that His Majesty
has been seeing Scribe Jung in private?

195
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,311
Someone saw them again
returning to the palace together.

196
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,855
They were spotted very early this morning.

197
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,359
But they seemed like more than
just a monarch

198
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,985
and his loyal servant.

199
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,278
That is because…

200
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,118
it is natural that a scribe should serve
His Majesty in close proximity.

201
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,203
Yeah.

202
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:56,166
Is it not odd that he requests two sets
of bedding when you sleep together?

203
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,753
Is it possible
His Majesty prefers men to women?

204
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,759
Quiet. You know I told you
about that in confidence.

205
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,386
But--

206
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,222
I have been fond of you
since before I came here.

207
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,266
But you should not relay
such ridiculous rumors to me.

208
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,400
No, that is preposterous thinking.

209
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,278
His Majesty obviously
cares about me a lot.

210
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,697
You saw for yourself, didn't you?

211
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,534
He sent refreshments
to enjoy with my friend.

212
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,453
Well, Scribe Jung was also there.

213
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,789
That was…

214
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,380
If you ever mention
absurd rumors like this again,

215
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,465
I will have you dismissed,
do you understand?

216
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,181
Wait? What? Prefers men?

217
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,184
The rumor has spread like fire
among the court maids

218
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,936
that he and Scribe Jung
have been intimate with each other.

219
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,604
That's enough of that!

220
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,066
Where you heard such a rumor is beyond me.

221
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,986
Lo… Look over there.

222
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,202
Look! There they are!

223
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,455
It looks like the rumors
were true after all.

224
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,040
There must be
something between them.

225
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,959
But a man with another man?

226
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,503
Rumor has it
they wander off together every night.

227
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,630
I wonder
what made him that way.

228
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,178
Wha… Uh…

229
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,557
What if this leads to more trouble?

230
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,350
Let me think.

231
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,104
Scandalous rumors regarding His Majesty
and a royal scribe?

232
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,272
This must be stopped.

233
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,358
We'll be done for
if this rumor spreads any more.

234
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,527
This must be stopped!

235
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,614
Jil-geum sought out
an herbal shop he suspected.

236
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,409
Kang Eun-seo will inform you
of their findings tonight,

237
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,078
so I will escort you to the shrine.

238
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,292
Your Majesty!

239
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,668
Your Majesty.

240
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,008
Your Majesty.

241
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,512
Chief Royal Secretary, what is this about?

242
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,555
Is there urgent business?

243
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,184
No, Your Majesty.
Uh, you must be out for a walk.

244
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,062
Uh, well, I…

245
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,355
What…

246
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:27,776
The weather is excellent today.
It is the perfect day to go for a walk.

247
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,655
Oh! Scribe Jung, did you not say
you had some business to attend to?

248
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,406
I have yet to conclude my report--

249
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,450
Scribe Jung, we need to speak with you.

250
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,369
-Wait, I…
-Yes, we should go talk now.

251
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,038
You see, the thing is…
So from the provincial city…

252
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,082
You know, it's so nice out,
we should do something…

253
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,002
Let go of me! What are you doing?

254
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,796
I haven't finished giving my report yet.

255
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,464
You need to stay away for your own good.

256
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,840
Wait. What are you talking about?

257
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,635
Salacious rumors about you
and His Majesty's relationship

258
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,428
are spreading all over the palace.

259
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,597
They say that the two of you are together.

260
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,727
-Together?
-You know, intimately.

261
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,448
I did not think too much of it

262
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,993
and just considered it gossip
that would fade away.

263
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,911
But if the Chief Royal Secretary knows,

264
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,914
it means that
all of the other officials do as well.

265
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,671
I think it would be a good idea
to stop seeing Scribe Jung for now.

266
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:36,678
If any of these were to get back
to Lord Sangheon somehow,

267
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:41,391
you and Scribe Jung will both be
in serious danger, you know that.

268
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,783
You are headed to the King's quarters
unannounced, Your Highness.

269
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,452
What do you plan to do?

270
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,871
Are you going to inquire
about the rumors--

271
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,956
I told you not to speak of that!

272
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,549
I just…

273
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,887
wanna see him even if it is from afar.

274
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,516
It will put my mind at ease.

275
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,152
What do you mean he's not here?

276
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,405
He said he wanted to go out
walking for a little bit.

277
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,367
I see.

278
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,746
Do you know which way he went,
by any chance?

279
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,248
Sorry. I don't.

280
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,514
At the herbal shop,

281
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,183
I saw the man
who was dressed as a royal physician.

282
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,646
Was it the man you spoke of?
The one who killed Eunuch Cho.

283
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,817
Yes, he's a royal physician
who goes by the name of Seo Seung-gyu.

284
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,111
I saw the scars.

285
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,570
The ones on his wrist.

286
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,155
On Seo Seung-gyu?

287
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,326
If we can find sonangcho there,

288
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,954
we can be certain
Lord Sangheon was behind it.

289
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,540
For now, I'll keep looking into it.

290
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,426
Seo Seung-gyu is the one responsible
for your well-being.

291
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,887
He must be stripped of his position
and arrested immediately.

292
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,308
If I were to actually do that

293
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,936
my grandfather would know
that something is going on.

294
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,566
For the time being,
I will keep a close eye on him.

295
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,528
Doing that will definitely be beneficial.

296
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,073
-However--
-Do not worry.

297
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,747
I will have Eunuch Hong find whatever
information he can about his whereabouts.

298
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,460
We should go.

299
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,088
I would like to do some digging
into the herbal shop,

300
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,340
the one that supplies the royal infirmary.

301
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,343
You should head out first.

302
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,347
I will stay here and leave
after a few moments.

303
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,770
It's not because of the rumors, is it?

304
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,691
I have caused you so much
unnecessary hostility.

305
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,067
Please forgive me.

306
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,029
Why would you think
you're responsible for any of this?

307
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,701
Silly rumors like this
don't faze me anymore.

308
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,120
So please do not worry.

309
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,375
When I said I'd endure
the consequences, I meant it.

310
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,721
Still…

311
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,309
it'd be wiser for us to be cautious
for the time being.

312
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,780
Uh…

313
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,911
Hold on. Why are you taking
this path at night? It's dangerous.

314
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,205
Which department do you serve anyway, huh?

315
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,959
Come on. Follow me.
I will escort you to a safer path.

316
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,502
-This way.
-Thank you…

317
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,087
Stay close, ladies.

318
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,381
My Queen, this is not--

319
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,633
Sorry, Your Majesty.

320
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,263
I should really be heading back
to my quarters now.

321
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,363
I am sorry to say,
but the Queen is already in bed.

322
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,160
Should I request
that she wake up to see you?

323
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,413
There is no need.

324
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:01,210
In the morning, would you
please tell her that I came to see her?

325
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,047
Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,458
Yu-gong.

327
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:47,256
What happened today should never
be repeated outside these walls.

328
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,925
Understand?

329
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,682
Are you feeling all right, Your Highness?

330
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,690
I truly believed…

331
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,611
that I really did not need that much.

332
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,659
All I wanted was for His Majesty
to hold my hand…

333
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,580
and have him acknowledge
the love I have for him.

334
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,629
I mean that was all I thought
that I needed.

335
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,257
Your Highness.

336
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,552
I just…

337
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,596
don't know what I should do.

338
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,142
What should I do?

339
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,038
Ooh!

340
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:54,175
A wicked rumor has been circulating
in the palace recently.

341
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,471
I have no idea how it even surfaced
in the first place.

342
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:06,020
However, I believe it has something
to do with there still being no heir.

343
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,273
Are you distancing yourself
from the Queen because

344
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,235
her father is loyal to Lord Sangheon?

345
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,323
Of course not.

346
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,621
I see. Well, I am sure
you are well aware of this,

347
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,541
but the Chief State Councilor
is a terrifying man.

348
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,752
If the rumors spread
while you remain childless,

349
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,838
he might suddenly turn against you.

350
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,715
So I urge you to proceed with caution.

351
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,718
Just keep your head down as they say.

352
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,471
GWAJEONBULNAPRI: DON'T DO ANYTHING
THAT CAN RAISE SUSPICION.

353
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,857
It will not do you any good
to keep Jung Ji-un by your side,

354
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,359
so I would suggest that you

355
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,029
find an excuse so you can
have him removed from here.

356
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,411
I do apologize for concerning you,
Grandmother.

357
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,163
However…

358
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,332
I will manage what goes on
in my own residence,

359
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,710
so please do not worry.

360
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:34,108
I gave orders to have
tea set up for you and your Queen.

361
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,444
Being seen together often

362
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,031
should help to make
these petty rumors subside.

363
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,826
You should go see her.

364
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,315
My Queen,

365
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,276
last night wasn't what--

366
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,529
I will not ask you to tell me
what is happening.

367
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,327
I will not pester you
for your affection anymore either.

368
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,120
Just…

369
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,376
allow me to produce your heir.

370
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,301
My Queen--

371
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,637
I am the Queen of this nation,
Your Majesty.

372
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,391
And as a wife and as the Queen,

373
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,852
let me at least fulfill
my responsibilities.

374
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,688
Additionally,

375
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,025
I would also urge you
to fulfill your responsibilities

376
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,069
as the King of this nation.

377
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,699
If you give me your word, I will…

378
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,578
not question anything ever again.

379
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,183
You must fancy a woman.

380
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,063
What is the meaning of this?

381
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,235
A bizarre rumor about His Majesty
and Scribe Jung has spread all over.

382
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,530
I know Jung Ji-un
is an old friend of yours…

383
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,409
so I say this out of my concern.

384
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,996
A man in love with the King.

385
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,167
How can one even comprehend that?

386
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,546
If you came here
just to relay a ridiculous rumor,

387
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,423
I would rather you leave.

388
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,719
I have no interest on absurd speculation
spread by clueless people.

389
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,142
I also heard a rumor.

390
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,729
A man resembling Lord Changun
was recently seen in the Capital.

391
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,316
You wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

392
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,155
I mean, you were the first
to inform everyone of his passing.

393
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,074
Come to think of it,

394
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,786
no one actually confirmed
that the body was Lord Changun's.

395
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,622
The funeral was quite rushed as well,

396
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:39,293
which makes me wonder
if it was just to cover something up.

397
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,797
Now look who's being ridiculous.

398
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,341
How can a dead man come back to life?

399
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,260
You say speculations don't interest you,

400
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,013
but I guess that's not absolutely true.

401
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,317
I would very much like…

402
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,738
to someday meet the woman
that ring is meant for.

403
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,382
Lord Wonsan,
I have news about Lord Changun.

404
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,426
It appears he snuck out
of the safe house again.

405
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,681
Go find him right this instant
before he's recognized.

406
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,932
Yes, my lord.

407
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,939
You have no idea
how much I missed this place!

408
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,441
Mm.

409
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,696
Do you want to hear something amusing?

410
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,489
Mm?

411
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,824
So what if…

412
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,118
Just what if

413
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,454
the king of this nation…

414
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,956
was actually a woman?

415
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,294
-No way!
-A woman? You've lost your mind!

416
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:07,590
Hold on! What if the prince

417
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,551
was born twins and swapped later?

418
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,637
-My gosh.
-And now we have a woman for a king.

419
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,139
That's absurd.

420
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,851
But it's the truth.

421
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,353
Pour me a drink, will you?

422
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,105
What is your name?

423
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,315
-It's So-wol.
-What?

424
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,358
-So-wol?
-Lord Changun.

425
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,652
I had too much to eat.

426
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,112
How is a dead man…

427
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,655
Hey!

428
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,594
Lord Changun died from falling,
did he not?

429
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,097
Yes, my lord.

430
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,560
Apparently, he was spotted alive recently.

431
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,650
Look into it and get back to me.

432
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,193
Yes, my lord.

433
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,278
That reminds me.

434
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,493
Your son must be incredibly loyal
to His Royal Majesty.

435
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,748
Being seen so often
by his side in close proximity…

436
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,503
could easily cause the spread of rumors.

437
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,927
My trust in you is the only reason
I gave him that position.

438
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:39,765
Do not disappoint me anymore.

439
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,354
I will keep that in mind, my lord.

440
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,695
Is it him?

441
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,655
-He's here.
-Are you sure it's him?

442
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,949
-I honestly thought he would stay away.
-But he's here.

443
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,577
Shut your mouths right this instant.

444
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,251
Allow me to take those
to His Majesty tonight.

445
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,886
Your Majesty, the reports have arrived.

446
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,231
Could we perhaps talk?

447
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,646
It'd be best if you just stay away
for the time being.

448
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,315
Last night, Her Majesty the Queen…

449
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,986
Well, there was an issue.

450
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,365
His Majesty is feeling troubled as it is,

451
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,783
so it's best if you…

452
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,577
if you refrained
from visiting his quarters.

453
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,083
That I will.

454
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,153
I have to… leave?

455
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:04,451
The Grand Queen Dowager and
the royal elders have sent me to tell you

456
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:10,416
after they had voiced their concerns about
the… the rumors of you and His Majesty.

457
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:17,089
I am well aware
that I have no right to even say this,

458
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,716
but…

459
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:24,346
if your love for His Majesty
is truly built upon loyalty,

460
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,099
please…

461
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,227
leave the palace on your own accord.

462
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,648
Your Highness, but I--

463
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,358
His Majesty can no longer be

464
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,902
frowned upon by his elders

465
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,572
all because of the rumors
that you have caused to circulate.

466
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,211
You're home later than usual.

467
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,012
I had work at the palace.

468
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,890
Really? You were only there for work?

469
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,101
Huh?

470
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,148
Yes.

471
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,902
Why do you ask me that?

472
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,573
It's nothing. Just get some rest.

473
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,007
A marriage proposal, you say.

474
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,259
With my daughter, you mean, Commander?

475
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,553
Yes, that is correct.

476
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,432
You should leave us.

477
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,207
I'm sure you're aware of the fact that

478
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,793
she participated
in the Crown Princess selection.

479
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,671
Which is why I do not understand

480
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,173
why you're before me
suggesting this marriage.

481
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,302
Actually, that is exactly
why this matrimony

482
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,054
could benefit both of our families.

483
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,225
Was this suggested by Lord Sangheon?

484
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,438
If you intend to use this

485
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,525
as just another pawn
in your political game, then I--

486
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,026
Absurd rumors…

487
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,822
regarding my son had been circulating
within the palace.

488
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,827
With this marriage,
we can put these rumors to bed.

489
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,989
Father.

490
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,284
I…

491
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,246
want to join his family. Commander Jung's.

492
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,834
I have loved his son for a while.

493
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,464
My feelings I have for him were
strong enough to make me wanna give up…

494
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,342
on ever being the Crown Princess.

495
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,302
So-eun…

496
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,847
Please just let me marry him, Father.

497
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,573
I will ask my husband
to write the marriage letter soon.

498
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,241
Please take care of the rest.

499
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,369
Yes, my lady. Please do not worry.

500
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,164
I will prepare only the best gifts
the Capital has to offer.

501
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,416
Care to tell me what this is about?

502
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,837
You should get going.

503
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,384
Shall we?

504
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,017
A marriage letter?

505
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,730
Your father told me the news.
The bride's family also approves of you.

506
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,109
They will ignore it all,

507
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,404
so please do this.

508
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,158
I don't know what you heard about
the situation, but it's not true.

509
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,120
That is not who I am.

510
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,122
I swear to you.

511
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,083
Uh, then how can you…

512
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,003
explain how such a rumor exists?

513
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,590
Start a family of your own.

514
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,636
So people will forget.
Marry the young lady, have a child.

515
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,597
And just live a normal life, all right?

516
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,892
You were the person who always told me
to follow my heart.

517
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,311
Yes, I did.

518
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,731
But I didn't mean this.

519
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:30,027
This could cost you your life.
And for what?

520
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,072
I can endure the ridicule

521
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,909
and the humiliation that I received
because of what you've done.

522
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,537
But I can't watch you suffer.

523
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,915
I can't do it and I won't.

524
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,752
Mother.

525
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,479
Follow me.

526
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,033
You will not have to write
the marriage letter.

527
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,576
For I…

528
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,245
will not do it.

529
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,039
Your opinion is irrelevant.

530
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,001
The girl's family has agreed
to the marriage already.

531
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,215
I swear to you, it's only a rumor.

532
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,884
Why are you being so extreme about it?

533
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,260
Are you sure…

534
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,387
it's just a rumor?

535
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,311
I know that…

536
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,064
His Majesty is…

537
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,067
actually a woman.

538
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,282
What do you… mean?

539
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,409
There is no need for you to lie to me.

540
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,204
I already know about everything.

541
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,416
So do as I say.

542
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,460
If you choose to disobey,

543
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:15,924
then I might not be able to keep
this secret buried.

544
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,760
And what is that supposed to mean?

545
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,430
-You'll what?
-I will kill her.

546
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,519
Because that is the only way
to protect you and our family.

547
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,230
To protect us…

548
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,609
Are you saying
you will commit treason, Father?

549
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,405
How can it be treason

550
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,783
when His Majesty is a woman?

551
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,288
You will go through with this wedding

552
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,999
because you have no other choice to make.

553
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,056
Lord Changun has been found, my lord.

554
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,160
-Uncle, stop now!
-Would you stop if you were me?

555
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,204
I'm dead if I get caught!

556
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,973
Damn it!

557
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,066
Spare me, please.

558
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,985
This is all Prince Wonsan's doing!

559
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,321
He said faking my death
could bring down His Majesty.

560
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,325
The attack on His Majesty
was also orchestrated by him.

561
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,827
I swear it wasn't my idea.

562
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,997
I just wanted to confirm
His Majesty is actually a woman.

563
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,915
Really?

564
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,421
Uh… Ta… take me to Lord Sangheon instead.

565
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,299
Okay? I'll tell him everything, huh?

566
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,971
What… what are you doing?

567
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,597
Why are you doing this?

568
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,151
I'm hurt.

569
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,490
Just wait! Wait!

570
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,534
Don't you know who I am, huh?

571
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,953
I am His Majesty's uncle!

572
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,966
Please spare me.

573
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,302
Let me live this once

574
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,595
and I will do whatever you ask.

575
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,889
Tell me to do tricks

576
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,474
or to crawl on my hands and knees.

577
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:16,646
Look, watch. Look, see? I'll do anything.

578
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,898
Please.

579
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,276
Please let me go just this once. Please.

580
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,029
The truth you have discovered…

581
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,073
will be buried alongside you.

582
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,813
What?

583
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:03,276
Do you think that I would not
be able to kill His Majesty?

584
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,990
Father. Father, please.

585
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,535
After the wedding,
you will leave the Capital.

586
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,330
You can be a physician
or whatever you want.

587
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,290
And I will not interfere. I promise.

588
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,127
Don't you think
you're taking this all too far?

589
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,254
Couldn't you…

590
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,592
just let His Majesty's secret…

591
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,595
stay buried forever?

592
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,515
Do you honestly not know what will happen

593
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,059
once Lord Sangheon finds out the truth?

594
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,106
Just do as I say.

595
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,066
And if you don't,

596
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,487
I will not be able to protect you
or His Majesty anymore.

597
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,374
Who is the wedding for?

598
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,379
So-eun will be marrying Jung Ji-un,

599
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,715
the firstborn son of Commander Jung.

600
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,076
No way.

601
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,496
It's not possible.

602
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,746
I was wondering…

603
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,832
why did you not come by today?

604
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,460
You didn't deliver the royal reports.

605
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,255
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

606
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,886
I have something I have to tell you,
Your Majesty.

607
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,184
I am…

608
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,229
going to get married.

609
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,114
Why, though?

610
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,703
If it's because of the rumors
that are going around,

611
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,539
don't go through with it.

612
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,251
We knew that this was
going to be difficult and--

613
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,127
This is the choice that I have made.

614
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,093
Then…

615
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,555
that's what you really want.

616
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,685
How can you just lie to me like that?

617
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,397
Why on earth
are you going through with this?

618
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,524
Please just tell me

619
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:33,027
why all of a sudden you have
a complete change of heart.

620
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:41,286
We've been able to stay strong
through so much until right now.

621
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,746
So what is it?

622
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,000
Is there a reason why…

623
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,461
you cannot just tell me then?

624
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,299
I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.

625
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,053
And this is the only way I'm able to…

626
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,141
be sure I can make that happen.

627
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,728
So what are you saying then?

628
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,273
If you don't wish to lose me, why--

629
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,274
This is…

630
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:17,488
I think this is where
I should say goodbye, Majesty.

631
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,338
Stop! Don't you dare leave!

632
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,468
I didn't say…

633
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,055
that we were finished here,
you can't leave.

634
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,775
Stop now!

635
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,696
I order you.

636
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,666
Forgive me,

637
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,335
Your Majesty.

638
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,578
Your wedding plans,
how are they coming along?

639
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,621
Well…

640
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,415
How could you make her care for you

641
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,292
when your feelings
are completely shallow and selfish, huh?

642
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,251
How dare you!

643
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,463
Your Highness,
please forgive me. I told him everything.

644
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,048
What? How could you disobey
my direct order like that?

645
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,301
And what would be next
after you meet with Lord Sangheon?

646
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:47,054
A woman cannot be King.
I will take back what's rightfully mine.

Sonangcho,
have you heard anything else?

648
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,477
I will do whatever is necessary
to protect His Majesty.

649
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,103
Trust in me, okay?

650
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,898
-Your Majesty.
-I will not die.
