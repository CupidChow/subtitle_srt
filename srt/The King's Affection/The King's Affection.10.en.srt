LIST OF COURT MAIDS

2
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,158
YEAR OF IMJIN

3
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,243
"Year of Imjin."

4
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,873
And widen your stance.

5
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,625
Who are you?

6
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,420
It's me, Hyun.

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,048
Hyun?

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,344
YANG SUN-JI

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,229
DAY 21 OF MONTH 4,
LEFT THE PALACE DUE TO ILLNESS

13
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,022
She left due to an illness?

14
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,150
Are there records on what illness it was?

15
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,362
Sadly, this is all we have
on that girl Dam-i.

16
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,571
Usually,

17
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,574
the records feature a short description
of what illness it was.

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,245
But for some reason,
there's no record of it in this case.

19
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,206
But may I ask why you wish to know?

20
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,415
It's nothing.

21
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,714
DAM-I

22
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,571
The Crown Prince had
the book I gave to the girl.

23
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,364
The Crown Prince?

24
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,717
No one can match his anti-climactic ways.

25
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,017
So was that the reason, Your Highness?

26
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,789
I thought I dreamt it.

27
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,083
But no…

28
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,630
it wasn't…

29
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,132
STAY, LONGING

30
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,259
…just a dream, though.

31
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,309
I'll believe you if you tell me that…
the feelings were momentary.

32
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,477
But…

33
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,648
but they aren't for me.

34
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,068
It's not regard from your subject.

35
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,861
I thought it was my loyalty to you.

36
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,489
Instead, it was my affection.

37
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,329
Deep affection, Your Highness.

38
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,377
Although you're a man
and also the Crown Prince of this nation,

39
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,837
I know…

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,469
I'm in love with you.

41
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
Royal Tutor Jung.

42
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,544
You and I…

43
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,172
You and I cannot be together.

44
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,343
I am the Crown Prince of this nation,

45
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,930
and you are my tutor and my subject.

46
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,391
I will endure it.

47
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,478
Whatever people say of it… No, wait.

48
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,106
Whatever you say about it,

49
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,775
I'm sure I can,

50
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,279
and I will endure it.

51
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't…

52
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,046
feel the same way.

53
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,590
Whatever you think
you felt from me that night,

54
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,800
I ask you to please…

55
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,845
just let it all go.

56
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,764
-Your Highness.
-Also, we never…

57
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,933
had this conversation.

58
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,389
EPISODE 10

59
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,642
JASEONDANG

60
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,871
Maybe,

61
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,167
everything would have been better
if we had never met again.

62
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,630
Because that way…

63
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,925
we wouldn't
have to go through all this pain.

64
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,417
YEON-SEON

65
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,674
Ji-un!

66
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,301
Come out!

67
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,802
Hurry up! Come on!

68
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,180
What is it?

69
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,874
What brings you here?

70
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,627
I didn't know you were a late riser.

71
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,130
Can't you see the sun
fully risen in the sky right now?

72
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,353
What do you mean
His Highness isn't at the palace?

73
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,273
I'm sure he knows that the Queen Dowager
is coming this afternoon.

74
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,193
He does know. He is aware,

75
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,446
but, uh, something urgent came up.

76
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,282
How on earth
could you allow him to leave here?

77
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,078
Where did His Highness go?

78
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,540
Now I have to go and I have to
escort him back to the palace.

79
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,544
He went out in disguise, undercover.

80
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,879
Naturally, he didn't have a destination.

81
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,633
However, his bodyguard went with him.

82
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,344
So you don't have to worry about it.

83
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:18,307
And I told Kim Ga-on
to stay very close to the Crown Prince.

84
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,059
Now he's doing everything I ask.

85
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:42,164
Come on. You cannot enter
the Prince's quarters just for today.

86
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,374
Understand?

87
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,336
Better yet, you should, um, go home
for the day.

88
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,963
And if anyone asks,

89
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,215
you went to the market
with the Crown Prince.

90
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,967
Understand?

91
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,387
If Court Lady Kim sees you,
you and I are dead meat.

92
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,222
Wait, Bok-dong. What?

93
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,393
Lord Jaeun.

94
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,438
Did His Highness really leave the palace?

95
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,732
It's not what you think.

96
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
Enjoy.

97
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,544
Aren't you going to eat?

98
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,716
Uh… sure.

99
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,427
Ah. Just a moment.

100
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,813
It's ready now.

101
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,233
But…

102
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,986
what made you come here to see me?

103
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,449
I doubt you came all this way
just to sit and have soup.

104
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,828
Actually, I did.

105
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,167
I just couldn't stop… thinking
about this soup.

106
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,254
Do you, um, mean that?

107
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,343
The soup will get cold. We should eat now.

108
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,048
A bag of that, please.

109
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
Can you buy this for me?

110
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,554
Oh. Sure.

111
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,150
Look at that.
He's grinning from ear to ear.

112
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,444
Yep, quite the resemblance.

113
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,446
Is that so?

114
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,619
How is your hat doing today,
Royal Tutor Jung?

115
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,833
Oh. It's, uh, it's all right, I believe.

116
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,251
Glad to hear that.

117
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,905
The flowers have bloomed beautifully.

118
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,074
Yes, beautifully indeed.

119
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,022
All right. Does anyone wanna try it?

120
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,566
Who wants to try?

121
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,319
Your Highness.

122
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,824
Come on, everyone.
Let's give him a round of applause!

123
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,954
One, two, three!

124
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,334
Are you all right?

125
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,338
Everyone,
give him a round of applause!

126
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,889
Here I go!

127
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm flying!

128
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,913
Would you like to try the swing?

129
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

130
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,752
Oh, no. That's only for women.

131
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,714
Over here!
Someone wants to try out the swing.

132
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,720
Are you out of your mind, huh?

133
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,055
Who says that it's only for women?

134
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,559
A swing is fun for everyone.

135
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,063
My lord, try it. It's very fun.

136
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,982
Wait. No. I…

137
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,275
Come on. Try it.

138
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,986
-Go on.
-Try it!

139
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,482
He's good.

140
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,708
Goodness. I can't believe I got
to ride a swing, thanks to you.

141
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,460
What a weird experience.

142
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,756
Well, Your Highness, thanks to you,
I got to use up my energy too.

143
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,135
Strange day, no?

144
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,764
Must you really have the last word
just because we're outside the palace?

145
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,600
Hey, no way, Your Highness.

146
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,854
It's all a misunderstanding.

147
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,149
Look.

148
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,236
I see an eagle over the mountain.

149
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,196
Over there.

150
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,587
Look, over there.
We should stay under that roof.

151
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,505
Oh.

152
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,854
Your Highness, your robe is all wet.

153
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,897
I wouldn't want you to catch a cold.

154
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,733
Uh… you don't need to.

155
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,350
Your Royal Highness, please tell me…

156
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,729
the real reason why…

157
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,732
you came to visit me today.

158
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:07,539
Sometimes, I think about how it would be
to live a normal life like them.

159
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,834
Being able to laugh

160
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,589
and also to cry, without worrying
whenever they want to.

161
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,678
It's impossible to be true to myself…

162
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,599
when I'm in the palace.

163
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,148
I've lived my whole life
in constant competition.

164
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,818
Constantly trying
to meet every expectation.

165
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,028
And the future…

166
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,824
will be no different from how it is now.

167
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,500
People may envy me
for being the Crown Prince.

168
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,755
I envy the lives
of the people outside the palace.

169
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,759
They enjoy life to their heart's content…

170
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,638
without having to worry
about what others think.

171
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,936
Why don't you that too, Your Highness?

172
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,732
You can laugh like today,

173
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,652
and even cry at times.

174
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,322
At least with me, you know.

175
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,586
Thank you for everything.

176
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,048
Thanks to you,

177
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,302
I was happy
even if it was just for one day.

178
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,179
Your Highness…

179
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,124
I've arranged a better position
for you at the palace.

180
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,005
I believe that taking that position
will be a good opportunity for you.

181
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,507
Are you…

182
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,136
ordering me to leave?

183
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,474
You can criticize me for being selfish.

184
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,226
I will soon…

185
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,355
have a wife of my own,

186
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,274
once the royal wedding is finalized.

187
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,153
This is…

188
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,115
my own way of dealing with…

189
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,911
your feelings for me.

190
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,856
You must have had
a tough day, Your Highness.

191
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,485
Hyun.

192
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,739
Some days are like that.

193
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,533
I know…

194
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,911
because my day was tough too.

195
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,660
I suspect that you will have
more use for it, Hyun.

196
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,247
When the time does come,
and a special someone steals your heart,

197
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,373
you should give it to them.

198
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,224
Did you just arrive at the palace?

199
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,935
Yes, Your Highness.

200
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,277
You were caught in the rain yesterday.
Are you all right?

201
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,989
Yes. I'm all right.

202
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,211
Are you headed somewhere?

203
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,425
Royal wedding planning.
I'm on my way to meet my father.

204
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,638
I see.

205
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,098
Let's go.

206
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:54,089
Father, I… I would like to get married.

207
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,843
I thought we had already discussed this.

208
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,849
Your Majesty,
the refreshments are ready.

209
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,755
I heard you enjoy chrysanthemum tea
around this time of the year.

210
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,440
Your mother also liked chrysanthemum tea.

211
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,526
But…

212
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,030
I never had the chance
to brew tea for her.

213
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,125
Son, do you know the reason why
I keep advocating against your marriage?

214
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,296
Is it because marriage is a big step,

215
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,465
and you don't think I'm ready to take it?

216
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:25,764
Well, I was around you age
when I finally got married.

217
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,436
I started a family at a young age.

218
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,813
So I didn't know…

219
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,192
how precious it was or how to protect it.

220
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,278
Because of that…

221
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,156
I wasn't able to…

222
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,619
properly protect my family then.

223
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,294
I just…

224
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,091
didn't want you
to make the same mistakes that I did.

225
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,555
If I look at you as the Prince,

226
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,226
I do have to admit
that your grandmother is right.

227
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,228
But you are also my son,

228
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,607
so what I wanted
was just to buy you some time.

229
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,158
Do you… truly want to get married now?

230
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,289
Yes.

231
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,793
I truly want to get married.

232
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,135
As the Crown Prince,

233
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,722
your marriage
is not the same as a nobleman's.

234
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,350
It is an important union
that defines the fate of Joseon.

235
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm sure you…

236
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,189
understand what that signifies.

237
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,372
I examined the body three times so far,

238
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,291
but I didn't find anything unusual.

239
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,095
What about the right shoulder fracture
you mentioned?

240
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,473
After he was hit by the arrow
he fell from about five feet.

241
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,767
So it's likely
that the fracture is a result of that.

242
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,235
Commander Yoon, a soldier
from one of the Five Central Armies,

243
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,695
is asking for you.

244
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,536
I heard that we already

245
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,080
collected the accounts
from everyone at the royal hunting.

246
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,918
Well, I was on extended sick leave
due to a medical condition.

247
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,587
So I was likely omitted
from the list for testimonies.

248
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,839
Okay.

249
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,549
What is it that you wanna tell me then?

250
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,053
The man that was considered the suspect
did not have the capacity to kill.

251
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,181
I'm one of the people
who are happy to see him dead,

252
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,310
but he definitely couldn't have tried
to kill His Royal Highness.

253
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,020
It just doesn't make any sense.

254
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,990
Shoot.

255
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,040
His shoulder was injured?

256
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,750
Three days before we got selected,

257
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,461
he got into a fight
when we were drinking together.

258
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,630
He injured his right shoulder
that evening, sir.

259
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,340
So he couldn't even lift a bow.

260
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,259
But he somehow
shot at the Crown Prince?

261
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,220
That just didn't sit well with me.

262
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,471
Shoot.

263
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,307
Next.

264
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,898
Get ready.

265
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,787
Shoot.

266
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,204
Who are you?

267
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,102
Commander Yoon. What brings you here?

268
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,520
Tell me, where is Kim Ga-on?

269
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,649
He headed to the King's quarters
a while ago to see His Majesty.

270
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,235
What did you say? The King's quarters?

271
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,023
I'm Kim Ga-on.

272
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,490
Announce it.

273
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,369
Your Majesty,
Commander Yoon asks for an audience.

274
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,205
Let him in.

275
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,515
What brings you here this late?

276
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,768
There's something I have to report.

277
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,270
But I will wait outside, Your Majesty.

278
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,315
All right. It'll be just a moment.

279
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,387
I heard that you are
the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

280
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,807
So, has it been going smoothly?

281
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,518
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,062
I noticed a tally on your sword

283
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,356
when you handed it over to my eunuch.

284
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,276
Was it from your betrothed?

285
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,319
TALLY: MADE OF STONE, BAMBOO, OR JADE,
SPLIT IN HALF AND USED FOR IDENTIFICATION

286
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,488
It's a keepsake from my late father.

287
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
I see.

288
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,746
Continue doing your utmost
to guard the Crown Prince.

289
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,501
There was a murder
in the Ministry of War just now.

290
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,756
How could there be a murder
in one of our six ministries?

291
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,882
Did you catch the culprit?

292
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,010
That man, Kim Ga-on.

293
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,471
Something's suspicious about him.

294
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,848
What do you mean?

295
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,314
So His Majesty
has finally come around

296
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,525
and given his blessing
for the royal marriage?

297
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,570
This will impact
the fate of our entire nation.

298
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,782
He knew that the Crown Prince
had to fulfill his duty soon.

299
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,409
And did he happen to say anything else?

300
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,537
A lady will be selected

301
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:38,000
at the Crown Prince's quarters,
and she'll be the future queen of Joseon.

302
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,419
As a royal family elder,

303
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,673
I will be the one
to choose the wisest and kindest lady.

304
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,258
So you don't have to worry.

305
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,761
Of course, you should be the one
to choose.

306
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:52,556
So, I would like
to recommend a suitable woman.

307
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,435
Someone who could be helpful to me,

308
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,647
to you and even to the Crown Prince,

309
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,274
should we need it in our future endeavors.

310
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,571
How pretty. Where did you get it?

311
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,073
My father bought me this.

312
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,991
What do you think?

313
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,159
It looks like mine.

314
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,580
I'm so nervous.

315
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,874
You don't want to be
in the selection process?

316
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,420
I don't think I'm quite ready
to participate in the selection yet.

317
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,176
This isn't about
whether you are ready or not.

318
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,178
This is all for our nation.

319
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,264
I heard that they already

320
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,600
have someone in mind,
and the selections are a mere decorum.

321
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,146
That means that even if I do
participate in the process,

322
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,647
no one would notice that I'm there.

323
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,150
Women who are selected
within the top three

324
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,402
will have to remain chaste
for the rest of their lives.

325
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,863
I do not wish to lead such a life.

326
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,284
I'm asking you father,
please don't put my name in the process.

327
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,374
The law says you must participate,
therefore, you will have to do so.

328
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:05,004
Don't try to make your father
convert into a disloyal subject.

329
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,925
-So-eun.
-Huh?

330
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,474
Here, just for your eyes. Take it.

331
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,559
What's this?

332
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,857
The questions for the first round
of the selection process.

333
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,823
I wanna be chosen, but that doesn't mean
I should keep this from you either.

334
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,998
I don't need it. But thank you.

335
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,500
Are you sure about it?

336
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,298
Please follow me.

337
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,469
-Let's go.
-Mm-hmm.

338
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,168
I'm Jeong-hui, the eldest daughter
of Deputy Magistrate Moon Jeong-hak

339
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,920
at Hanseong Magistracy.

340
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,591
I am So-eun, the eldest daughter
of Shin Yeong-su,

341
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,009
Minister of Personnel.

342
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,429
I'm Ha-gyeong,

343
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,478
the second-eldest daughter
of No Hak-su, the Minister of War.

344
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,773
I'm Yeon-hui, the second-eldest daughter

345
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,235
of Han Gyu-seong, the director
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

346
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,029
A certain
high ranking governor

347
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,699
once proposed a test to three ladies.

348
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,120
They had to endure one month
with just half a bag of rice.

349
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,539
One ate all of the rice
and when she ran out,

350
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,291
she gave up on the test.

351
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,918
Another lady
ate the rice little by little,

352
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,421
but she gave up, as she was still hungry.

353
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,300
The third endured through the whole month
without even having to eat the rice

354
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,509
she was given.

355
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,304
What did the third lady do?

356
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,357
She made rice cakes
with the rice she had and then sold them.

357
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,403
Then she bought some more rice
with the money she made.

358
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,038
That is correct.

359
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:50,794
That being said, would you be able
to say that the lady's behavior was fair?

360
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,464
Couldn't one argue that the lady cheated?

361
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,384
Well…

362
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,615
Did the governor
mention any rules that forbade that?

363
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,910
No, he didn't.

364
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,037
In that case, the third lady didn't cheat.

365
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,581
In order to pass the test,

366
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,334
she put her skills
in making rice cakes into good use.

367
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,670
She did her best
so she wouldn't have to give up.

368
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,755
How could that be considered cheating?

369
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,094
That's a brilliant answer.

370
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,513
So-eun, isn't that right?

371
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,433
Yes, Your Highness.

372
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,734
Do you mean to tell me
you want my daughter to be the princess?

373
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,702
When you first
started working for me,

374
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,954
do you remember what you told me?

375
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:13,961
You said you would become a subject
who would keep the royal court grounded…

376
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,924
without being swayed
by any biases or personal interests.

377
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,260
That is what you said.

378
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,179
I do remember, Your Majesty.

379
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,599
Even to this day,
my goal still remains the same.

380
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,727
-However--
-Now is the time…

381
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,606
for you to show me
that you meant what you said.

382
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,679
Oh.

383
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,348
Tutor Jung was kind enough
to spare some for me.

384
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:25,449
My father hasn't come home from his post
at the Ministry of Personnel.

385
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,952
Yes, I'm aware.

386
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,916
I didn't come here to see your father.
I actually came here to see you.

387
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,168
Really? Why is that?

388
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,256
We're more connected than I thought.

389
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,343
Had I known that we would meet again,

390
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,679
I wouldn't have lied
about my identity that day.

391
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,516
I'm sorry if I surprised you.

392
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,851
No, Your Highness.

393
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,022
Please forgive me
if I possibly offended you in any way.

394
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,734
Your Highness.

395
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:11,328
I can feel a sense of grace
and honesty from this house.

396
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,497
It's much like your father's character.

397
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,712
It's a cool day, so would…

398
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,508
you possibly care
to come with me on a short walk?

399
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,363
When you were around ten years old,
when you daydreamed,

400
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,074
what kind of husband
did you imagine having?

401
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,702
Sorry?

402
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:59,418
When I was ten years old,
I used to stand under a pine tree

403
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,503
on the grounds of the palace.

404
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,883
I would dream of having
someone by my side who would…

405
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,137
walk with me even through thorny roads.

406
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,890
Someone who…

407
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,059
endures the hardships of life.

408
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,857
The Minister of Personnel
will help you.

409
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,902
Having him on your side will be…

410
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,988
very helpful to you in your future.

411
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,077
So I wanted

412
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,998
to ask you if you would be so kind
as to walk that path with me.

413
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,259
It will most likely be,

414
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,220
either Minister Shin's
or Minister No's daughter.

415
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,431
Why don't we make a bet? Huh?

416
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,642
I will bet on Minister No's daughter.

417
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,854
Minister Shin is the symbol of integrity
and the leader of Confucian scholars.

418
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,398
Lord Sangheon will never approve of him.

419
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,902
Sure. Then I will bet
on Minister Shin's daughter.

420
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,405
Do you really think that His Majesty
wouldn't object to accepting

421
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,199
Minister No's daughter,
when everyone knows

422
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,076
Minister No always
sides with Lord Sangheon?

423
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,578
Don't you agree, Royal Tutor Jung?

424
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,833
Tutor Jung! Tutor Jung!

425
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,878
Is it true?

426
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,590
Did the Crown Prince
truly recommend your name for a promotion?

427
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,301
Huh?
So where are you getting transferred to?

428
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,972
Censor General? Huh? Inspector General?

429
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,766
Where is your next post?

430
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,144
Nothing like that, no.

431
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,231
Come on. Don't keep things from me.
Just tell me.

432
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,609
No big deal, I'm not that petty.
You know that. Right?

433
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,819
So, uh, what is it?

434
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,029
Is it something big?

435
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,909
I'm sorry,
but I'll head out a bit early today.

436
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,538
Don't be like that, Royal Tutor Jung.

437
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,540
Just tell me. Royal Tutor Jung!

438
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,836
Is he looking down on me
just 'cause he's getting a promotion

439
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,337
and I'm not?

440
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,048
Oh. Oh, my heart!

441
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,133
Oh, my goodness!

442
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,552
Royal Scholar Yang.

443
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,479
I'm not sure…

444
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,816
if I'll be able to meet the expectations.

445
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,943
And this is all very sudden too.

446
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,786
You…

447
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,458
you already have feelings
for another person, don't you?

448
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,630
Please forgive me.

449
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,556
I did come all the way here,

450
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,018
so I'm sure you understand
that I can't give up that easily.

451
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,688
So-eun, we'll meet again soon.

452
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,063
Why are you here this late?

453
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,903
I just left Minister Shin's house.

454
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,864
The woman you were with the other day…

455
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,909
was Minister Shin's daughter.

456
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,833
I went to see if she would
accept the offer to be my wife…

457
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:15,632
despite the fact that I knew
that she had crossed paths with you.

458
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,221
I understand, Your Highness.

459
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,602
Have you given some thought to what I had…

460
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,148
offered the other evening?

461
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,443
If you want, I can even
recommend you to a better position.

462
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,195
Whenever I see your face…

463
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,575
I feel like talking to you
out of the blue.

464
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,455
When I'm not expecting to see you,
I feel that…

465
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,375
even more.

466
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,551
When you offered another position, I…

467
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,138
felt like you were asking me
to leave the palace too.

468
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,978
Your Highness, is that something that…
that you actually want?

469
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,278
-Because if it's not, will you--
-I also…

470
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,284
had a hard time telling you those things.

471
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,789
I thought that you,
of all people, would understand that.

472
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,668
I guess it turns out that I was wrong.

473
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,424
Now I finally see that.

474
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,469
The flowers have bloomed beautifully.

475
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,791
Wasn't it supposed to be Royal Tutor Park?

476
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,295
I asked Tutor Park
to switch our lectures just for today.

477
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,924
So I guess there's…
there's no lecture today, then.

478
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,634
You said…

479
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,096
that you wanted to hear my answer.

480
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,559
I will give you an answer afterwards…

481
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,479
because this will be

482
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,607
our last lecture together before I leave.

483
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,784
"Sisinyail, hwachwijoya."

484
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,204
"Even if the trees
are laid out evenly,

485
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,873
the drought will find a way to invade."

486
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,835
"Pyeongjiyail, suchwiseupya."

487
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,588
"Even if the ground is flat,

488
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,550
water will find a way to spread."

489
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:33,056
"Chomokjusaeng, geumsuguneon."

490
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,725
"Similar plants
will find a way to grow together

491
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,728
just like animals
of a similar species do."

492
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,482
"Mulgakjonggiryuya, sigo

493
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,236
jiljeokjangigungsijieon."

494
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,949
"All things are bound to find their own."

495
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:54,702
"Therefore, an arrow finds its place

496
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,204
only when a target is set."

497
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,252
I will be your tutor starting from today.

498
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,629
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

499
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,989
So that means the lotus seed
will bloom into a flower soon.

500
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,744
I look forward to working
for you until then, Your Highness.

501
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,332
Allow me…

502
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,794
to answer that question.

503
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,262
Like the rain
that falls when it's needed most,

504
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:58,349
I'd like to be there
when you need me the most, as well.

505
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,730
Just like you were for me
when I needed you the most.

506
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:13,490
If I could, I'd like to keep helping you.

507
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,921
"Limmokmoi bugeunjieon

508
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,799
suseongeumi jungjosikeon."

509
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,806
"When the trees are dense
the axe is drawn."

510
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,728
"And when the shade is wide,
the birds fly in."

511
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,620
DAEHAKJANGGU

512
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,383
Now, as you said before…

513
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,302
you have to tell me,

514
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,888
what is your answer to my offer.

515
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:25,311
There's somewhere…
I wanna take you, if I may.

516
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,390
Do you remember?

517
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,812
This was the first place we came to
after I became your lecturer.

518
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,026
For some reason,
that day feels like so long ago.

519
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,029
For once at least,

520
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,865
can't you put your trust in people?

521
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,535
Not for anyone else, but yourself.

522
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,580
For Your Royal Highness.

523
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,207
Don't distance yourself too much.

524
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,585
It will only make you lonelier.

525
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,927
I swore to myself
I would never come back to the palace.

526
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,556
If I hadn't, I would have regretted it.

527
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:50,438
The truth is, I'm not usually one
to linger for too long in one place.

528
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,026
So I plan on going back to how I…

529
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,153
how I used to live before.

530
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,493
I hope that you can be happy…

531
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,789
not just for a day,

532
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,249
but every day.

533
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,922
Because when I had no hopes or dreams,

534
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,258
you brought
happiness and joy into my life.

535
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,475
I'm unable to accept…

536
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,061
your recommendation for a new position

537
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,063
because if I stay,

538
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,358
I know I will
keep coming to your quarters.

539
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,278
Maybe I'll use saying hello
to the royal tutors as an excuse.

540
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,950
Or I'll use a tree
at your quarters as my reason.

541
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,160
If not those,

542
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,081
then maybe I'll look
for Lord Jaeun at your quarters when…

543
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,126
who I really want to see is you.

544
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:17,233
NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

545
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,318
Please stay healthy, Your Royal Highness.

546
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,739
I hope you won't be lonely.

547
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,140
NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

548
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:58,125
Are you all right?
I thought you might be feeling lonely.

549
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,210
No, not at all.

550
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,920
And the Crown Prince is well?

551
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,839
-Jan-i!
-Everything's fine?

552
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,633
She did nothing wrong!
So why did you kill her?

553
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,427
Until now, you were able
to hold yourself back.

554
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,804
What happened this time?

555
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,849
I had to hold back
for the last ten years.

556
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,477
Please dethrone
the Crown Prince, strip him of his title.

557
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,646
-Dethrone the Prince!
-If you're dethroned

558
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,898
the only thing that
awaits you would be death.

559
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:24,944
I will protect the Crown Prince. I will.
