1
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,806
-Stop it!
-Thirteen!

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,725
Fourteen!

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,312
-Fifteen!
-Yeong-ji.

4
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,938
-Yeong-ji!
-Sixteen!

5
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,483
-Yeong-ji! Jil-geum!
-Seventeen!

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,902
Eighteen!

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,654
-My lord! They don't know anything!
-Nineteen!

8
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,282
-Please! I was the one giving the orders.
-Get him out!

9
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,368
No! Please, my lord! No, Jil-geum!

10
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,163
No, my lord! Please stop hurting them.

11
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,708
Yeong-ji!

12
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,587
Please. Let me go back to them.

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,756
Let go of me. Please.

14
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,093
No…

15
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,529
So you sent out the soldiers.
Didn't you, Father?

16
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,864
Yes, I sent them out.

17
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,247
They aren't responsible for anything.

18
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,499
Please release them.

19
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,460
They were following my orders.

20
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,003
I'm sure they were.

21
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,464
After all, you were the physician
at Samgaebang.

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,174
You know…

23
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,386
You know everything,
and you're punishing them, anyway?

24
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,264
Why would you do that?

25
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,725
There's only one thing
that I want from you.

26
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,395
I want you to work at the royal quarters.

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,650
From now on, you do what I tell you to do.

28
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,571
If you do, your friends will be safe.

29
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,827
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

30
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,175
I hear you come
with glorious recommendations.

31
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,218
I look forward to your…

32
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,854
I will be your tutor starting from today.
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

33
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,902
What on earth are you doing here?

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,322
Your Royal Highness, it is an honor
to once again meet you.

35
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,993
I told you I wouldn't be lenient with you
if we ever met again.

36
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,119
Did you forget that?

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,121
How could I forget?

38
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,291
However, I cannot disobey a royal command.

39
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,171
I have been appointed by His Majesty
to be in charge of your lectures.

40
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,799
So forgive me for what I did that day.

41
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,346
Let us begin with the classical poetry.

42
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,862
You want me to revoke
my appointment of a new royal tutor?

43
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,782
Yes. Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un

44
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,160
comes from a noble family,
but he operated a clinic named Samgaebang.

45
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,330
With his devious acupuncture skills,

46
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,499
he tricked noblewomen and noblemen.

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,669
On top of that,
from what I hear, he covets wealth.

48
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,381
And at times, he sneaks into the palace
and befriends court maids.

49
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,466
His behaviors are known to be crude.

50
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,344
In fact, I cannot, in good faith,
respect him as my tutor.

51
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,639
Please reconsider your decision, Father.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,396
This man was recommended
by the Left State Councilor.

53
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,731
Do you have any proof for your claim?

54
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,699
Please interrogate Chief Gu Chun-saeng,

55
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,076
and the court maids
who are in charge of embroidery.

56
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,498
EPISODE 4

57
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,960
My duty is to guard
your quarters, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,380
I would never secretly bring in
an outsider to the palace.

59
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,591
That is inconceivable, Your Majesty.

60
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,970
A female physician
performed acupuncture

61
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,055
on me as I was feeling fatigued,

62
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,850
but I have never met
a physician from Samgaebang.

63
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,894
On top of that, I heard the physician
from Samgaebang

64
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,397
is currently imprisoned
at Hanseong Magistracy.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,692
How can he be locked up and be
at the royal institute simultaneously?

66
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,659
You may all leave.

67
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,091
Father, they are all lying.

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,178
You should summon Jung Ji-un
and ask him for yourself.

69
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,806
I'm sure he will tell you
that he and I met at Hongwolru.

70
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,808
Hongwolru?

71
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,394
Were you at a courtesan house?

72
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,446
I mean, I only… stopped by
when I went out in disguise.

73
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,282
You are the Crown Prince of this nation.

74
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,743
Not only did you go out
without my permission,

75
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,995
but you also went to a courtesan house.

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,749
You are truly frustrating and foolish.

77
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,837
I must attend to the state affairs.
You can leave now.

78
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,881
But, Father…

79
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,765
Yes. Yes, Father.

80
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,736
So that wraps up my crash course
on the family tree of the royal family.

81
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,989
And now, since you're a new lecturer,

82
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:52,036
I'm about to teach you something,
and it is high-level information.

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,498
Have you heard of the Ice Prince before?

84
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,334
That's the Crown Prince's nickname.

85
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,338
He's known to be cold and heartless
to preceding royal priest centers.

86
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,965
Hence, the nickname.

87
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,717
And everyone must stay five steps
away from him.

88
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,970
So he's also known as Five-Step Prince.

89
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:09,929
Hmm…

90
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,014
But, wait…

91
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,559
Why do you have animal drawings
near the portraits?

92
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,895
These display ranks in the royal family.

93
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
Ranks?

94
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,735
I thought you might find these useful too.

95
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,613
So I risked my safety to assemble them.

96
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,908
All right. First off, our tiger.

97
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,745
The tiger represents bravery,
grit, and power.

98
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,124
He's the eldest son of His Majesty's
late brother, Prince Dohyeon.

99
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,501
Furthermore, the superintendent
at the Royal--

100
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,961
That's Prince Wonsan.

101
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,922
PRINCE WONSAN

102
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,924
How did you know that?

103
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,971
As for the hawk here,
he's very helpful to everyone.

104
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,765
-The Second Minister of Rites--
-Prince Jaeun.

105
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,894
PRINCE JAEUN

106
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,149
Well, then, you certainly
came here prepared.

107
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,528
But hold on. The rabbit, who's that?

108
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,782
Well, I guess I'll tell you
who this rabbit is.

109
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,493
He seems docile, but has a lot of support.

110
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,744
The son of the Queen

111
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,579
and grandson of the Chief State Councilor.

112
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,540
He's the second-in-line to the throne,
Prince Jehyeon.

113
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh.

114
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,046
That vole, who's it?

115
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,382
The fields may have eyes, you know.

116
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,009
But at night…

117
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,222
the words of the night are heard
by the ears of Prince Changun.

118
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,058
He's the stepbrother of His Majesty,

119
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,477
and the black sheep of the royal family.

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,271
Well, I don't need to go into details
for this one. Don't you think so?

121
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,364
Oh, the drawings again?

122
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,950
You really never give that up, do you?

123
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,798
Tutor Park is always in need
of more sleep.

124
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,179
Hello, Royal Scholar Yang.

125
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,639
Well, hello, there.

126
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,560
My goodness. The institute seems
to be full of life today.

127
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
Get up!

128
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,404
Well, well, well, a new royal tutor
has been appointed today.

129
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,322
What do you say, huh? Drinks to celebrate?

130
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,074
We already drank last night.

131
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,158
Not again.

132
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,370
What? Are you in? Are you in?

133
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,454
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,917
Unfortunately, I have
a prior engagement today.

135
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,916
Ji-un.

136
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,131
Ji-un. What are you doing here?

137
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,886
How are you feeling?

138
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,096
Are you okay?

139
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,475
How could I be?

140
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,520
They beat me up so much
that I can't even take a dump.

141
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,444
I'm sorry that… I'm not here.

142
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,576
What about Yeong-ji?

143
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,287
I heard that she's in Hanseong.

144
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,498
But I'm not sure.

145
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,379
Hang in there, friend.
I promise to get you out.

146
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,215
Ji-un.

147
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,885
Don't go out of your way for us.

148
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,597
My sister and I… I mean…

149
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,851
if we hadn't met you,

150
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,728
we would've died a long time ago.

151
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,023
No matter happens to us,

152
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,442
we won't resent you.

153
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,205
It will be difficult
to continue our investigation

154
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,582
on Tutor Jung and Samgaebang now.

155
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,003
It looks like Jung Seok-jo bought off
everyone involved already.

156
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,341
I doubt that he wanted
to waste a golden opportunity

157
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,926
to make his son a lecturer.

158
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,720
Wouldn't this be a problem?

159
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,306
As you already know,
the lecturer has a private audience

160
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,643
with you almost every day.
He will be very close to you.

161
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,937
So if he even suspects there's something--

162
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,313
That will never be the case.

163
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,069
Because I'll make sure he resigns quickly.

164
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,781
Well, how will you do that?

165
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:26,954
No task can be easier
than simply making a lecturer resign.

166
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,842
What are these?

167
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,386
As my knowledge is limited,

168
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,181
I'm struggling
to understand them on my own.

169
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,893
I would like you
to transcribe every single book here

170
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,644
with footnotes, one by one.

171
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,438
Pardon?

172
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,815
Every single book here?

173
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,068
Why? Is that a problem?

174
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
-Whoa.
-Oh, he's even strong too.

175
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,744
Did you get
on His Royal Highness' bad side already?

176
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,537
What? Why?

177
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:14,043
Goodness, Tutor Jung.
Stay strong through all this, eh?

178
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,337
Because…

179
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,840
this is only the beginning.

180
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,064
At least for now, you'll have an easy task

181
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,358
such as transcribing books
like these ones.

182
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,696
But things are bound to get way worse.

183
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,266
It is customary to give soksu
to new tutors.

184
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,561
But instead, I prepared a light meal
with some drinks.

185
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,480
I hope that's okay?

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,610
I will be honored, Your Royal Highness.

187
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,659
Be careful. He wants to get you drunk,
so you'll make mistakes.

188
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,413
So you must never get drunk
in the Crown Prince's presence.

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,290
Never.

190
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,839
Why don't you drink up?

191
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,840
Sure.

192
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,533
The bigger the cup,
the more you appreciate the drink, right?

193
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,013
Isn't this a bowl for soup?

194
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,403
Would you like a drink?

195
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,698
Court Lady Kim. Escort Eunuch Hong out.

196
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,245
I'm sorry,
Your Royal Highness. Come on. Get up.

197
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,555
I got it!

198
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,099
It's in here.

199
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,976
Oh, no, no!

200
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
Come on! Why does he want me
to catch loaches for?

201
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,274
Well, that's because…

202
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,071
I guess you just rub him
the wrong way, my friend.

203
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,656
-Whatever. Let's eat.
-What?

204
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,282
How about some loach soup?

205
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,165
Huh?

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
Ah, I still smell like fish.

207
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,799
I should just go and submit
my letter of resignation!

208
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,219
Envoys from Ming will arrive in two weeks.

209
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:56,223
If you can be trusted till then to serve
by the side of the Crown Prince,

210
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,559
I will release both of your friends.

211
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,567
Not bad.

212
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,030
I thought you would be ready
to quit right about now.

213
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,284
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

214
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,787
But I've gone through hell and high water.

215
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,915
I even flew like a diving genet
off the cliff into water.

216
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,044
So I'm not going anywhere.

217
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,769
What are these books doing here?

218
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,897
These are the transcriptions
you made Royal Tutor Jung do

219
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,273
the other day.

220
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,068
Goodness. He actually transcribed
all of them?

221
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,089
Here you go.

222
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,548
JWAJEON

223
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,311
Don't just stand there.
Get rid of these now.

224
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,188
Yes.

225
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,611
Someone's here to see me this late?

226
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,655
Well…

227
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,575
I was told to say that it's your soulmate,
and it's your friend.

228
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,868
What?

229
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,706
Wait.

230
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,294
The visitor said he wanted
to meet you here.

231
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,217
Well, it looks like
all this was nothing but a prank.

232
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,848
It's been a while, my lord.

233
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,156
It's me. Your soulmate.

234
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,326
Jung Ji-un. What a surprise.

235
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,623
A royal tutor?

236
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,542
So then, you're the new replacement?

237
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,920
When did you get back from Ming?

238
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,299
A year already?

239
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,926
But I got here three or four months ago.

240
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,012
How is it that you wander like the wind?

241
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,182
No matter how busy you've been,
you know you should have come by

242
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,725
to see me first.

243
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,186
Can you see?

244
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,354
I have calluses on my delicate hands.

245
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,859
I get that he's the Ice Prince
and all, but…

246
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,113
Has the Crown Prince
always been that mean?

247
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,034
After today, I never want to see anything
that lives in the water.

248
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,204
It sounds like the Crown Prince
taught you a lesson or two today.

249
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,416
What do you say? Should I put in
a good word with His Royal Highness?

250
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,293
Just for you?

251
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:12,961
Can you?

252
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,173
If you tell him that we are soulmates,

253
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,968
and you politely ask him to go easy on me,
will he do so?

254
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,721
I was expecting a firm no from you.

255
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,973
Ji-un, is there something else
going on here?

256
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,689
I've had some dark days.

257
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,399
And I'm still having them.

258
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,653
What do you mean exactly?

259
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,155
Is this related to your father?

260
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,371
You said you would never serve
in the palace because of your father.

261
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,875
It's a long story.

262
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,794
Let's just drink tonight, okay?

263
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,217
How are you finding
your new lecturer?

264
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,178
Do you approve?

265
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,517
He is sly and always looks for shortcuts.

266
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,187
He's more interested
in talking his way out of everything.

267
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,523
I don't think I should keep him
around for long.

268
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,609
I heard he's a rather distinguished man

269
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,321
and excels in literature
and fighting arts.

270
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,240
He's good-natured and well connected.

271
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,576
Well, of course! I'm sure people
who wanted to be

272
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,912
on my grandfather's good side
told you these lies.

273
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,207
People say birds
of a feather flock together.

274
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,295
To befriend someone like that man
is a proof of ignorance.

275
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,383
That's a bit harsh.

276
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,347
The time has come for your lecture,
Your Royal Highness.

277
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,682
Yes, I know that!

278
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,144
Close them.

279
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,552
Are you sure you don't want
to attend the morning lecture?

280
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,763
Ever since you're appointed
the Crown Prince,

281
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,475
you have never missed not even
a single one of your lectures before.

282
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,853
How many times must I tell you I won't go?

283
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,314
Goodness.

284
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,982
May I ask why?

285
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,617
Why try to avoid? No.

286
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,204
Why are you trying to kick me out?

287
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,958
I'm sure you know
the reason for that more than anyone.

288
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,752
Am I wrong?

289
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,838
I have already passed
all of your assignments, though.

290
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,217
I am your appointed tutor.

291
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,886
Attend my lecture,
so I can fulfill my duty

292
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,223
of helping you study
and teaching you moral principles.

293
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,517
Did you say…

294
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,852
moral?

295
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,608
Seriously?

296
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,529
You may be helpful in my studies,
but as for moral principles,

297
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,116
you of all people
can't possibly teach me anything.

298
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,874
I've heard that you operated Samgaebang,

299
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,545
and we also met
at a courtesan house. Correct?

300
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,091
You are no more than an idler
who performs acupuncture there.

301
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,345
Yet, with your father's support,
you managed to become my lecturer.

302
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,932
Some may find that embarrassing.

303
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,184
But you are indeed brazen.

304
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,229
Well…

305
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,899
does that mean you will keep avoiding me?

306
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,026
While I'm able, I'll keep doing it

307
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,238
until you come to your senses
and decide to resign.

308
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,908
I'm sorry,
but what if I won't resign?

309
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,005
You know no shame. Do you?
I can understand, though.

310
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,343
Becoming a lecturer of the Crown Prince,
it must have been tempting.

311
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,305
Just like your father,

312
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,309
you are nothing but an opportunist.

313
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,200
Then allow me
to offer a compromise.

314
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,827
We'll make a wager.

315
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,122
And if it comes to me losing this wager,

316
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,707
I will resign as you wish.

317
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,918
However,

318
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,464
if I win, your compromise
will be to attend my lecture.

319
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,009
-A wager?
-Get the highest mark on the upcoming exam

320
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,094
given by all lecturers, including myself.

321
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,973
His Majesty and people of the court
will attend the session,

322
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,602
so if I fail you in the exam,
I would be in big trouble.

323
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,064
What do you think?

324
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,401
Why would I ever agree to that?

325
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,988
It's not in my interest
to make a silly bet.

326
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,490
How can I get you…

327
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,159
to accept this deal for me?

328
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,036
Who knows?

329
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,541
I don't think you'll agree to it, but…

330
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,463
I might change my mind
if you offered up your life.

331
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,543
What are you doing?

332
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,007
If I have to bet my life, I'll do it.

333
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,362
My lord! Lord Jaeun!

334
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,784
There's a problem.

335
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,746
The Crown Prince is pointing arrow
at the new royal tutor.

336
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,331
It's quite a scene.

337
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,707
What?

338
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,066
Your Royal Highness!

339
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,613
Your Highness, your subjects are watching.

340
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,074
I'm begging you, lower your bow.

341
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,202
He told me he wishes to die,

342
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,870
don't you think
I should grant him his wish?

343
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,331
Oh, no.

344
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,815
Your Highness!

345
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,611
Oh!

346
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,077
Oh!

347
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,520
I must admit,

348
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,859
I admire your courage,
so I agree to the bet.

349
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,044
Oh, my goodness.

350
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,778
Samgaebang?

351
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:46,159
Those people mean everything to me.

352
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,077
I will do anything to save them.

353
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,330
-Anything.
-Did you need to go this far?

354
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,085
So what do you plan to do now?

355
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,257
I don't know.

356
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,676
I just have to keep trying.

357
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,021
Hold on.

358
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,483
Lord Sangheon is his maternal grandfather.

359
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,943
Do they not get along?

360
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,994
I know that His Royal Highness
isn't the friendly type.

361
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,704
But…

362
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,041
…how could you be so reckless? Hmm?

363
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,543
His father and his grandfather

364
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,671
aren't the biggest supporters
of one another, so…

365
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,757
Perhaps the Crown Prince
is in a tight spot now.

366
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,593
That's why he's been hard on me.

367
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,388
What are you mumbling about?

368
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,641
Uh, oh, it's nothing. It's nothing, sir.

369
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,268
Goodness.

370
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,980
His Royal Highness will like this,
so go and get in his good graces.

371
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,773
And plead for forgiveness.

372
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,733
Come on. Now!

373
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,324
Bold of you to shoot an arrow
at your tutor in broad daylight.

374
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,661
Why have you become so reckless?

375
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,791
I was just teaching him a lesson.

376
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,586
He showed no respect to me.

377
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,047
It's okay
to show people your claws.

378
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,092
But he's not the one
you should be worried about.

379
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,427
So I ask you…

380
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,222
never cause a scene
like this ever again. All right?

381
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,643
Jung Ji-un.

382
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,481
Why did you insist
that he'd be selected as my tutor?

383
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,694
From what I heard,
he's had a questionable past.

384
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,325
Is it because he is the son
of Jung Seok-jo…

385
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,412
your trusted associate?

386
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:02,337
He's a distinguished young man
who passed the state exam at 15.

387
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,966
If you keep him by your side,
I'm sure he'll be helpful someday.

388
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:12,096
And so what if he's the son
of my trusted associate?

389
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,266
The palace can be as dirty as the mud.

390
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,603
If you don't have
your people by your side,

391
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,397
others will try to get close to you.

392
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:26,402
So please let go
of these insignificant matters.

393
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,447
It's no use staying virtuous
in a dirty game.

394
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,953
-Grandfather--
-My people are also your people.

395
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:41,459
Therefore, I advise you to keep
what I just told you in mind.

396
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,468
Yes, Grandfather.

397
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,239
Ugh.

398
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,956
Royal Tutor Jung, what brings you here?

399
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:25,211
Ah, Royal Scholar Yang asked me
to deliver him this book.

400
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,630
-Here you go.
-All right.

401
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,010
Then I'll let you get back to work.

402
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,150
This is the topic of the upcoming exam
as well as your assignment.

403
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,861
My assignment?

404
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:01,330
The only way you will be able to answer
my question at the exam

405
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,417
is if you plant that seed
and study it after it buds.

406
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,753
However,

407
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,923
I strongly advise you
not to get any of your servants

408
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,800
to undertake your assignment.

409
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,510
That is because, you see,

410
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,222
you're the only one
who can answer this question.

411
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,102
Do you happen to know
who I am, you punks?

412
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,981
Let me tell you who I am.

413
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,068
-Stop the palanquin.
-Yes, my lord.

414
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:22,787
Here's a thing about life.
You need to pick the right side to join.

415
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,292
Take me, for instance.

416
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,254
Who are you?

417
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,050
You…

418
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,477
Hold on. Isn't this a lotus seed?

419
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,104
No.

420
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,358
I'm sure it is.

421
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,695
He wouldn't have wagered his life
on such an easy question.

422
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,614
I'm sure
there's a different meaning to this.

423
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,204
He's so handsome.

424
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,207
Have you ever seen
one this tall?

425
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,294
Look at his hair.
His hair is so beautiful.

426
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,589
Who is that? Do you know?

427
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm not sure. I've never seen him around.

428
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,178
I don't think he works in your quarters.

429
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,183
Find out what he's up to,
and get him out of here.

430
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,313
Your Royal Highness.

431
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,621
I will be your bodyguard
from this moment on.

432
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,372
Kim Ga-on is my name.

433
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,937
Bullseye!

434
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,610
A bodyguard?

435
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,487
Did you assign a bodyguard
to the Crown Prince,

436
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,322
without consulting me, Mother?

437
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,659
I thought we'd already discussed
this before.

438
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,246
Given the incident
during the royal hunting,

439
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,958
I am too concerned to just sit around
and do nothing.

440
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:36,671
Fortunately, the Ministry of War
was able to recommend a trustworthy guard.

441
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,422
I'm counting on your aid.

442
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,759
Regarding the Crown Prince,
I can take care of those matters myself.

443
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,686
Then you should have done so
a long time ago.

444
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,856
How can you be so indifferent
toward the Crown Prince?

445
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,360
There's nothing I can do
about your marriage with the Queen.

446
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,780
But the Crown Prince
of Joseon is not Prince Jehyeon.

447
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,574
You must consider
the Crown Prince's reputation.

448
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,170
So, your previous assignment was?

449
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,089
I was an elite army soldier.

450
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
I see.

451
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,893
All right. I wanted to see you in private…

452
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,273
because now that you work
for the Crown Prince,

453
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:42,528
I thought it would be nice
to go over a few ground rules with you.

454
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,281
First rule.

455
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,325
During your guarding duties,

456
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:51,704
you have to stay five steps away
from the Crown Prince.

457
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,873
Watch me.

458
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,460
One, two, three, four, five.

459
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,341
This is it. That's the distance.

460
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,717
Second rule.

461
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,013
If there's anything
you need to report to him,

462
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,100
first, you will have to go through me
and Court Lady Kim.

463
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,565
Do you understand the ground rules now?

464
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,780
Five steps back.

465
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,202
Look. Come on.

466
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,953
Five steps away. Five steps away.

467
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,664
You. You must stand five steps away.

468
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,417
Come on. I told you,
you have to step back.

469
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,127
Come on. Five steps.

470
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,838
Look at his face.
We ought to thank the Queen Dowager.

471
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,757
-I know, right?
-Oh, my goodness.

472
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,843
He'll be guarding the Crown Prince
at night, too, right?

473
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,762
I'll take the night shift from now on.

474
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,265
Watching him
will make me feel like I'm dreaming.

475
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,769
-He's handsome even from the back.
-Step back.

476
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:01,482
-You must be five steps away from him.
-Oh, my goodness. He's so hot.

477
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,407
Watch out.

478
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,033
Five steps! Five steps!

479
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,619
I believe I've made
the five steps rule clear.

480
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,954
Haven't I? Haven't I?

481
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,835
I already have a lot on my mind
to prepare for the exam.

482
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,681
I told you to stay five steps
away from me. Are you even listening?

483
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,645
Five steps.

484
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,149
I said, five steps away from me.
Keep walking.

485
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,862
More. More! Keep going. Move!

486
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,990
The royal command I received
was to guard the Crown Prince.

487
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,828
A royal command, huh?

488
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,000
Then does it mean you work for my father?

489
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,503
No, that's not it.

490
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:09,091
Since my grandmother gave you this post,
you must be working for her.

491
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,305
If not, you must work
for my maternal grandfather.

492
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,890
None of them, my lord.

493
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,603
I am only here to fulfill my duty
of guarding you, the Crown Prince.

494
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,105
So to be precise, my lord,

495
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,066
I work for you from this moment on.

496
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,700
Sorry.

497
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,381
Come on, five steps back.

498
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,736
That is because, you see,

499
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,906
you're the only one
who can answer this question.

500
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,079
What on earth could he have planned?

501
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,966
JWAJEON

502
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,745
YEON-SEON

503
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,508
YEON-SEON

504
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:01,221
Lotus flowers brought me to you,
so I thought the name would be fitting.

505
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,641
Yeon-seon.

506
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,894
He wouldn't.

507
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,233
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

508
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,610
Uh… Ugh.

509
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,944
Hyun.

510
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,280
Why are you so alarmed?

511
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,328
Uh, allow me to lend you a hand.

512
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,497
No. There is no need.

513
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,833
I heard that you will be the one

514
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,504
who will be in charge
of receiving the envoys from Ming.

515
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,340
Will there be anything I can do
to help you?

516
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,384
No, my lord.

517
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,303
I know that you have a lot
on your mind already.

518
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,682
Well, I just wanted to accompany you
when you leave the palace.

519
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,809
Wasn't that obvious?

520
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:53,023
Well, then why don't we discuss this
after your exam?

521
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,025
The exam is very important to you.

522
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,319
Yes.

523
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,657
I guess… that will be better for me.

524
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:04,910
Mm.

525
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,719
The next lecturer
is Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

526
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,512
He will present now.

527
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,859
I gave you an assignment
during my previous lecture.

528
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,278
Yes.

529
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,449
You gave me a seed,
and you told me to study it…

530
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,534
after I got it to bud.

531
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,204
Were you able to discern
what that seed was?

532
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,249
It was a lotus seed.

533
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,544
Yes, that is correct.

534
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:02,593
Now, did you also figure out
the reason behind my giving you

535
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,219
the lotus seed?

536
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,307
According to the Jonggyeongrok,

537
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,185
we are unable to face our true feelings.

538
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,897
But our heart resembles
the form of a lotus flower.

539
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,485
And it says that a blooming lotus flower
in our hearts will enlighten us.

540
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,947
Moreover, lotus flowers
can still keep their fragrance

541
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,949
without getting dirty by the mud.

542
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,745
So I should be kind
and continue to cherish my people

543
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,498
by following the path
of this virtuous flower.

544
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,842
-I'm sorry, but--
-However…

545
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,431
I doubt you gave me this assignment

546
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:53,393
just to review
classic Confucian philosophy.

547
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,232
FAIL

548
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:02,986
When it comes to lotuses,
there's nothing that will go to waste.

549
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,241
Including the leaves, the roots,
fruits, pistils, and even seeds.

550
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,161
Every part of the lotus can be either used
as food or as medicinal herbs.

551
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,164
The people must have seen life and death

552
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,458
when all of those noblemen scholars…

553
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,877
found virtue…

554
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,463
while studying the lotus flowers.

555
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,176
Therefore,

556
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,847
the assignment has brought me
to the final conclusion

557
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,975
that having an open mind
towards the hardships of my people…

558
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,815
instead of blindly cherishing them,
is the path of a wise king.

559
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,162
That is an excellent answer.

560
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,708
However, it is not the answer
I was looking for, Your Highness.

561
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,255
Uh, it is not?

562
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,550
How can a king always think
only about his people?

563
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,804
Only those who love themselves
are truly able to cherish and love others.

564
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:19,771
Does that have anything to do
with the lotus seed you gave me?

565
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:25,152
Someone once said that the palace
can be as dirty as the mud.

566
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,039
The palace can be as dirty as the mud.

567
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,541
If you don't have
your people by your side,

568
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,711
others will try to get close to you.

569
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,965
Lotus flowers bloom in mud,
but they can cleanse their surroundings.

570
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,886
And the leaves have the ability
to shake off murky water.

571
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,055
There's no trace of any dirt on them.

572
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,641
Just like the lotus flowers
that stay virtuous

573
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,101
despite its dirty environment,

574
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,230
I hope that you will become
a strong, indefectible ruler.

575
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,941
That's why I gave you the seed.

576
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,903
Some hurt innocent people
justifying it by saying

577
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,113
it's all somehow for a greater cause.

578
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,283
But no matter how great the cause is,

579
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,204
it can never be greater
than the lives of the people.

580
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,708
With that said, I hope that
you will learn from the lotus flower,

581
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,795
and hold on to the virtue,
which will help you see,

582
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,089
even in the midst of mud,
what really matters

583
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,257
and make sound judgement.

584
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,595
It's no use staying virtuous
in a dirty game.

585
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,847
Therefore, I advise you…

586
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,851
to keep what I just told you in mind.

587
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:47,401
Therefore, I'm obliged to say…

588
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,947
that you failed this exam.

589
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,110
Your insight is outstanding.

590
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,613
I'm truly delighted
by your question and answer.

591
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,576
I'm truly honored, Your Majesty.

592
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,204
I'm glad we have appointed you.

593
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,415
Lord Sangheon said it himself,

594
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,500
you are quite extraordinary.

595
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,120
Ah, come on. Pour the man a drink.

596
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,247
Sir, don't worry. Sit comfortably.

597
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,585
Having a tutor so distinguished here,
what a surprise.

598
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,837
Doesn't he remind you of me ten years ago?

599
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,509
What do you think?

600
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,522
Let's drink it up.

601
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,774
I'm a lightweight.

602
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,491
Well, I… I thought it was perfect.

603
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,125
All right. I'm thirsty.

604
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,626
Let's get some more.

605
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,509
I have been looking for you,
Your Highness.

606
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,472
So you heard us talk?

607
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,850
You heard my grandfather
and me speaking, then.

608
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,437
I'm sorry.

609
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,107
I did not intend for it to happen.

610
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,111
Did you believe my answer was offensive?

611
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,951
I thought it was impressive.

612
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,870
No one has ever dared…

613
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,915
to make such a bold statement here.

614
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,254
However,

615
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,882
I suggest you don't do it
in another time, all right?

616
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,762
In the palace, you have to learn
to be careful.

617
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,807
A lot more careful than you think.

618
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,185
It's dangerous…

619
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,272
and frightening.

620
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,195
I'm aware that the palace…

621
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,906
is a dangerous place.

622
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,288
My father and your maternal grandfather,
Lord Sangheon,

623
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,541
they made it that way,

624
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,920
along with a few other people as well.

625
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,844
Actually, I was talking about myself…

626
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,556
when I gave you my answer earlier.

627
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,146
Therefore, even if my answer
puts me in danger,

628
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,773
I will not fear it.

629
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,777
What I fear is…

630
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,781
that I might get used
to seeing mud all the time, and…

631
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,329
follow in their footsteps.

632
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,959
That's the only thing I fear.

633
00:55:55,518 --> 00:56:00,231
Oh, and where can I see the lotus bud
from the seed I gave you?

634
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,362
Isn't it obvious where I planted it?

635
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,740
The day you gave it to me,
I threw it into this pond here.

636
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:12,285
Does that mean you knew
what it was the second you got it from me?

637
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,580
I thought this would be difficult for you.

638
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:19,501
The lotus fruit is often served as one
of the side dishes for the royal meal.

639
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,003
Why wouldn't I recognize that?

640
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,718
Well, I've never seen a royal meal before.

641
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:44,025
So that means the lotus seed
will bloom into a flower soon.

642
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:50,448
I look forward to working
for you until then, Your Highness.

643
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,876
Royal Tutor Jung!

644
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,630
Royal Scholar Yang right here
is passed out drunk!

645
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,756
Help us, come on!

646
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,551
Tutor Jung!

647
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,512
Okay. On my way.

648
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,891
You should come along.

649
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,937
Let's just have drinks tonight
and set aside our worries.

650
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,231
Whatever is worrying you.

651
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,319
I hope to see you back there.

652
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,653
We should get a move on.
Time will fly by today.

653
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,946
I'm sure it will.

654
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,544
Your hand, what happened,
Royal Scholar Yang?

655
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,422
Well, I had too many drinks.

656
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,675
When I woke up the next day,
I realized my hand was injured.

657
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,427
And I was completely soaked too.

658
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,596
But I don't remember what happened.

659
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,223
Do you remember, huh?

660
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,352
Well, you must've been pretty drunk too.

661
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,522
As you can see, my hand is injured.
So can you do me a favor?

662
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,106
Can you transcribe this?

663
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,317
And then take it to the palace, huh?

664
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,488
Are you seriously asking me
to do your task?

665
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,657
Do my task?

666
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,494
This is a task from the Crown Prince.
It doesn't matter who writes it.

667
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,913
How could you make such accusations?

668
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,164
Forget it!

669
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,584
Do you think I even want to ask…
ask you to help me, anyway?

670
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,044
Mm, I'm done here.

671
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,591
-Slow down.
-Ooh!

672
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:59,137
My lady, are you all right?
You must be more careful.

673
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,103
Are you all right?

674
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,629
Are you okay?

675
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,370
How about this one over here?

676
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,497
Pardon?

677
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:08,956
Oh.

678
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:14,295
Well, I think that one over there
is better than the one you're holding.

679
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,130
Come on. There is a door in the back.

680
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,089
Let's go.

681
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,716
What?

682
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,724
Oh, Your Highness! Your Royal Highness!

683
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,976
Move! Please make way!

684
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,103
Move! For goodness' sake!

685
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,620
Oh, my. Wait. Oh!

686
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,550
Wait! Hold on!

687
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,846
Hey! Wait, don't lose them.

688
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:00,860
Hey.

689
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,258
Why did you run off like that, Hyun?

690
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,260
Don't you think it's fun?

691
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,513
It's just like playing tag
when we were little.

692
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,933
Playing tag?

693
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,361
What… What is this?

694
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,363
That is a present for you.

695
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,299
But why are you giving this to me?

696
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,930
When you find a lady you love
and get engaged,

697
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,724
give that to your betrothed. All right?

698
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,229
Ah…

699
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,457
Are you all right, Your Highness?

700
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,027
Oh, Hyun, you're…

701
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,282
My sincere apologies.

702
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,576
I was worried it'd splash on you.

703
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:18,539
Oh, no. I ruined your fine robe.
I'm so sorry.

704
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,833
That's all right. We all make mistakes.

705
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,002
I'm sorry.

706
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,599
I feel awful. Your robe is soaked.

707
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,815
That's true, but your hat
is ruined because of me.

708
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,359
Please wait for me here.

709
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,110
I will go and buy you a new one.

710
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,237
Wait. That's all right. Uh…

711
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,957
Please wear mine
for the time being, Your Highness.

712
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,709
Royal Tutor Jung.

713
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:31,714
The robe isn't enough without the hat.

714
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,676
Uh… what are you doing?

715
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,471
People are watching.

716
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,391
Protecting your dignity
is also my duty as your subject.

717
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,352
Please forgive me for being too forward.

718
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,357
Oh, wait. Wait, I…

719
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,486
I can do it myself.

720
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,613
Sure.

721
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,961
You never had to tie it yourself before.

722
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,423
Please stay still for a moment.

723
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,974
Do you two know one another?

724
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,642
You certainly seem happy.

725
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,270
Did you have fun
outside of the palace wall?

726
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,606
So a male friend
he meets secretly?

727
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,357
Could the Crown Prince like men?

728
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,651
What do you mean
the Crown Prince seems like a woman?

729
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,988
He kinda reminds me of
the court maid I saw at the royal hunting.

730
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,115
What are you doing?
I'd prefer if you stay away.

731
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,452
Don't distance yourself too much.
It'll only make you lonelier.

732
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:10,122
Nothing in the world that is harder
to trust than the emotions of humans.

733
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,791
Killing others to protect oneself.

734
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,418
That is simply human nature.
