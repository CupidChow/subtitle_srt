1
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,892
The wound must be infected.

2
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,393
You should be examined.

3
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,070
I will…

4
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,160
I'll take it off myself.

5
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,972
Your Highness.

6
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,724
This is…

7
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,313
This is my secret.

8
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,995
What? You've lost His Highness?

9
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,080
While the procession
was crossing the woods,

10
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,624
Commander Yoon and his men
took His Highness.

11
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,711
They were… disguised as bandits.

12
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,546
Commander Yoon?

13
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,842
So His Royal Highness
still has not been found?

14
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,386
Yoon is now in Inspector Jung's custody,

15
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,846
I know we will find him soon.

16
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:28,750
So the King ordered you to keep
the Crown Prince alive, right?

17
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,046
Even after his previous order
to dethrone the Crown Prince,

18
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,548
he still used you
to try to take him to safety.

19
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,552
Hmm.

20
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,473
I was surprised though.

21
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,226
Disguising him as a woman
was a neat trick.

22
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,395
Dam-i, was it?

23
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,982
When I looked at him, I saw her.

24
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,360
Well…

25
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,572
the two of them were twins,
so I guess that is obvious.

26
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,950
Why go to such lengths…

27
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,203
just to track down the Crown Prince?

28
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,455
As you said,

29
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,999
he is already a dethroned prince.

30
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,417
It's about time…

31
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,174
It's about time… you let him go.

32
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,802
Unfortunately,
it is not up to me to decide.

33
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,221
This is Lord Sangheon's decision.

34
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,519
We just got a report
of a suspicious man and woman

35
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,312
in the woods in Mount Hwanghak.

36
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,523
I'll look into it.

37
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,316
Stand guard here while I'm gone.

38
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,343
I… I should treat your wound first.

39
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,367
I'll go gather some firewood.
I'll be right back.

40
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,249
EPISODE 13

41
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,633
Over here! I found blood.

42
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,560
He couldn't have gone too far.

43
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,437
Search this area thoroughly.

44
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,355
We have to find His Highness.
Do you understand?

45
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,523
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,691
Let's go.

47
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,235
Any news on Lord Jaeun?

48
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,070
We're still searching, my lord.

49
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,247
Why are you not resting?

50
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,124
Is there…

51
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,877
Is there something that you need?

52
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,842
I didn't wanna be alone, so…

53
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,162
By the way,
why aren't you asking me anything…

54
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,872
about my secret?

55
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,794
I know this came as a shock to you.

56
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,172
You probably feel resentful…

57
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,635
because I've been deceiving you.

58
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,637
Yes.

59
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,932
I do feel resentment.

60
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,102
Not towards you,

61
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,563
but myself.

62
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,568
So many hardships…

63
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,280
and you had to manage all of it all alone.

64
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,577
I apologize…

65
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,497
for not realizing sooner.

66
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,716
We were born twins.

67
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,471
Me and my brother,
the son of the Crown Prince.

68
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,766
After my brother died,

69
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,022
I suddenly had no choice
but to take his place.

70
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,985
Not only did I deceive people,

71
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,156
but I also had to live a life
that wasn't mine.

72
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,045
You don't have to do that.

73
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,923
Don't tell me about the hardships now.

74
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,678
Right now, your health is more important.

75
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:43,142
So please don't force yourself
to tell me your story.

76
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,907
No! No, Father. Please, stop.

77
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,047
I may not be able to…

78
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,009
find another circumstance
to tell you everything.

79
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,554
I won't hold that against you because…

80
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,099
for me…

81
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,103
none of this changes anything.

82
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,318
I'm still looking at the same person
I was before.

83
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,571
And that's all that matters.

84
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,491
As long as I'm with you

85
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,205
nothing else really matters. Nothing.

86
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,581
Let me take it. I'll deliver it.

87
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,168
Uh… sure.

88
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,064
Why did you help me?

89
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,943
It takes determination
to take a person's life,

90
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,529
but I do not see that in you
at the moment.

91
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,697
Answer me.

92
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,366
Why did you have Commander Yoon tail me

93
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,493
and save me from trouble?

94
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,162
What is your reason
for trying to kill them?

95
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,250
Did you think that murdering them
would solve all of your problems?

96
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:41,130
Or maybe it was just an attempt
to relieve your pent-up anger?

97
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,176
Traitor Kang Hwa-gil
now must have his head cut off.

98
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,267
What do you know anyway?

99
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,144
You don't know…

100
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,147
anything about me.

101
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,198
JESEOK

102
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,826
Jeseok.

103
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,747
It means, "To discard what's old
before welcoming a new year."

104
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,042
Your father and I…

105
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,129
each shared a piece of that tally
as a token of our promise

106
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,964
to build a new world.

107
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,634
I…

108
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,387
I failed to keep that promise,
unfortunately,

109
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,100
and lost a good friend,
and became a helpless king,

110
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,395
who abandoned his own child.

111
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,398
But…

112
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,194
there was never a day
when I forgot about our promise.

113
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,074
And I will remember it
until the day I die.

114
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,869
The world I dreamed of
along with your father,

115
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,207
I will manage to build that world.

116
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,053
Your Majesty,
your herbal tonic will be served.

117
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,071
Your Majesty,
I thought I heard you conversing,

118
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,033
and I assumed there was someone here.

119
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,583
I was reading my book out loud.

120
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,960
I see.

121
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,448
Eun-seo.

122
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,453
Your father's grave is by the wide rock

123
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,247
about halfway up Mount Gwanak.

124
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,006
You should visit him.

125
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,201
JESEOK

126
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,164
Your Majesty!

127
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,333
Your Majesty!

128
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,172
Your Majesty!

129
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,134
-Your Majesty!
-No!

130
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,596
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

131
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,895
No!

132
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,674
-No! Your Majesty!
-Oh!

133
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,219
Your Majesty!

134
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,972
No!

135
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,477
Why? Someone do something!

136
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,022
It's not true!

137
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,025
Your Majesty! It's not true!

138
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,360
Somebody!

139
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:03,368
Your Majesty, please come back!

140
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:09,499
Your Majesty, please come back!

141
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:14,755
Your Majesty, please come back!

142
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,805
Just a moment.

143
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,935
Can we stay like this for just a moment?

144
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,156
So, are you feeling better?

145
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,909
It still…

146
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,705
hurts a lot, my arm.

147
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,293
You're going to be fine…

148
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,088
because I will be here by your side.

149
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,306
You know that being with me…

150
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,060
will make you a fugitive
for the rest of your life.

151
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,525
You will have to sever ties
with family and friends,

152
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,528
and even live in the shadows.

153
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,114
I don't mind that.

154
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,078
After all, I've always dreamed of…

155
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,831
living such a life.

156
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,094
Once we leave this place
and arrive somewhere safe,

157
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,057
the first thing I'll do is find us
a small house.

158
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,228
Maybe even… something by the shore,
you know.

159
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,066
I'll have to get us
a fishing boat as well.

160
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:45,197
I will come home around sunset
and cook you dinner

161
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,200
with any fish
that I'm able to catch for you.

162
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,869
Also…

163
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,747
we'll go to the market together
when it's open.

164
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,708
And when we go…

165
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,629
I will get you a little present…

166
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,007
without you knowing.

167
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,846
Is there anything you like me to buy?

168
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,102
I'll take time and think of something…

169
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,732
I would like to receive from you,
Tutor Jung.

170
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,218
Hey, you. Could you give me some water?

171
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,101
Here you go.

172
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,493
Lord Jaeun!

173
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,954
Are you all right?

174
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,834
I followed the soldiers
guarding this place.

175
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,919
What happened? Where's His Highness?

176
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,546
We parted ways at the dock.

177
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,883
It's likely they're headed
to Mount Hwanghak.

178
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,219
Jung Seok-jo went after him with his men

179
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,222
which is why we must hurry
and find him first.

180
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,432
Let's go.

181
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,451
More blood over here!

182
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,917
Look! Over there!

183
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,689
I told you to wait for me in the woods.

184
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,650
You must be exhausted.

185
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,862
Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong
will be worried about me.

186
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,614
Time is of the essence,

187
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,325
so I thought it would be best
to get moving soon.

188
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,290
Are you sure it isn't just
because you miss me too much?

189
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,753
I beg your pardon?

190
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,675
You said the safe house
was across Mount Bukseong.

191
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,718
Yes.

192
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,764
If we get to Bukseong, we'll be able
to reunite with everyone else.

193
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:07,857
In that case, I'm afraid you should change
because this will draw attention.

194
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,113
Here you are.

195
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,243
Thanks so much.

196
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,369
It's my pleasure.

197
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,429
Shall we?

198
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,349
I found a place where you can change.

199
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,144
Uh, sure.

200
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,727
I think we should probably split up.

201
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,521
His Highness could have gone
to the safe house,

202
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,982
so why don't you go there
and look for him?

203
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,735
I'll search here a little bit more.

204
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,778
All right.

205
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,434
Um, what is that?

206
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,436
I thought you could be hungry.

207
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,022
Why don't you try it?
I'm sure it will suit your palate.

208
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,614
Oh, and do the clothes fit well?

209
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,367
Yes.

210
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:27,622
It's like I'm finally wearing
my home clothes now.

211
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,251
Please don't be too wistful.

212
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,880
Once we're gone, I, um…
I will buy you pretty clothes every day.

213
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,260
You can tie a ribbon in your hair
or wear dresses all you want.

214
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,721
I'm sure no one will care about that.

215
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,812
Actually…

216
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,524
I'm afraid
that it hasn't quite hit me yet.

217
00:28:55,358 --> 00:29:00,113
You know that I'm leaving the palace
to finally live my own life.

218
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,912
Your Highness,
could you wait here for a moment?

219
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,623
I forgot to buy something.
I'll be right back.

220
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,668
-Uh, buy what?
-Enjoy the food as you wait!

221
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,919
I won't be long!

222
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,246
If you wish to save their lives,
drop your sword now.

223
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,209
How dare you.

224
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,905
What is the meaning of this?

225
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,033
Forgive me, Your Highness.

226
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,827
It is time you return to the palace.

227
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,332
Why would I return? Why should I?

228
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,985
Grandfather, why are you--

229
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,237
What brings you here?

230
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,657
His Majesty…

231
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,701
has passed away.

232
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,207
You must return to the palace,
Your Highness.

233
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,171
What are you talking about, Grandfather?

234
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,299
What do you mean Father has passed away?

235
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,560
Is it true
that the King passed away?

236
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,646
It's true. Didn't you see
all those soldiers leaving their posts?

237
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,025
What's the point of being a king
if you die just like the rest of us?

238
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,235
No one's the same if you die.

239
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,703
He was poisoned?

240
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,373
According to the physician
who last saw him,

241
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,335
his body showed discoloration
which indicates poisoning.

242
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,796
Who could have done something so…

243
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,067
There's no reason to waste time,
Your Highness.

244
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,568
Please do not let this drag on.

245
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,612
Just appoint a successor to the throne.

246
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,738
Stop pondering so much.

247
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,491
This is a state funeral.

248
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,579
How dare you speak of this now?
And even in the presence of his coffin.

249
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,749
His Majesty's untimely
and unfortunate death,

250
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,293
in addition
to the Crown Prince's dethronement

251
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,920
is bringing forth social turmoil.

252
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,507
Your Highness, you must decide
who succeeds the throne

253
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,133
before there is an uproar.

254
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,636
Please make a decision,
Your Highness.

255
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,352
Why is it that Lord Sangheon
is not here right now?

256
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,152
Your Royal Highness.

257
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,745
How is… How is the Crown Prince here?

258
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:11,627
I apologize. I'm late because I had
to escort the Crown Prince.

259
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,358
My father…

260
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,498
My dear father.

261
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,918
MEMORIAL TABLET OF KING HYEJONG

262
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,366
A dethroned Crown Prince

263
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,744
who broke away from his road to exile
is back at the palace.

264
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,498
Please see to it that
the former Crown Prince is arrested

265
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,542
along with Lord Sangheon
who escorted him here.

266
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,588
You must now demonstrate
the weight of the royal family.

267
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,426
Though he is in exile,

268
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,430
do you really think it's fair
to punish him

269
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,516
for attending his own father's funeral?

270
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,687
Let the Crown Prince experience
his own grief…

271
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,439
and pay respects to his father.

272
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,610
Your Highness,
don't forget that this nation has laws.

273
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,363
I'm afraid
if you don't take action yourself,

274
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,741
I shall then be forced
to order the soldiers instead.

275
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,495
I'll order them to immediately arrest
Lord Sangheon and the Crown Prince.

276
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,871
Lord Changcheon!

277
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,472
I would like to speak
with Her Highness alone,

278
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,934
so I would appreciate some privacy,
Lord Changcheon.

279
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,486
Despite the circumstances,

280
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,698
it was still wrong
to bring His Royal Highness back.

281
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,201
The throne remains unoccupied,

282
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,371
so I advise you choose a successor.

283
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,040
Are you implying that I should…

284
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,126
reinstate a Crown Prince
who has been deposed?

285
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,797
Would you rather hand the throne over
to those who committed treason?

286
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,384
What are you talking about?

287
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,054
What do you mean treason?

288
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,373
Where is Prince Jehyeon at the moment?

289
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,256
Gyeom.

290
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,013
Hwi.

291
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,896
Please forgive me.

292
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,566
I failed to hold back my tears
like you told me to do.

293
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,913
It's all right.

294
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,711
Everything will be fine.

295
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,883
It's going to be fine.

296
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,817
Such unfathomable insolence.

297
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,444
The deposed Crown Prince

298
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,114
walks within the palace walls
using the funeral as an excuse.

299
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,325
Is that the reason
you wished to speak with me?

300
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,831
Lord Sangheon wouldn't have brought back
the Crown Prince

301
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,167
unless he had an ulterior reason.

302
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,670
Rumor has been spreading across
the grounds of the palace

303
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,255
that the King was poisoned.

304
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,135
All I wanted to tell you
is that if we're not careful,

305
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,429
we could play right into the hands
of Lord Sangheon.

306
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,680
We?

307
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,767
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

308
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,982
We joined forces and had the scholars
make an appeal, did you forget?

309
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,403
I've heard people are suspecting that
it drove a wedge between me and the King.

310
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,907
So before others try to use that
as leverage--

311
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,784
I think you're getting the wrong idea,
Lord Changcheon.

312
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,287
The scholars' appeal
was solely your doing.

313
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,249
All I did was inform you
of what happened to Lord Changun,

314
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,418
so that his voice could be heard.

315
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,588
Are you really backing out right now?

316
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,175
What? You think I don't know
what your true intentions were?

317
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:55,012
You thought if the Crown Prince was out
of the picture, you'd be next in line.

318
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,890
Lord Sangheon and the Crown Prince
were jeopardized,

319
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,477
but Prince Jehyeon just happened
to get the upper hand in all this.

320
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,815
Sounds like you were very aware
of everything that's going on.

321
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,442
You should also be aware

322
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,237
that one must take responsibility
for their actions.

323
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,489
What? What did you say?

324
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,658
As I'm sure you are well aware,

325
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,495
one person here in the court has the most
to gain with the passing of His Majesty.

326
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,748
And since this is clear to everyone,

327
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,085
Lord Sangheon surely thinks
this is clear as well.

328
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,591
10,000 BAGS OF RICE
100 HORSES

329
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,635
160 SHORT SWORDS
70 BOWSTRINGS

330
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,763
Great Lord Changcheon
has amassed an army.

331
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:43,060
And I'm sure we both know
what this implies.

332
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,985
Amassing an army secretly
is clearly wrong,

333
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,488
but it is not enough
to accuse him of treason.

334
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,532
Recently…

335
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,954
Great Lord Changcheon clashed
with the late King

336
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,999
over the whole scholars' appeal situation.

337
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:10,671
His Majesty was well aware
of Great Lord Changcheon's

338
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,090
secret congregation of soldiers.

339
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,677
Don't you think Lord Changcheon
would fear the repercussions?

340
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,346
Wait a minute.

341
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,849
Are you saying…

342
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,477
Great Lord Changcheon poisoned the King?

343
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,942
It is your decision.

344
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,322
Will it be Prince Jehyeon
of treasonous origins or will it be…

345
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,325
the dethroned Prince?

346
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,505
My Queen,
Great Lord Changcheon shall enter.

347
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,597
So what happened?

348
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,767
I should have known better
than to work with Lord Wonsan.

349
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,271
How can he turn his back on me like this?

350
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,818
Rumor has it that you poisoned His Majesty
to prevent being reprimanded

351
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,528
for triggering the scholars.

352
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,572
What can we do about this?

353
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,449
Damn it. Damn it.

354
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,578
We can't just sit here
and watch this come about.

355
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,456
You need to rally your troops, Father.

356
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,417
-What?
-There is no time.

357
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,172
Write the letter. Do it now!

358
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,018
Explain yourselves!

359
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,729
They are traitors who killed the King.
Arrest them immediately!

360
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,190
-Yes, my lord.
-What?

361
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,150
What are you doing?
What is the meaning of this?

362
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,361
-How dare you!
-You take your hands off of me!

363
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,697
-How dare you lay hands on the Queen!
-Let us go right now!

364
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,825
I am a warlord!
How dare you lay your hands on me!

365
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,953
-How dare you!
-Let go of me! Let go!

366
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,164
How dare you lay your hands on me?

367
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,846
That's the poison you used.

368
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,849
You had the King's eunuch
put it in his herbal tonic.

369
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,352
What…

370
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,567
Before planning to start a war,

371
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,404
it's a good act you had
to choose your enemy as well.

372
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,322
Lord Sangheon…

373
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,828
-Take them away.
-Yes.

374
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,205
This is a set-up.

375
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,834
How dare you!
I will have your head for this.

376
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,918
We are being framed!

377
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,629
-Your Highness!
-Lord Sangheon!

378
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,839
Your Highness!

379
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,599
But why? Why did you come back here?

380
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,854
I came back only so I could…

381
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,232
see and bid farewell
to our deceased father.

382
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,109
Brother.

383
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,577
-Take him.
-Yes, my lord.

384
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,040
What is this?

385
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,542
Brother! Help me, please!

386
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,835
Let go of me!

387
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,587
Brother!

388
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,339
Let go!

389
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,724
Prince Jehyeon was just arrested.

390
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,559
Do you know what is happening?

391
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,063
The Queen and Great Lord Changcheon

392
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,108
conspired together to kill His Majesty.

393
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,903
But why?

394
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,907
Great Lord Changcheon
had no reason to do that.

395
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:12,454
When it comes to one's heart's desires,
reason doesn't always come into play.

396
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,751
The throne cannot be left vacant
for too long,

397
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,879
so please collect yourself
as soon as possible.

398
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,717
What do you mean by that?

399
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,472
-Am I--
-What I mean is that you are…

400
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,644
the only one destined to take
your father's place.

401
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,404
But how could I take his place,
I was deposed.

402
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:50,534
At the moment Prince Jehyeon
is the only eligible heir we have left.

403
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,703
Please release him this instant.

404
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,080
As I will also return to where I belong.

405
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,547
I'm afraid you may not.

406
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:09,303
Did you forget you tried to escape custody
with the help of your royal tutor?

407
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,972
Dying as a fugitive

408
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,017
who went on the run
against His Majesty's orders

409
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,185
is the only other option before you.

410
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,316
Commander Yoon Hyeong-seol
will have his limbs cut off.

411
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,527
Your eunuch and court lady
will be beheaded.

412
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,530
And your friend, Jung Ji-un,
will then be forced

413
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,325
to become a government slave
for the rest of his life.

414
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,749
Do you really want me to show you…

415
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:43,211
how far I am willing to go
in order to make you the King?

416
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,884
Why do you…

417
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,347
Why do you have to go this far,
Grandfather?

418
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,432
It's like I just told you,

419
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,311
when it comes to the heart's desires,
reason doesn't always apply.

420
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,231
Just take the throne.

421
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,361
If you truly wish to protect your people,

422
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,530
you ought to have the power to do so.

423
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,203
Is no one out there?

424
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,668
Escort His Royal Highness to his quarters.

425
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,044
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

426
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,691
Your Highness!

427
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,200
Step aside. How dare you draw your sword.

428
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,869
We were ordered by Lord Sangheon
to escort him to his quarters.

429
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,246
Any contact is forbidden.

430
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,145
Are you all right, Your Highness?

431
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:24,896
Hyun.

432
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,190
I'm glad to see you unharmed.

433
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,068
We will leave the palace.

434
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,946
I will escort you, if I may.

435
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,618
Lower your sword.

436
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,882
First Commander Yoon, and now
the people who serve His Highness?

437
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,053
Isn't that enough? Why are you
doing this to the Crown Prince?

438
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:01,183
Do you not realize
that you standing here unscathed

439
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,562
is my last courtesy
toward relatives of the royal family?

440
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,079
I heard Lord Wonsan…

441
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,708
had significant influence
in the deposition of His Highness.

442
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,547
Never again…

443
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:38,303
will you and your brother be given
any favor because of your position.

444
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,515
Keep that in mind.

445
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,398
Let go of me.

446
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,817
-Hyun!
-Let go of me!

447
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,569
Your Highness! Your Highness!

448
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,614
Your Highness!

449
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,096
SHINMUMUN

450
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,897
You're such a fool.

451
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,819
Where is His Royal Highness?

452
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,780
Do you have the slightest idea
of what you have done?

453
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,615
I have to meet with the Crown Prince.

454
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,618
You helped him try to flee.
What the hell were you trying to achieve!

455
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,786
Father!

456
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,664
I have to…

457
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,168
meet the prince.

458
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,628
He is not someone
you can meet at will now.

459
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,465
What do you mean by that?

460
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,676
His coronation will soon take place,

461
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,511
so you should leave.

462
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,680
Oh, wait…

463
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,893
Are you saying
that he will soon be made King?

464
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:12,814
That can't be.

465
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,568
No. No.

466
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:43,929
Brother.

467
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,601
Is it true?

468
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:55,357
Did… did Grandfather really poisoned
our father, brother?

469
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,777
It's not true, is it?

470
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,738
Please tell me it's not true.

471
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,872
All my life I have been scared.

472
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,543
I was scared that I might be forced
to take the crown from you.

473
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:17,837
But…

474
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,882
I guess I was mistaken.

475
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,262
It turns out I was actually scared
that my mother and grandfather

476
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,180
would get greedy and because of that…

477
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,599
it would end up landing me here.

478
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,727
I fear that I would die.

479
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,772
I'm scared of the thought of it alone.

480
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,113
I'm truly sorry, Gyeom.

481
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:45,991
I…

482
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,786
I thought I was facing hardships alone.

483
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,707
I thought it was only I who lived in fear.

484
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,879
Our father's death…

485
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,633
is all my fault.

486
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,931
I am the one to blame for his death.

487
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,911
You don't need to worry.

488
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,540
I will save you, Gyeom.

489
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,835
You will not die.

490
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,378
I'll never…

491
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,133
let any of them take your life, okay?

492
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,656
I will become King as you want.

493
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,994
And I will always remember
about how you are gracious…

494
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,498
to save me from exile and death,

495
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,169
so that I was made king.

496
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,632
But there is one thing…

497
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,927
that I would like to ask.

498
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,221
Go on. I'm listening.

499
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,560
Please make sure
that Prince Jehyeon lives.

500
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,439
Also, ensure the safety of my people.

501
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,692
I need for you to give me your word.

502
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,362
And if you do so,

503
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,075
I will gladly become your puppet king.

504
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,460
Will that be all, Your Majesty?

505
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,925
I'm humbled by your generosity,

506
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,010
Your Majesty.

507
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,190
Halt!

508
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,509
Put your swords down.

509
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,505
Are you all right?

510
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:58,928
Your wound, it…

511
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,308
It must not be fully healed.

512
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,149
I am sorry.

513
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,694
I am…

514
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,656
truly so sorry.

515
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,286
It can't be.

516
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:25,997
Tell me it's not true.

517
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:32,170
You promised me that we would be together.

518
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,466
It's not too late. I mean…

519
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,885
You can still leave the palace.

520
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,763
Allow me to escort you, please--

521
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,014
As of this moment,

522
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,312
you are not allowed to be by my side.

523
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,690
Forever.

524
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,245
Then…

525
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,166
allow me…

526
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,962
at least allow me to tend to your wound.

527
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,308
Bow.

528
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,274
Rise.

529
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,111
Bow.

530
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:25,158
His Majesty shall now enter.

531
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,431
Let the morning assembly begin.

532
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:04,173
I will stay by your side, Your Majesty,
until your wound gets better.

533
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,175
The one and only desire I have

534
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,220
is to produce a son
and to see you as happy as possible.

535
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,973
Please let me handle
these burdensome matters,

536
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,475
so you can focus on producing an heir.

537
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,643
I'll keep that in mind, then.

538
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,728
How is His Majesty?
How's his wound?

539
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,813
Has it healed yet?

540
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,440
-He has a wound?
-Did you know this whole time?

541
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,694
If anything happens to His Majesty,
I will lose my mind.

542
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,363
And I hope that you'll put an end to it
before it hurts.

543
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,531
Hyun.

544
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:32,451
His Majesty has become my whole world now.
