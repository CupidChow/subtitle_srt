1
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,766
PREVIOUSLY…

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,643
Your Highness, are you okay?

3
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,688
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un
of the Crown Prince

4
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,649
is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?

5
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,901
-Oh, no.
-Your Highness!

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,445
Why do you have…

7
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,530
this particular book?

8
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,450
That girl must have been
someone special to you.

9
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,868
She was my first love.

10
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,161
You have a big problem!

11
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,539
The Minister of Personnel
lodged a demand for your resignation.

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,417
My resignation?
I'm in need of your help.

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,710
You're the only person
who can help me now.

14
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,545
-There is nothing I can do for you.
-Yeong-ji!

15
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,506
So I advise you to stop asking.

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,133
You could have just punished me
right from the beginning.

17
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,053
Why do you insist on torturing my friends
and putting everyone in danger?

18
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,055
Moreover, he deceived me
and the Crown Prince.

19
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,598
The degree of his crime is quite severe.

20
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,226
Who exactly is going to get killed?

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,688
As the Crown Prince, I demand,
give the prisoners to me.

22
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:50,443
If you do, no one will shed
one drop of blood here tonight.

23
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,035
Allow me…

24
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,581
…to answer that question.

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,283
The person who moved the prisoners…

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,285
was actually me.

27
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,335
I was taught that prisons
are a place to punish sinners

28
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,087
not a place to kill them.

29
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,299
Even though it is not His Majesty's will,

30
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,802
the living conditions in prisons
have become horrendous.

31
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,389
Just led many prisoners
to starve or freeze to death.

32
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,851
For that reason,
even without receiving permission,

33
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,978
I decided to move the prisoners.

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,480
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,905
You dare to interrupt

36
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,574
today's ruling to notify me
of this frivolous matter?

37
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,872
Your Majesty, I have urgent information

38
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,708
regarding the incidents
that occurred at Samgaebang.

39
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,170
This is not a matter His Highness
should involve himself in.

40
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,088
I'll allow it.

41
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,007
Tell me what you know.

42
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,596
Royal Tutor Jung

43
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,474
never disobeyed
the custom of our class system.

44
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,935
The people who actually did…

45
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,313
would be those two.

46
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,570
You may enter.

47
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,959
One is an herb gatherer

48
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,462
who supplied several pharmacies
within the capital and the other…

49
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,509
is the custodian of Literary
Licentiate Choi's warehouse.

50
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,846
Now you tell His Majesty
what you told me before.

51
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,352
Samgaebang's physician was accused

52
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:34,315
of prescribing overpriced medicine,
but that is not true.

53
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:39,320
In reality, Literary Licentiate Choi
over here

54
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,739
bought all the medicinal herbs
available from villages

55
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,492
and stocked them in the storage he owns.

56
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,370
Adult and children
were dying left and right,

57
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,330
due to a lack of medicine.

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,541
After hearing about that,

59
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,043
Physician Jung found herbs
with similar effect

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,878
and made them affordable.

61
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,881
It resulted in the price drop
of the herbs in storage

62
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,717
which prompted this accusation.

63
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,679
Is everything he said the truth?

64
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,723
He's spouting lies in here.

65
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,224
I'm being falsely accused!

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,727
No, you are not! We speak the truth!

67
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,855
Here. I have a list
with all the transactions.

68
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,398
MEDICINAL HERB INVENTORY LEDGER

69
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,118
So you're saying that Samgaebang
was a place that helped the unfortunate,

70
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,828
unlike the rumors.

71
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,081
And it never broke any rules,
is that correct?

72
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,417
Yes, although…

73
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,587
I guess that depends
on what each person views

74
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,923
as following the rules
and as helping the unfortunate too.

75
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,429
What I'm trying to say is that Samgaebang
didn't go against the justice

76
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,350
that I wish to see
in this nation's promising future.

77
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,146
And I know Royal Tutor Jung shares
the very same values.

78
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:03,488
I also consider His Royal Highness' claims
to be true, Your Majesty.

79
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,532
But you were the one

80
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,702
who first raised questions
regarding this matter!

81
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,331
I realize now I acted too quickly
without taking time enough to look…

82
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,875
…into the truth of the matter.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,044
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

84
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,640
Good.

85
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,267
However, that was not the only issue.

86
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,521
Jung Ji-un became a royal tutor
without disclosing

87
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,815
his previous operations.

88
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,948
If I may dare to say so,

89
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,535
Royal Tutor Jung never lied
about his past endeavors.

90
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,831
In fact, I accepted his teaching
while aware of his past.

91
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,128
And I'm sure you remember
that I did inform you of this matter.

92
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,759
But you chose not to listen to me,
Your Majesty.

93
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,678
In the end,

94
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,848
you still decided to move forward
with appointing Tutor Jung.

95
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,600
So if anyone's to blame,

96
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,480
wouldn't it be fair to say that in reality
Your Majesty and the members of the court…

97
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,110
were at fault for failing to conduct
a background check?

98
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,745
So you're saying it's our fault
because we were negligent?

99
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,765
Do not forget.

100
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,311
Whatever path ahead that I choose…

101
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,314
will also be your path.

102
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,775
And if you deviate from that path,

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,361
I will never forgive you,

104
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,240
no matter how much I adore you.

105
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,171
I want to go with you…

106
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,174
on that path you wish to take.

107
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,309
Aren't you curious, Grandfather?

108
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,646
Don't you want to know how…

109
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,149
and in what way I'm planning
to follow your lead?

110
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,166
Is the Crown Prince finally ready
to fight his battle?

111
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,485
EPISODE 7

112
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,059
Thank you so much, my friend.

113
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,270
It's not me who you should thank.

114
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,730
It's His Royal Highness.

115
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,619
Your Highness,

116
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,539
no words can possibly show my gratitude.

117
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,044
There is no need to thank me.

118
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,504
I just couldn't sit and do nothing…

119
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,466
once I found out the whole truth.

120
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,471
You should head to Seorin-bang now.

121
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,723
Your assistants are there.

122
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,309
You'll finally be reunited.

123
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,122
I had no idea you plan
on getting involved in this matter.

124
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,876
Well…

125
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,921
He is your friend, isn't he?

126
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,507
Also…

127
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,385
he is my tutor.

128
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,106
JEONOKSEO

129
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,661
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

130
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,787
Ji-un.

131
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,673
You won the Crown Prince's trust
in a short amount of time.

132
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,841
Well…

133
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,719
I'd expect no less
from someone as prodigious as you.

134
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,181
If you so much as lay a finger
on these two again--

135
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,808
If you don't want to be in the palace…

136
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,436
I won't force you to anymore.

137
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,020
But…

138
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
don't you dare even think about
being a hack of a physician again.

139
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,776
Both for your sake

140
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,820
and for your mother's, especially.

141
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,823
Consider how painful it could be

142
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,868
to hear the name of your one and only son…

143
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,495
toss around like garbage.

144
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,238
My lady! My lady!

145
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,283
My lady, it's deep into the night.

146
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,659
-My lady!
-Stop this.

147
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,828
-I can't take it anymore.
-Oh, where are you headed?

148
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,830
-My lady, it's dangerous.
-Let me go!

149
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,749
I can't let this slide.
I have to do something.

150
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,000
But it's dangerous.

151
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,335
What could be so dangerous?

152
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,378
-Let go!
-Please, my lady. Wait!

153
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,263
-Those blabbermouths--
-I knew it was you.

154
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,267
I was wondering whose voice was so loud.

155
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,561
Ji-un!

156
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh. Are you all right?
Are you doing okay, huh?

157
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,733
Yes. Of course, I am.

158
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,320
My lady, your shoes don't match.

159
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,321
Don't worry.

160
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,448
I can take care of that. You may go.

161
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,706
So they're speaking ill of me again, huh?

162
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,958
The ladies in Bukchon?

163
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,085
No, that's not it.

164
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,588
Well, you know, they used to love
passing around

165
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,923
the medicine you prescribed but…

166
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,634
now they're saying ridiculous things.

167
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,554
They're obviously jealous
that you became a royal tutor,

168
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,389
so how can I let them carry on?

169
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,020
I thought you were
the inspector's calm and better half.

170
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,564
From what I've heard,

171
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,692
you used to be the most shy and modest
maiden in the village.

172
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,279
My one and only son made me
a salty woman, that's why.

173
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,494
How much longer will you spend
your days away from home?

174
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,705
It's time you moved back in.

175
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,418
Your father is worried about you.

176
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,508
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,472
Goodness, I… just said
the same thing again.

178
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,851
Just come by whenever you want.

179
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,477
Just like today, right?

180
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,355
Your room is still as it was.

181
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,276
Working at the palace, uh,
doesn't define success.

182
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,153
If you're happy doing what you wanna do,

183
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,572
that's what makes you successful,
isn't it?

184
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,199
So don't let anyone intimidate you.

185
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,076
Do what you wanna do.

186
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,745
Not what others want you to.

187
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,913
Understand?

188
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,695
Uh…

189
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,995
Weren't you going to
go back to Samgaebang,

190
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,873
uh, once you finally
saved your assistants?

191
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,416
Nuh-uh.

192
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,794
You went through a hassle
in order to clear my name,

193
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,046
so I couldn't part ways.

194
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,133
I have decided to stay where my heart is,
at least for a while longer.

195
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,927
Mm, your heart?

196
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,222
Your Highness, I had the wrong idea
about you in the past.

197
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
I let my judgment be clouded
by your nicknames,

198
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,352
Five Step Prince and Ice Prince,

199
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,481
and I assumed that you were reckless
and even cold-hearted too.

200
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,485
However, that wasn't the case.

201
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,907
You turned out to be, uh,
a man of outstanding generosity

202
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,575
whose…

203
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,079
…worthy of having a place
in this Confucian classic.

204
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,083
A cold-hearted soul

205
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,128
who doesn't bat an eye
even at the sight of death?

206
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,340
No, that was only a preposterous rumor.

207
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,758
I'm living proof of it,

208
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,468
don't you agree?

209
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,678
Therefore…

210
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:58,517
would you care to clarify
why he is the Ice Prince, hmm?

211
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,854
Because his heart
is icy cold all year round--

212
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,025
Ice is transparent
and it sparkles under the sun.

213
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,278
One might argue
that it's more elegant than any jewel.

214
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,405
And that my friend is the origin

215
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,116
behind his nickname the Ice Prince!

216
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:28,088
Why do I feel like he…
might get the promotion before I do?

217
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,979
Your Highness.

218
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,318
Your Highness.

219
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,029
The weather's pleasant today.

220
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,547
It's nice to enjoy a lecture outside
for a change.

221
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,174
It's been a while, hasn't it?

222
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,135
You should watch where you're going.

223
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,804
If you keep walking backwards,

224
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,598
you'll definitely trip and fall
into the pond.

225
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,851
I'm more sturdy and nimble
than people think

226
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,770
which is why I've never tripped before--

227
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,897
Oh, no!

228
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,319
Oh!

229
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,466
Your Highness.

230
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,563
Amazing.

231
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,987
I'm going too, Your Highness!

232
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,291
THE WATER IS COLD
AND THE NIGHT IS CHILLY

233
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,299
WITH WIND…

234
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,606
You look inspired.
What is it that you're writing?

235
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,549
WELCOME RAIN ON A SPRING NIGHT

236
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,385
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

237
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,767
"A good rain knows its seasons right."

238
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,647
I don't think
I properly expressed my gratitude…

239
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,234
for all the help I received from you.

240
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,614
Like the rain that falls
when it's needed most,

241
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,826
I'd like to be there
when you need me the most as well.

242
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,206
Just like you were for me

243
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,250
when I needed you the most.

244
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,572
It's raining, Your Royal Highness.

245
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,033
Perfect timing, no?

246
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,021
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

247
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,567
Your Royal Highness, it's Bok-dong.

248
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,780
What is this about?

249
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,157
Oh, eh…

250
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,661
Well, Court Lady Kim, she ordered me
to check if you're set for the night.

251
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,788
Oh.

252
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,505
By the way, Bok-dong…

253
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,049
Yes, Your Highness.

254
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,343
About Royal Tutor Jung.

255
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,220
Has he been getting along with

256
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,097
those at the Royal Institute?

257
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,932
Oh, you have no idea.

258
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,018
It's like second nature to him now.

259
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,480
He brings them alcohol,
he gladly trades shifts.

260
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,607
He is as easygoing as they get,

261
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,401
and he is highly praised by the rest.

262
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,279
You can tell right away
that he's nothing like his father.

263
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,698
Even from the way
he acts towards you, right?

264
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,993
But why do you ask about him though?

265
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,953
Hmm?

266
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,997
No reason.

267
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,669
If you're done, then why don't you
dismiss yourself, Bok-dong.

268
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,962
Yes, Your Highness.

269
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,131
Uh… Uh, have a goodnight then.

270
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,235
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

271
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,163
If it's a concern
for His Majesty's health conditions,

272
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,500
it might not be a bad idea
that the Crown Prince

273
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,877
should welcome the envoys.

274
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,006
I do understand of your desire
to give more authority to…

275
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,551
His Royal Highness.

276
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,929
In that case, I'm trusting that you're…

277
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:56,643
going to make an official request
to His Majesty, is that right?

278
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,439
Well, it does seem that you often
make use of your cloth

279
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,983
and request that you influence the King.

280
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,821
I noticed that with the incident
involving the tutor.

281
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,616
But I do have to say that…

282
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,537
lately, I haven't been pleased
with how often you…

283
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,914
overstep your authority.

284
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,305
Overstep my authority?

285
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,056
You know…

286
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,769
that I wholeheartedly vowed
my allegiance to the former king

287
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,480
with blood on my lips.

288
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,647
It's safe to say,

289
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,525
I put my life on the line
to help him take the throne.

290
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,196
How could you possibly say
such a thing about me?

291
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,740
I understand your fondness
for the Crown Prince,

292
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,577
but you should also serve
and respect His Majesty above all.

293
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,706
If you happen to offend him in any way,
you will be answering to me.

294
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,461
Then wouldn't it be only fair that
you lead by example, Your Highness?

295
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,880
What do you mean?

296
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,383
More and more key officials
are being appointed in your favor

297
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,511
in preparation for a war.

298
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,972
Your Highness, do I have to remind you

299
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,016
how much I have been considerate

300
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,102
of your desire
to vest yourself in strength

301
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,897
and to give your family power.

302
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,150
You dare to threaten me right to my face?

303
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,027
Of course not, Your Highness.

304
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,322
My only desire now and forever

305
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,658
is for those after His Highness' crown

306
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,327
to no longer present any threat.

307
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,457
That's all I want.

308
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,793
Therefore…

309
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,591
I suggest we refrain from
pointless bickering, Your Highness.

310
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,066
I don't think so.

311
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,569
His foot?

312
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,655
So my father's foot disease
has already come back?

313
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,823
Yes.

314
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,077
His prognosis doesn't look very good

315
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,622
due to all the stress
from the state affairs.

316
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,757
Listen,

317
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,843
other than Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong,

318
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,845
he's the first to serve you
from close proximity.

319
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,640
Hasn't it been uncomfortable?

320
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,143
I have to get used to it.

321
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,645
Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong

322
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,855
shouldn't be the only ones
to serve me forever.

323
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,690
Right.

324
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,797
Your Majesty.

325
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,133
Leave the herbal tonic.

326
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,357
Father.

327
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,985
It's me, your son.

328
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,364
Mm. What brings you here?

329
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,077
I've been meaning to make a request
if I may, Father.

330
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:36,005
Please allow me to be in charge
of receiving the envoys.

331
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,886
Aren't you aware of that being
the responsibility of Prince Jaeun?

332
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,306
Actually, I was hoping to greet them…

333
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,644
in Your Majesty's place
when they finally arrived at the palace.

334
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:54,190
I'm aware that the same request
came from the Queen Dowager as well.

335
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,152
And do you believe
that that is what I want?

336
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,780
I will greet the envoys

337
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,741
as it is customary.

338
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,243
You are dismissed.

339
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,249
If you don't mind, Father,

340
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,004
may I ask if it's because
you still don't have faith in me?

341
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,680
I am well aware that you were against
my installation as Crown Prince.

342
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,349
Was it…

343
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,644
because of my maternal grandfather?

344
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,022
Or was…

345
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,028
Gyeom-i… the reason
for your change of heart.

346
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,446
Tell me…

347
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,074
why are you bringing this up
after all this time?

348
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:50,205
To be frank, I understand why you
would find my grandfather to be difficult.

349
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,415
But greeting the envoys

350
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,043
is something I want for myself.

351
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,215
Put your faith in me this time.

352
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,843
That's all I'm asking you.

353
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,970
Father…

354
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,475
I will not let you down if you do.

355
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,952
Oh, no!

356
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,833
Oh!

357
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,308
Oh, so sweet. Hmm.

358
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,354
Mm. There's something cute about him.

359
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,444
How are preparations coming along
at the guesthouses for the envoys?

360
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,406
Did you hear from the governor
who went to Uiju with them?

361
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,158
You should pace yourself.

362
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,577
Try not to worry too much.

363
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,038
I am taking His Majesty's place.

364
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,374
You know there can be no room for error.

365
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,795
Just let your mind rest for the moment.

366
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,630
I have to be at the market soon.

367
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,508
I'll make sure to get the report
sent by the governor then.

368
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
Your Royal Highness.

369
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:47,113
I hear lectures have been canceled
to focus on greeting the envoys.

370
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,408
Yes, I'm afraid I won't be able
to attend for now.

371
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,243
I see.

372
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,249
Since you're busy,
I'll keep it as short as possible.

373
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,003
Not even the legendary physician Hua Tuo
has seen these pills

374
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,881
which were made with nothing less
than a drop of dragon tears--

375
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,675
Do you have nothing to do?
Should I ask Royal Scholar Yang to--

376
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,969
No. Actually, I'm quite busy as well.

377
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,894
Take some when you are having
a difficult time.

378
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,273
It will give you courage
and reduce of anxiety.

379
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,444
So, um…

380
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,572
Ah!

381
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,138
Was it Royal Tutor Jung who just came by?

382
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,228
No one can match his anti-climactic ways.

383
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,290
They are all of good quality.

384
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,917
Yeah, sure, if you say so.

385
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,669
Let me take a look for myself.

386
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,970
Oh, I'll take this one.

387
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,521
Have them delivered
to Samgaebang.

388
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,150
This one right here.

389
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,027
And this.

390
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,695
And this. This one too.

391
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,740
You know what?

392
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,908
We should just send all of these, okay?

393
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,243
Yes, my lady.

394
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,626
Are you sending
all of these to Samgaebang?

395
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,380
Like I said, that's the least
I can do for them so…

396
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,678
What on earth?

397
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,932
Oh…

398
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,024
You must be the type to apologize
with gifts rather than words.

399
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,071
Oh, well, I…

400
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,492
Wait. Why? Do you happen
to think that's wrong?

401
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,036
I'm apologizing for my wrongdoing

402
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,330
by helping them get what they need
the most at this time.

403
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,125
And I'm only doing so
because I can afford it.

404
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,714
I'm just saying.

405
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,386
Anyway, why are you carrying
that hand plow around?

406
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,388
Oh, this?

407
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,308
I'm just looking to plant, uh,
plant some flowers.

408
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,812
I can't afford to buy them
like someone I know,

409
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,855
so I'll just plant them myself.

410
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,401
Wait.

411
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,825
Forgive me.

412
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,162
For putting you in a predicament,
you know.

413
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,624
I wanted to apologize in person,

414
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,585
but I couldn't muster up the courage.

415
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,550
Uh, why are you smiling?

416
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,884
Oh, well…

417
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,970
'cause I was joking.

418
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,348
Besides, you have nothing
to apologize for.

419
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,269
It's not like you, uh,
lied to get me in trouble.

420
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,813
You know I didn't think…

421
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,233
it'd be so funny to tease you.

422
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,730
Why do you wish to plant flowers
in the palace, though?

423
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,526
Well, um, they're pretty, aren't they?

424
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,759
Oh.

425
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,854
Oh, and we should hang lots
of square lanterns

426
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,731
to light up the streets more.

427
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,191
-Will do, Your Highness.
-Mm.

428
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,610
Oh, and what would you like to do
about the roof?

429
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,113
The roof should be prepared
accordingly too.

430
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,581
All right, right here.
Come and get yours.

431
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,875
Take a closer look. Here, try this one.

432
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,377
What's the matter?

433
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,004
Oh.

434
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,465
It's nothing.

435
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,073
Um, who…

436
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,367
Oh, this man here…

437
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,915
I mean, they are colleagues I work with.

438
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,625
Oh.

439
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,211
So that means you two work
at the Royal Institute too, right?

440
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,131
Well, I guess so.

441
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,257
Oh.

442
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,051
May I ask… your name?

443
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,887
Oh, forgive my belated introduction.

444
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,806
Shin So-eun is my name.

445
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,520
-This is the only table left so go ahead--
-Actually…

446
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,273
since we ran into each other,

447
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,401
why don't we all eat together?

448
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,863
Four bowls of soup with rice, please.

449
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,887
Didn't you say you were busy?

450
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:13,726
Never did I imagine you having
an affectionate side, Royal Tutor Jung.

451
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,104
Affectionate?

452
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,316
So beautiful.

453
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,819
The flowers, I mean.

454
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,530
Ah.

455
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,493
Tutor Jung was kind enough
to spare some for me.

456
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,827
Hm.

457
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,245
Anyway,

458
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,331
how do the two of you know each other?

459
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,542
-Uh, yes, well, that's--
-That's…

460
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,046
That's actually a very long story.

461
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,130
Here's the food you ordered.

462
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,256
Wow.

463
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,258
We should eat first.

464
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,641
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

465
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,019
All right. Allow me to add
a spoonful here.

466
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,194
-I'll do it. Allow me.
-It's fine. I'll do it myself.

467
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,613
Oh, come on, this is my specialty,
let me do it.

468
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,240
I said it's fine!

469
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,419
Uh…

470
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,379
Are… are you all right?

471
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,264
I'll do it myself.

472
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,190
Lord Jung, you also have some
on your sleeves.

473
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,569
I'm… I'm fine, it's just…

474
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,889
GWANGHWAMUN

475
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,911
I guess it's been a while
since you set foot…

476
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,705
in your homeland.

477
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,125
Homeland? What a joke.

478
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,888
NOKUNGAK

479
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,221
We did our best

480
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,348
to make your stay here with us

481
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,016
as comfortable as possible.

482
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,187
I do hope everything is up to par.

483
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,523
We appreciate all you have done for us.

484
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,818
You can speak comfortably from now on

485
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,487
for we have prepared well
for our arrival here.

486
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,454
This ornamental knife
has accompanied us from Ming.

487
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,248
It's a lucky one, don't you think?

488
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,166
I'd rather rest, so please leave us.

489
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,350
Did you know that a new emperor
was crowned last year?

490
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,185
From what I have heard,

491
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,313
those two played a major role
in his crowning.

492
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,899
This way, please.

493
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,986
They await you. They're here.

494
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,080
I'm glad you're here.

495
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,418
Why is Lord Sangheon meeting
with Tutor Jung?

496
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,215
Ah…

497
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,718
He has a history
with the Vice Minister of Rites,

498
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,637
so he must be here to greet him.

499
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,348
Would you like to join them?

500
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,019
What will I say at an event
to which I wasn't invited?

501
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,480
Wouldn't want to interrupt.

502
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,650
I heard I was urgently summoned.

503
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,943
Was it by you?

504
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,411
I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.

505
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,997
I'm the one who summoned you here.

506
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,907
Physician Jung!

507
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,122
It's been too long.

508
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,083
What brings you here?

509
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,799
I couldn't ever find you in Ming,

510
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,010
so when the Left State Councilor said
he'd arrange for us to see each other,

511
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,387
I thought he was joking.

512
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,681
Who knew we'd meet again like this,
am I right?

513
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,018
Left State Councilor, I'm truly grateful.

514
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:34,022
When I heard one of my own
ended up saving your life,

515
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,359
you have no idea how surprised I was.

516
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,196
I guess it's safe to say
that this was the work of faith, right?

517
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,995
As if that even qualifies
to saving his life.

518
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,913
That's a little dramatic.

519
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,421
I'm afraid I must apologize.

520
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,716
Duty calls at the Office
of the Inspector General.

521
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,084
Physician Jung,
allow me to pour you a drink.

522
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,381
It truly has been too long.

523
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,926
I agree, Vice Minister.

524
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,789
So the rumors about
the Left State Councilor

525
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,208
being the richest in Joseon are true.

526
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,588
So, what exactly is it
that he wants from us?

527
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,925
He's planning on developing
the land in Yeoyeon,

528
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,385
and he needs permission.

529
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,553
Yeoyeon?

530
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,639
Barbarians constantly invade that land.

531
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,140
Why would he want to develop…

532
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,852
Ah.

533
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,691
He wants to build an army under
the pretense of protecting the border.

534
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,817
How greedy.

535
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,737
Tell him that he doesn't need to worry.

536
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,528
I'm truly grateful for this grand welcome.

537
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,281
However,

538
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:32,284
if only you had focused
more of your energy

539
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,745
on improving the roads leading to Joseon,

540
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,081
I wouldn't be so fatigued from the trip.

541
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,921
That means we'd be clearing a path
for the barbarians up in the north.

542
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,341
That's the reason why we've been hesitant.

543
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,762
Well, you still should have taken the time
to clear a road to Ming though.

544
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,348
Developing the land in Yeoyeon
will make the trading with Ming

545
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,308
significantly less demanding.

546
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,269
That place is a strategic point
for our defense.

547
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,355
Hasty decisions cannot be made.

548
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,857
That's why I'm offering you my assistance.

549
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,194
I will let the Emperor know
of these issues regarding Yeoyeon.

550
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,322
All I suggest is that
you respond to him promptly.

551
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,224
That's so good.

552
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,686
Isn't she beautiful?

553
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,688
Especially the one in the second row.

554
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,200
So, is there a girl
that has caught your eye, my lord?

555
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,494
Don't hesitate to tell me.

556
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:43,081
Whether it's ten girls or a hundred,
I'll make sure you see them tonight.

557
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,712
Uh, from what I hear, girls sent
as offerings are quite adored,

558
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,466
so much so that some even
become imperial concubines.

559
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,302
The girl to serve you tonight…

560
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,139
will also be a lucky one.

561
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,767
I see.

562
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,020
So I can have my pick of girls?

563
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,773
Your request is my command.

564
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:12,277
From what I hear,
your wife's beauty is actually blinding.

565
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,403
Uh…

566
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,363
Could I take her back with me then?

567
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,908
Sorry?

568
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,411
That was quite the jest, my lord.

569
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,250
A jest?

570
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,422
So does that mean
that you were taunting me just now?

571
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,302
You said that being sent to Ming
as an offering is an honor,

572
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,305
but not when it comes
to your own family, is that it?

573
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,681
Uh, no.

574
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,142
Uh, that's not what I meant, sir.

575
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,238
What is the meaning of this?

576
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,618
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

577
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:06,081
It's just that this man here promised me
something that he will not deliver.

578
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:12,170
I will punish him accordingly
once I gather all of the facts,

579
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,089
so please let your anger subside.

580
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,759
What is there to investigate
and find out, Your Majesty?

581
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,094
Sometimes one can…

582
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,347
justify an immediate execution.

583
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,271
Please spare my life!

584
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,065
That is enough.

585
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,447
You are in the palace of Joseon.

586
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,368
His Majesty said
that he'd get to the truth,

587
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,245
so we'll deal with it
according to the law.

588
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,458
Leave and await your ruling.

589
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,503
Yes, Your Highness.

590
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,436
This doesn't concern you.

591
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,856
Allow me to greet you.

592
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,948
I'm Jung Ji-un,
a royal tutor at the palace.

593
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,910
This is a festive banquet
yet you seem upset,

594
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,369
so I'd like to serve you a drink.

595
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,830
Would you accept it?

596
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,964
Please don't be like that.

597
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,216
Just accept this drink.

598
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,554
I would… consider it a great honor.

599
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,896
You speak out of place
because you know that you are favored

600
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,981
by the Vice Minister of Rites.

601
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,996
Get lost.

602
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,087
Maybe…

603
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,466
it's because it came from you,
the drink tastes so amazing.

604
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,760
Is that so?

605
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,054
Then have some more.

606
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,141
That's about enough.

607
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,562
Maybe you don't realize it,
but by failing to show courtesy to Joseon,

608
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,064
you're dishonoring the Emperor.

609
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,194
Yes, that is enough.

610
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,997
So this is where you were,
Your Highness.

611
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,927
Did you have to make me feel so uneasy
by doing what I didn't order you to do?

612
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,973
It was an important banquet.

613
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,393
I was only worried
that things possibly would escalate.

614
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,103
Well, it is not your job

615
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,646
to spend time worrying about me.

616
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,109
Pretend you didn't see…

617
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,570
or hear anything.

618
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,031
That's what you should do.

619
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,288
Wait. There's another child.

620
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,331
Go and get him.

621
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,666
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

622
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,252
Sit down.

623
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,212
I said sit down.

624
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,946
Well, it's not your job
to spend time worrying about me.

625
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,118
Is this what you serve
as food in these lands?

626
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,039
Is there a problem?

627
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,665
I should be asking you that.

628
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,003
Everything you served
is nothing but waste.

629
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,880
How am I supposed to eat, anyway?

630
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,638
Forgive me, sir.

631
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,933
I had the kitchen prepare
what I believe to be your favorite,

632
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,976
but I guess it doesn't suit your palate.

633
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,646
Go prepare the food again.

634
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,314
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

635
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,738
By the way,

636
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,575
has a decision been made regarding
the man who taunted me last night?

637
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,995
I think we should have cut out his tongue,

638
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,206
that way he can't gush any more nonsense.

639
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,126
The Office of the Inspector General
is reviewing the case.

640
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,547
He will be punished severely
once they come to a ruling,

641
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,715
so please let your anger subside.

642
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,552
How about you just let me
take care of it myself?

643
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,387
If you think about it,

644
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,014
it is less work for you if I execute him.

645
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:24,394
Even a man guilty of treason
is punished by law and by custom.

646
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,354
So I advise you…

647
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,649
to forget and drop this issue.

648
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,738
Acting tough, are we?

649
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,868
Wait.

650
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,038
What did you just say to me?

651
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:44,998
What do you mean?

652
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,426
What did you just do?

653
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,556
You dare treat me with disdain?

654
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,268
-Uh…
-How dare you communicate in code

655
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,436
in my presence!

656
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,107
That… that is not true, my lord.

657
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,358
Communicating in code?

658
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,526
What are you talking about?

659
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,154
I will have the food served again.

660
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,531
Follow me.

661
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,002
How dare you follow him out.

662
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,755
Putrid bitch, you just
don't know your place, do you?

663
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,342
Court Lady Kim! Court Lady Kim!

664
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,887
What the hell do you think you're doing?

665
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,768
Well, I'm teaching her some manners
as you can see now.

666
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,646
Why? Does this require
proper procedure too?

667
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,652
Do you know what I despise the most?

668
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:59,822
Words or actions of disrespect
which you just showed me once again.

669
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,450
Today, you will be lucky
to be taught some manners.

670
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,135
No!

671
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,595
Court Lady Kim!

672
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,264
What's happening?

673
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,609
Court Lady Kim…

674
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,832
Your Royal Highness!

675
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,041
No, no! Don't!

676
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,960
Your Royal Highness, don't!

677
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,979
You must not do this.
Your Royal Highness, no!

678
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,821
Your Royal Highness…

679
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,932
Your Royal Highness,
you did the right thing.

680
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,392
If you are disgruntled,
take it up with me, understood?

681
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,394
That also means you will leave
the innocent alone.

682
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,979
People like you
are hypocrites

683
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,981
who pretend to care for the people.

684
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,566
I want to destroy people like you.

685
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,402
You saw someone suspicious
in the Chief's chambers?

686
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,987
I must look into the Chief Eunuch.

687
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,406
So until the day
you finally leave Joseon,

688
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,326
security at this guesthouse
will be increased.

689
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,828
If you ever go anywhere
near her,

690
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:52,912
then you're going to pay for it!

691
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,247
Thank you for everything

692
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,123
and for helping me with this.

693
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,793
If I could, I'd like
to keep helping you,

694
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,920
but only if you want me to, Your Highness.
