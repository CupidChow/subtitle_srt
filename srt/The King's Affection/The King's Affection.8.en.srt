1
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,067
Your Royal Highness, no, no!

2
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,283
Your Royal Highness…

3
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,287
Why did you do it?

4
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,042
Why in the world would you do
such a thing?

5
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,089
I put my faith in you.

6
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,717
And you disappointed me.

7
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,647
You did the right thing.

8
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,525
Your Royal Highness…

9
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,028
you did the right thing.

10
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,894
You're a strong and brave man
who beat up the Chief Eunuch by yourself.

11
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,938
I'm sure you can handle this.

12
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
I'm fine. Thank you for that.

13
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,194
Let me just treat your hand.

14
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,217
This might not be the right time
to bring this up,

15
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,139
but I know that you saw me
at the guesthouse.

16
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,852
I know I shouldn't have been there,
so I'm sorry if that disappointed you.

17
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,312
But I swear,

18
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,398
I didn't do anything to disgrace myself.

19
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,693
Just in case you misread the situation--

20
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,445
No, I don't think I misread it.

21
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,283
I know that you're…

22
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,162
not the kind of person
who would do anything like that.

23
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,915
Okay, then…

24
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,628
why were you so distant
towards me at the banquet?

25
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,715
Well…

26
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,306
I didn't want you to be left
in a tough situation

27
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,058
on account of me, so…

28
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,642
That's why.

29
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,688
I feel the same way.

30
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,984
So now that we understand each other,

31
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,237
please don't hide yourself away anymore.

32
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,705
There. It's all done.

33
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,640
EPISODE 8

34
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,628
I'm really fine, Your Royal Highness.

35
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,214
And I know that your hand has to be sore.

36
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,092
Come on, I told you to sit still.

37
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,811
Your hair…

38
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,981
So beautiful…

39
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,443
even when it's short.

40
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,745
Thanks to the Chief Eunuch,

41
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,747
I get the chance
to have my hair done by you.

42
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,585
This is truly such a blessing to me.

43
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,596
Your Royal Highness.

44
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,396
It's the Chief Eunuch's subordinate.

45
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,065
He invited you,
the Vice Minister of Rites,

46
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,276
and Royal Tutor Jung for a drink.

47
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,612
He wants me to join?

48
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,365
Yes. Should I tell them
to station royal guards there?

49
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,536
That's all right.

50
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,039
I can't afford a cheap trick like that.

51
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,665
There mustn't be any more problems.

52
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,421
I'm going to head there now.

53
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,799
Find Royal Tutor Jung and take him
over to the guesthouse. Okay?

54
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,051
Yes, Your Highness.

55
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,826
It seems the Vice Minister of Rites
hasn't arrived yet.

56
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,329
Men can resolve
this kind of matter over drinks.

57
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,208
There's no need to bother
anyone else about this.

58
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,752
Please sit down.

59
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,183
As a peace offering,
I've asked you to come,

60
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,435
so I could show you something interesting.

61
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,770
What do you say?

62
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,025
Come on out.

63
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,811
I've heard that your guard over there
is the best swordsman in Joseon.

64
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,442
Care to put that to the test with mine?

65
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,662
Whose is better doesn't matter.

66
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,207
If this is why you asked to see me,
you can count me out.

67
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,335
I need to get back, anyway.

68
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,217
We're leaving.

69
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,986
What do you think you're doing there?

70
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,955
My guard is the best swordsman in Ming.

71
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,168
But since he wasn't with me the other day
when I was beaten to a bloody pulp,

72
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,506
I thought he deserved a chance
to show me he's still worth my money.

73
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,133
Stop it right now. That's enough!

74
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,053
Why? When you gave the beating,
you had fun.

75
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,972
Now, it's your man in it,
but you don't wanna watch him take it?

76
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,709
I told you that's enough!

77
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,214
If I get so much as a scratch,

78
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,384
you won't be walking out of here alive,
do you understand that?

79
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,226
Are you all right?

80
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,934
If you laid one finger
on the Crown Prince,

81
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,062
I promise…

82
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,107
I will…

83
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,486
kill you.

84
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,530
Tutor Jung.

85
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,751
Are you all right, Your Highness?

86
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,421
Your Highness!

87
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,132
Your Royal Highness, thank goodness!

88
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,969
-Oh, no.
-What is going on here?

89
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,722
-Bring a physician. Now!
-Yes, my lord!

90
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,641
Oh, no. Are you all right?

91
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,441
This is no fun.

92
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,412
What are you doing bearing a sword
near His Royal Highness?

93
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,378
How dare you injure my guard?

94
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,965
I apologize. I didn't expect things
to get so heated.

95
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,261
If you are disgruntled,
take it up with me, understood?

96
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,304
That also means you will leave
the innocent alone!

97
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,224
How exactly am I supposed to do that?

98
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,102
After all, isn't that
why you keep them around?

99
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,145
To take all the punishment for you,

100
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,648
as well as handle any dirty work
you need done?

101
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,985
Why are you doing this to me, huh?

102
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,530
-What is it that you even want from me?
-What do I want?

103
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,034
Huh. Well, there is one thing
I want from Joseon.

104
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,754
You see, people like you

105
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,799
are privileged hypocrites
who pretend to care for the people.

106
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,802
And all I want
is to destroy people like you.

107
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,437
So, I guess the drink
will have to wait, Your Highness.

108
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,169
This… This way, please. Here.

109
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,338
Put him down here.

110
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,220
Oh, no. What should we do?

111
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,306
Do you think he'll wake up?

112
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,808
Fortunately, he stopped bleeding.

113
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,437
But it's a deep wound.
We'll have to observe him for a while.

114
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,856
What… How did this…

115
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,859
What on earth happened here?

116
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,615
My lord. There's an urgent message
from the guesthouse.

117
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,826
The Crown Prince's bodyguard
was badly hurt

118
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,244
by the Chief Eunuch's guard.

119
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,163
Is the Prince okay? Where is he now?

120
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,250
He's fine. He just returned
to his quarters.

121
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,339
The Chief Eunuch,
is he still at the guesthouse?

122
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,341
What did you say to me?

123
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,055
Who do you think you are?
How dare you talk about her here?

124
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,265
Please hear me out.

125
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,810
I just wanted to say there'd be no point
in spilling any more blood.

126
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,812
For the sake of that poor girl.

127
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,815
You cannot do this to me!

128
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,316
Wanna bet?

129
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,458
I'll be back. I'll return tomorrow night.

130
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,877
So you should wait here quietly.

131
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,297
Yes, my lord.

132
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,299
Goodness. Oh, my…

133
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:48,233
So, what brings you here
at this time of night?

134
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,821
I heard that your bodyguard badly injured
the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

135
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,284
Not only did you cut off the hair
of one of his court ladies,

136
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,203
but you also hurt his guard.

137
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,371
I would like for you to tell me why.

138
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,584
Why on earth do you care?

139
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,711
Well, they are your subordinates.

140
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,546
True.

141
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,674
But I heard a very interesting story.

142
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,054
Someone the Emperor
puts his trust in dearly

143
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,807
has been stealing offerings
meant for the Emperor.

144
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:25,896
I heard this person's also been stealing
the Emperor's private assets.

145
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,026
Don't you want to know
who that person might be?

146
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:37,533
Are you really trying to threaten me
with a petty rumor like that one?

147
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,911
Everyone says the Emperor thinks
rather highly of you.

148
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,747
The higher they are, the harder they fall.

149
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,042
Unless you want a huge scandal
to break out,

150
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,713
it's my advice that you behave yourself
for the remainder of your time here.

151
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,804
This is absurd.

152
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:05,102
I don't understand why you would want
to do this to me.

153
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,149
I'm afraid you're mistaken about that.

154
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,736
You see, I have plenty of reasons
why I want to.

155
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,181
Traitor Kang Hwa-gil
now must have his head cut off.

156
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,195
That wound is pretty deep.
Try not to move.

157
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,908
Sorry, Your Highness.

158
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,787
I failed my duty to keep you from danger.

159
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,999
Don't say that.

160
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,294
I also have failed to protect you.

161
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,094
What is it that upset you
this deeply, huh?

162
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,682
That even in your dreams,
you still are suffering.

163
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,529
You still need to recover.

164
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,367
Don't move too much. Just rest.

165
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,273
Hyun.

166
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,359
Is your bodyguard going to be okay?

167
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,239
Yes. He made it through the toughest part.

168
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,784
The people in the palace
all keep getting hurt,

169
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,244
and I'm the reason for it all.

170
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,663
Quite the burden to carry, too.

171
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,667
You're not the one to blame here.
The Chief Eunuch is.

172
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,546
He's a dangerous man.

173
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:42,759
So, if there is a problem with him,
you should tell me about it right away.

174
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,637
Mm.

175
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,350
If you get hurt by someone,
they hurt me, too.

176
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,229
So don't feel burdened.

177
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,648
You have me, Your Highness.

178
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,445
I know I do, Hyun. Thank you.

179
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,369
You saw someone suspicious
in the Chief's chambers?

180
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,123
That's exactly why I need to ask
for your assistance.

181
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,090
So we are to double our tribute?

182
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,176
Did the Chief Eunuch also demand this?

183
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,558
-Then just let me talk with him, please.
-There is no need.

184
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,978
I will take care of this.

185
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,733
You are not to get involved any further.
You can leave now.

186
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,276
I can't do that, Father.

187
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,655
I will resolve this problem
between the Chief and myself.

188
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,285
Please put your faith in me one more time.

189
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,538
Just give…

190
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:58,210
give me just one more chance,
please, Father.

191
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,430
Why does the Chief Eunuch
keep causing trouble?

192
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,891
He ought to help us
since he's from Joseon.

193
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,520
I guess, sometimes,
your own people can be even worse.

194
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,606
What do I want?

195
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,947
You see, people like you

196
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,866
are privileged hypocrites
who pretend to care for the people.

197
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,619
And all I want
is to destroy people like you.

198
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,582
Tutor Jung is close
to the Vice Minister of Rites, isn't he?

199
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,709
Yes. That's how I describe him, yeah.

200
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,046
I must look into the Chief Eunuch.

201
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,425
Oh…

202
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,517
Tail the Chief Eunuch tonight,

203
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,686
and you will find out who that man is.

204
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,702
Tutor Jung wasn't at the royal institute.

205
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,455
What business does he have
at the guesthouse?

206
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,833
Oh, goodness. Your Royal Highness, look.

207
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,846
-Stay here and out of sight.
-Huh?

208
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,389
Wait. Wait. Your Highness.

209
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,767
What's going to happen this time?

210
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,130
I'll go alone from this point.
You can wait here.

211
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,256
My lord.

212
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,211
Kill him!

213
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,015
How did you…

214
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,308
Just be careful.

215
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,911
Oh, my goodness.

216
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,544
If you ever use her to blackmail me again,

217
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,505
I swear, I will cut your head clean off.

218
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:18,595
Yes, of course. Don't worry, my lord.
You will never see me again, huh?

219
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,578
We have been followed, my lord.
We have to get out of here now.

220
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,663
Followed?

221
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,480
Are you all right?

222
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,239
Stop!

223
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,577
This way!

224
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,292
I want everyone involved in this attack
to be filed and put under arrest.

225
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,377
Yes, my lord!

226
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,633
Catch them!
Stop them! Get them!

227
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,027
-Where are you going?
-I'll be okay. Let me go.

228
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,281
-But they already got away.
-I have to find out something.

229
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,116
Why do you have to be so reckless?

230
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,788
Oh.

231
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,584
They cut you deep out there.

232
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,336
We have to get it treated first.

233
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,676
I'll be fine. How are you, Your Highness?

234
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,639
You have another cut here?

235
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,517
And one here, too?

236
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,687
Where else?

237
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,607
Are there any more cuts anywhere?

238
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,694
Your Highness.

239
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,114
Why on earth did you help me, huh?

240
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,701
Lean on me.

241
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,663
-What?
-How can you walk on those injured legs?

242
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,666
Here, lean on me, to help you walk.

243
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,756
Careful.

244
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,395
Well, hello. And what brings you out here
right in the middle of the night?

245
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,609
I wanted to visit a few places

246
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,694
since I haven't been back
in my hometown for a while.

247
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,239
-Is there anything wrong?
-Ah…

248
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,369
You see, we received a report
about suspicious movement

249
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,787
somewhere in the area.

250
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,832
I was concerned you might be
the target of an assassin.

251
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:38,044
As I'm in charge of the reception,
I couldn't stop worrying about you.

252
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,298
I appreciate your concern,
but you can call off your men.

253
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,133
I'm afraid I can't do that.

254
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,720
I have to make sure
that there won't be any more incidents.

255
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,015
So until the day you finally leave Joseon,

256
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,061
security at this guesthouse
will be substantially increased.

257
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,343
His secret ledger is close by,
most likely around his quarters.

258
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,221
Whatever you do,
don't let him out of your sight.

259
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,598
Yes, my lord.

260
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,270
I heard that the Chief Eunuch met
with a suspicious man.

261
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,897
So I was tailing him.

262
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,399
The Chief Eunuch?

263
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,611
Still, it was reckless of you to do that.

264
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,280
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

265
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,074
I just wanted to help.

266
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,037
Are the cuts still bothering you?

267
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,416
Not that much.

268
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,670
By the way…

269
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,466
were you really that worried about me?

270
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,097
I get it.

271
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,892
If something happens to me,

272
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,520
you're going to have a very tough time
finding a good replacement.

273
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,148
I would've been concerned, too.

274
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,486
How can you joke right now?

275
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,322
Your Highness, that really hurt.

276
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,160
Oh, Tutor Jung. Are you okay?

277
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,037
Um, I'm so sorry.

278
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,961
Uh, let's go.

279
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,605
Your Highness.

280
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,486
Are you all right? Why are you out here?

281
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,196
I can't believe you, Hyun.

282
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,740
No one told me or anything.

283
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,659
Well, I…

284
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,206
I, uh…

285
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,251
All right, so, I want to know
what your plan is.

286
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,009
Let me join you.
I need to be part of this.

287
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,351
What are you seeking this man out for?

288
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,355
Well, uh, I like to collect rare
and valuable objects.

289
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,359
There are rumors that this man
has a very extensive collection.

290
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,820
And I'd pay well for an introduction.

291
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,158
I assure you,
it's a handsome sum of money.

292
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,662
Well, he's left some
of his items here already.

293
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,166
Then we'd like to buy those as well.

294
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,625
Double the price.

295
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,380
Well, that'll be quite a lot of money.

296
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,715
How exactly…

297
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,592
Ah.

298
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,512
As you can see,
we're nothing without our good looks…

299
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,806
…and our wealth.

300
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,193
Here you go.

301
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,280
He became quite a gambling addict.

302
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,617
He was cocky, because his daughter
became an imperial concubine in Ming.

303
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,037
So I definitely remember his face.

304
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,961
Oh, my goodness. Huh.
This is quite rare.

305
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,881
I've heard that the Emperor's infatuated
with your daughter.

306
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,593
-I guess it must be true.
-Enough. Do you believe me or not?

307
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,679
Just get me a good price for that. Hm?

308
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,394
He got a large sum for the items
the Chief Eunuch gave him.

309
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,898
So the first thing he'll do
is check out this place.

310
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,699
If we catch
the imperial concubine's father,

311
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,286
we'll be able to find out
why he threatened the Chief Eunuch.

312
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,832
And that will be
the Chief Eunuch's weakness.

313
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,417
NINE, NINE

314
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,503
Hey!

315
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,881
Yes! Yes!

316
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,885
Sorry. I really feel awful
taking all this money.

317
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,893
I'm sorry, too,
since I won this round, brother.

318
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,106
Come on! Really? You're ruining my day.

319
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,567
Oh, hold on. Are you leaving?

320
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,278
Can't you see that I'm now
out of money, huh?

321
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,656
Come on. Seriously, I thought
you would've known better.

322
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,076
If you leave now, we won't be able
to play anymore. Isn't that right?

323
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,122
Exactly. Come on. Sit down.
I'll lend you some money.

324
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,499
After all, I'm not a heartless man.

325
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,919
Whoa! Where in the world did you get that?

326
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,884
What the…

327
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,387
What? Do you recognize it?

328
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,181
It's from Ming, you know?

329
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,975
It's incredibly rare.

330
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,894
I know it's rare.

331
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,062
'Cause it was me who sold it.

332
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,109
Oh, really?

333
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,362
Goodness. Well, I guess
we were meant to cross paths.

334
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,616
I've been looking everywhere for you,
and now, here you are!

335
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,953
Ah! Soldiers, run!

336
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,832
-The soldiers are here!
-This way.

337
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,960
Let's go. Over here. Go, go, go!

338
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,759
I'm so sorry, my lord! Please forgive me.

339
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,553
I was only trying to make money
to buy medicine for my sister.

340
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,520
Who are you? What do you want from me?

341
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,356
Hmm, can't tell you that.

342
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,777
But I do need you to come with me.

343
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,823
Stay back. Hey, stay back.

344
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:28,329
Just drop it, huh? You're only
going to end up hurting yourself.

345
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,254
Ah! My arm. My arm.
You're going to break my arm.

346
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,382
Wow. I'm not even holding you
that tightly. Relax.

347
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,384
How about now? Better?

348
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,557
-Don't follow me.
-Come on. We can talk it out.

349
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,269
-Seriously. We can talk about it.
-Leave me alone.

350
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,319
Move! Come on, hurry. Go get him! Go!

351
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,532
Take him with you.
I'll deal with these guys.

352
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,616
Wait, are you sure?

353
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,244
Of course.

354
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,788
Now, go. Don't lose him, okay?

355
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,003
Wait. Wait. No. Wait, please. No.

356
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,967
Hold on.

357
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,934
Your Highness.

358
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,996
Can you handle them alone?

359
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,498
Of course, Your Highness.

360
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,500
Sorry, we're late.

361
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,085
No, you are right on time.

362
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,047
Had you been a moment late,
I would've been in trouble.

363
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,302
-Get on the horse.
-Yes.

364
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,849
We're in your debt.

365
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,322
You just never listen to me.

366
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,243
I thought I told you not to get hurt.

367
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,038
I'm sorry.

368
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:08,466
You sure make a lot of noise
for such a small wound.

369
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,804
What? Wait, that's not true.

370
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,932
You saw how bad that cut was.

371
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,642
It hurt a lot.

372
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,979
Others would have complained, too.

373
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,028
Thank you for everything,

374
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,946
for enduring the pain.

375
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,699
And for…

376
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,579
for helping me with this.

377
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,340
If I could, I'd like to keep helping you.

378
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,808
But only if you want me to, Your Highness.

379
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,465
Oh, no.

380
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,015
Your Highness, please,
let me live. Spare me.

381
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,768
All right. On one condition.

382
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:46,021
You tell me exactly what
the Chief Eunuch has been keeping secret.

383
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,965
What's this for?

384
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,720
Why the long face this evening?

385
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,722
Please sit.

386
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,730
We could have easily resolved
the matter over drinks.

387
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,399
I think I might've been a bit too rigid
with things earlier.

388
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,702
As a peace offering,

389
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,413
I want to show you

390
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,875
something that I think
you'll find quite interesting.

391
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,630
I'll admit you are indeed audacious

392
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,799
to have coveted the Emperor's wealth.

393
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,436
All your management record
of the Emperor's private assets

394
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,604
are inside this ledger.

395
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,732
How did you get that?

396
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,489
We will not be able to comply
with your tribute request.

397
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,115
And if the Emperor were to find out,

398
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,869
you'd be stuck
in a rather difficult situation.

399
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,579
You agree with me, right?

400
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,504
Is this the reason that you wanted…

401
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,422
to see me right now?

402
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,674
What?

403
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:43,305
Now I just wonder
what other secrets you could be hiding.

404
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,148
Don't worry.
I'll be sure to keep this safe.

405
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,027
You worked hard to build your reputation.

406
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:01,657
It would be a shame to destroy it
over something like this.

407
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,926
So then you talked, huh?
You told the Prince everything.

408
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,095
He was going to kill me otherwise.

409
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,847
What should we do now?

410
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,391
If your affair with her is revealed,

411
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,435
it will be the end of us all.

412
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,568
Please save my daughter's life.
Take pity on her and protect her. Please?

413
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,864
You threatened me with her life before.

414
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,532
Now, you're worried about her?

415
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,642
I told him to just leave
and go home quietly.

416
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,313
But instead, he must have gone to see you.

417
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,190
What's your plan for all this?

418
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,403
You found something bigger than the book.
Why did you pretend you didn't?

419
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,905
You're wrong. I didn't pretend.

420
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,534
I didn't need to use
your heartbreaking love story.

421
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,537
I already had the ledger that proved
you stole from the Emperor.

422
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,541
And to be honest,
I didn't care about your story, anyway.

423
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,752
Still…

424
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,799
I must say, I was a bit surprised.

425
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,968
Not only did the father
of an imperial concubine

426
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,804
sell off his own daughter,

427
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,015
but he also bargained over her life
while threatening to expose you for money.

428
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,976
Despite that, you still managed
to put up with him.

429
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:57,731
So please tell me the truth.
Do you love her that much?

430
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,234
An Emperor's concubine?

431
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,821
Don't you dare talk about her,
you hear me?

432
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,490
If you ever go anywhere remotely near her,

433
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,742
then you're going to pay for it,
understand?

434
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,619
I will use everything I have

435
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,455
to take revenge on both you and Joseon!

436
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,419
Revenge?

437
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,803
I heard that your parents only received
a mere bag of rice

438
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,847
when they sold you off as a child.

439
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,933
By the time you crossed the border,

440
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,018
your feet were covered
in scabs and blisters.

441
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:40,274
Because you were a foreigner,
you were probably beaten up a lot.

442
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:44,820
And you probably spent
every single night of your life,

443
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,073
resenting your parents for selling you off

444
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,118
and Joseon for allowing it to happen.

445
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,662
I see why you wanted revenge.

446
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,917
And you must have been disgusted
to see people trying to flatter you

447
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,919
after everything
you achieved for yourself.

448
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,714
However,

449
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,300
you shouldn't have behaved that way.

450
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,678
I doubt you went through all that trouble,

451
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,763
just so you can end up
like one of those people.

452
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,390
Get off your high horse.

453
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,808
Understand this,

454
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,728
you're no different from them
and you never will be.

455
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,774
You're right about that.

456
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,862
I'm not any different from them.

457
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,572
I'm not.

458
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,493
But you must resent me even more,
seeing as I'm the Prince

459
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,496
of the country that gave you away.

460
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,917
Shut your mouth.

461
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,879
I don't need your pity,
so save it for someone else.

462
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,589
This isn't pity.

463
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,216
I just…

464
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,678
wanted to apologize to you

465
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,640
as the Crown Prince of your home country.

466
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,481
A long time ago,

467
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,653
you were forced to leave
without proper clothes or food.

468
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,739
And for that, I am sorry.

469
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:17,162
And as for your secret affair,
I will take that to the grave as well.

470
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:24,670
You two must have gone through
a lot of pain keeping your love safe.

471
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,091
And I think…

472
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,637
that I might relate to that somewhat.

473
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,862
Feeling wronged?

474
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,491
-Don't look at me like that.
-You stole it, didn't you?

475
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,411
Answer me.
If you don't, I'll have you killed.

476
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,038
Get lost. Just go back to your homeland.

477
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,875
Bastard.

478
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,848
Are you all right?

479
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,184
Oh, that must hurt.

480
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,231
That's a lot of blood.

481
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,152
You don't know…

482
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,405
when you'll be back here.

483
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,866
You should look around
a bit more before going back.

484
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,660
After all, this is your homeland.

485
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,580
Homeland, my foot.

486
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,616
I am indebted to both of you.

487
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,207
You, too. You were very helpful.

488
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,751
Here, take it.
Have a drink with us tonight.

489
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,631
Get comfortable.

490
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,970
All right. Everyone.
If you have a drink, let's cheers.

491
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,389
What do you say, Your Highness? Ready?

492
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,477
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

493
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,395
Cheers.

494
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,870
Since when did you become
so loyal to His Royal Highness?

495
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,705
I mean, you of all people.

496
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,456
Well…

497
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,420
if you know me, then you know
I'm nothing without my loyalty.

498
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,755
Right, Your Highness?

499
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,632
Uh…

500
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,260
yes, I mean…

501
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,928
I guess so.

502
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,185
Your Highness, are you… are you serious?

503
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,604
That really hurts my feeling, you know--

504
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:16,234
I get it. Calm down.
I just wanna tell him something real--

505
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,904
Come on.

506
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,947
I really need to talk to His Highness.

507
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,078
Your Highness. Why are you laughing?

508
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,249
Your Highness,
I cannot let this slide.

509
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,169
You are hurting my feelings right now.

510
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,256
Why don't you just sit down?

511
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,177
Come on, Lord Jaeun. Help me out.
Did you mean that, Your Highness, or…

512
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,805
All right.

513
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,686
Why…

514
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,191
Your Highness, why don't we…

515
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,318
have just one more…

516
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,821
Just one more. Come on!

517
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,699
I'm asking if he wants to have
one more drink.

518
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,493
Let's just have one--

519
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,788
Oh, come on.

520
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,874
Can you escort Tutor Jung home, please?

521
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,459
I'll escort the Prince tonight.

522
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,504
Lord Jaeun. I'm not drunk.

523
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,465
Lord Jaeun. Your Royal Highness. Wait.

524
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:24,469
Can't we please just have one more drink?
Just one, please?

525
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,472
My arm. Can you just wait a second?

526
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,016
Wait. Please wait.

527
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,644
Just one more drink.

528
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,647
Listen. Hey. Hey.

529
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,148
I'm not drunk.

530
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,402
I told you I'm not drunk. Why are you so…

531
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:44,114
Come on. Talk to me. Please. Talk to me.

532
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,581
Just one more. Hmm?

533
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,711
Then why don't we have one more drink?

534
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:03,091
I always felt that there was
a brotherly bond between us two.

535
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,095
You felt it too. Hmm?

536
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,431
Not really.

537
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,816
Hmm, what a heartless person you are.

538
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,910
I really need to talk to His Highness.

539
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,061
Why can't I stop smiling?

540
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,108
I can't stop smiling!

541
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,487
Why? Why? What's going on?

542
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,585
Your Highness.

543
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,221
Tutor Jung.

544
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,686
What are you doing out here
all by yourself?

545
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,731
Uh, well…

546
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,828
I was surprised.

547
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:07,252
That girl and I are the only ones
who know about this place.

548
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:13,550
Uh… do you mean
the court maid from before?

549
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,516
I saw some fireflies and followed them.

550
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,810
That's how I stumbled across this place.

551
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,688
The door… I found the hidden door.

552
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,745
Did you set this place up all by yourself?

553
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,957
Ah… yeah.

554
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,965
So then that's why you had
those flowers at the tavern.

555
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:58,595
But…

556
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,849
why do you have so much liquor here?

557
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,142
I just, uh…

558
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,396
I was still up, though.

559
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,944
And everyone said no to more drinks.

560
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,823
I was just getting started, you know.

561
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,116
And so…

562
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,537
that's why you've been using the palace
as your own private tavern?

563
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,706
Only sometimes.

564
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:37,133
Yeah. I definitely have been.

565
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,639
Ji-un, how very typical of you.

566
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,441
Please don't smile like that.

567
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,195
-What?
-What?

568
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:06,037
I just… Uh, I just… I thought, like…

569
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:10,541
Oh, that's right.
I wanted to ask you a question.

570
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,169
Did you let the Chief Eunuch go,

571
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:17,882
because you believe he's really in love
with the imperial concubine?

572
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,641
Their lives were determined
by other people's decisions.

573
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,269
So they were both forced
to hide their love away.

574
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,731
And that broke my heart.

575
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,743
You intrigue me sometimes.

576
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,164
When I first met you,

577
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,042
you were as cold as ice.

578
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,713
But you're warmhearted deep down.

579
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,697
You should really slow down.

580
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,491
You already drank quite a bit
with dinner earlier.

581
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,454
I… I was so thirsty, so…

582
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,679
Someone I know drank too much
and kissed the person

583
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:13,015
-sitting next to him on the cheek.
-Does he like that person?

584
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,810
You've been seeing
and hearing strange things as well.

585
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,062
-You're lovesick!
-No, it can't be.

586
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,022
I deserve to die, Your Highness.

587
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,025
You seem to be from a noble family.
Why are you here in the palace alone?

588
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,277
Selecting princess?

589
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,238
We must hold a royal
marriage so he can produce an heir.

590
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,865
The Crown Prince is getting married?

591
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,993
Have you ever loved someone,
Your Royal Highness?

592
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,078
I have a favor to ask,
Your Highness.

593
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:35,746
Would you give me a hug?
