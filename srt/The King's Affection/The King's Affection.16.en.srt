1
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,775
Why does His Majesty want to see me here?

2
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,661
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,297
What…

4
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,841
What are you…

5
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,731
I'd rather not be teased by you,
Your Highness.

6
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,775
Tease you?

7
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,362
I'm serious.

8
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,279
Huh?

9
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,573
I remember you told me once…

10
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,243
that you would endure everything.

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,581
I will now do the same for you.

12
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,587
I'll bear the consequences of my feelings.

13
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,658
EPISODE 16

14
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,190
DIARIES OF THE ROYAL SECRETARIAT
MONTHS 7 AND 8

15
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,420
"A day and a half after being found dead,

16
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,423
the late King's body became swollen

17
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,467
and his gums blackened."

18
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,596
After a day and a half?

19
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,232
Great Lord Changcheon
used busohwa poison to try to kill…"

20
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,402
Busohwa?

21
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,697
It causes immediate reactions, though.

22
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,877
Oh, Scribe Jung, we have
to finish writing the diaries.

23
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,338
Where are you going?

24
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,842
Uh, I was just going
to the royal infirmary's library.

25
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,636
Why do you need to go there?

26
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,013
Wait!

27
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,890
I guess I'll do it, huh.

28
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,934
This will be a while.

29
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,170
Who's there?

30
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,345
Check the back door.

31
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,387
Yes!

32
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,184
Check if anything is missing.

33
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,310
Yes, my lord.

34
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,481
I found nothing
about weapon transactions there.

35
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,778
It seems like… he didn't leave
any evidence at the office of the guild.

36
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:07,075
I should make my way to Yeoyeon
and also search their base.

37
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,371
It has to be there,
since it wasn't at the office.

38
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,375
It would be too dangerous, Commander.

39
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,128
The army base
must be difficult to infiltrate.

40
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,423
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
I'll report once I'm back.

41
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,260
Oh, if you have any news,

42
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,764
Kang Eun-seo can act as your messenger.

43
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,977
I'll keep that in mind.

44
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,313
Please be careful.

45
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,736
Busohwa…

46
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,283
Busohwa…

47
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
BUSOHWA

48
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,918
"Consumption of busohwa
causes stomach swelling

49
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,297
as well as blackening of the gums."

50
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,593
"These symptoms are immediate."

51
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,140
Eunuch Hong,
what brings you here at this hour?

52
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,059
Well, it's a lovely night,
so I was taking a stroll again.

53
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,728
-Come with me.
-We can't go with you.

54
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,022
Why not? Let me show you a better spot.

55
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,023
Come with me.

56
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,025
-We're busy.
-Let's go. Don't be so stubborn.

57
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,277
I know a better spot.

58
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,172
It's true he's made
only one simple mistake,

59
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,717
but now it will continue
to be much easier.

60
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,513
That's why I can never forgive…

61
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,224
even a single mistake.

62
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,857
Father.

63
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,373
What are you doing here?

64
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,127
I'd like to ask you… the same question.

65
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,597
Your Majesty,
did the conversation go well?

66
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,974
-Let's head back.
-Sure.

67
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,520
Your mother must be waiting.
You should go home.

68
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,663
Did you handle the Minister of Taxation?

69
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,458
-Yes.
-Mm.

70
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,213
The Inspector General's daughter…

71
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,218
and your son are acquainted
with one another.

72
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,680
What do you think
about advocating their union?

73
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,975
After all, their marriage
could help with politics.

74
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,732
If the Inspector General approves of it,
then it should be fine.

75
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,650
Mm.

76
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,696
Right. I've been told an intruder…

77
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,783
broke into the office of the guild.

78
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,578
They were checking for weapon transactions

79
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,082
right after the Minister of Taxation
was fired.

80
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,961
I need you to go to Yeoyeon.
Take the trip right away.

81
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,882
You are to bring back
anything that could prove

82
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,093
the existence of the private army.

83
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,679
Yes, my lord.

84
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,021
It seems that more people were involved
with the office of the guild incident,

85
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,898
so the Inspector General is investigating.

86
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,276
I believe you will soon have
to train and hire

87
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,570
a good number of new people
because of that.

88
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,281
I understand.

89
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,122
Your Majesty,
Pyongan Province, Hamgil Province,

90
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,292
and Yeonbyeon won't have enough food
due to the Minister of Taxation's actions.

91
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,355
Scribe Jung.

92
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,610
Scribe Jung. Please stay focused.

93
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,488
Ah, forgive me.

94
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,259
What is it that has been
on your mind all day?

95
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,346
Forgive me.

96
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,974
I didn't get enough sleep, so…

97
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,271
The Queen is approaching.

98
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,963
I heard that you had returned
along with the new Inspector General.

99
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,924
Yes, Your Majesty.

100
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,135
But what brings you here today?

101
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,180
I've been invited
by Her Highness, Your Majesty.

102
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,100
Her and I have been friends for a while.

103
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,938
The Grand Queen Dowager
allowed me to invite her to the palace.

104
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,981
I see.

105
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,362
You've done a lot, and I'm indebted to you
for your benevolence.

106
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,739
Not at all.

107
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,495
You must have a lot
to talk about after so long.

108
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,081
I should let you go to your quarters.

109
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,460
I will send some Court Maids
to serve you refreshments and good tea.

110
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,630
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

111
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,633
Let's go.

112
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,069
Then I will be heading
over to Seungjeongwon, Your Majesty.

113
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,322
I hear you are in charge
of all the Royal Diaries.

114
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,283
You must be tired, so get some sleep.

115
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,411
I'm all right.

116
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,093
Scribe Jung. Just a moment.

117
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,849
Yes, Your Highness?

118
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:56,020
If you have some time to spare,
could you join us at my quarters today?

119
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,065
What?

120
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,737
Your Highness.

121
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,075
There are few things I wanted to ask you
about life at the palace.

122
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,828
And I happen to run
into you here by chance.

123
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,331
I promise I'll be quick. I promise.

124
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm not sure
if I'll be able to meet the expectations.

125
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:11,387
You… You already have feelings
for another person, don't you?

126
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,264
Please forgive me.

127
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,939
Should I make a trip
to the Queen's quarters?

128
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,315
I can go and observe.

129
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,735
Why would you want to do that?

130
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,113
The night with the lanterns,

131
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,658
I saw you and Scribe Jung share a kiss.

132
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,368
I saw everything, Your Majesty.

133
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,411
Oh…

134
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,622
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

135
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,748
Seriously?

136
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,376
You don't have to worry, though.

137
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,463
Court Lady Kim will never know.
You can put your mind at ease.

138
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,091
I will head over now, Your Majesty.

139
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,972
Uh, that is not…

140
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,480
I heard that you have
crossed paths before.

141
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:08,402
And now, here you are, the two of you
running into each other again.

142
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,739
Isn't it magical
when these encounters happen?

143
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,325
Just like how it was
with His Majesty and me.

144
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,830
Yes, indeed.

145
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
It can be strange. I mean, uh…

146
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,502
extraordinary.

147
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,096
His Majesty has sent
some refreshments to enjoy.

148
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,558
Lend me a hand.

149
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,446
His Majesty was so very kind
to send us this food.

150
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,198
Please tell him how very grateful I am.

151
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,949
Yes, Your Highness.

152
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:05,042
By the way, Scribe Jung,
you are very full of soul and maturity.

153
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,128
How come you're not married yet?

154
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,046
Huh?

155
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,676
Uh, well, I--

156
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,107
Are you all right?

157
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,535
Uh, thank you so much.

158
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,128
Your Highness, that question
may have been too personal.

159
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,256
Where are my manners?

160
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,216
I am so sorry.

161
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,261
Was I… Was I too meddling just now?

162
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,889
Not at all, Your Highness.

163
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,528
Eunuch Hong, will that be all?

164
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,446
Yes, Your Highness.

165
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,492
Oh, I'm going to take my leave now.

166
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,620
Please tell His Majesty how grateful I am.

167
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,122
Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,143
Your Majesty…

169
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,815
So, are they enjoying
each other's company?

170
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,235
Yes. But you have nothing
to worry about, Your Majesty.

171
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,447
I was not worried.

172
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,583
You can leave now.

173
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,293
Yes.

174
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:25,515
It seems that His Majesty is very kind
and compassionate towards you.

175
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,143
Just look at everything
he's arranged here.

176
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
I suppose.

177
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,566
I hope that you also find someone
who is like that.

178
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,194
And you, too, Scribe Jung.

179
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,031
Yes, well…

180
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,282
Your Highness.

181
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,285
Ah!

182
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,705
So-eun, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

183
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,625
Can you please wait here for a moment?

184
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,437
I didn't know you would be here.

185
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,941
When did you return from Onyang?

186
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,192
Oh, well…

187
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,488
sometime ago, so…

188
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:26,702
Actually, quite a few things happened
since I, uh, got back.

189
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,167
There's been a misunderstanding
in regards to our history.

190
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,795
That's why Her Highness
left us in private.

191
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,755
But you seemed busy earlier.

192
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,301
I will talk to Her Highness for you,
so you can feel free to go.

193
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,475
Will you… Will you really speak to her
on my behalf?

194
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,062
I'm leaving the palace now
to meet some friends, so…

195
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,939
All right. You know them, too.

196
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,567
Jil-geum and Yeong-ji,
my Samgaebang friends.

197
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,320
I hope they are well.

198
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,654
Of course.

199
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,199
They would still be standing way
after catastrophe happened to all of us.

200
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,706
It was a pleasure to see you again.

201
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,503
Wait.

202
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,675
The last time I saw you, Scribe Jung, I…

203
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,471
I felt like I might have made
you uncomfortable

204
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,222
when I expressed my feelings.

205
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,975
And now I'm worried about that.

206
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,897
Don't be. No need to be worried.

207
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,362
You seem drawn compared
to the last time I saw you.

208
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,198
I heard your family had a tough time.

209
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,076
I'm glad you're back.

210
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,621
Returning here,
to where you had been hurt…

211
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,707
must have been a difficult decision.

212
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,671
Leave your past behind you now,
and please look after yourself.

213
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,050
And don't blame yourself.

214
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,850
Farewell.

215
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,722
Where is Scribe Jung?

216
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,476
Please forgive me.
I told him it was okay to take his leave.

217
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,186
But why?

218
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,442
Did I make you two
feel uncomfortable at all?

219
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,613
Of course not, Your Highness.

220
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,392
What are you doing here, Scribe Jung?

221
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,895
I'm sure the reception
at the Queen's quarters

222
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
is still ongoing, is it not?

223
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,485
I just have something to do on outside.

224
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,279
Oh.

225
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:55,327
So, tell me. Did you enjoy the reception?

226
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,415
Uh, yes. I wanted to thank you
for the refreshments, Your Majesty.

227
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,417
The refreshments weren't for you.

228
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,586
They were meant for the Queen.

229
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,923
Oh, they were?

230
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,136
Is anything that matter?

231
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,763
What do you mean?

232
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,433
Uh, did I do something wrong, or…

233
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,737
What is that look on your face?

234
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,281
Uh, well…

235
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,951
it's… it's nothing, um…

236
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,869
it's nothing.

237
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,373
You…

238
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,709
Why are you smiling at me like that?

239
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,546
Well, it's just that…

240
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,299
I get the feeling
you're jealous right now.

241
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,842
It makes me happy.

242
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,678
Oh. What?

243
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,764
Come on! Why would I be jealous?

244
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,435
Don't be fooled by yourself.

245
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,615
Do not worry about it.
I'll be back soon, Your Majesty.

246
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,796
Commander Jung wishes to enter.

247
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,051
Enter.

248
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,315
Allow me to take a leave for a few days
to inspect security at Ganghwa,

249
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,858
where Prince Jehyeon resides.

250
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,735
All of a sudden?

251
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,071
Why, did something happen
to Gyeom recently?

252
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,616
It's just a periodic inspection.

253
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,995
If that is so, then you may go.

254
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,971
-Jil-geum.
-Oh!

255
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,974
Oh! Hey, what took you so long?

256
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,978
I have a lot of clients at the clinic,
so I really can't be gone for too long.

257
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,271
I'm sorry.

258
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,315
Fine. So, what is it?

259
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,527
I need to ask you for a favor,
if it's all right.

260
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:35,945
A favor?

261
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,198
I need you to find out
all there is to know…

262
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,826
about this plant at the herb markets.

263
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,206
I don't think this herb
is commonly found in the Joseon region.

264
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,085
See if you can find any vendors
who are knowledgeable about herbs

265
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,754
-from Ming and the West.
-What is this?

266
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,590
Is this plant… poisonous?

267
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,304
I'm counting on you. See you soon.

268
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,568
-Be careful.
-Mm.

269
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,248
Please forgive me!

270
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,835
It slipped when I was putting it
in the box.

271
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,630
So it is broken now.

272
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,716
To whom does it belong?

273
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,637
Well, this chest…

274
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,641
this chest belongs to His… to His Majesty.

275
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,917
Twins?

276
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,962
It is in my understanding
that umbilical cords

277
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,338
can take on this shape

278
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,259
when the umbilical cords of twins
get tangled inside the womb.

279
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,109
Do not speak
about what you saw here today.

280
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,360
Yes, my lord!

281
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,786
They are the ones
who banished Prince Jehyeon

282
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,496
all the way to Ganghwa Island.

283
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,748
And now, they're checking in
on him periodically?

284
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,999
How ridiculous is that.

285
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,756
We must hold off on our plan in Yeoyeon.

286
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,675
You should send a letter
to Eun-seo right away.

287
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,093
Eun-seo?

288
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,221
Kim Ga-on, that's his real name.

289
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,517
I'm not used to that name yet.
I will do so, Your Majesty.

290
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,994
After all, Prince Jaeun
is a member of the royal family.

291
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,705
It seems he has stopped coming
to your quarters

292
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,875
after finding out the truth
about who you really are.

293
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,212
I believe he's doing so
out of consideration for you,

294
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,589
Your Majesty,
in case you feel uncomfortable.

295
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,264
Hyun, wait.

296
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,605
Your Majesty.

297
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,581
Have you been very busy these days?

298
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,208
You haven't shown
your face here for a while.

299
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,627
What is it?

300
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,713
Is there something wrong, Your Highness?

301
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,093
Whenever I ask you something like that,

302
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,262
the first thing you do is always worry…

303
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,472
and ask me if something's wrong.

304
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,026
You know, Hyun, sitting here with you…

305
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,571
reminds me of a day from a long time ago.

306
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,533
You were worried that I would be scared,

307
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,829
so you read books, you read for me
until deep into the night.

308
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,249
Your Majesty, you have
always enjoyed books.

309
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,168
And you still do.

310
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,212
You also gave me candy.

311
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,840
And I had never had candy before that.

312
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,012
It was the sweetest taste
that my tongue had ever felt.

313
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,892
All the fear went away at that moment.

314
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,938
I even forgot about the challenges
of being in the palace.

315
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,565
I was happy.

316
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,526
Then I will gladly bring you some.

317
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,281
As much as you need. I will do it.

318
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,788
I've always felt
the most comfortable around you.

319
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,249
Even when we were children.

320
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,879
And you were the person
I relied on the most.

321
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,258
-Your Majesty.
-So, Hyun, can we go back…

322
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,638
to being comfortable
around each other like we used to?

323
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,393
When I see you distancing yourself,

324
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,103
I also…

325
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,525
feel unsure about
how I should behave around you.

326
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,571
If I asked you…

327
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:17,078
to keep being my good cousin
and closest friend…

328
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,498
and to stay by my side, would I be…

329
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,377
asking too much of you?

330
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,390
Of course, you wouldn't.
I will gladly do so, Your Majesty.

331
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,687
In fact, you will forever be my king.

332
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,861
What… What is this?

333
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,363
That is a present for you.

334
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,742
But why are you giving this to me?

335
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,336
When you find a lady you love
and get engaged,

336
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,338
give that to your betrothed, all right?

337
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,124
There you are, Uncle.

338
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,101
His Majesty
will remove you from your position

339
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,604
and banish you
to Gyeongsang Province as punishment.

340
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,398
Are you serious?

341
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,235
What… What?

342
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,904
I can't believe this nonsense.

343
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,241
Why? Why? What have I done wrong?

344
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,325
Why?

345
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,619
Tell him to just kill me!

346
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,205
No. I'll go over there and kill everyone!

347
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,374
I'll do it, and then I'll end my life!

348
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,756
I will help you get your revenge.
You just have to trust me.

349
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,385
Put your life in my hands,
and I'll honor you.

350
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,681
I know something
very useful.

351
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,932
Hey. Hello?

352
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,437
Useful enough
to bring down the Crown Prince.

353
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,745
Something is off
about Jung Seok-jo.

354
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,083
I need you to go and tell Commander Yoon
to postpone his trip to Yeoyeon.

355
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,131
Officer Yoon left last night in a haste

356
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,258
to check the border
in the northern region.

357
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,135
-He left last night?
-Yes.

358
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,954
-What is it?
-A suspicious man has been spotted.

359
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,121
What?

360
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,000
TRANSACTION ON DAY 23

361
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,314
I guess I've arrived earlier
than you expected.

362
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,985
I warned you before

363
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,654
that I wouldn't turn
a blind eye next time.

364
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,673
What you told me before,

365
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,759
do you still believe in it?

366
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,388
Do you still think that
this is the only path you can take?

367
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,477
Have you ever regretted
your decision?

368
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,064
Standing with Lord Sangheon,
is it a choice you're happy within?

369
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,858
In the end,
there was no other path to take.

370
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,694
So all I could do was walk it.

371
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,845
-Are you all right?
-How did you…

372
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,727
Intruders!

373
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,270
You must leave.

374
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,898
Come with me now. Hurry!

375
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,693
Chase them! Go!

376
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,986
Come on!

377
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,201
Get them! Go!

378
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,041
Hurry.

379
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,377
Don't let them get away!

380
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,090
-Get them!
-Faster!

381
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,428
Move! Get them!

382
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,437
Get them!

383
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,203
Give me the ledger.

384
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,205
And I'll spare your life once more.

385
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,293
Is that another… favor as a friend?

386
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,086
Take it.

387
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,805
No! Don't!

388
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,821
Stay alive.

389
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,282
Go.

390
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,974
No! Stop it!

391
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,296
Seok-jo…

392
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,841
the sky is beautiful.

393
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,506
Here is what I'm thinking.

394
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,718
I'm thinking you'll spent
the whole night training alone, huh.

395
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,136
I'm sure you did. I know you.

396
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,639
You know, you could afford to try.

397
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,975
Oh, you smuggler.

398
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,857
Hey, Seok-jo. Look at the sky.

399
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,318
How beautiful.

400
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,673
Hyeong-seol.

401
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,764
No.

402
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,490
I believe he was unable
to take the ledger.

403
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,411
And Officer Yoon…

404
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,498
died right there on the spot.

405
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,381
After paying a price like that,

406
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:22,344
that's a lesson I'm sure
His Majesty won't forget.

407
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,398
-Ji-un, over here!
-Hey, Jil-geum.

408
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,652
Did you find what I asked for?

409
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,572
You said that the corpse got swollen
and that the gums changed color

410
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,990
-after a day and a half?
-Uh-huh.

411
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,952
In that case, I think this is it.

412
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,998
SONANGCHO

413
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,459
A RARE, POISONOUS PLANT
THAT FLOWERS EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS

414
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,384
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

415
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,264
Scribe Jung, it's late.
Why haven't you gone home yet?

416
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,142
I need to talk to you, Your Majesty.

417
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,144
-That's why.
-What?

418
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,277
All right. Then let's go.

419
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,240
BONCHOGANGMOK

420
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,494
So, what is this?

421
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:33,290
The Diaries of the Royal Secretariat
state that the poisonous herb

422
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,751
that is known as busohwa
killed His Majesty.

423
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,129
Yes. In fact, I do remember that.

424
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,465
I checked the Diaries a while ago.

425
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,967
It was all fabricated.

426
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,845
When one gets poisoned with busohwa,

427
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,349
the postmortem signs
are supposed to show up immediately.

428
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,767
But it actually took…

429
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,188
a day and a half for these signs
to manifest on the King's body.

430
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,690
What are you…

431
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,828
SONANGCHO

432
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,415
Sonangcho poison.

433
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,253
Its postmortem sighs are very similar.

434
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,255
And it's much more poisonous too.

435
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,259
But it is very difficult
to find this herb.

436
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,137
That means…

437
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,306
That if we find out
who the distributor is,

438
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,394
then we will be able to find out the truth
behind the late King's death.

439
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,116
Your Majesty!

440
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,330
What is it?

441
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,167
We have news from the post in Yeoyeon.

442
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,504
News?

443
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,191
Commander Yoon?

444
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,737
Where is he?

445
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,116
He didn't make it.

446
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,584
Commander Yoon told me
to make sure this was delivered to you.

447
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,968
Could you escort the two of them
back to the palace now?

448
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:59,139
I want to stay here with him
for just a while longer.

449
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,434
Yes, Your Majesty.

450
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,022
I thank you…

451
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,070
for coming back alive.

452
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,305
I feel as if
I'm currently surrounded by fog.

453
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,184
And whenever I try to run
towards the right direction,

454
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,020
I realize that the destination…

455
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,065
is actually still far away.

456
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,527
And if I run with all my might,

457
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,404
the destination gets further away.

458
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,910
I have been wandering around to no end.

459
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,913
And now,

460
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,875
I feel like I've almost forgotten…

461
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,294
where I really need to go.

462
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,925
Do you think that I…

463
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,303
will be able to find the way again?

464
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,559
Do you think the fog…

465
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,395
will ever go away?

466
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,904
The sun will shine once the rain stops.

467
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,491
And the view will become…

468
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,829
more clear and definite
once the fog lifts.

469
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:52,043
If you have a destination,
you're going to reach it someday.

470
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,717
No matter how long it takes
to get there, you will reach it.

471
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,614
What brings you here?
I wasn't informed you'd be visiting.

472
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,408
I heard the news of Officer Yoon's death.

473
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,660
I know that His Majesty respected him and…

474
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,996
I'm sure he's grieving.

475
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,331
Yes.

476
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,000
Is that why you came here?

477
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,007
How is the relocation
of the placenta chamber?

478
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,218
Is everything going well?

479
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,013
The task was more interesting
than I expected.

480
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,307
I don't know how to thank
the Chief State Counselor

481
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,352
for giving me this alluring task.

482
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,062
That's good news.

483
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,940
I was worried that life
in the countryside would be difficult.

484
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,942
You shouldn't worry.

485
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:02,614
It seems I have a good chance
of returning earlier than I imagined.

486
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,890
What a dazzling sound.

487
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,143
It sounds like waves.

488
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,112
You asked me to come
to the seaside with you.

489
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,073
I'm so sorry.

490
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,411
It doesn't have to be by the seaside.

491
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,454
I just…

492
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,000
I just wanted to remain by your side.

493
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,547
Did you say, "Trust me,
or die like a dog?"

494
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,675
'Cause this feels
just like the latter, huh?

495
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,511
You were supposed to bring me back
after taking the throne,

496
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,222
you didn't get rid
of Prince Jehyeon or his people.

497
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,434
And plus, you didn't answer
the thousands of letters I sent you!

498
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,728
How I love a cordial welcome.

499
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,564
Please calm down, Uncle.

500
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:11,284
Fine. Why did you want
to see me, anyway, huh?

501
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,079
Have you got kicked out of the Capital?
Looks like you need me, huh?

502
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,249
What? You need company
on your way to hell?

503
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,877
I don't think that would be necessary.

504
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:26,091
I asked you to come here,
so that I could bring you back from there.

505
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,033
If there are two umbilical cords,

506
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,786
does it mean that there were twins?

507
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,545
If you are trying to fool me again…

508
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,506
Damn it.

509
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,553
Fine. So go on. What are you trying
to do with this?

510
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,805
I'm sure you've already heard that

511
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,599
in the year His Majesty was born,
there was a blood bath

512
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,642
at the royal nursery.

513
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,229
So you heard
about that too.

514
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,106
It is a secret, so no one speaks of it.

515
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,192
What if they were
all killed to cover up a certain truth?

516
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,527
What do you think?

517
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:33,032
For example, switching His Majesty
for a different person at a certain point.

518
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,243
Switching?

519
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,871
When His Majesty was the Prince,

520
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,248
Hyun came to me and said something.

521
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,251
He said it felt as if the Prince
had become someone else.

522
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,337
We both sensed it, too, didn't we?

523
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,799
I understand he wanted
to keep a distance from us,

524
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,303
but he was oddly fastidious
about not participating in activities

525
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,221
where there were only men.

526
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,863
Right? Huh?

527
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:15,033
Oh, man! I knew it! I told you. Huh?

528
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,994
I told you I was right. I knew it! Yes!

529
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,704
I was right, my friend!

530
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,498
That's right, my uncle.

531
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:26,419
Now, I also believe that maybe
you were right about all of this.

532
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,840
So I just have to check
whether or not he's a woman.

533
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,883
Is that right?

534
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,190
Your eyes are puffy. Is that all right?

535
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,694
Well, there is nothing I can do.

536
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,696
Unfortunately, I can't be gone for long.

537
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,406
-What are you doing?
-You have to get away from here.

538
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,681
Uncle, how are you even…

539
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,082
Your Majesty.

540
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,615
Father.

541
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,111
Did you check
if he was indeed a woman?

542
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,362
He's a woman.
I'm certain of it.

543
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,157
A woman? Oh, you've lost your mind!

544
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,908
His Majesty's been
seeing Scribe Jung in private?

545
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,661
Is it possible His Majesty
prefers men to women?

546
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,246
You know, that may be why

547
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,831
he's been avoiding
sleeping with the Queen.

548
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,710
It would be a good idea
to stop seeing Scribe Jung for now.

549
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,337
I will not ask you
to tell me what is happening

550
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,757
Just allow me to produce your heir.

551
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,342
I do not want
to lose you, Your Majesty.

552
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,553
I am going to get married.
