1
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,688
It was here somewhere.

2
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,738
-Yeong-ji!
-Yeong-ji!

3
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,866
You have until the end of today.

4
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,118
And if you should happen to fail in this,

5
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,955
I can't promise that your shop
or that girl will be safe.

6
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,593
I… I was just…

7
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,221
Don't worry about it, I saw nothing.

8
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,557
I was digging for herbs.

9
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,694
Well… I honestly didn't see a thing

10
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,906
so please carry on with your…
whatever you're doing.

11
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,333
It's dangerous to be out here, though.

12
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,961
Hear that? That sound?

13
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,131
His Majesty is on a royal hunt out here,

14
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,886
and you could, uh, possibly be mistaken
for a beast and be shot at.

15
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,764
Come with me.
I'll escort you out of these woods.

16
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,102
Just go. I don't need help from you.

17
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,520
No, wait.

18
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,022
Don't be like that.

19
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,274
And you should put your clothes back on.

20
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,551
If you don't want to,

21
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,554
you are free to choose not to.

22
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,478
Did you

23
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,855
run away?

24
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,275
Are you a court maid?

25
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,985
Or, or maybe…

26
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,051
That was more
than I expected from a woman.

27
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,345
However,

28
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,725
this blade is quite dangerous.

29
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,567
Damn, I know he went this way.

30
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,861
Nice.

31
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,909
Whoa.

32
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,374
My bow is rather accurate today.

33
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,212
Is it possible he could have seen my face?

34
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,882
Nah.

35
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,846
Wait. Is that…

36
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,807
Huh?

37
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,275
Follow me.

38
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,862
It'll be the end
if we get caught in these woods.

39
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,906
For both you and for me.

40
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,381
Huh?

41
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,426
What is this?

42
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,306
What in the world is going on out here?

43
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,981
There.

44
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,151
Identify yourselves!

45
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,780
-Get them!
-Yes, sir!

46
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,014
Hyah.

47
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,741
They're over there!

48
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,659
Oh, no.

49
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,663
What do we do now?

50
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,041
-Jump.
-What?

51
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,234
EPISODE 3

52
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,658
MERCHANT

53
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,859
What is it you've been cherishing
so affectionately?

54
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,777
It's as if you're holding your beloved.

55
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,362
It's nothing like that.

56
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,864
Come on, Lord Jaeun.

57
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,575
What's of value should be shared,
don't you think, eh?

58
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,079
Hey. This is just
an ordinary brush, though.

59
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,790
It's too big for a fine writing brush

60
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,500
and too small for a middle-sized one.

61
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,668
Give it here.

62
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,253
It's for someone I treasure very much.

63
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,714
And if you haven't noticed,
that brush-maker did not do

64
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,257
a very good job, you know?

65
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,636
It's not of adequate size
for a man to use anyway.

66
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,346
We must be here.

67
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,437
The Crown Prince has vanished?

68
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,482
He ran into the woods
that are near the valley,

69
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,775
but then we lost sight of him.

70
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,611
What could have happened?

71
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,282
Listen, until I explain this to the King,
continue to keep watching your post.

72
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,909
Yes.

73
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,040
Could His Highness have taken advantage
of the situation and ran off?

74
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,750
His Highness would never do that.

75
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,128
You know he'd never go anywhere
without telling us something about it.

76
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,881
Something must have happened.

77
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:19,595
What I mean, it's either that
or that he could be in danger somehow.

78
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,639
You.

79
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,849
-You'll follow me.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,226
Wait a minute.

81
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,560
Yes?

82
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,648
What on earth is happening? Oh.

83
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,235
Here. You should take this just in case.

84
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,153
You must find the Crown Prince

85
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
before anyone else does,
do you understand?

86
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,990
I will. Please do not worry.
I'll find him.

87
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,493
What's all the ruckus?

88
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,997
Lord Jaeun!

89
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,876
I heard you went to Mokcheon
on business for the Ministry of Rites.

90
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,003
It ended faster than expected.

91
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,506
Anyway, what's going on?

92
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,258
What's His Royal Highness up to?

93
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,218
Oh…

94
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,469
Well, uh…

95
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,014
I'll fill you in about it later!

96
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,350
I'll tell you all about it another time!

97
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,777
What happened?

98
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,113
Maybe…

99
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,284
she's dead?

100
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,721
I can't be as good as you, Your Majesty.

101
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,057
What a sweet boy.

102
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,030
Father!

103
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,658
Oh, that's my boy.

104
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,000
Hey.

105
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,347
On the day I was born,

106
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,809
I want to know what my father said.

107
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,188
What's that, huh?

108
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,691
Did he also agree

109
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,944
of those who wanted to end my life?

110
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,866
That a girl was of no need
and could be killed

111
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,868
and should be killed?

112
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,287
Is that what he said?

113
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,455
The order came
from the preceding King.

114
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,669
His Majesty wouldn't dare
to disobey his father,

115
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,129
you must understand.

116
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,496
Are you all right, Your Highness?

117
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,248
Hyun? I'm…

118
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,515
Your Royal Highness.

119
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,403
With Commander Yoon in pursuit,
the culprit won't get away.

120
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,530
-Yes, but he--
-Are you sure you're all right?

121
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,824
Did you get injured, Your Highness?

122
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,244
Wa… Wait.

123
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,288
Why are you back, Hyun?

124
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,998
How on earth are you possibly here?

125
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,709
We must leave the woods,
it's not safe here.

126
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,003
Soldiers must be informed
of what happened.

127
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,588
Uh, uh…

128
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,840
I'll need a minute…

129
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,384
Hyun.

130
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,683
I didn't see before,
what happened to your clothes?

131
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,688
Your Royal Highness!

132
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,065
Your Royal Highness!

133
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,152
I'm so glad that I found you.

134
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,323
You should, uh,
probably change into these.

135
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,141
An assassin?

136
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,644
You're saying on the hunt today,
an assassin attacked the Crown Prince?

137
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,314
Yes, Commander Yoon went after him,

138
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,692
so, soon we'll know
the identity of the culprit.

139
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,528
Why are you still standing here?

140
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,030
Go after the assassin!

141
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,323
Yes, sir!

142
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,664
Are you sure that you're not injured?

143
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,875
That was an extremely close call.

144
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,800
Your Majesty,
we should return to the palace.

145
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,219
It seems danger lurks in these woods.

146
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,471
I will command
the royal carriage to be ready--

147
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,265
No one should leave
the royal hunting site.

148
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,231
Explain yourself, Left State Councilor.

149
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,150
Soldiers patrol at the royal hunting site.

150
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,569
Without help from an insider,

151
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,490
how could an assassin
have made it to our vicinity?

152
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,370
Are you accusing us of sneaking
an assassin into these woods somehow?

153
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,332
Those who would benefit most
from the death of…

154
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,584
His Royal Highness are undoubtedly…

155
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,002
…gathered here.

156
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,754
Silence!

157
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,048
Your Majesty.

158
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
Choose your words carefully.

159
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,512
It's why we must get
to the bottom of this.

160
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,015
Even if we must burn down the forest,

161
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,269
it is urgent that we figure out

162
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,981
the assassin's true identity.

163
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,278
Hyah!

164
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:22,327
A body most likely to be the assassins
was found near Samil Peak.

165
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,970
You will move the body.

166
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,263
Yes, sir!

167
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,459
Isn't he a soldier
from one of the Five Central Armies?

168
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,171
Are you certain this is the assassin
who attacked the Crown Prince?

169
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,422
From what I've been told,

170
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,342
this man was incessantly disgruntled
with the Left State Councilor.

171
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,845
According to multiple sources,

172
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,597
he ran his mouth off while drunk,

173
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,474
saying he might murder
the Left State Councilor

174
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,019
and also his grandson, His Royal Highness.

175
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,775
Now that the threat is over,

176
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,237
you should return
to the palace, Your Majesty.

177
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,699
See to it that
he wasn't working for anyone.

178
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,216
Why that…

179
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,428
This was clearly a conspiracy.

180
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,890
The Queen's people could have
arranged this for all we know.

181
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,436
The Queen has the King wrapped
around her fingers even tighter now,

182
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,647
which could lead to Prince Jehyeon

183
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,316
threatening the status
of His Royal Highness!

184
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,484
Minister No!

185
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,448
I… I only meant
that it should never happen.

186
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,588
Oh. Yeong-ji! Yeong-ji!

187
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,965
Yeong-ji!

188
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,093
Yeong-ji! Yeong-ji! Yeong-ji!

189
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,645
Is the Samgaebang physician
still not back?

190
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,439
He's not.

191
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,607
I only have myself to blame

192
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,861
for trusting a hack who only has rumors
for credentials.

193
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,491
You know, he will come back.

194
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,038
No matter what,
Physician Jung always keeps his word.

195
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,875
And the rumors,
they reflect his medical skills.

196
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,962
I admire your faith in him.

197
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,683
I didn't realize how pretty you are.

198
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,772
Rather than killing you,
how about I brand you instead?

199
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,776
Put your hands off of her.

200
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,112
Let her go now.

201
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,572
-You made it!
-Ji-un, you're back!

202
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,664
Just like I promised you.

203
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,209
Your herbs.

204
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,129
I thought you would have
run away from here.

205
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,841
Running away isn't my style
when there's someone to protect.

206
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,052
Not so fast.

207
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,849
How can I trust that
these herbs are the remedy?

208
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,813
If you didn't have hope
then you wouldn't have waited.

209
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,148
Is that correct?

210
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,530
Are you okay? Do you have a fever?

211
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,617
I'm sorry that you went through all this.
Let's go home.

212
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,911
I hope there wasn't
any trouble on your trip.

213
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,956
You're worried about me
when you're tied up?

214
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,166
Worry about yourself first.

215
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,252
Oh, I couldn't help it, you know.

216
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,431
I couldn't sleep after hearing about
what happened at the royal hunting.

217
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,059
It gives me great relief
to see you in one piece.

218
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,688
We were blessed.

219
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,650
Prince Jehyeon was deeply concerned
for his brother's safety.

220
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,112
I'm truly glad to hear
the assassin was captured, brother.

221
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,493
I apologize that I raise any alarm.

222
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,580
From what I hear,

223
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,542
the Queen was also present
at the royal hunting.

224
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,754
Ah, yes, per His Majesty's request, I--

225
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,923
A hen shouldn't cry before the rooster.

226
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,428
When to be present or not
is something you should clearly learn.

227
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,141
Of course. I'll keep that in mind,
Your Majesty.

228
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,022
Your Royal Highness will someday
lead the people of this nation.

229
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,860
Please know that you must be careful
at all times.

230
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,738
I hope you understand what I mean.

231
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,865
Yes, I know, Grandmother.

232
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,254
Watching how disciplined those

233
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,883
of the Crown Prince's quarters are
never ceases to amaze me.

234
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,055
At all times they stand exactly
five steps apart from one another.

235
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,182
Sometimes, it fascinates me.

236
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,437
The future leader of this nation
should be wary

237
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,981
of letting small details go by undetected.

238
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,526
You should also know
that applies to business

239
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,736
within the quarters of the Crown Prince.

240
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,115
Once again,
I am enlightened by you, brother.

241
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,714
How can he be this cold
to his one and only younger brother?

242
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,592
One might say
he brought the assassin on himself.

243
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,678
Oh, Mother, please.

244
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,097
It's just a figure of speech.

245
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,934
Being born first doesn't make him best.

246
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,527
Good going, Your Royal Highness.

247
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,612
I felt the kick
from where I was standing--

248
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,073
You know that nothing good
will come from you

249
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,491
and the Queen being at odds.

250
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,952
That was never intended.

251
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,622
The one who sees me as an eyesore
is the Queen herself.

252
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,668
Could the assassin's attack really
have been ordered by the Queen?

253
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,753
You know one should watch what they say

254
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,088
within the palace walls,

255
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,842
and your mouth not only lets in a lot
but also lets out a lot as well.

256
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,719
Um, that was uncalled for.

257
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,179
Well, that's what you get
for always crossing the line.

258
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,812
I must ask.

259
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,899
Why did you spare that young man,

260
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,653
the one who saw you there in the woods
at the royal hunting?

261
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,238
You don't know who he was.

262
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,033
He could have conspired
with the assassin that came after you.

263
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,386
He was there to dig up herbs
which might suggest

264
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,680
he's an herb digger or a physician.

265
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,891
If not, he was probably
in the woods to hunt.

266
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,478
I doubt he will ever step foot
in this palace,

267
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,107
which is why I chose
not to complicate things further.

268
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,276
Yes.

269
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,374
Come on.

270
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,346
A court maid
at the royal hunting?

271
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:48,101
She had a delicate face, porcelain skin,
and dark brown hair.

272
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,562
And her eyes were the size… Oh.

273
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,439
…this jade.

274
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,651
Her sharp gaze seemed very cold
in some kind of way,

275
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,071
but also determined
depending on how you look at it.

276
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,199
Could it be Hong-sim
who works at His Majesty's chamber?

277
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,534
Hong-sim? Who's she?

278
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,661
It can't be her.
He just said she's determined.

279
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,497
It sounds like Eun-yeong
at the royal kitchen.

280
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,790
Could it be that one you were just--

281
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,334
It has to be Yeon-ok who serves
at the Crown Prince's quarters.

282
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,003
-Hong-sim, Yeon-ok--
-Who's Yeon-ok?

283
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,215
Ah!

284
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,426
-Shh, shh, shh…
-No, there's no way.

285
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,387
Those maids were they all
at the royal hunt?

286
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,139
Not just them.

287
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,975
Dozens more were probably there.

288
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,310
Yeah.

289
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:36,649
Is there maybe a court maid
who never found her way back?

290
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,027
Someone who could have drowned
in the river.

291
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,489
Don't be ridiculous.

292
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,409
Anyway, why do you ask?

293
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,789
Uh… I mean…

294
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,582
No reason.

295
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,959
Yeah.

296
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,240
Oh.

297
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,950
Gr-- Grandfather?

298
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,953
You're not the eldest son
of the Crown Prince.

299
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,163
The one who should have died was you.

300
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,418
You should have died instead!

301
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,877
Your Highness,
I thought you were in your chambers.

302
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,755
What on earth might I ask are you doing?

303
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,841
Disturbance is finding me in my sleep.

304
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,720
Go back to your quarters.

305
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,473
And don't worry about it.

306
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,725
It was that same nightmare, huh?

307
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,186
It hasn't haunted you
for a while now.

308
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,026
I'll have the royal pharmacy
bring you calming herbs to help you sleep.

309
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,112
You best head back to your chambers.

310
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,909
Shh!

311
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,084
Tell me what is this about?

312
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,460
He's here.

313
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,003
Huh? Who's here?

314
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,222
How is he inside the palace walls?

315
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,314
What are you doing?

316
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,109
Just wait here for me.

317
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,193
What?

318
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,779
Your Highness, wait!

319
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,137
Get down! Get down! Get down!

320
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,015
Hey! You scared me!

321
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,183
"You scared me!"

322
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,980
Anyway, so, did you ask around?

323
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,315
About the court maid
at the royal hunting site.

324
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,276
You wanted to know if she was alive.

325
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,945
I don't know.

326
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,656
There's a high chance
she wasn't a court maid after all.

327
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,702
I wonder who could have made you
wanna visit the palace you try to avoid?

328
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,953
Just take this, all right?

329
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,831
Oh.

330
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,750
Ah, stop it. Stop it.

331
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,210
You didn't have to.

332
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,882
So, there's something
I wanna ask you about.

333
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,135
Rumor has it that you donate your earnings
to the poor and needy, eh?

334
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,386
Is that right?

335
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,930
Who says that? Hmm?

336
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,476
Enough with the nonsense
and just lead the way.

337
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,188
Sure. We should go
before the gatekeepers change shifts.

338
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,154
There.

339
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,077
Over there! There!

340
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,787
Wait! Where are you going?

341
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,051
Well, well. Working hard
on the evening patrol.

342
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,969
Chief Gu, what, what are you…

343
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,429
What brings you out at this hour?

344
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,099
What brings me out? Not much.

345
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,127
So tell me what's new.

346
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,962
I hope all is well at home.

347
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,421
Yes, all, all is well.

348
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,048
Anyway, it's been a while…

349
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,550
Yeah, it has.

350
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,731
Please spare me.

351
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,568
I do not know anything. I swear.

352
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,946
Please spare me this one time.

353
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,785
End it with one strike.

354
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,536
It's painless that way.

355
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,165
I…

356
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,167
I cannot do it.

357
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,086
I cannot.

358
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,420
If you don't do it,

359
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,257
we're all as good as dead.

360
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,639
This is what you must do.

361
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,432
From now on…

362
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,269
it is what you must do.

363
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,233
But I…

364
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,694
I will forever play dumb. I swear.

365
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,988
I will never tell anyone.

366
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,907
I will never say
that Your Highness is a woman--

367
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,239
What are you doing here?

368
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,117
Wh-wha… what's that?

369
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,827
Is that blood or…

370
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,579
The shot came from over there.

371
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,290
This is bad.

372
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,793
We have to leave now. Come on. Hurry.

373
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,233
The only ones who know of that door
are me and that boy I knew long ago.

374
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,946
So how could he…

375
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,177
-Oh.
-Ji-un.

376
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,095
Ji-un.

377
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,763
Why haven't you turned in?

378
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,890
Uh… You see…

379
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,692
We'll get out of your way.

380
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
Oh.

381
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,624
How did you know where to find me?

382
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,294
You stopped by the house, didn't you?

383
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,839
When did you return to the Capital?

384
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,883
I only went there to visit Mother.

385
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,385
You should probably just go.

386
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,973
I sent you to Ming
because you wanted to pursue knowledge,

387
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,434
but you return
with a bag full of pointless tricks.

388
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,436
They are not pointless.

389
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,647
They are skills I could one day save…

390
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,941
the life of somebody.

391
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,571
Skills that could have saved
the lives of those people…

392
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,366
who you decided to…

393
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,077
to hurt.

394
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,538
How long will you let that day

395
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,041
waste your life and ruin your future?

396
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,210
Tell me, how long…

397
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,255
will you continue
to disappoint your mother and me?

398
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,012
Do you really want
to know how long, Father?

399
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,682
That memory will stay with me
to the day I die.

400
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,436
The image of you slaying
that innocent court maid…

401
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,898
will forever…

402
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,860
haunt me, Father.

403
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,278
It's in the past.

404
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,405
You should move on.

405
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,659
Just move on?

406
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,164
There was a time
when I admired you, Father.

407
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,086
I wanted to grow up to be just like you.

408
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,546
But that ended…

409
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,968
when I found out that your honor

410
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,178
was built on injustice.

411
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,429
Injustice?

412
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,394
Your grandfather valued integrity overall.

413
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,188
He gave me a life of injustice.

414
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,817
If justice means to be virtuous

415
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,280
at the expense of taking care
of one's own family,

416
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,409
then it's wiser to make an agreement

417
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,703
with injustice.

418
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,121
No, I…

419
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,001
I will never be that way.

420
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,170
I won't live like you…

421
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,339
or Grandfather.

422
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,925
So do not interfere with my life again.

423
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,928
Don't you ever try
to come back here either.

424
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,455
No!

425
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,958
-Samgaebang?
-Yes.

426
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,878
He was escorted out of the palace
by Chief Gu.

427
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:37,132
He's been introducing the court maids
to his services from time to time.

428
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,636
Must you really take care
of this matter personally, though?

429
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,096
I could have sought him out alone.

430
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,015
I will see him with my own two eyes.

431
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,935
What if he really is Jung Seok-jo's son?

432
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,693
Then I'll kill him.

433
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,529
Do… do you mean it?

434
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,906
He's the one you once had feelings for.

435
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,450
Why do you think
that's even important now?

436
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,414
If it really was
Jung Seok-jo's son who saw me,

437
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,791
I must kill him…

438
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,002
since he is my biggest threat.

439
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,589
Hmm, that's true.

440
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,305
It pains me to tell you
that our famous physician stepped out

441
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,099
to tend to very urgent business.

442
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,268
So I'm afraid you'll have to head home.

443
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,061
Please come back, all right?

444
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,271
I'm sorry about this.

445
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,231
Please, please, please, watch your step.

446
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,899
Uh, if you come back,

447
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,445
I'll be sure to let him know
that you all deserve extra care.

448
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,571
Put in a good word for us.

449
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,115
Of course I will, and have a nice day!

450
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,292
Uh, are you

451
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,670
the scholar from the mountain
who booked an appointment the other day?

452
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,755
Uh…

453
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,131
Oh! Uh…

454
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,841
Yes, that's me.

455
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,468
Oh, no, and you…

456
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,927
You've waited so long!

457
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,472
I'm afraid our physician
had urgent business

458
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,557
and can't come in today.

459
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,018
I feel terrible
since you must have traveled far.

460
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,982
Sir, just follow me.

461
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,735
You can find him at Hongwolru.
You've heard of the place, eh?

462
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,652
Hongwolru?

463
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,404
-The courtesan house?
-Shh, shh!

464
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,323
I can see you're looking for a tavern.

465
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,450
A fine gentleman like you.

466
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,659
I know a good one.

467
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,244
-Let me lead the way.
-Maybe next time.

468
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,746
Oh, come on.

469
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,289
Let's get a move on.

470
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,749
-But--
-It's quite all right.

471
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,125
Come on. What's the matter?

472
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,169
Come on. Let's go!

473
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:41,006
This way. Let's go! Come on!

474
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,426
-Watch your step.
-Hello, sir!

475
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,887
Goodness.
Let me introduce you to today's guest.

476
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,057
He's a hotshot scholar
from the mountainous district.

477
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,165
My dear.

478
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,376
Do you know how much I've missed you?

479
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,588
-Oh, My Lord.
-Anyway, let's hurry inside.

480
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,717
Come on now. Let's go in.

481
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,220
-My Lord!
-You adorable bunny.

482
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,516
-Oh, hey, be careful.
-Hey!

483
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,102
Come on! Come on!

484
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,651
Hey, what are you saying?

485
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,236
Drink up.

486
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,825
It seems to me
that our delicate Crown Prince

487
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,994
has a weakness no one should know about.

488
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,037
Have you heard of rumors like this at all?

489
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,082
A weakness, you say?

490
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,168
See, it seems the Crown Prince
is hiding something.

491
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,088
Ah, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

492
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,175
As the Royal Preceptor,
you must have information.

493
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,304
I don't really know.

494
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,723
Come on. Get this.

495
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:16,727
During the royal hunting,
I saw the Crown Prince with his hair down.

496
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,771
And what I saw was a woman

497
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,316
just like this one right here, huh!

498
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,943
Do you have any idea
how taken aback I was?

499
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,362
Have you seen any
weird stuff like that, huh?

500
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:31,867
You said that, for some reason,
there's a womanly mood to him.

501
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,369
Isn't that what you told me last time?

502
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:39,791
That's… Well, I was only referring
to his unique style of writing.

503
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,753
His elegant penmanship and delicate lines
are such compliment--

504
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,509
Do you really think you can keep
playing dumb with me, huh?

505
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,305
I think that's enough,
Lord Changun.

506
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,141
It's the last thing
you want anyone to hear, I'm sure.

507
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,229
But you just seemed to be
a little too drunk right now, yeah?

508
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,649
What? Too drunk?

509
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,699
Get over here.

510
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,285
Of course.

511
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:21,124
Do I seem like a drunk halfwit lunatic
just babbling nonsense to you?

512
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,585
Of course not.
No, that's not what I meant.

513
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,878
Okay.

514
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,423
I guess that
I could have mistaken your words.

515
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,762
You must think nothing of me
as a member of the royal family.

516
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,099
A member of the royal family!

517
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,767
Do I seem like a joke to you?

518
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,560
-Am I a joke to you?
-Oh, my goodness!

519
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,104
Am I?

520
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,773
Am I a joke to you? Am I? Huh?

521
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,526
Yeah, I guess
I could have mistaken your words.

522
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,902
Damn!

523
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,237
Get up!

524
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,323
It's all right, so get up.

525
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,866
It's okay. It's okay.

526
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,410
Let me see.

527
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,912
Let me take a look.

528
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,330
Yeah.

529
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:05,585
How… dare… you!

530
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,046
Say it again, huh?

531
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,424
I dare you to say it again!

532
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,758
Huh?

533
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,480
What the…

534
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,861
-What? What is it? Huh?
-Please.

535
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,156
Now, would you like to play as well, huh?

536
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,950
What are you looking at?

537
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,535
Please don't do this.

538
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,370
Oh, please don't.

539
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,830
Let go of me.

540
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,874
Ah, damn it!

541
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,636
Shh.

542
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,689
You…

543
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,109
You… You are…

544
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,115
How dare you do that.

545
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,199
Uh…

546
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,535
Haven't…

547
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,329
we met before…

548
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,749
at the royal hunting site?

549
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,836
Hunting site?

550
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,340
Uh, from what I recall, you were a…

551
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,259
a woman.

552
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,386
Uh, no, wait.

553
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,347
You mustn't go out there yet.

554
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,476
I saved you, don't waste it.

555
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,354
Who saved whom did you say exactly?

556
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,859
Haven't you heard the rumors?

557
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,444
He's known as the madman.

558
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,823
He's a jerk and someone you should avoid.

559
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,788
Hey, hold on! Hold on, hold on!

560
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,167
We should continue having our fun, right?

561
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,960
All right, yeah. Let's go.

562
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,879
Let's party.

563
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,382
Of all the places for you to be, Uncle.

564
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,633
You're here.

565
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,595
Ah, well, you look who it is.

566
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,222
What brings His Royal Highness here?

567
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,100
Your Royal Highness!

568
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,104
-I see you're here too, Royal Preceptor.
-Crown Prince?

569
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,899
A royal preceptor

570
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,693
having drinks in the daytime

571
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,029
with a member of the royal family?

572
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,114
How utterly honorable.

573
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,826
It… It isn't what it seems to be.

574
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,753
You and that quick temper of yours.

575
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,213
From what I recall,

576
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,925
His Majesty has warned you before
not to assault anyone ever again

577
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,843
by abusing your power and status.

578
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,803
Huh?

579
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,890
Ah, that wasn't random.

580
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,434
He insulted the royal family,

581
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,437
and all I did was give him
a little discipline, that's all.

582
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,398
That's all?

583
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,904
I'll keep this affair
from His Majesty's ears.

584
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,615
He's been waiting to scold you.

585
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,161
And, of course,
the Queen Dowager has as well.

586
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,291
Hey, wait.

587
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,002
What brings you here of all places?

588
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,256
There are more than enough women
at the palace, aren't there?

589
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,135
Unlike you, I'm not that kind of man.

590
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:28,556
I just, uh, came here
to meet up with a friend of mine.

591
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,558
Friend?

592
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,447
I'm not in the mood for drinks.

593
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,032
Come on, let's go!

594
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,377
Wait.

595
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,466
I saw improvement then…

596
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,511
Your archery skills.

597
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,680
Huh?

598
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,070
If you wish to be beheaded

599
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,657
as the man behind
the assassination attempt,

600
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,745
keep up being cheeky.

601
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,047
Let's go.

602
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,485
Damn it!

603
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,867
-Physician Jung!
-Physician Jung, it's been so long.

604
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,119
-We've been waiting.
-Oh, please.

605
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,039
-It's been so long.
-I've been waiting for you.

606
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,958
Uh, hold on for just one minute.

607
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,169
Now's not the time. Later.

608
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,066
So, what were you about to say?

609
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,152
-What?
-The royal hunting site?

610
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,488
I doubt anyone who isn't a soldier

611
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,282
or a part of the royal family
could have been there.

612
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,743
Well, sure, absolutely.

613
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,495
I definitely wasn't there.

614
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,374
Only someone who has a death wish
would have landed himself there.

615
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,095
And, uh, what is your name?

616
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,688
Jung Ji-un is my name,
Your Royal Highness.

617
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,284
When did you return
from traveling to Ming?

618
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,331
Do you… remember me?

619
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,334
Yes.

620
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,255
Bits and pieces
are slowly coming together.

621
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,884
Many years ago,
you came to me to introduce yourself.

622
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,930
I'm honored, Your Royal Highness.

623
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,225
I apologize for not realizing
you were His Royal Highness.

624
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,479
Please forgive my impudence.

625
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,276
Very well. You are forgiven.

626
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,030
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

627
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:16,075
You are just as same as you were
all those years ago.

628
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,412
You are still just as kind and generous.

629
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:20,955
However,

630
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,543
if I lay my eyes on you one more time,

631
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,962
I will…

632
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,341
withdraw my forgiveness.

633
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,177
Remember…

634
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,887
what I've said to you.

635
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,681
Yes.

636
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,226
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

637
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,316
Your… Your Royal Highness!

638
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,736
Your Royal Highness!

639
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,159
So is it him? Is it?

640
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,310
Follow me.

641
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,607
Shh.

642
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,920
Court Lady Kim has ordered me
to help you get to bed.

643
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,425
I'm fine, all right?
Go back to your quarters.

644
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,302
Yes.

645
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,225
Eh…

646
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,147
Can you afford to let him live?

647
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,150
Being Jung Seok-jo's son

648
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,319
makes him dangerous
as you've already said.

649
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,489
He's also someone who knew you
before you claimed this identity.

650
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,658
If he figures it all out--

651
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,118
That won't happen…

652
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,704
for he will not

653
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,415
show himself to me again.

654
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,463
And you saw for yourself.

655
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,840
He grew up to be a…

656
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,593
a pathetic excuse for a man.

657
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,345
However,

658
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,931
he's the son of the man
who slew the young prince.

659
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,433
That's exactly why…

660
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,269
I cannot complicate things.

661
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,650
Even if we eventually run
into one another,

662
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,320
he won't have any more doubts,
that much I'm sure of.

663
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,114
But why wouldn't he?

664
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,035
Anyone who knows Dam-i…

665
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,289
would never think that the Crown Prince

666
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,250
could ever be a woman.

667
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,618
You called for me?

668
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,370
Have a seat.

669
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,214
Is it true that Jung Ji-un is your son?

670
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,302
Rumor has it that
he's a skilled acupuncturist.

671
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,641
Many say he saved
the Vice Minister of Rites of Ming.

672
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,480
It's true he studied in Ming,

673
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,358
but I'm unaware of his actions there.

674
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,486
The envoy from Ming will soon visit here.

675
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,990
And among them will be
the Vice Minister of Rites.

676
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,534
It would help if…

677
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,035
your son could…

678
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,206
serve the Crown Prince
during the upcoming visit to the palace.

679
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,141
Forgive my actions from the other day.

680
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,976
It was uncalled for.

681
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,356
It's not me you need to apologize to,

682
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,359
but the girl who you intimidated

683
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,403
and threatened to have branded.

684
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,322
Is she important to you?

685
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,784
I thought she was simply an assistant.

686
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,412
So then?

687
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,875
Is that why you treated her
with such cruelty?

688
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,170
Threatening to brand a young girl's face,

689
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,255
leaving her with a burn?

690
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,305
All right. Fine.

691
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,766
I will go and apologize
to your assistant as well.

692
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,980
Since you're here,
if it's all right with you,

693
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,692
I'd like to suggest that you stay for tea.

694
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,785
What are you doing?

695
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,916
I see your face is well recovered now,

696
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,501
so I'll trust you…

697
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,920
to keep true to your word.

698
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,405
Wait!

699
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,039
What?

700
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,958
Is there something else you want?

701
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,132
So-eun's my name.

702
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,303
Shin So-eun.

703
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,015
Will you remember that?

704
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,455
-Please don't!
-What's going on?

705
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,706
-Jil-geum!
-Move!

706
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,209
-Jil-geum! Oh, Jil-geum!
-Yeong-ji!

707
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,377
Jil-geum!

708
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,546
What's the meaning of this? Who are you?

709
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,797
Ji-un!

710
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,174
There must be a misunderstanding.

711
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,009
-Let me--
-Seize them! Now!

712
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,094
What the… What are you saying?

713
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,096
What is this?

714
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,431
-Take them!
-Jil-geum!

715
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,474
Yeong-ji!

716
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:37,725
Arrest them all!

717
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,102
-Ji-un!
-I deserve to know why you're doing this!

718
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,104
Why are you… Just let us go!

719
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,105
Jil-geum!

720
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,523
Stop resisting!

721
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,838
Jung Ji-un is my name,
Your Royal Highness.

722
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,279
There's no need to be alarmed.

723
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,699
Go right ahead.

724
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,117
It should fit your grip well.

725
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,204
Oh, is that so?

726
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,355
It's as I said.

727
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:11,736
I know you better than you know yourself,
Your Highness.

728
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,041
Your Royal Highness.

729
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,920
Your lecture starts soon,
you'd best leave.

730
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,423
Oh, is it time already?

731
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:35,843
Well then.

732
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,596
I'm afraid I have to get going.

733
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,141
A new lecturer is starting today so, uh…

734
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,727
I heard about the resignation
of your preceptor.

735
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,105
I'm a little concerned
about the frequent change in tutors.

736
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,356
You've had so many.

737
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,526
You haven't noticed it yet?

738
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,696
There's no talent within the royal court.

739
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,703
Well, anyway…

740
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,623
thank you for the present.

741
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,427
So tell me all about my new lecturer.

742
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,180
Well, all I heard is he's a young talent

743
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,766
who caught Lord Sangheon's attention
early on.

744
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,979
We shall see how long
this one will last in here.

745
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,819
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

746
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:57,174
I hear you come
with glorious recommendations.

747
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,218
I look forward to your, uh…

748
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,768
I will be your tutor starting from today.

749
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,937
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

750
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,608
Uh…

751
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:16,569
You…

752
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,183
Wouldn't this be a problem?

753
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,560
If he even suspects there's something--

754
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,853
That will never happen.

755
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:54,106
Nothing can be easier
than making a lecturer resign.

756
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,442
May I ask why?

757
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,902
Why do you wanna kick me out?

758
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:58,986
Samgaebang?

759
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,113
Those people mean
everything to me.

760
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,990
I will do anything to save them.

761
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,074
A wager?

762
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,993
Get the highest mark
on the upcoming exam

763
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:07,077
given by all the lecturers

764
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,662
-including myself.
-Why would I ever agree to that?

765
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,373
I might change my mind
if you offered up your life.

766
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,126
If I have to bet my life, I'll do it.
