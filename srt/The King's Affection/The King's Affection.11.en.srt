NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

2
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,196
Please stay healthy,
Your Royal Highness.

3
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,657
I hope you won't be lonely.

4
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,059
NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

5
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,109
Lord Jung!

6
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,288
Is it true that you're actually
leaving the Capital?

7
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,874
Yes.

8
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,251
I'm afraid it's the way it has to be.

9
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,461
How can you be this indifferent?

10
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,674
Even after I confess my love for you,

11
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,093
you're still just going to go.

12
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,762
Lady So-eun…

13
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,018
Please don't leave.

14
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,066
My feelings for you
have just started to grow.

15
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,695
And I only recently realized that.

16
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,407
So how can you decide
to just leave like this?

17
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,918
I apologize…

18
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,047
for not…

19
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,800
realizing how you felt.

20
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,316
It was a pleasure.

21
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,652
I truly cherished…

22
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,280
meeting you.

23
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,485
Are you sure?

24
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,861
Yes.

25
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,698
The farewell would have brought
anyone to tears.

26
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,450
Seems hard to believe, doesn't it?

27
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,078
A lady hoping to be Crown Princess

28
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,580
has given her heart away
to another man instead.

29
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:56,462
Hopefully, you're not going to
let this devastating bit of info

30
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,548
stay just between the two of us.

31
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,303
What? I don't think I follow.

32
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,973
His Majesty wants to join forces
with the Minister of Personnel

33
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,142
to regulate Lord Sangheon's authority.

34
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:13,521
Rumor has it that the Crown Prince has
already met with Minister Shin's daughter.

35
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,734
Stop. Hold on.

36
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,528
She's already been chosen
as the future Crown Princess?

37
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,071
You mean it?

38
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,200
Well, that all depends on you now.

39
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,875
Lord Sangheon wants the Minister of War's
daughter to be the Crown Princess.

40
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,837
This information would
surely grab his attention.

41
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,089
Don't you agree?

42
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,218
Yeah.

43
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,930
Are you saying

44
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,891
the Minister's daughter

45
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,894
harbors feelings for someone else already?

46
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,439
Yes, um, and just say the word and, well…

47
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,608
I'll notify the Queen Dowager right now,

48
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,568
but only if that's what you want.

49
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,613
I could even present her
with a witness if need be.

50
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,503
And what is it you want in return?

51
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,171
Sorry?

52
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,508
Uh, what do I want?

53
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,094
If this matter swings in my direction,

54
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:31,140
I will make sure to repay you
however you wish.

55
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,781
This is the future Queen
we're talking about.

56
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,408
A lady who

57
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,286
not only has feelings for another man,
but for the Prince's tutor, no less?

58
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,750
I believe you'd be wise to remove her
from consideration

59
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,796
to ensure this matter does not lead
to any other serious problems.

60
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,677
That cannot be the end of it.

61
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,892
As Your Highness implied just now,

62
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,813
the Minister made a mockery
of the royal family.

63
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,942
Our nation's most sacred event
was discredited.

64
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,362
I say that just taking her name
out of the process for consideration

65
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,405
is simply not enough.

66
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,615
But if she's removed from the list,

67
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,286
it would allow you to choose
whomever you want as Crown Princess.

68
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,079
What more could you possibly want?

69
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,749
The Minister of Personnel
put forth his daughter as a candidate

70
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,002
despite her transgression, and so,

71
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,713
he should also answer for his crime.

72
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,515
APPEAL TO THE KING

73
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,143
It was I who ignored
my daughter's pleading.

74
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,104
And despite her
expressing her wishes to me,

75
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,274
I entered her
for the Crown Princess selection.

76
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,359
If you're going to punish someone
in this case,

77
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,236
please punish this foolish father

78
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,699
for not realizing
where his daughter's heart truly lies.

79
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,954
How could any of this be your fault?

80
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,084
Greed blinded me,
and I lost a loyal subject as a result.

81
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,837
No, I am the only person

82
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,340
who deserves to be blamed.

83
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,135
I'll never be able to

84
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,763
seek forgiveness from His Royal Highness,

85
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,517
the other officials of the court,
and you, Your Majesty.

86
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,496
It was I who ignored
my daughter's pleading.

87
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,207
And despite her
expressing her wishes to me,

88
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,793
I entered her
for the Crown Princess selection.

89
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,836
If you're going to punish someone
in this case,

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,547
please punish this foolish father

91
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,092
for not realizing
where his daughter's heart truly lies.

92
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,804
Please, I'm begging you!

93
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,305
-Come on.
-I'm begging you.

94
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,473
Don't do this!

95
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,559
Please don't do this. I have to get home.

96
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,227
Lady So-eun is waiting for me!

97
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,145
Why you…

98
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,064
Stop screaming.

99
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,899
No one here can help anymore.

100
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,652
Your master has been demoted,

101
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,862
so who do you think
is going to save you now?

102
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,531
Now, move.

103
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,283
Go. Hurry up.

104
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,832
Whoa, now, imposing stance
whoever you are?

105
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,125
Now beat it.

106
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,172
Must you indulge in such indecent behavior
within the Capital, Uncle?

107
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,928
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

108
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,930
I thought you were busy
planning your wedding.

109
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,142
The length of your house arrest
doesn't seem to have been long enough.

110
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,436
If it's really what you want,

111
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,606
I could see to it that you never
go outside of your house again.

112
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,610
I rested well, all thanks to you.

113
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,530
Although I might have died
just for boredom.

114
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,825
That's not gonna happen ever again.

115
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,787
Because I'm also dangling
from the lifeline that's tied around you.

116
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,208
Are you the one who informed
the Queen Dowager about…

117
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,628
the Minister of Personnel's daughter?

118
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,548
It must have broken your poor heart

119
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,635
when you found out your tutor
had been involved

120
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,512
with the person you almost married.

121
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,306
Of course, who knows, huh?

122
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,725
They could be together
at this very moment.

123
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,394
And might I remind you…

124
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,689
…that this girl belonged to the family
who openly mocked yours.

125
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,024
That being said,

126
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:54,403
I think if I were you two,
I'd get out of here.

127
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,865
You see this girl and I have to attend
to some unfinished business.

128
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,700
Off we go.

129
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,793
Let go of her right now.

130
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,462
Disobey my orders

131
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,256
and you will endure
the full force of the law, Uncle.

132
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,426
Are you threatening a royal relative

133
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,097
in the name of defending this lowlife?

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,307
She is one of my people.

135
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,353
And you better believe,
I will not stand by and idly watch

136
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,023
as someone attempts to harm my people.

137
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,694
Right.

138
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,278
Of course.

139
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,365
Uh-huh.

140
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,169
Are you all right?

141
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,964
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,591
I was headed
to the minister's residence just now,

143
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,884
you can come with me.

144
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,308
That reminds me!

145
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,394
Just so you know…

146
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,859
Lord Sangheon promised me a reward
for gaining the leverage on Minister Shin

147
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,778
which resulted in his demotion.

148
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,281
We should go.

149
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,002
I heard you saved my maid.

150
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,006
Words cannot possibly convey my gratitude.

151
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,052
I heard you will soon be returning
to your hometown, is that true?

152
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,638
Forgive me, Your Highness.

153
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,308
I wronged you in the severest of ways

154
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,852
and should never be pardoned.

155
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,271
Don't say that.

156
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,441
One's heart is not simply an object.

157
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,818
It cannot be controlled at will.

158
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,865
That day,

159
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,871
I have to admit I was grateful
for the honesty you displayed.

160
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,791
I say that…

161
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,377
because I hid my own feelings
like a coward.

162
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,884
If it were not for these circumstances,

163
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,472
I think that there's
a good chance the two of us

164
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,933
could have been good friends.

165
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,602
Not that…

166
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,437
…a man and a woman

167
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,481
can have a real friendship, of course.

168
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,778
But still…

169
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,950
I wish for you a healthy
and peaceful life.

170
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,047
My father will be home soon.

171
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,261
Then would you please let your father know

172
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,887
I send him my best regards,

173
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,181
and that I await the day

174
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,100
we see each other again.

175
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,330
Huh?

176
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,133
Jan-i?

177
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,217
Jan-i!

178
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,719
Jan-i!

179
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,850
Jan-i!

180
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,863
Jan-i…

181
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,909
Jan-i…

182
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,911
No…

183
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,165
…with the person you almost married.

184
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,708
Of course, who knows, huh?

185
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,377
They could be together
at this very moment.

186
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,760
Jan-i!

187
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,234
EPISODE 11

188
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,684
Your Highness, what brings you here?

189
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,402
How dare you, you bastard?

190
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,028
What is the meaning of this?

191
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,780
Why am I furious?

192
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,907
Because a girl is dead.

193
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,451
I'm furious because
an innocent girl is dead!

194
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,620
She did nothing wrong.

195
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,330
So why did you kill her!

196
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,958
I'll tell you. Let me… Let me go.

197
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,758
Just because you're the Crown Prince

198
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,387
you don't have the right to go around
disrespecting your elders!

199
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,316
This time around,

200
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,696
I will not allow your disgusting behavior
to go unpunished.

201
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,322
Great.

202
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,082
I already told you everything.

203
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,544
It's true that I passed the house
at that hour,

204
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,629
but I did not kill anyone.

205
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,634
Who would be crazy enough
to kill a slave in broad daylight?

206
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,765
And seriously, why would I waste
my time and energy on a worthless life.

207
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,934
That's just preposterous.

208
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,605
Do you not agree, huh?

209
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,274
Then how do you explain
the scratches on your face

210
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,403
and this jade button
that was found with the victim's body?

211
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,030
Oh, this?

212
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,619
I already told you what happened.
That lowlife scratched me.

213
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,455
She is as feisty as her lady.

214
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,832
How dare that wench harm a royal relative.

215
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,876
Huh? Right here, huh?

216
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,002
You see this?

217
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,045
Huh?

218
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,632
She's the person who you should be
forcing to answer for her crime, not me!

219
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,509
We all die!

220
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,844
Talk about an unlucky day.

221
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,139
The young girl was stabbed to death

222
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,184
so have the coroner specify
a murder weapon.

223
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:28,482
The killer's residence should be
thoroughly searched as soon as possible.

224
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,785
And be sure that you give
a nice smile, okay?

225
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,370
You ready?

226
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,122
Give them to the doctor.

227
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,958
Get in line, people!

228
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,003
Our physician can't stand
when people cut in line!

229
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,257
I was wondering, are they here today?

230
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,008
The acupuncturist from Hanyang?

231
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,552
Yes, they are. They're here.

232
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,679
Oh, that's so great to hear.

233
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,682
Is it true that the physician
has almost godly powers?

234
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,475
Yes, that's right. Now, get in line!

235
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,061
-Please, get in line like everyone else.
-But the line is so long.

236
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,271
-Don't cut in line.
-Goodness.

237
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,689
I know. I know.

238
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,191
-Get in line.
-Just how long is this line?

239
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,526
Get behind me, woman.

240
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,530
Do you remember
what I told you not to eat?

241
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,285
What? About feet?

242
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,912
No, food. What food you should avoid?

243
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,206
You say food?

244
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,001
Yes, food. Meat. Sugary food.

245
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,127
You shouldn't eat those.

246
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,753
What about fish?

247
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,463
Come on.

248
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,966
No. No meat, okay? Hmm?

249
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,509
And no sugary food.

250
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,928
Ah, okay. Okay.

251
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,140
Oh.

252
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,604
All right, my dear.

253
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,648
He said I should eat
a lot of meat and sugary food.

254
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,400
No, that's…

255
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,443
Oh, dear.

256
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,696
Those are… Those are
what you shouldn't eat!

257
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,032
Let's see.

258
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,750
Can you wait here a second?

259
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,381
Brew this in warm water,

260
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,926
and then dab the itchy skin
with the solution.

261
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,803
Oh, and make sure he doesn't scratch.

262
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,847
When the itch gets unbearable…

263
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,146
Count to five like that, okay?

264
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,773
Okay.

265
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,566
Okay.

266
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,197
Thank you so much.

267
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,659
The pleasure is mine, huh?

268
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,494
Now, wait over there, okay?

269
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,495
Okay.

270
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,628
My lord, please.

271
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,505
You must get in line like the rest.

272
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:00,926
Oh, Hyun!

273
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,803
Jung Ji-un.

274
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,639
Boy, am I glad to see you?

275
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,059
I was wondering why I dreamed of a snake
crawling into the yard.

276
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,144
I was predicting a special visitor.

277
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,062
Come here.

278
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,481
Have a seat.

279
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,358
Here.

280
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,528
You can do it, right?

281
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,946
I trust you, hmm.

282
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,364
Next patient, please!

283
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,408
Whoa!

284
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,617
What…

285
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,744
What happened?

286
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,329
Well, let me just see.

287
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,081
What happened to your face?

288
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,000
-Oh.
-Where did this happen?

289
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,459
Here. Sit down.

290
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,046
Here.

291
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,673
Take one.

292
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,603
How did you even find this place?

293
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,023
I got lost while I was looking for it.

294
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,151
It was a huge hassle.

295
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,739
Will you stop with all the grumbling,
Lord Jaeun, huh?

296
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,200
I mean, you really do whine a lot
for someone who came here to lend a hand.

297
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,535
Lend a hand?

298
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,537
I only came by to see how you were.

299
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,914
If I had known it was this secluded,

300
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,750
I'd have asked you to meet somewhere else.

301
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,293
Well…

302
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,587
The flowers are pretty here.

303
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,631
Everyone leaves this place
a little rosier,

304
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,800
whether they have health issues or not.

305
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,763
It's not bad here, I guess.

306
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,681
No, it's great.

307
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,727
Clean water, fresh air, and good people.

308
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,189
If I'd known of this place,
I would have come sooner.

309
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,902
It's good to see
that you're doing so well here.

310
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,874
And the Crown Prince as well?

311
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,002
Everything's fine?

312
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,005
Don't worry about the palace.

313
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,842
Oh.

314
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,302
I almost forgot.

315
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,513
Your mother asked me to bring you this.

316
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,432
My mother?

317
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,270
Oh, what sort of weird thing does she…

318
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,068
What is it?

319
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,278
A clairvoyant bodhisattva
wrote it for you.

320
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,030
She said you'd know how to use it.

321
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,532
Oh, great.

322
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,535
The feigned bodhisattva
of Mount Cheongryong.

323
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,203
She fell for his tricks again.

324
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,667
Why don't you take it?

325
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,751
You see,

326
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,753
you have to carry it in your underwear.

327
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,296
Here. Let me help you attach it.

328
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,090
No way.

329
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,175
Come on. Don't be like that, Lord Jaeun.

330
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,262
A man engaged in state affairs
must stay healthy, wouldn't you agree?

331
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,390
-Ah!
-Get that away from me.

332
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,058
You! Argh! Come on!

333
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,351
Don't be like that.

334
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,146
Just let me put it
on your underwear, Lord Jaeun.

335
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,231
Get back here.

336
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,556
The flowers have bloomed beautifully.

337
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,526
I hope all went well on your trip
for the Ministry of Rites.

338
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,652
It did.

339
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,905
As it happens, I was near
Tutor Jung's clinic,

340
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,740
so I dropped by to see how he was doing.

341
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,703
Oh, I see.

342
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,711
He looked like he has been well.

343
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,007
Staying healthy and busy.

344
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,387
Glad to hear it.

345
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,936
Your Royal Highness, how have you been?

346
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,565
What do you mean by that?

347
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,151
I know how close you two had become.

348
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,779
I thought you might be lonely.

349
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,825
No, not at all.

350
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,639
NOKUNGAK

351
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,466
Wind chimes?

352
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,677
The sounds they make

353
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,640
take me back to a moment in life
that I truly miss.

354
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,476
A time when I had no worries

355
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,437
and could spend all day doing nothing.

356
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,231
That moment in my childhood.

357
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,276
That's where I'm taken to.

358
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,918
Don't they sound like this a little bit?

359
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,631
Those wind chimes you enjoy so much.

360
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,427
With that in mind,

361
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,263
how about we make
that lovely sound one more time.

362
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,974
Cheers!

363
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,381
The Ministry of War section chief

364
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,133
was found dead at the ministry office.

365
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,885
There was a murder in a government office

366
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,054
and not the slightest commotion?

367
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,932
Per Commander Yoon's orders I presume.

368
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:52,147
In other words, it is His Majesty
who wishes to keep it quiet.

369
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,942
Regarding that, some new information
has come to light.

370
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,904
Un-am who took his own life recently,

371
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,615
Hamgyong's newly deceased Governor Kwon,

372
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,117
and now the section chief.

373
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,870
They all gave the decisive statements

374
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,914
during Preceptor Kang's interrogation
ten years ago.

375
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,168
You mean someone killed those three

376
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,546
so they could avenge the preceptor
who died ten years ago?

377
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,672
My lord,

378
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,592
it would be in your best interest
to take precautions.

379
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,306
Look out! Step aside!

380
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,183
Make way.

381
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,232
Everybody, step aside.

382
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,443
Step aside.

383
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,391
What's going on?

384
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,644
An assassin, my lord.

385
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,062
Get Lord Sangheon out of here!

386
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,321
Explain yourself!

387
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,910
What brings you here?

388
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,788
A suspicious man
attacked the Left State Councilor.

389
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,748
There's no time to explain now.

390
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,126
Suspicious, eh?

391
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,005
But there's no one here.

392
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,890
I'm also curious

393
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,226
why you'd be out here
so late in the day, Commander.

394
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,565
I was patrolling outside
the palace walls just now.

395
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,776
Seems a little odd, doesn't it?

396
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,069
That you would decide

397
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,071
to go on patrol on this side of the gate.

398
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,617
If there's anyone suspicious,
I'll be the one to deal with them,

399
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,160
so you can be on your way.

400
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,344
Kim Ga-on, he managed to escape.

401
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,680
I see.

402
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,016
You did well.

403
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,310
I have to ask.

404
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,604
Do you still intend
to keep him in the palace?

405
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,773
It may endanger you as well.

406
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,568
Just keep your eyes on him.

407
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,237
Until I tell you something else.

408
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,530
I…

409
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,910
will not allow another soul
to be hurt like that.

410
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,126
You're staring, Uncle.

411
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,047
A nephew visiting his uncle
is not all that surprising.

412
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,300
Normally no.

413
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,387
But you are not one to come by
without a reason.

414
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,142
Let me see, huh?

415
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,854
His Highness put you up to this, huh?

416
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,818
You were ordered to find out
what happened to the girl named Jan-i.

417
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,905
I'm glad to find out that
you are not as dense as you used to be.

418
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,282
That being said,

419
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,660
why did you kill the maid?

420
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,205
Since Lord Sangheon
is looking out for you now,

421
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,833
there's no harm in telling me.

422
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,683
Do you really wanna know

423
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,101
why I killed that girl?

424
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,987
Because I was angry.

425
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,156
Rage swept over me.

426
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,074
I just couldn't take
seeing the Crown Prince

427
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,910
acting all righteously like that
about everything.

428
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,829
You know?

429
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,667
And besides, I never intended
to actually kill her.

430
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,629
If anything, she is the one to blame
for harming a royal relative.

431
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,063
Gosh, that's so bitter.

432
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,109
Hey! Bring me better food, now!

433
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,819
Oh, eat, huh?

434
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,945
Enjoy.

435
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,970
No!

436
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,532
Shh…

437
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,252
Oh, that's a relief.

438
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,221
Thank you…

439
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,766
for leading me right to it, Uncle.

440
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,666
That hurt!

441
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,460
Don't just stand there.

442
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,712
-Protect me.
-It's the Crown Prince.

443
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,130
Sheathe your swords.

444
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,971
Damn it!

445
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,556
Damn it!

446
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,267
Now that I have evidence,

447
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,814
I seriously doubt you can hide behind
my grandfather's protection any longer.

448
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,616
I will accept any punishment you choose

449
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,577
since I damaged
the Minister of Personnel's property.

450
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,414
Anyone guilty of murder will be sentenced
to execution by beheading.

451
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,792
The deceased girl
was also one of my people.

452
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,213
Therefore, your actions will be dealt
within accordance to the law.

453
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,256
Murder? Are you serious?

454
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,051
I mean you can't honestly
be telling me that…

455
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:04,555
that I, your uncle, should pay
for her life with my own life.

456
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,602
It is common knowledge

457
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,646
that some lives have more value
than other ones do!

458
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,939
Are you saying…

459
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,733
that you believe your life

460
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,527
is more important than the life
of the innocent girl you murdered?

461
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,365
Well, uh…
isn't-- isn't that fairly obvious?

462
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,574
I am of royal blood

463
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,328
and I'm the uncle to His Royal Highness.

464
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,704
Well then…

465
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,165
if you insist on following that logic,

466
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,084
since I'm the Crown Prince,

467
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,169
my life would be worth
much more than yours.

468
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,214
And yet, Uncle, you attempted
to harm me more than once.

469
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,467
Uh, I… I don't follow.

470
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,010
Once during my bath

471
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,679
and once at the royal hunting.

472
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,602
The girl had the audacity
to harm a man of royal blood.

473
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,021
She was as good as dead anyway!

474
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,734
If that much can be said about the girl,

475
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,071
then you should be killed
right here, right now.

476
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,909
No, wait.

477
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,079
And please don't say…

478
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,958
you can't grasp
the severity of the situation

479
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,128
and are naive enough to think
I wouldn't kill my uncle.

480
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,047
No, wait.

481
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,759
Why are you doing this to me?

482
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:27,972
Your Highness!

483
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,225
Please, Your Highness, have mercy on me.

484
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,436
I was wrong, all right? There. I…

485
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,272
If you wish to beg for your life,

486
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,358
you can go and do it in her presence,
not in mine.

487
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,612
Go to her grave and when you get there,

488
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,698
bow for her forgiveness.

489
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,912
If you do that much,
I will at least spare you your life…

490
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,624
before turning you over
to the State Tribunal.

491
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,462
Wait. Hold on.

492
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:04,842
Did you just order me to bow
to a simple slave girl's grave?

493
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,261
Why?

494
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,473
Is that something you cannot do?

495
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,058
Of course not.

496
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,809
I will heed your command.

497
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,353
Yes. I'll do it.

498
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,961
You had him kneel!

499
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,758
You had a royal relative kneel down
in front of a slave's grave.

500
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,262
What would possess you
to do something so rash?

501
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,308
Uncle abused his power as a royal relative

502
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,019
and took an innocent life in the process.

503
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,771
I believed he should at least

504
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,691
seek out forgiveness
and atone for what he did.

505
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,027
You know full well that
he has been this way for years now.

506
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,946
You shouldn't have gone so far.

507
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,241
As the Crown Prince, it is your duty
to uphold the code of morals.

508
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,493
What brought on this lack of judgment?

509
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,371
It was not a misjudgment.

510
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,752
The only thing I did was act dutifully.

511
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,049
I heeded Father's guidance
to always serve the people of our nation

512
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,510
and also Grandmother's guidance

513
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,971
regarding my duty
to defend our royal blood.

514
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,641
That is why

515
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,271
I do not feel
even the slightest bit of shame.

516
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,398
-Crown Prince!
-This matter

517
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,775
will be mine to sort out.

518
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,612
You are hereby dismissed.

519
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,449
You think that was a benevolent act?

520
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,702
You should have also kept in mind

521
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,206
that your actions could have provoked
other royal relatives

522
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,625
and the noble families as well.

523
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,420
Peace is only maintained in this nation

524
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,757
as long as the law that binds
our social class structure

525
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,925
is never disrupted.

526
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,594
One who is next in line for the throne

527
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,429
should not disrupt that order

528
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,307
especially not over
the petty life of some slave.

529
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,061
You think that girl's life was petty.

530
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,355
What I mean is that you were wrong,

531
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,567
and you should not have gotten involved
in the murder of a lowly girl.

532
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,280
There is no such thing as a petty life.

533
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:58,367
And not a single person deserves to die
for no reason.

534
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,287
And no one…

535
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,248
has the right to disregard another's life.

536
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,876
And I mean no one.

537
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,309
The Crown Prince did what?

538
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,893
You heard what I said.

539
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,395
Word has been traveling fast

540
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,106
all across the entire region
near the Capital.

541
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,233
The Crown Prince who made a mockery
out of his uncle.

542
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,654
Some are slandering him
for violating moral principles.

543
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,531
Only a noble would be angry, though.

544
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,742
People like us
could not be more delighted.

545
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,787
To be honest, I've never been
this fond of a ruler before.

546
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,915
Uh, wait, so then what happened?

547
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,501
Insulting a royal relative like that

548
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,879
must have gotten His Highness in trouble.

549
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,550
You never seem intrigued
when it comes to the Capital, you know,

550
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,844
but mention the Prince,
and your ears prick right up.

551
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,138
Well, I mean…

552
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,457
I hope you are well,

553
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,126
Your Highness.

554
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,300
Why are you outside right now
and not in bed sleeping?

555
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,020
Even when I am here,

556
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,232
all I do is think about you.

557
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,320
I'm worried for you…

558
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,824
and I miss you.

559
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,828
Says the man who chose to move out here.

560
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,206
To a town as secluded as this.

561
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,589
I wish to be by your side,

562
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,676
to take you in my arms,

563
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,887
to have long conversations with you,

564
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,224
and to be together with you.

565
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,052
Oh. Mm.

566
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,764
He-- Hello?

567
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,015
Hey. Hello?

568
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,158
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

569
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,014
Hello, Great Lord Changcheon.

570
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,646
You must have a good reason
for asking me up here.

571
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,856
There has to be a secret reason.

572
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,859
I was just hoping to go
on a hunt with you.

573
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,154
Hunting does not intrigue me at all.

574
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:10,160
Especially a hunting trip
accompanied by royal relatives.

575
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,996
Yes, of course.

576
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,791
Prince Jehyeon is the apple
of His Majesty's eye,

577
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,919
so there is no reason for you
to go out hunting.

578
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,880
What? Is there's something I should know?

579
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,677
Even game that's caught in a trap is…

580
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,555
not very easy to retrieve
for the cowardly predator.

581
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,515
What are you saying?

582
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,858
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

583
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,861
These are Lord Changun's final words,
Great Lord.

584
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,737
Are you…

585
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,830
The humiliation the Prince caused
was too much for him to take.

586
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,708
How could he have done this?

587
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,377
I doubt I'm the only one
who is devastated by his death.

588
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,963
Moral principles have been violated.

589
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,215
A man of nobility knelt before a slave.

590
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,760
He was humiliated by his own nephew

591
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,223
which drove him to deciding
to take his own life.

592
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,435
Members of the nobility

593
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,855
cannot allow this matter
to be swept aside.

594
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,317
Now…

595
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,194
I hear that your nephew

596
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,530
is the ritual manager
at the Royal Confucian Academy.

597
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,909
Confucian scholars
have always been the ones

598
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,036
to correct grave matters like this one.

599
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,958
So I'm asking you to please make sure
this reaches your nephew.

600
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,837
It will serve us greatly, my lord.

601
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,927
Lord Changun, whom the Crown Prince

602
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,054
commanded to disrupt the moral order,

603
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,223
lamented over his humiliation
and took his own life.

604
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,560
The Crown Prince is expected
to lead an exemplary life.

605
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:02,814
However, the entire nation is confused
and deeply unsettled by his decision.

606
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,441
I just cannot understand why he did…

607
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,443
His sinister act of humiliation

608
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,821
which led to his uncle's death
has pierced the heavens

609
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,365
and we are gravely worried

610
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:15,160
that its wrath will soon
be set loose on the people.

611
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,580
If what His Majesty wishes
is to set order to the nation,

612
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,999
and if he honors the Confucian law,

613
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,960
the wisest decision will be

614
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,088
to strip the Crown Prince of his title
and to depose him.

615
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,965
Please punish the Crown Prince

616
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,051
for shaking the foundation
of a Confucian order.

617
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,178
Punish the Crown Prince!

618
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,471
Who was it?

619
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,431
Pardon?

620
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,559
Who was it
that rallied the Confucian scholars?

621
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,146
It's hard to know that.

622
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,734
Let me just say I'm as disturbed
as you are by all of these--

623
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,654
Did you honestly believe
this would lead to Prince Jehyeon

624
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,073
being promoted
to Crown Prince that easily?

625
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,786
I am shocked by your accusation,
Your Majesty.

626
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,747
Please believe me
when I say I had no idea.

627
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,543
Your nephew's position
at the Royal Confucian Academy

628
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,752
is well known.

629
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,588
How long do you intend to stand there
and blatantly lie to me?

630
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,009
My nephew may be the ritual manager

631
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,095
but who am I
to stop the Confucian scholars

632
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,056
from leaving their posts
to raise their concerns

633
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,560
regarding the disobedient attack
on our class system?

634
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,075
What is the meaning of this?

635
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,830
You will see to it
that the scholars go away from the gate.

636
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,582
This minute!

637
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,666
How dare you--

638
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,334
Deploy the soldiers, Your Majesty.

639
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,504
Anyone dishonoring
the Crown Prince on palace grounds

640
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,507
must be found guilty of treason
immediately!

641
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,968
Whether it's treason or not,
that is my decision.

642
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,887
I will see to this matter personally,

643
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,764
so I advise you to stand down!

644
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,683
Apprehend those behind this strike
and put their heads on pike.

645
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,853
And if need be,
I'll deploy the soldiers myself.

646
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,191
Anyone who speaks of trying
to depose the Crown Prince

647
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,109
needs to be punished
by having their mouths

648
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,320
ripped open and tongues pulled out.

649
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,832
Explain this to me.

650
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,876
It's a declaration
for the Prince's dethronement.

651
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,628
So what are you doing with it?

652
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,630
It speaks for itself.

653
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,800
His Royal Highness acted hastily.

654
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,010
And it was a grave error.

655
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,763
Tell me, is this why you met with him?

656
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:40,972
With Lord Changcheon?

657
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,892
Why are you orchestrating such defiance?

658
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,227
I don't understand.

659
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,062
How could you do something
like this to the Prince?

660
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,440
When will you finally stop
taking the Prince's side in life?

661
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,859
It's time to face facts.

662
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,237
Your uncle is dead.

663
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,574
And it's all over for your Crown Prince.

664
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,578
Wait, brother.

665
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,708
The palace was home to our father

666
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,754
who was the true Crown Prince,

667
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,756
to me his eldest son,

668
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,217
you, and our mother.

669
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,511
I was supposed to inherit all of it.

670
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,179
Don't be this way.

671
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,307
Come on, brother, stop this. Stop this.

672
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,977
That's impossible at this point.

673
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,064
There's nothing I can do.

674
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,859
The scholars can't be stopped now.

675
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,497
Please dethrone the Crown Prince

676
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,207
and strip him of his title.

677
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,251
Dethrone the Crown Prince!

678
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,627
Severely punish the Crown Prince

679
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,921
for shaking the foundation
of the Confucian order.

680
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,464
My goodness.

681
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,258
How can they be so cruel?

682
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,509
Hmm.

683
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,679
…take responsibility
for the death of his own uncle.

684
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,890
He must take responsibility!

685
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,108
What if you decided
to just swallow your pride

686
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,194
and ask His Majesty's forgiveness?

687
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,905
You don't know how this ordeal
will turn out.

688
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,199
How could it possibly hurt?

689
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,166
Do you two also think that I went too far?

690
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,084
That's not it.

691
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,213
Until now, you were able
to hold yourself back.

692
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,506
What happened this time?

693
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,842
Well, I had planned to do that.

694
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,887
I suppose I could have.

695
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:48,099
But this time around, I did not want to.

696
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,855
Her life was taken away
because she was of low birth…

697
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,276
and I had to die
because I was born a girl.

698
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,489
How are we any different?

699
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,618
Your Highness…

700
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,746
If I had once more
turned a blind eye to this,

701
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,623
then for years…

702
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,416
No…

703
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,546
Until the end of my days, my life

704
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,091
would have been filled with nothing more

705
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,053
than meaningless attempts to stay alive.

706
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,266
What kind of life would that be
in that case?

707
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,644
That thought crossed my mind.

708
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,109
Pretending not to see and hear things

709
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,653
for the sake of keeping my place
in the palace,

710
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,198
what would be the meaning in doing so?

711
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,914
The scholars' reactions…

712
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,875
they show an ugly truth

713
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,254
that the code that our people live by

714
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,675
has not changed one bit since I was born.

715
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,512
You did well, Your Highness.

716
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,102
The Crown Princess Consort

717
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:18,898
would never have wanted your life
to turn out in such a way.

718
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,277
If she were alive now to hear your words

719
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,070
she would have said

720
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,865
that you were right.

721
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,951
That you made the right decision.

722
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,831
So please do not be hard on yourself.

723
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,084
Eunuch Hong and I will be right here.

724
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,130
Your Highness, you can count on us
to be here by your side.

725
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:55,018
JASEONDANG

726
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,509
Hyun.

727
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,391
I see you still haven't turned in
for the night.

728
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:41,648
I don't really know how anyone
could sleep with all that commotion?

729
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,071
I feel ashamed.

730
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:53,034
You always seem to catch me
in these embarrassing moments.

731
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,497
Listen, there's…

732
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,208
something I need to confess.

733
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:07,841
I met you for the first time
when I was 14 years old.

734
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:14,013
Your eyes were so deep
yet clear as the clearest of seas.

735
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,391
However, what filled them…

736
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,144
was a surprising level of caution.

737
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,940
How could I not recognize your eyes when…

738
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,234
you're like a brother to me?

739
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,280
Your face, your voice,

740
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,116
and even the way you walked

741
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,326
were all the same,

742
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,580
but you were not the young prince
I grew up with.

743
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,962
You knew?

744
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,758
You knew this entire time then?

745
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,387
I was incredibly confused at first.

746
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,264
And then…

747
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,516
I was afraid.

748
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,520
And when I met you once again,

749
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,940
I just wanted to protect you.

750
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:12,322
The child who practiced archery all night
despite the blisters on her hands.

751
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,824
The child who rose to her feet

752
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,160
even with a broken bone.

753
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,205
The child who was left alone

754
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,876
in a world that would bring her
only unimaginable suffering.

755
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,880
And so I swore then…

756
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,132
I'll protect that child.

757
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,344
Oh, Hyun, um…

758
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,693
If you are deposed,

759
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,738
the only thing waiting for you
will be death.

760
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,825
Even if you're lucky enough
not to be deposed,

761
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,996
tell me, how are you going to deal
with the many hardships ahead?

762
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,958
Up until now,

763
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,835
you may have been able to fool people
into believing you're a man.

764
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,046
It won't be as easy going forward.

765
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,632
I'm sure you're aware

766
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:17,554
that this revelation could likely
cost you your life.

767
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,768
What is it…

768
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:32,443
that you actually want to say
to me right now?

769
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:39,659
Do you remember how I once told you
that the sea awaits at the far end

770
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,328
of the path you once weren't able to take?

771
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:47,875
At this moment, there's a boat
with big sails docked there.

772
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,505
I'm saying you should leave on it.

773
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,217
And know that wherever you decide to go,

774
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,553
I will be by your side.

775
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,841
APPEAL TO THE KING

776
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,224
APPEAL TO THE KING
