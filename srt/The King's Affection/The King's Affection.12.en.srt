1
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,782
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,370
May I ask why you're leaving
without seeing His Royal Highness?

3
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,556
Please dethrone the Crown Prince!

4
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,474
Please dethrone the Crown Prince!

5
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,103
We beg you,
make the right decision for us all!

6
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,814
We beg of you, Your Majesty!

7
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,441
Please punish him
according to the law!

8
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,360
Please the Crown Prince!

9
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,197
Your Majesty,
I ask that you give us an answer.

10
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,909
We ask for your answer,
Your Majesty.

11
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,712
The Crown Prince…

12
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,715
shall be dethroned.

13
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:02,974
How is…

14
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,856
I ask His Majesty, the King,

15
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,317
to reconsider his chosen plan of action.

16
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,028
We ask that you reconsider!

17
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,280
We ask for you to reconsider!

18
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,158
We ask that you reconsider!

19
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,870
We ask that you reconsider!

20
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,212
This cannot be. No!

21
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,008
It cannot be.

22
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,306
This cannot be.

23
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,394
Please, Your Royal Highness.

24
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,315
This cannot be.

25
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,954
EPISODE 12

26
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,175
Did you decide to dethrone me,

27
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,470
because of what happened with my uncle?

28
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,515
No. Not that.

29
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,773
I came up…

30
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,610
to your quarters last night.

31
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,035
I know you're a woman.

32
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,205
And I have known for a while.

33
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,754
How did you find out?

34
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,861
You are… very special.

35
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,824
Don't forget that.

36
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,869
My beautiful…

37
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,288
daughter.

38
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,999
Mother.

39
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,544
Mother.

40
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,982
Announce it.

41
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,653
The Crown Prince
shall now enter.

42
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,535
Please protect…

43
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,246
the Prince…

44
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,792
our child.

45
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,144
It doesn't matter now.
Not anymore, at least.

46
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,273
And whatever has happened is fate.

47
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,573
Then why have you not…

48
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,368
said anything all this time?

49
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,998
Do you hate me for that?

50
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,425
I've thought

51
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,137
long and hard about
what this day might be like.

52
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,265
Always wondering what would happen

53
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,059
if you ever found out.

54
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,521
I was terrified.

55
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,199
As the nation's Crown Prince,
I had never resented you, Father.

56
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,243
No, but…

57
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,416
I did resent you quite a lot
as someone who…

58
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,630
was born in this palace.

59
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,258
Because I was a kid…

60
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,889
who wanted to be loved by her parents…

61
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,185
same as everyone else she saw.

62
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,245
There is something that I wish to ask you.

63
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,041
Just this…

64
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,755
If you could go back
to the day that I was born,

65
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,635
would you still make that same choice?

66
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,472
If not for the late King's order,

67
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,017
could things have turned out differently?

68
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,521
I want you to tell me that.

69
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,117
Leave the palace.

70
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,581
And live your own life.

71
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,297
But I…

72
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,386
have never had a life
that I could call my own.

73
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,357
If this is really what you want for me…

74
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,820
I will accept it.

75
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,157
Are you trying
to get yourself killed, huh?

76
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,327
You show up here after a month
and demand to see His Royal Highness.

77
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,496
Don't you know
no one dares to go near him?

78
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,086
He was dethroned! If you go see him,
you could go down with him!

79
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,879
Go. I don't care.

80
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,172
You reckless fool.

81
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,595
Over there. Isn't that His Highness?

82
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,357
Don't tell anyone
I let you into the palace.

83
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,858
Leave me out of this, okay?

84
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,546
Whoa!

85
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,674
YEON-SEON

86
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,092
Yeon-seon.

87
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,660
I was wrong.

88
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,624
I will never leave you alone again,
Your Highness.

89
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,211
Not ever.

90
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,196
What do you think you're doing?

91
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,156
You cannot be here.

92
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,450
You need to go right now.

93
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,957
Your Highness,
I'll stay by your side with you.

94
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,503
Nothing you say can stop me.

95
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,716
You got that?

96
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,972
I will always protect you, Your Highness.

97
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,536
Being back here is nice, you know.

98
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,124
The trees, the flowers…

99
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,919
The pond too. Just as I left them.

100
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,841
And yet…

101
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,554
the way the air smells here is not quite
as fresh as the air in Onyang.

102
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,650
Come back there with me.

103
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,199
We can sit together just like this

104
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,827
and admire all the beautiful flowers
that bloom each year.

105
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,039
We can stargaze at night.

106
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,835
And on rainy days,
listen to the droplets falling

107
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,004
in our yard together.

108
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,229
I'm afraid…

109
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,108
I can't do that.

110
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,865
There was this dream I had.

111
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,288
And in the dream,
I was in the distant future.

112
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,000
When I woke up,

113
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,962
my heart ached a bit.

114
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,049
My future has always

115
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,677
given me heartache.

116
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,931
A painful…

117
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,767
burdensome feeling.

118
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,437
Your Highness.

119
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,117
I really thought that you had changed.

120
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,413
But it's good to see
you're the same person.

121
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,082
I am so…

122
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,002
glad about that.

123
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,984
Royal Tutor Jung,
you ought to go on your path.

124
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,820
And I…

125
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,948
I must now go on mine.

126
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,673
I already told you before.

127
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,386
I don't care.
It doesn't matter what you do.

128
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,060
Your Royal Highness, I will stand by you.

129
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,618
And I…

130
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,500
I only want happiness and joy for you too.

131
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,169
Just as you…

132
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,965
hoped I'd be happy every day too.

133
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,259
I mean that.

134
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,933
Lead a good, happy life.

135
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,227
Tutor Jung…

136
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,440
that request is my last.

137
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,069
Go be happy. Please grant me that.

138
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,892
I am here, my lord.

139
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,112
So then, did you look
into the matter I asked you to?

140
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,533
I confirmed that Lord Changcheon's
soldiers were at Mount Odae.

141
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,173
The ledger confirms
that the military supplies

142
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,633
were relocated there.

143
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,097
"Even if you have the best sword,

144
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,394
it is dangerous for those
who do not know how to handle it."

145
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:20,315
It looks like the King let his greedy
get the better of him, then.

146
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,820
His Royal Highness

147
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,198
is departing for Ganghwa today?

148
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,334
As soon as I pass the message
along to you,

149
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,754
you need to make sure
His Royal Highness returns.

150
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,217
It won't take very long.
You have my word on that.

151
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,262
Yes, Great Lord.

152
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,158
What has life been like
outside the palace?

153
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,537
You're going to have to move into it soon.

154
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,873
You should get things ready gradually.

155
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,502
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

156
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,923
Do not apologize.

157
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,301
I just…

158
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,763
thought I should, to you.

159
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,607
How nice it feels
to have a cup of tea with you.

160
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,735
I have been scared
for nothing all this time.

161
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,989
I'd always tried to push you away.

162
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,783
And all because of how insecure I was.

163
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,956
Do not shed those tears.

164
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,751
You cannot be weak.

165
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,085
In the palace,

166
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,214
always be confident

167
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,091
and act with self-assurance.

168
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,682
I know you're going to do well.

169
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,811
Because you need to.

170
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,065
Gyeom, you're the…

171
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,319
only brother I have, after all.

172
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,754
GANGNYEONGJEON

173
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,831
Your Highness.

174
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,001
I'm afraid that we must leave now.

175
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,094
And so, I will leave the palace today.

176
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,555
May you…

177
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,393
continue to be healthy, my father.

178
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,988
Your Majesty,
this is Commander Yoon.

179
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,792
I have prepared everything
as you've ordered.

180
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,019
Take good care…

181
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,106
of my only child.

182
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,820
I kept the truth from you.

183
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,072
I'll give my life for your forgiveness.

184
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,081
Thank you…

185
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,669
for all this time that you…

186
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,630
kept my child's secret safe.

187
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,636
You should be careful as well.

188
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,866
GWANGHWAMUN

189
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,880
And now, I take your leave.

190
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,845
Please have a safe trip,
Your Royal Highness.

191
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,022
Do make sure
that His Royal Highness is safe.

192
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,575
Your Highness, be careful.
May you stay in good health.

193
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,709
I haven't seen Kim Ga-on,
the guard, for some time now.

194
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,295
You don't think
that he ran away alone, do you?

195
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,303
Stop worrying about such nonsense.
Just focus on serving His Highness, huh?

196
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,972
Where did he go?

197
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,188
Let's go.

198
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,177
The flowers
have bloomed beautifully.

199
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,275
Stubborn man never listens to anything.

200
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,526
Huh?

201
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,781
Take that down and bring it over here.

202
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,075
Yes.

203
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,672
Go stop them from chasing
after His Royal Highness

204
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,507
until I escort him to the safe house.

205
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,592
Understand?

206
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,233
Hold up, everyone.

207
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,902
We should rest after riding for so long.

208
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,154
This looks like a good area.

209
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,906
You think so?

210
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,498
I'll tell them to prepare
a spot over there.

211
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,708
Dismount and wait for a while.

212
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,051
Hold on.

213
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,888
I need your help.
Would you bring some water?

214
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,140
And you, a fresh set of clothes
for His Highness?

215
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,141
What?

216
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,643
Oh.

217
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,232
-Yes… Lord Jaeun.
-I guess… Of course, Lord Jaeun.

218
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,704
Soon, we'll arrive at a valley
where we can drink water.

219
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,248
We would all rest better there.

220
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,125
His Royal Highness is tired.

221
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,503
I will have someone
go fetch water for him.

222
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,130
We will rest here.

223
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,341
The terrain is rough,

224
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,718
and these woods are crawling with bandits.

225
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,139
So I suggest that you take my advice
and rest elsewhere.

226
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,516
I lead the procession.
You are not in charge.

227
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,936
I'm part of the royal family.

228
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,522
I would never put
His Royal Highness in danger.

229
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,082
I will be leading the procession tomorrow.

230
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,794
The Inspector won't stop me
as I'm a member of the royal family.

231
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,479
It is me, Commander Yoon.
Come with me, Your Highness.

232
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,648
His Majesty's order.

233
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,860
Protect His Royal Highness!

234
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,264
Hold on. What…

235
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,725
Tell us what is going on!

236
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,977
Something must have happened
to His Royal Highness!

237
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,437
Oh… Oh, no!

238
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,731
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

239
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,858
-His Highness is safe.
-Huh?

240
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,028
-But I… What are you saying?
-What are you telling us?

241
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,988
There's no time to explain.

242
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,782
I need you to come with me now.

243
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,284
But, wait…

244
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,494
What on earth…

245
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,704
-You must hurry.
-Yes, my lord.

246
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,082
What do we do?

247
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,459
What are you doing here?

248
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,559
Who is the man
that took His Royal Highness?

249
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,395
I don't know.

250
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,606
I do know that he is trying
to save His Highness.

251
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,582
Get out of here.
He must return to the palace at once!

252
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,169
What are you saying?

253
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,882
Get out of here immediately,

254
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,301
or else you'll get framed
for abducting him!

255
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,559
Someone reported suspicious men.

256
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,603
Keep watch there on the other side.

257
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,605
Yes. Let's go!

258
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,581
Please… change your clothes first.

259
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:44,006
His Majesty is behind this?
What is going on?

260
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:51,013
You told me once before
that you would sacrifice your life for me.

261
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,807
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,145
Now, you will owe your life
to the Crown Prince instead.

263
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,274
You will have to keep…

264
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,903
my child's secret to the end.

265
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,993
His Majesty wishes for you to have this.

266
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,850
By the time
you are reading this letter,

267
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,228
the palace will be in an uproar.

268
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,401
As I knew you would not want this,

269
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,821
I could not tell you in advance.

270
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,785
So even to the end, I am still a father

271
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,497
who's denied your wishes.

272
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,462
Leave the palace.

273
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,839
And live your own life.

274
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,382
But I…

275
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,347
I never had a life
that I could call my own.

276
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,268
I thought this would be better

277
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,145
than losing you forever.

278
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,024
As long as I can keep you safe,

279
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:11,278
I will gladly put up
with any resentment you have for me.

280
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,451
You want to appoint Prince Jehyeon
as the Crown Prince?

281
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,288
How much sway does the Queen have over you
that your judgment has been clouded so?

282
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,960
I was against appointing
you as the Crown Prince

283
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,169
for this very reason.

284
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,672
However,
I was wrong to worry about you.

285
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,675
You were much stronger than I thought.

286
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,111
Lord Changcheon will gain more power.

287
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,741
So, when the Crown Prince
becomes the King,

288
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,037
Lord Sangheon shall no longer
hold sway over him.

289
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,167
That is why it was more painful

290
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,794
and I was tormented even more.

291
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,923
And every day, seeing you

292
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,136
was the hardest thing for me
in this world.

293
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,139
If you could…

294
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,018
if you could go back
to the day that I was born,

295
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,898
would you still make that same choice?

296
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,734
If it not for the late King's order,

297
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,320
could things have turned out differently?

298
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,865
I want you to tell me that.

299
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,869
I regretted
my decision that day

300
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,497
for a very long time.

301
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,916
Therefore, I…

302
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,504
will never again repeat the same mistake.

303
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,215
YI HWI

304
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,174
Yi Hwi.

305
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,469
It was the name of your brother.

306
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,096
But for me,

307
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,390
it is now your name.

308
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,227
You were the Crown Prince of Joseon.

309
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,147
The Crown Prince shall be dethroned.

310
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,777
And you were
my only daughter.

311
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,106
I just want you to live.

312
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:23,155
And I hope to never hear from you again.

313
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,261
Have you been enjoying
the restful good night's sleep?

314
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,435
But since you've driven your son
into danger,

315
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,021
you must have been
too troubled to fall asleep.

316
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,577
You had to pay quite a price
in order to keep your son safe.

317
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,288
You had to abandon your daughter

318
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,083
in order to keep your son.

319
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,627
And that is why

320
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,547
I do not like you, Lord Sangheon.

321
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,719
You were the one who forced me
to make that decision.

322
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,436
So then, tell me,
what do you plan to do now?

323
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,441
Naturally, Prince Jehyeon will have
to take the Crown Prince's place.

324
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,403
How unfortunate.

325
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:49,283
How much you must miss
your glory days with the late King.

326
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,006
The wind blows cold tonight.

327
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,512
So I do hope you stay in good health.

328
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,634
You, go and search up on the hill.

329
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,843
Yes, Inspector.

330
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,194
We should part ways from here.

331
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,531
The soldiers know my face.

332
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,868
If I accompany you,
it will be more dangerous for you.

333
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,828
Are you sure you'll be all right?

334
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,496
There's no need to worry.

335
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,624
Just go on without me.
I will follow you soon after.

336
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,740
I knew it was you.

337
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,910
The woman you were with…

338
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,456
The Crown Prince must be disguised.

339
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,500
You all came here much too late.

340
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:31,004
I'm headed to the palace now.
He's already gone.

341
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,341
Go and look carefully
at all the women's faces.

342
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,843
If you come across anybody
that looks suspicious,

343
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,846
bring them here without delay, understand?

344
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,181
Yes!

345
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,600
He has already been dethroned.

346
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,687
You must allow him… to keep his life.

347
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,441
I'm doing this
to save His Royal Highness too.

348
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,682
Allow me to see your face.

349
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,232
Let me see your face clearly.

350
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,696
Let me see--

351
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,953
Darling, are you that upset?

352
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,621
You walked away so quickly.

353
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,875
I told you I wasn't looking
at other ladies, hmm?

354
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,588
Thank you for your service, but…

355
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,425
how dare you try to look
at my wife without my permission?

356
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,343
She is so stunning…

357
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,471
her beauty will blind you.

358
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,558
Well, no, you see. I…
I was not trying to see--

359
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,978
Ugh, leave them alone!
Why do you have to look at her face?

360
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,855
She's married. Stop bothering her.

361
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,107
-You need to hush up right now.
-Don't even think about it.

362
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,402
Okay. If everyone is ready,
we should get going.

363
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,031
As lovebirds,
we have a long way to go.

364
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,661
Be quiet! Let's go.

365
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,901
Tell me what happened.

366
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,362
I followed you all,

367
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,280
and I saw you leave with Commander Yoon.

368
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:11,122
I knew that you would wear
a disguise to get away.

369
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,043
But it looks great on you.

370
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,129
Well…

371
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,012
Hold on, why is no one with you?

372
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:28,640
Because…

373
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:36,231
we are not alone here.
Let's talk after we get off.

374
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:29,284
Your Highness, so the King was the one
who sent Commander Yoon to rescue you?

375
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:34,414
Yes. And my father had already arranged
somewhere for me to go.

376
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,378
That means…

377
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,798
you just need to get to that place
and finally be done.

378
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,932
You've lived at the palace
your entire life,

379
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,352
I wonder how you will survive
in this harsh world.

380
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,604
You leave me no choice.

381
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,482
I guess I will need to put you
into my care.

382
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,321
Wait. Are you looking down
on my medical practice?

383
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,076
Oh, you should have been there
when I was in Onyang.

384
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,870
People gave me potatoes, sweet potatoes,

385
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,581
many grains, and even meat
to pay for their treatments.

386
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,832
Yeah.

387
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,836
So I can assure you, Your Highness,
that I can satisfy even your picky taste.

388
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,682
Tutor Jung.

389
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,768
Yes?

390
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,562
I have been wanting to tell you something.

391
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,234
Tell me, then.

392
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,704
It was so hard keeping this from you
all this time, Ji-un.

393
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,794
Okay, then tell me.
Whatever it is, I can hear it.

394
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,712
You seem nervous, though.

395
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,594
Well, you see…

396
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,190
I am…

397
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:35,994
Over there! Get them!

398
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,579
Yes, sir!

399
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,624
Are you all right?

400
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,252
Yes, I'm all right.

401
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,839
I said he must be kept alive!

402
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,474
No! Hold on!

403
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,110
Hurry.

404
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,024
They are not here.

405
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:30,942
Let's go.

406
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,668
Your Highness. This looks bad.
I must treat it immediately.

407
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,797
I'm okay. If I could just…

408
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,633
Your Highness.

409
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,636
Your… Your Highness.

410
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,141
Please hang in there.

411
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:24,245
Don't move, I'll be right back.
I'll get your fever down with something.

412
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,337
Don't leave me here alone.

413
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,801
You'll be all right.

414
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,929
I'll be right back.

415
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,467
You must stay awake, Your Highness.

416
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,974
I'm grateful that…

417
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,353
you're with me through all this.

418
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,565
Please try not to talk.

419
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,195
It'll hurt more if you continue to speak.

420
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,791
I said that I had to tell you something.

421
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,795
Aren't you curious to know what it is?

422
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,808
The wound must be infected.
You should be examined.

423
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,404
I will…

424
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,619
I'll take it off myself.

425
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,740
Your Highness.

426
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,244
This is…

427
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,833
This is my secret.
