1
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,274
This is all
Prince Wonsan's doing!

2
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,528
I just wanted to confirm
His Majesty is actually a woman.

3
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,821
Really?

4
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,365
The truth you have discovered…

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,869
will be buried alongside you.

6
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,077
He is not here. Let's go.

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,286
Yes, Commander.

8
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,757
I have something
I have to tell you.

9
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,970
I am…

10
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,014
going to get married.

11
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,978
I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,357
And this is the only way I'm able to…

13
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,570
be sure I can make that happen.

14
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,330
Stop, don't you dare leave!

15
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,294
I didn't say…

16
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,964
that we were finished here.
You can't leave.

17
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,636
Stop now!

18
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,474
I am ordering you.

19
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,396
Forgive me,

20
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,191
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,191
I'll agree to get married.

22
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,861
I will do whatever you tell me to.

23
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,697
As long as

24
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,409
you keep His Majesty's secret in return.

25
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,412
No matter what happens…

26
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,167
you need to keep it.

27
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,845
EPISODE 18

28
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,188
Oh, my. How gorgeous!

29
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,567
Commander Jung's wife clearly
put a lot of thought into these gifts.

30
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,742
My lady.

31
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,874
Your Highness!

32
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,002
So-eun, hello.

33
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,219
You didn't have to bring anything.
Thank you, Your Highness.

34
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,388
I wish you the best.

35
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,933
And all the planning, how is it?

36
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,686
There are many things left to arrange.

37
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,272
And it still doesn't feel real. Not yet.

38
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,865
I hope you're not tiring yourself out.

39
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,908
Is there something the matter?

40
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,745
No, it's nothing.

41
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you upset because of that rumor?

42
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,002
About Lord Jung and His Majesty.

43
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,717
I heard it as well.

44
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,765
Don't worry about it, Your Highness.
You know that it is not true at all.

45
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,684
The rumor will be gone
after he and I are married.

46
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,187
Don't you think about it anymore.

47
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,240
As you instructed earlier,
I talked to the Ministry of Works

48
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,410
about renovations
at the Royal Confucian Academy.

49
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,622
We still have
some leftover rice bags from before.

50
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:17,418
And we have an excess of roof tiles.
Thus, the materials and workers…

51
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,962
I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.

52
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,632
And this is the only way I'm able to…

53
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,928
be sure I can make that happen.

54
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,264
So the renovations
can proceed, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,685
Oh, yes. And Scribe Jung of Seungjeongwon…

56
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,689
Ah. Scribe Jung. Come over here.

57
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,526
Ah. Join us.

58
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,030
Come here, now.

59
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,784
Scribe Jung, he has
some very good news, Your Majesty.

60
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,956
He will be
getting married soon, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,795
He must make preparations for the wedding

62
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,964
and so he will be very busy.

63
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,257
So would it be all right

64
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,718
if Scribe Kim brings you
the daily reports for the time being?

65
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,890
Yes. Sure.

66
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,520
Then we will take our leave, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,024
All right, let's go.

68
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,577
I'm still looking for the poisonous herb
we discussed previously.

69
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,329
When we are able to locate it,

70
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:40,126
we will be able to prove that
all the records from the Royal Secretariat

71
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,211
are entirely fabricated.

72
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,932
Your wedding plans,

73
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,019
how are they coming along?

74
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,065
Well…

75
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,527
That's good.

76
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,907
Thank you for your work.

77
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,825
You are now dismissed.

78
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,394
So were you able to find Lord Changun?

79
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,691
I wish to have a word with His Majesty
about the impending event.

80
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,487
I know. It's coming up soon.

81
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,200
And also, Scribe Jung's marriage
is happening soon too.

82
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,660
What do you think of that?

83
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,454
Marriage? He's getting married?

84
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,706
You haven't heard?

85
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,501
I thought that the two of you
were best friends.

86
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,921
Does His Majesty know?

87
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,563
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

88
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,273
It's nothing.

89
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,693
I really think
that's enough practice, don't you?

90
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,029
You could get hurt
if you're not careful, Majesty.

91
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,867
I said it's nothing.

92
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,869
Your Majesty.

93
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,746
I just need to have
at least this right now.

94
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,540
Let me, please.

95
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,830
Marriage?

96
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,207
What is this nonsense?

97
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,296
It's not nonsense, though.

98
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,675
A stupid rumor
has swayed you to act to drastically?

99
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,344
How could you make her care for you

100
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,055
when your feelings
are completely shallow and selfish?

101
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,313
Okay. You're right about me, all right?

102
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,650
These shallow feelings were all I had.

103
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,567
Okay?

104
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,694
What?

105
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,530
We never had a chance
to be together forever, anyway.

106
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,493
I had to do this.

107
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,245
Bastard!

108
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,046
Why… are you doing this?

109
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,178
You must have a good reason, I know.

110
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,897
There's a strange rumor circulating

111
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,024
at the courtesan house in the Capital.

112
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,529
A man resembling Lord Changun

113
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,448
has been claiming
His Majesty is part of a set of twins,

114
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,283
and may also be a woman.

115
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,508
I was told you wanted to see me, Lord.

116
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,552
Yes.

117
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,848
I called you here because
there was just something I had to ask.

118
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,946
Your Majesty,
your herbal tonic is ready.

119
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,240
You can enter.

120
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,203
Fortunately, Your Majesy,
the swelling will not persist.

121
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,002
Oh, your royal physician is here.

122
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,387
Eunuch Hong, what have you done?

123
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,265
F-forgive me. I don't know what happened.

124
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,351
-Check to see how badly he has been hurt.
-Yes.

125
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,520
-Court Lady Kim.
-Let me see.

126
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,897
No, wait, I'm fine.

127
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,316
-I told you I'm fine.
-My goodness.

128
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,819
-Hold on, stop it.
-Did it hurt you at all?

129
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,156
Oh, no.
Thankfully, it wasn't too hot. I'm--

130
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,617
Well, that's good. You may leave.

131
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,328
Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,830
I feel awful about this.

133
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,429
His Majesty
hurt his hand while training.

134
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,098
I was just there to examine it.

135
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,100
I see. And is he okay?

136
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,727
Yes. I also took his pulse,

137
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,354
and it seems strong.

138
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,482
That means he can share
his bed with the Queen.

139
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,484
Mm. I see.

140
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,530
Keep an eye on him.
Report everything, no matter how small.

141
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,865
Yes, my lord.

142
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,293
See. As we expected.

143
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,354
Busohwa.

144
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,547
Was it really necessary
to search everywhere just to find that?

145
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,966
Use your brain sometimes
and not just that body of yours.

146
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,384
I thought you were smart.

147
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,307
Did you look into the sonangcho?

148
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,145
Today, I have an appointment
at the pharmacy to buy

149
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,273
-so-nang-cho.
-Really?

150
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,525
What did I tell you?
I told you I could find it.

151
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,445
Are you sure, though? When? Where?

152
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,406
It'll be dangerous,
make sure that you go there with Eun-seo.

153
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,367
Eun-seo? Not here.

154
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,703
He is really busy.
He said His Majesty gave him a task.

155
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,622
He left for Pyeongan Province.

156
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,836
By the way,

157
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,006
you are about to get married,
and your face looks terrible.

158
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,008
How did you bust your lip?

159
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,426
You need to take care of yourself.

160
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,387
I know it was your father's idea,

161
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,639
you can still try
to show a little interest, you know.

162
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,104
Ji-un, the Inspector General's daughter

163
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,273
she has a kind heart
and also, she's a nice lady.

164
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,069
Ji-un. Ji-un.

165
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,782
And don't forget that
she also takes such good care of us.

166
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,538
I just thought that I would come over.

167
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,293
I did not know that you would be here.

168
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
We have received the wedding gifts.

169
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,516
It must have been difficult
to choose them.

170
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,979
And I heard that your mother
selected everything on her own.

171
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
Yes.

172
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,820
What happened to you?

173
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,449
Oh.

174
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,035
It's nothing.

175
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,427
Please use this.

176
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,941
Lord Jung, tell me.

177
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,529
Do you not want to get married?

178
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,867
It's just that…

179
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,460
I am sorry.

180
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,754
And…

181
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,256
I will try to do better.

182
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,469
It's just going to take a while.

183
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,833
So-eun will be marrying Jung Ji-un,

184
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,418
the first-born son of Commander Jung.

185
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,437
Your Highness.
You must prepare for the evening.

186
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,774
All right.

187
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,989
So, Your Highness.

188
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,205
I was summoned
by the Chief State Councilor, so I went.

189
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,417
And so then, what did he want?

190
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,297
Your Highness, please forgive me.

191
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,464
Yu-gong.

192
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,800
I couldn't help but tell him everything.

193
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,846
That you and His Majesty
use two sets of blankets.

194
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,097
What?

195
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,641
How could you disobey
my direct order like that?

196
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,061
I was terrified
when Lord Sangheon was questioning me.

197
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,421
Beginning tonight,
we will be sharing one blanket.

198
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,091
What are you saying?

199
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,427
There are awful rumors
going around the palace.

200
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,348
And if we are to put an end to these lies,

201
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,767
then this has to be done.

202
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,186
Those rumors…

203
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,565
they are nothing more than rumors.

204
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,653
I will tell them
to bring another set of blankets.

205
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,699
For a husband and a wife,
there cannot be two sets of blankets.

206
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,326
My Queen.

207
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,287
I don't know everything, but I think

208
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,706
I know what a Queen is meant to do.

209
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,584
She needs to be the mother of the state

210
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,544
and that means let her subject then become

211
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,755
like her very own children to look after.

212
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,510
But without having carried
or given birth to a child of my own,

213
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,888
how could I understand what being
a real mother even means and cherish them?

214
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,936
Producing an heir
so we can continue the royal lineage,

215
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,816
it's the reason I exist and
the Queen's most important responsibility.

216
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,697
Help me to fulfill my duty
as the Queen, I beg you, Your Majesty.

217
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,664
Please stop what you're doing.

218
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:35,210
I don't wanna hurt you
more than I already have, My Queen.

219
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,838
Why won't you embrace me?
Can't you just hold me?

220
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,011
Please, My Queen, you must stop.

221
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,388
You must.

222
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,307
Is the problem your preference?

223
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,434
Is it that you prefer
to love men, Your Majesty?

224
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,854
Or is it because your heart
already lies with another woman?

225
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,898
Please answer me.

226
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,152
Is it that you don't desire me?

227
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,529
Or is your behavior for another reason?

228
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,035
-No, it's not you.
-Well, then, if that's truly the case

229
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,829
why won't you allow us to sleep together?

230
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,665
I really need to know what's wrong.

231
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,385
I would rather you select another.

232
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,972
If this is something
I cannot fulfill…

233
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,310
choose a royal concubine

234
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,522
to produce an heir, please. You must.

235
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,543
Listen to me.

236
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,215
This has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

237
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,551
And I know…

238
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,099
how strange all of my actions look to you.

239
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,810
But soon

240
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,105
I will tell you everything.

241
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,942
I swear that I will explain exactly

242
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,278
how there was simply no other choice.

243
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,281
I promise you this.

244
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,618
I'll make sure you know.

245
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,954
I swear.

246
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,613
My father found out about…

247
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,075
His Majesty's secret.

248
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,871
What?

249
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,876
I would do anything
to protect this secret.

250
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,211
No matter the cost.

251
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,380
Hyun…

252
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,427
you must pretend to know nothing.

253
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,347
I beg you.

254
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,665
Sir, someone came to the pharmacy
asking about sonangcho.

255
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,050
Father.

256
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,760
Why are you here?

257
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,932
Sonangcho, is that the reason
you came here?

258
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,479
Did you also know the truth about

259
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,357
how the late King was poisoned?

260
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,443
What are you trying to do
by unearthing this now?

261
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,404
I will get to the bottom of his death.

262
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,073
If you reveal the truth
about all that's happened,

263
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,493
then you will also expose your own father.

264
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,665
If this is your crime then,

265
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,793
you must face the repercussions also.

266
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,343
Lord Sangheon
watches this pharmacy closely.

267
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,847
His eyes are always on it.

268
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,017
You mean…

269
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,604
we're being ambushed?

270
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,317
Jil…

271
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,027
Jil-geum is on his way.

272
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,742
It's too late for him, all right.
You better just let it go.

273
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,287
So he should… suffer again because of me?

274
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,334
When you hurt me,
I thought my life was done,

275
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,212
so friends were
the only things motivating me.

276
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,135
If it wasn't for them,
I would have been full of despair…

277
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,430
and ended it.

278
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,865
Excuse me,
but how much farther must we go?

279
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,492
Do you even have sonangcho?

280
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,202
We are almost there.

281
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,246
I cannot sell
such a rare herb out in the open.

282
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,249
Of course. Yes. It is quite rare.

283
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,628
By the way, why are you
looking for such a deadly herb?

284
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,837
Oh, well,

285
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,174
I have my reasons. You don't wanna know.

286
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,930
Oh! What is this?

287
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,351
He is the man looking for sonangcho.

288
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,524
If you wish to remain breathing,
I suggest you tell me the truth.

289
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,568
Why are you looking
for the herb sonangcho?

290
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,820
Well…

291
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,240
I heard it was a rare,
and I couldn't find it…

292
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,367
Spare me, please.

293
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,787
Now, you're going to tell me
who sent you here.

294
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,165
It was me.

295
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,626
Ji-un, help!

296
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,921
I sent him here.

297
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,813
Ji-un.

298
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,443
We should go, Jil-geum.

299
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,404
Get them!

300
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,306
Stop!

301
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,946
What brings you here tonight?

302
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,575
I will take care of this now.
You can step back.

303
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,828
Lord Sangheon ordered us to find the man

304
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,664
looking for sonangcho
and bring him back at any cost.

305
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,249
I said step back!

306
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,211
Do you understand?

307
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,092
I will report this to Lord Sangheon.

308
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,804
Stand down.

309
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,933
Ji-un.

310
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,250
You were not here this afternoon.
So I picked them out for you myself.

311
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,711
I wanted to thank you
for your offer to help out.

312
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,550
Well, of course I would.
You do not have to get me anything.

313
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,054
I heard that Lord Jung cherishes you
and your brother like his own siblings.

314
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,974
Could I consider
you two my siblings as well?

315
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,646
I really want to get along with you
and your brother like my own family.

316
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,191
Of course.

317
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,903
Yeong-ji! Yeong-ji!

318
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,238
Ji-un!

319
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,492
-What's wrong with him?
-He's bleeding. Get something!

320
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,202
Oh, no. Ji-un!

321
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,006
Ji-un, please wake up.

322
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,341
Ji-un, come on!

323
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,803
What happened here? How did he get hurt?

324
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,056
Well… I don't know.

325
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,571
Has the news
reached Lord Sangheon?

326
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:33,159
A number of people heard Lord Changun
discussing the twins while he was drunk,

327
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,370
that could easily spread.

328
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,750
And… I assume no one's found my uncle yet?

329
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,171
If Lord Sangheon can make my uncle talk,

330
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,590
it means that my life is in danger.

331
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,758
Go find my uncle first.

332
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,884
Yes.

333
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,724
Were you really behind this?

334
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,643
I want to know what it is you're plotting?

335
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,145
I told you to find my uncle, didn't I?

336
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,901
You must end this.

337
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,653
Our uncle is dead.

338
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,530
Are you certain?

339
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,824
Did you see who was responsible?

340
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,368
How could you have done something so evil?

341
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,620
I don't understand
why you're doing all of this.

342
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,873
You don't, huh?

343
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,876
It all makes sense.

344
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:30,883
I did always wonder
why you were so loyal to His Majesty.

345
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,889
Hyun, you always knew, didn't you?

346
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,268
That His Majesty was a woman.

347
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:49,235
Your heart has been leading you
down this road for too long, Hyun.

348
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,823
-Find him!
-Yes!

349
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,539
I didn't expect that Lord Sangheon
would be so quick to seek me out.

350
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,255
You cannot go like this.

351
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,467
Come with me to see His Majesty.

352
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,386
If you give up and ask for forgiveness,

353
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,098
I will look for a way
to keep you alive, brother.

354
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,185
It is too late. Now stand down.

355
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,026
Look at you. You'd betray
your own flesh and blood, brother.

356
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,778
And all because of this girl.

357
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,031
And what will be next,
after you meet Lord Sangheon?

358
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,365
I will take what is mine.

359
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,617
You can't, please!

360
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,538
A true King is not a woman, Hyun.

361
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,595
Escort him back.

362
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,925
Please have a seat, Lord Wonsan.

363
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,064
You faked Lord Changun's death

364
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,735
to dethrone His Royal Majesty
when he was Crown Prince?

365
00:35:55,444 --> 00:36:00,324
It seems that you still haven't let go
of your vain desires.

366
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,997
You've seen
the umbilical cord already and…

367
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,625
you think my desires are in vain?

368
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:15,047
You are the one harboring vain desires,
and still pressing onwards,

369
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,842
while knowing how poor your situation is.

370
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,929
The palace is quiet.

371
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:27,518
So you must not be aware that
His Majesty was attacked by assassins.

372
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,189
His coat string was ripped
during the attack.

373
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,525
And Commander Jung
was also present at the scene, I heard.

374
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,195
I wonder why he hid it from you.

375
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,575
You must be feeling quite anxious.

376
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:47,288
A young king is infatuated with a man
and refuses to sleep with the Queen.

377
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,666
I'm sure you're aware by now

378
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,753
that the recipient
of His Majesty's passion is a man.

379
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:59,342
Unless, for some reason,
you want to end your life tonight,

380
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,053
I don't think you will benefit

381
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,764
from provoking me by telling evil lies.

382
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,559
Do you remember?

383
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,603
Ten years ago,

384
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,148
shortly after
the royal preceptor was killed,

385
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,319
His Majesty acted almost like he was
a whole new person for quite a while.

386
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,864
Back then, we thought
it was he was just in shock.

387
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,450
But… think about it.

388
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,787
It wasn't even His Majesty anymore.

389
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,257
How dare you!

390
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,510
How dare you ridicule His Majesty

391
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,054
with such a violent, ridiculous claim?

392
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,098
For that I should
rip your tongue right out!

393
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,434
There's still
an opportunity to keep your power.

394
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,688
Listen. You can let me be of use to you.

395
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,734
What do you say?
Join forces with me, Lord.

396
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,863
Lock him away right now!

397
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,162
I will leave on my own.

398
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,051
Soon, there will be no choice

399
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,179
except for you to come over to my side.

400
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,611
What, are you saying that he knows?

401
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,990
My uncle was sent to attack you

402
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,367
on my older brother's order.

403
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:53,581
I believe that he plotted this
to find out if you are a woman.

404
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:59,211
He is on his way to tell
Lord Sangheon about it right now.

405
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,505
What will we do? Oh, dear!

406
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,090
Court Lady Kim! I'm right here.

407
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,303
Your Majesty.
What should we do?

408
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,850
We need to be the first ones to act.

409
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,812
What Lord Wonsan knows
is still only a speculation.

410
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,275
So my grandfather
won't be rushing to move just yet.

411
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,587
Have you had
a restful night's sleep?

412
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,090
Yes.

413
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,220
Chief State Councilor,

414
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,765
what brings you here
all the way to my quarters?

415
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,266
Last night,

416
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,605
foolish thoughts consumed me
and distracted me from my sleep.

417
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,566
I have been hearing talk

418
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,821
that things between
His Majesty and you are not well.

419
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,573
It is…

420
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,702
so much foolishness.

421
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,040
His Majesty cherishes me,
I assure you, my lord.

422
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,878
Soon, there will be good news I'm sure.

423
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,214
So please don't worry about it, my lord.

424
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,205
Ji-un.

425
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,793
You okay? Can you sit up?

426
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,880
What happened, huh? Where's Jil-geum?

427
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,798
You should worry about yourself.

428
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,759
Jil-geum is going to be fine.
Don't worry about him.

429
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,561
Lady So-eun
looked after you all night.

430
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,063
She actually just left.

431
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,597
Your Majesty, I…

432
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,060
miss you so much, Majesty.

433
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,815
So much.

434
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,534
I wanna be by your side always.

435
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,391
The sonangcho,
have you heard anything else?

436
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,102
Well, it seems
they are still looking for it.

437
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,857
I'm sure Physician Seo obtained
the herb and gave it to my grandfather.

438
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,278
We must go and capture him
and get him to confess.

439
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,446
But what if he does not
make a full confession?

440
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,158
You will only be making
Lord Sangheon more suspicious.

441
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,452
You're completely right, Your Majesty.

442
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,955
He has already begun
to have suspicions towards you,

443
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,874
and I think he's going to find out
about the truth soon.

444
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,961
Whatever we do, we need to hurry, Majesty.

445
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,549
Get Eun-seo and send him out right away.

446
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,762
Why did you not tell me
that His Majesty was attacked

447
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,514
by Lord Changun?

448
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,392
We were coming back
from Officer Yoon's grave.

449
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,605
And so, His Majesty
did not wish for it to be known.

450
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,190
You followed royal orders?

451
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:35,571
But then, when I tasked you
with bringing me Lord Changun,

452
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,907
why didn't you say anything then?

453
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,200
Forgive me.

454
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,371
I thought it would not be
too late to inform you

455
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,333
after I had confirmed it
and captured him first.

456
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,721
I see. You may leave now.

457
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,747
Commander Jung,
I need you to keep an eye on him.

458
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,041
Yes, my lord.

459
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,945
Your Majesty.

460
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,700
Eun-seo, where is he now?

461
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,619
He just arrived at Seonwonjeon,
the Royal Portrait Hall.

462
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,242
What brings you here
at this late hour?

463
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,875
Where were you going
at this time of night?

464
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,881
I just thought I'd go get some fresh air,
because I was feeling a bit lonely.

465
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,467
Well, then if you don't mind

466
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,552
I would like to have
a little chat with you.

467
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:08,682
I have many very interesting things
I wish to share.

468
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,897
Yes. That sounds quite nice.

469
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:19,109
Your uncle was presumed
to have killed himself,

470
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,695
but he is actually alive,

471
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,907
and he appeared
to make an attempt on your life.

472
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,035
But it turned out
he was not trying to kill you.

473
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,956
He was trying to confirm
if a ridiculous rumor was true.

474
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,338
What rumor is that?

475
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,591
That the King was born a twin in fact.

476
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:47,596
Also, that the King
shared the womb with a sister.

477
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,560
That, in and of itself,
would make things difficult

478
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,562
for you to keep the throne.

479
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,068
But he also claimed
the siblings had secretly been switched,

480
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:05,823
and that the girl twin now
sits on the throne as the King of Joseon.

481
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,831
How about that?

482
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,125
Come now, Your Majesty,
it's quite amusing.

483
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,635
Yes, it's amusing, but you know,

484
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,639
people from outside the palace say

485
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,768
that a flesh-eating monster
lives deep inside the palace.

486
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,772
When I was young,
I was afraid of meeting it face to face.

487
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,025
So I never left my chamber at night.

488
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,610
But after a while,

489
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,407
I realized those people
were actually telling stories of you.

490
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,742
Well…

491
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,579
it seems all these rumors

492
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,834
get thrown around
and absurdly exaggerated.

493
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,840
They can be.

494
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,428
But Your Majesty…

495
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,224
the rumor is not a completely untrue one.

496
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,812
It's true that when you were born,
you did have a twin sister.

497
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,525
And when I was informed
of what had happened,

498
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,486
I ordered her to be killed that night.

499
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,495
You had my twin sister killed?

500
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,205
Yes.

501
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:42,294
And the people who knew about
your sister they are all gone as well.

502
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,213
I made sure they were killed.

503
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,051
But why did you do that?

504
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,678
How could you take
such an utterly cruel action, my lord?

505
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,556
It was all done for you,
Your Majesty.

506
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,684
At the palace,
it is not like with the commoners.

507
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,313
Witnessing the birth of twins
is considered an omen here.

508
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,984
The late King who ascended
the throne after murdering his nephew

509
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:11,239
was more afraid than anyone else that
people were going to find out about them.

510
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,578
Therefore, I was
in an impossible situation.

511
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:23,168
I had two choices,
I could kill you and also your sister

512
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:28,131
or I could choose
to kill your sister alone and keep it…

513
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,634
my secret.

514
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:39,184
And why are you choosing this night
as your chance to tell me this?

515
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,605
If anyone else were ever
to find out about this,

516
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,608
I will see to it that they are all killed.

517
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,320
Rest assured, if anyone tries to hurt you

518
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,489
I will have them killed.

519
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,267
I truly do hope that…

520
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,730
you acknowledge
my loyalty to you, Your Majesty.

521
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,316
As long as you continue to do so,

522
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,110
I will…

523
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:36,742
have no regrets for what I've done.
They can call me a monster.

524
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,412
You must leave the palace now.
Go and gather your things.

525
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,455
You…

526
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,957
Your Majesty.

527
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,711
I can't go, Majesty.
You can't just make both of us go.

528
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,757
I will never leave you!
I'm going to stay right here by your side.

529
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,886
I understand, but it's too dangerous
for you to be here.

530
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:42,849
My grandfather will hold you both,
so he might get me to tell the truth.

531
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,352
But what about…

532
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,896
What will you do now?

533
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,608
I will reveal that my grandfather

534
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,152
ordered my father killed
and plotted treason.

535
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,154
I have the ledger from Yeoyeon,

536
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,074
and if I can find sonangcho
through Royal Physician Seo,

537
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,909
I know I can do it.

538
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,997
Everyone, the entire royal court
is under Lord Sangheon's thumb.

539
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,461
You were the one who said
that it isn't enough to bring him down.

540
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,508
After everything, I must try.

541
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,471
You will not stay away for long.

542
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,724
I will make this work. I don't care how.

543
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,059
I will get you back.

544
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,025
You need to be right here at my side when

545
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,820
I pass on the throne to Gyeom.

546
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,073
-No.
-Your Majesty.

547
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,040
Trust in me, okay?

548
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,917
I will…

549
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,503
I will not die.

550
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,549
You two know better than anyone…

551
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,636
all that I have endured to get here.

552
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,476
We've become
a hindrance to you, haven't we?

553
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,564
Forgive us, please.

554
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,377
I understand
you have the body of the girl.

555
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,465
Show me her body at once.

556
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,385
Do you not trust your man,
Jung Seok-jo anymore?

557
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,807
Ten years ago, shortly after
the royal preceptor was killed,

558
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,978
His Majesty acted almost like he was
a whole new person for quite a while.

559
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,065
Commoners play
with childish toys like this.

560
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,608
So why might you have it?

561
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,235
That's mine…

562
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,989
Crown Prince,
what is your opinion?

563
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,908
Is marriage what you desire?

564
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,078
Please be more considerate of them.

565
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,873
Could we wait a little to start
making our plans for this wedding?

566
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,917
What I mean
is that you were wrong,

567
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,212
and you should not have gotten involved
in the murder of a lowly girl.

568
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,880
You think that girl's life was petty?

569
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,466
There is no such thing as a petty life.

570
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:26,054
And not a single person
deserves to die for no reason.

571
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,027
Please take care of them, Hyun.

572
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,865
I will come back right away
as soon as they are safe.

573
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,454
Bok-dong.

574
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,166
Take good care
of Court Lady Kim, all right?

575
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,502
Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,296
I will take good care of her.

577
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,925
Do not worry yourselves.

578
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,554
Once this is over,
I'll come and get you right away.

579
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,681
Oh, you had better.

580
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,561
Even if the hour is later than midnight.

581
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:20,817
We will wait for you with the lanterns on.
You need to come to us.

582
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,366
Come on. Follow me.

583
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,767
I don't know
what His Majesty plans to do alone.

584
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,603
There's a place…

585
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,774
that we need to stop at.

586
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,797
It's very late.

587
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,424
Why would you come here?

588
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,595
We're here
because I've got something to say.

589
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:23,064
YEON-SEON

590
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:43,751
His Majesty he was
at one time a court maid in the palace.

591
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,256
And for a long while,
the King used the name…

592
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,593
Dam-i back then.

593
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,815
Commander Jung pursued
and killed the Prince, thinking he was

594
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,526
Dam-i, since he was wearing her clothes.

595
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,823
It was His Majesty's wish
that you'd never be told all this but…

596
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,867
I think that your father

597
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,412
is the greatest threat
to His Majesty at this moment.

598
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,542
So I'm asking you
to keep His Majesty safe.

599
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,462
Protect His Majesty,

600
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,882
I beg of you.

601
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,064
Lotus flowers
brought me to you,

602
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,483
so I thought that
the name would be fitting.

603
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,027
Yeon-seon.

604
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,531
She said to give these to you
if I ever met you.

605
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,032
LONGING, NOT

606
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,870
She told me they would help you
stay strong when things get hard

607
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,122
just like they had been helpful for her.

608
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,333
That court maid…

609
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,960
LIST OF COURT MAIDS

610
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,920
…in fact, she died.

611
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:14,300
That girl must have been
someone special to you.

612
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,219
She was my first love.

613
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,558
We were born twins.

614
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,812
Me and my brother,
the son of the Crown Prince.

615
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,107
After my brother died…

616
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,695
I suddenly had no choice
but to take his place.

617
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,950
I may not be able…

618
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,578
to tell you everything.

619
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:42,472
JWAJEON

620
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:35,024
YEON-SEON

621
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,493
Dam-i.

622
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,609
Is it you, Your Majesty?

623
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,573
Dam-i?

624
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,375
I think we
should break off our engagement.

625
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,420
One who covets
the crown must be coldhearted.

626
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,423
-I am sorry, Hyun.
-No! Jaeun!

627
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,260
Forgive me, I couldn't.

628
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,387
Is this the kind of life
you want to live?

629
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:14,851
No. Kill me instead!
He didn't do anything wrong!

630
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:20,022
The Crown Prince's twin sister
did not die that night.

631
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,067
I'm his twin sister.
