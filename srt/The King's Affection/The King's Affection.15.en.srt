1
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,024
Stop right now. I am…

2
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,193
No! Hold on!

3
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,073
If he so much as moves
his hand even one inch,

4
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,158
then I want him dead

5
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,993
and bring his head to me.

6
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,016
You're just getting home now?

7
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,434
Yes.

8
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,107
Would you…

9
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,026
care for a duel?

10
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,843
Well, this is a first.

11
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,930
We never had the chance
to enjoy drinks together.

12
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,810
Your swordsmanship has improved.

13
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,730
Have you been refining your skills?

14
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,648
While traveling in Ming.

15
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,068
Self-defense
was a necessary skill to learn.

16
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,374
I remember the day when you
first came to me wanting lessons.

17
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,462
You said you met someone
you wished to protect.

18
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,344
Was Dam-i her name?

19
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,640
Did you meet her when you returned?

20
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,144
No, they told me that…

21
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,979
she left

22
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,440
because of an illness and then died.

23
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,949
Unaware of that fact, I suspected you.

24
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,451
I thought her disappearance

25
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,412
was because of you and I thought it was…

26
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,873
all your fault.

27
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,667
No!

28
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,429
Do you still feel resentment for me?

29
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,140
Well, it would be a lie to say I don't.

30
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,226
But I…

31
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,064
I have been trying to understand better.

32
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,568
You thought it was the only way
to keep your family safe.

33
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,612
You made a choice.

34
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,906
But your choice…

35
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,784
still perplexes me.

36
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,795
EPISODE 15

37
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,888
Who are you, please?

38
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,059
Oh, dear.

39
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,811
Spare me, please.

40
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,230
I don't wanna die, please.

41
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,316
Please spare me.

42
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,779
So you've witnessed
my husband's last moments.

43
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,699
Someone murdered your husband.

44
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,285
So that's it then?

45
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,703
He was murdered?

46
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,913
Why were you so afraid of my presence?

47
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,977
I thought Lord Sangheon had sent you.

48
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,521
Before he passed away,

49
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,940
my husband put me in hiding here.

50
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,650
He also said

51
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,070
there was a chance that
Lord Sangheon would send someone.

52
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,117
Can you tell me about
his involvement with Lord Sangheon?

53
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,207
Ten years ago,

54
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,751
to save my life, he decided he would…

55
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,880
ask the Great Lord for help
for treating the illness I had,

56
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,298
and in return,

57
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,717
he was instructed to deliver a letter.

58
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,012
The man who received the letter…

59
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,641
…he was then beheaded.

60
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,601
For committing treason.

61
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,021
The Left State Councilor
has been holding that

62
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,816
against my family all this time.

63
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,777
You should just kill me.

64
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,446
This is all my fault.

65
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,909
Just to save my worthless life,
my husband…

66
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,453
Was the recipient of that letter

67
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,830
the Crown Prince's royal preceptor,

68
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,250
Kang Hwa-gil?

69
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,646
Listen.

70
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,439
Do not…

71
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,984
ever repeat what you told me

72
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,944
to anyone.

73
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,456
-I, uh…
-What's going on?

74
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,124
Oh, I'm…

75
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,168
I'm just taking a break.

76
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,754
Scribe Jung,

77
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,297
here's the schedule for this month.

78
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,591
Ah… Should be good.

79
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,886
Hold on. Hold on.

80
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,430
I have no duties for His Majesty at all?

81
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,850
But you were given exactly
what you asked for.

82
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,227
To not be in His Majesty's presence.

83
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,439
The Chief Royal Secretary saw to it
that your request was granted.

84
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,365
I am humbled, Chief Royal Secretary.

85
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,491
However,

86
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,703
burdening Scribe Kim with
all these extra chores just seems wrong.

87
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,664
I know that I requested it,

88
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,167
but the terrible guilt
is eating up my insides.

89
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,341
So I declare, Scribe Kim
will find these duties taken care of.

90
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,013
So I shall labor all day,
morning and through the night,

91
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,848
on the Diaries.

92
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,069
APPEAL TO THE KING

93
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,160
I've been waiting to hear that.

94
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,995
I mean it.

95
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,415
Had you taken any longer…

96
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,378
Actually…

97
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,340
I would have waited anyway.

98
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,175
As long as it took.

99
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,732
Why are you looking at me like that?

100
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,318
Just speak up already.

101
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,738
Can't help but think about Scribe Jung.

102
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,533
I guess with this job,
he's not been very busy

103
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,162
since he took the time
to light the path at the lanterns.

104
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,373
That's because the eunuchs assigned
to light the path

105
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,958
are not doing their task.

106
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,794
The path that I take is barely even lit.

107
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,254
There are more than enough lanterns

108
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,089
near the court conference hall.

109
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,177
But that's because Lord Sangheon
has been taking his walks there lately.

110
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,304
I have little authority, you know.

111
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,982
Scribe Jung,

112
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,442
you're here to see His Majesty?

113
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,652
Why are you surprised?

114
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,654
I am here to fulfill my duties.

115
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,532
After all, writing daily accounts
of His Majesty's life

116
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,785
and actions is exactly what a scribe does.

117
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,670
Did I do something wrong?

118
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,714
Please relax and be at ease.

119
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,216
Here, sit down. Go on.

120
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,092
As you were.

121
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,864
I'll go and deal with the eunuchs now,
Your Majesty.

122
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,204
I'll make sure they learn their lesson.

123
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,184
Did everything go well
with His Majesty, Your Highness?

124
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,103
You've hardly eaten since then.

125
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,190
Do you think I'm really that ugly?

126
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,733
What?

127
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,198
What did I do that was so wrong
and ruined everything?

128
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,619
Yu-gong, you should come and eat this.

129
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,582
I'd rather not raise any concern
by dismissing food.

130
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,921
Listen, I hear that His Majesty
and his grandfather, Lord Sangheon,

131
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
do not have a good relationship.

132
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,801
Rather than it being anything you did,

133
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,263
the King could instead wanna keep you
at arm's length because of it.

134
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,725
You know how much your father
and Lord Sangheon like to keep in contact.

135
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,310
So, it's not you.

136
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,812
You think that's all?

137
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,315
It's my father, not me, he doesn't like?

138
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,902
Forgive me, Your Highness.

139
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,905
I just did not want you to blame yourself.

140
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,950
That means that he could change his mind
if I do all the right things.

141
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,078
Yes?

142
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,497
Thank you, Yu-gong!

143
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,752
Who watches over this nation?

144
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,087
The Han Family or the Yi Family?

145
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,798
Dismiss Lord Sangheon from his position

146
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,719
for manipulating state affairs
and disregarding appeals from the King.

147
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,221
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

148
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,308
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

149
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,852
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

150
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,605
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

151
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,107
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!
-Get down!

152
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,027
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

153
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,363
-Come on.
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

154
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,033
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

155
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,536
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty!

156
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,790
I don't understand it.

157
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,335
But imprisoning them only seems
to be a temporary fix.

158
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,920
They just keep coming back.

159
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,382
I do not think they will give up
anytime soon.

160
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,134
So what should we do,
Chief State Councilor?

161
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,556
When a dog barks after seeing something,

162
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,686
other dogs follow despite
not seeing it for themselves.

163
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,023
The scholars outside
are just following another's lead.

164
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,485
Simply repeating the same words
over and over again.

165
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
And so…

166
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,031
it's really no bother.

167
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,492
Hmm.

168
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,831
However…

169
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,250
even feathers can sink a ship

170
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,252
if there are enough of them.

171
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
If the scholars outside
increased in numbers,

172
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,507
it could become a burden for you then.

173
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,176
That's what I actually worry about most.

174
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,014
That being said…

175
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,185
I suggest that we plan
to reinstate Lord Shin Yeong-su

176
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,312
back at the palace.

177
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,232
But he was sent to retire
in the countryside

178
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,400
and stripped of his rank.

179
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,862
I hear he now works
as one of the scholars' mentors.

180
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:15,159
You see, he's greatly admired
for bringing all his skills and knowledge.

181
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,287
So I'm sure he could help with this.

182
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,875
I won't say that you are wrong,

183
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,961
but he is no longer involved
in state affairs.

184
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,255
A man who's been forced to leave

185
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,176
won't have any interest
in coming back here, Your Majesty.

186
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,913
Yubungjawonbangrae bulyeokrakho.

187
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,958
Yubungjawonbangrae bulyeokrakho.

188
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,462
Inbujiibulon bulyeokgunjaho.

189
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,132
Inbujiibulon bulyeokgunjaho.

190
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,842
It says…

191
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,887
"Even when no one
acknowledges your choice,

192
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,182
if you're able to consistently stay
on the right and straight path,

193
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,602
you may consider yourself to be virtuous."

194
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,355
Have a good day.

195
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,898
Thank you, Master.

196
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,155
My lord!

197
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,574
You have a visitor from Hanyang.

198
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,368
-Hanyang, you said?
-Yes, my lord.

199
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,620
Look at that,
you've learned quite a lot.

200
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,373
-Yes. Well, keep up the good work.
-Yes.

201
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,502
Oh, look.

202
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,964
It certainly has been a while,
Master Yeosan, huh?

203
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,966
Oh.

204
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,467
Ah…

205
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,514
The weight of my sin
still remains heavy inside of me.

206
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,810
I don't think I could come back
to a position like that within the palace.

207
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,105
Hey. Can't you just say
something besides "No, Lord"?

208
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,482
And then you could help me save face, yes?

209
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,737
If I return to the palace empty-handed,
it won't be good for anybody, huh?

210
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,281
And also…

211
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,996
I've got a royal order right here
from His Majesty himself.

212
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,166
Then it was really sent
by the Chief State Councilor.

213
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,419
That's all I would say about this.

214
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,838
You can go tell
the State Councilor my answer.

215
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,175
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Just wait.

216
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,095
I've relayed the order
so now you can… refuse yourself.

217
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,847
Wait. Uh, hold on.

218
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,307
-You can't… Don't go!
-Bye!

219
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,433
Let's go!

220
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,796
BULBIBULMYEONG

221
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,313
If a boat filled with passengers

222
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,981
tilts to one side,

223
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
who would be the first
to fall into the water?

224
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,028
Those who will fall first

225
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,365
would be the people
who have no power or wealth to speak of.

226
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,616
That's why…

227
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,245
I stand here today asking you…

228
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,291
to keep the boat well-balanced and afloat.

229
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,181
BULBIBULMYEONG

230
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,891
Shin Yeong-su

231
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,395
is hereby appointed Head of the Office
of the Inspector General.

232
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,064
Do not take your responsibilities lightly.

233
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,067
Rectify any wrongdoings and ensure that

234
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,487
all officials seek the right path.

235
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,551
Your generosity humbles me, Your Majesty.

236
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,151
I did not believe
you would actually return.

237
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,737
Ignoring the summons from one's sovereign

238
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,156
would be an act of defiance.

239
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,198
Hmm.

240
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,493
What happened is now in the past,

241
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,164
so I hope we're able to get along,
Inspector General.

242
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,332
Yes.

243
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,717
This has not bode well.

244
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,802
The Inspector General

245
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,056
could surely get in the way
of your political endeavors.

246
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,642
I will see to it
he serves a purpose in the end.

247
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,479
I can utilize him to my advantage.

248
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,780
"Bulbibulmyeong."

249
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,200
The bird that stays grounded in silence.

250
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,203
I believe that it meant you?

251
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,001
So I take it that you received
the message I sent you.

252
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,755
Am I right in thinking this means
that my guess is correct?

253
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,465
It might be true.

254
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,092
HIS MAJESTY MEETS
WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

255
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,553
I must tell you, Your Majesty,

256
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,724
that I, in taking this role, do not intend

257
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,017
to be a pawn.

258
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,817
I cannot always stand by your side
blindly, or not be bought.

259
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,486
if you go down the wrong path,

260
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,156
I'll be the first to go
in the opposite direction.

261
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,034
Is that understood, Your Majesty?

262
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,495
Of course, I'm glad.

263
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,081
This is my goal,

264
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,459
and the reason I wanted you
to be reinstated here at the palace.

265
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,838
Not just to free the court
from the Chief State Councilor,

266
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,215
but to better its future too.

267

DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

268
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,695
This will prove the Minister of Taxation's
criminal conduct.

269
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,489
It will be the first matter
you investigate,

270
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,576
Inspector General Shin Yeong-su.

271
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,285
Scribe Jung.

272
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,078
What you have just heard--

273
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,455
Fear not, Your Majesty,

274
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,665
it's not in the book.

275
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,838
"Bulbibulmyeong."

276
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,342
They say there is a bird who

277
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,427
is silent and grounded for three years.

278
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,181
Then to make up for all that time
spent on the ground,

279
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,808
it soars up above the clouds.

280
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,352
And when it cries,

281
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,312
it sends shocks across the lands.

282
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,900
You have waited to achieve
something great.

283
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,610
I would like,

284
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,072
if Your Majesty would allow it,
to join you.

285
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,284
But this is my burden to bear…

286
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,287
and will absolutely entail risks.

287
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,497
Do you remember

288
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,706
in the woods?

289
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,545
Everything we talked
about that day together,

290
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,589
none of that is an option for us anymore.

291
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,467
So please…

292
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,680
allow me to at least in this way
be here with you.

293
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,903
We're in the same boat now,

294
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,281
so we're going to need to stick together.

295
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,163
Well then, I want you
to promise me something.

296
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,083
When I give you the order,

297
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,128
please just promise to stop that.

298
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,130
I order you as the King.

299
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,677
Then I will obey, Your Majesty.

300
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:46,813
Minister of Taxation Park Won-hyeong
unloaded rice meant for the army

301
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,398
in order to load his own cargo.

302
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,650
Head to Hamgil Province shipping docks

303
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,653
and raid the storage facility
used by his people.

304
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,739
That is where you'll find
the missing rice.

305
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,365
And the Minister of Taxation

306
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,700
-committed another crime.
-Find him!

307
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,661
He gave bribes to the crewmen
to deliberately destroy the ship.

308
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,163
He must be captured…

309
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,040
-We found him!
-…and brought to justice.

310
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,291
Understood?

311
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,668
Search every corner!

312
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,045
Yes, sir!

313
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,466
-What is happening?
-What is this? Who are you?

314
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,551
What are you doing?
What's going on?

315
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,512
Identify yourselves!

316
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,850
-We are with the Inspector General.
-What's that?

317
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,443
Minister Park,
you must come with us right now.

318
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,488
How can you dare!

319
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,743
You're trying to drag me
through the dirt, huh?

320
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,120
Making a scene this huge?

321
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,498
The rice that was meant for our soldiers

322
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,000
was discovered in the shed
that you personally own.

323
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,755
That's ridiculous. I know nothing.

324
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,762
Yes, but this right here says that you do.

utilizing the cargo ship
for your own personal use.

328
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,938
Well, well…

329
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,486
The people make clothes out of hay
to stay covered,

330
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,489
and because they'd otherwise starve,

331
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,200
strip the bark from the trees
to eat as their meals.

332
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,245
But the Minister of Taxation
steals from the nation

333
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,663
to feed his own stomach.

334
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,331
Your Majesty.

335
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,000
You have been using
the cargo ship for yourself.

336
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,086
And on top of that,

337
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,046
you hoarded the rice
that was meant for our soldiers.

338
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,506
I…

339
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,927
And I shall make sure that
you are beheaded for this too.

340
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,555
No. No, not that.

341
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,141
All I did was help Lord Sangheon.

342
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,685
I had no other intention, Your Majesty.

343
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,728
Oh…

344
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,897
So you were following
my grandfather's orders then?

345
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,233
Huh?

346
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,738
This is why one must never trust
another human being.

347
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,198
So with how much trust

348
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,118
that my grandfather has had in you,

349
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,455
he will be very disappointed
to hear that it was you

350
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,540
that said he was the one
in charge of this operation.

351
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,709
That, that…

352
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,502
That, that isn't what I meant.

353
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,504
It was me who did--

354
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,298
You'll take the fall instead?

355
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,767
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

356
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,615
Here's a choice for you.

357
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,327
If you follow my orders
and leave the palace,

358
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,955
then I will keep silent and not reveal
your betrayal to everyone.

359
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,044
You are probably very well aware of this,

360
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,671
but my grandfather is extremely ruthless.

361
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,841
Rather than receiving punishment from him,

362
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,344
you may want to take this deal.

363
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,721
Yes, Your Majesty, I'll obey.

364
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,139
I give my word.

365
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,433
May I please keep my life too?

366
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,519
I know you secretly…

367
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,105
move weapons to Hamgil
on the boat carrying the rice order.

368
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,106
Huh?

369
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,485
Name the guild that provides those weapons
to my grandfather.

370
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:24,197
If you do, I will keep my word to you.

371
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,542
My lord.

372
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,587
The Inspector General raided
the residence of Minister Park.

373
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,047
What's that?

374
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,592
Minister Park must have hoarded
the rice that was unloaded

375
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,885
to make room for the weapons.

376
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:50,056
Weapons ready to be shipped to Yeoyeon
tomorrow are in storage nearby.

377
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,141
If they manage to find it--

378
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,811
-Or we burn everything right away.
-What?

379
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,104
Was I not clear?

380
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,189
Yes, my lord. I will get it done.

381
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,041
Tell me…

382
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,628
what game do you think you are playing?

383
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,883
Minister Park's crime was uncovered
by the Inspector General.

384
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,968
By exploiting the authority from you,

385
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,304
he kept rice meant for our forces.

386
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,098
Don't tell me you have already forgotten

387
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,893
that I told you to do nothing?

388
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,561
No, I have not.

389
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,731
But how could I sit idly by in this case

390
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,150
when he tarnished your reputation
in such a way.

391
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,402
-And so I--
-Minister Park…

392
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,821
is one of my people.

393
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,658
Therefore, he should be left for me
to deal with.

394
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,871
Your Highness has no say in this matter.

395
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,339
Grandfather…

396
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,467
if word gets out about this,

397
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,552
the anger that just subsided

398
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,638
will challenge us again.

399
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,056
That won't happen

400
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,517
just as long as you were able
to shut your mouth.

401
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,479
Hear me.

402
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,565
Do not dare to challenge me.

403
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,529
I have excused your insubordination
for the last time.

404
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,478
APPEAL TO THE KING

405
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,487
We could pay with our lives
if we get caught.

406
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,658
Section Chief, you're the last person
I would have expected to be here.

407
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,078
A man takes responsibility.

408
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,330
But tell me,

409
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,792
why are these necessary when Minister Park
has already been arrested?

410
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,044
Shh. Shh.

411
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,629
We're running out of time here.

412
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,631
Please hurry. Hurry.

413
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,757
Give it here.

414
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,179
Identify yourselves!

415
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,646
What are you doing?

416
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,648
Uh, well…

417
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,907
The alcohol must be getting to me.

418
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,785
Uh, I think I'm seeing things.

419
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,705
Shh. He's drunk.

420
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,408
Park Won-hyeong,
Minister of Taxation,

421
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,621
has been siphoning rice meant for the army
and storing it for personal gain.

422
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,831
To cover up his crimes,

423
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,917
he purposely wrecked a fleet of ships.

424
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,961
His disrespect for state property

425
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,506
is being investigated
by the Inspector General.

426
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,510
The people are making clothes
out of hay to stay covered

427
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,429
and eating bark from trees
to appease their hunger,

428
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:02,683
which is why the Minister of Taxation's
selfish decision

429
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,810
to steal from the state

430
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,229
leaves misery in its wake.

431
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,232
All those who serve at the royal court

432
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:13,277
must request
that Minister Park be impeached.

433
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,321
Write this in the diary.

434
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,407
This morning Chief State Councilor

435
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,494
requested I dismiss
the Minister of Taxation…

436
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,162
permanently.

437
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,416
The 35th stratagem in The Art of War.

438
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,417
The yeonhwanji.

439
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,009
"Utilize several schemes at once
to achieve your goal."

440
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,054
It was most ingenious,
and I am grateful to you.

441
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,018
Nice words.

442
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,606
But instead of just flattery,
there's a wish I'd like granted.

443
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,275
A wish?

444
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,488
Oh. I'd like to hear this wish.

445
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,992
I would like… You see…

446
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,535
Well, okay.

447
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,955
Before I ask for my wish,

448
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,665
swear…

449
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,376
that you will not get angry.

450
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,044
Hmm.

451
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,880
What could this wish of yours be?

452
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,716
Okay then. Fine.

453
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,009
I will swear not to--

454
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,641
What…

455
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,561
What, what on earth are you doing?

456
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,021
You swore it though…

457
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,481
that you wouldn't get angry with me.

458
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,968
I'm back to it.

459
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,785
What is it this time?

460
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,121
Here's the Ministry of Rites report.

461
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,581
Take it to His Majesty.

462
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,126
Why are you giving this to me
when you could deliver it yourself?

463
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,213
His office is a few steps away, you know.

464
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,589
I'm quite busy these days.

465
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,467
I thank you.

466
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,844
Oh, yeah.

467
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,723
What's with him?
Did he do something to upset His Majesty?

468
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,460
So you know…

469
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,464
I won't…

470
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,718
be leaving the palace.

471
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,016
And I won't abandon my feelings.

472
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,686
Yes. I see.

473
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,481
Consider yourself understood.

474
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,535
Her Majesty the Queen
would like to speak to you both.

475
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,428
So you see…

476
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,140
I asked you here
so I could speak to you two

477
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,268
despite it being an inconvenience for you

478
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,647
because I know that you are
His Majesty's closest friends,

479
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,901
and you are also close friends yourselves.

480
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,115
And I really do hope this isn't awkward.

481
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,079
No, of course not.

482
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,250
We had the same mentor
when we were young boys, but now…

483
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,838
Yes, we've known each other
for quite some time.

484
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,096
But… why have you asked us here,
Your Highness?

485
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,307
Well, you see…

486
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,357
I wanna ease all His Majesty's worries
he has about the state.

487
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,987
And so can you

488
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,116
tell me what His Majesty likes
and finds particularly pleasing?

489
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,951
You'd be the ones who knows his taste.

490
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,705
Anything would be helpful.

491
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,874
I hope that you can tell me.

492
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,344
His Majesty has a sweet tooth so perhaps…

493
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,388
candy…

494
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,807
or, uh…

495
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,808
Or?

496
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,769
Persimmons or some peaches.

497
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,937
Peaches?

498
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,480
PEACHES

499
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,608
His Majesty is fond of flowers,

500
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,861
so he would prefer peach blossoms
to peaches…

501
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,615
and flowers from the persimmon trees,
not the actual fruit.

502
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,616
PERSIMMONS, PEACHES

503
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,787
His Majesty enjoys long walks
and exercise.

504
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,955
Rather than walks,

505
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,790
he loves to just sit peacefully,

506
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,293
listening to wind chimes
in the air, you see.

507
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,795
He likes to spend time on his own.

508
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,047
Time on his own.

509
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,800
All right. So then what's something
he doesn't like?

510
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,844
What?

511
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,769
He will not like others talking
behind his back

512
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,813
as we are now.

513
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,401
That is true. He will not take it lightly.

514
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,236
The fact that we talked
about all this already--

515
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,490
We urge you to keep this to yourself,
Your Highness.

516
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,033
Please.

517
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,120
Others talking behind his…

518
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,080
Oh.

519
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,839
It's no wonder you are such good friends.

520
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,341
Do not worry.

521
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,219
Please excuse me.

522
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,109
Be careful, Your Highness.

523
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,737
Let us carry it for you instead. Please.

524
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,827
What on earth is that walking bouquet?

525
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,209
Your Majesty!

526
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,920
Oh, what is all that?

527
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,143
Oh.

528
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,437
Oh, no. My goodness.

529
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,196
It's not even ripe.

530
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,990
My Queen, what…

531
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,117
What is all this here?

532
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,538
I just got you a few flowers
since I heard that you like them, Majesty.

533
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,040
That's a few of them?

534
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,502
Oh…

535
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:10,963
Oh.

536
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,340
I thank you.

537
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,389
I hear you also have a sweet tooth.

538
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,145
May this rejuvenate you
after working long hours.

539
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,855
Please…

540
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,566
enjoy excellent health always.

541
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,905
Oh…

542
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,074
Come join with me.

543
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,493
You can avenge the late King

544
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,119
and build the world

545
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,080
your father dreamed of.

546
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,018
I told you that's enough!

547
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,900
I also have failed to protect you.

548
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,655
What is it that upset you
this deeply, huh?

549
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,576
That even in your dreams,
you still are suffering.

550
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,201
THE LAST NIGHT OF THE YEAR

551
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,376
THE LAST NIGHT OF THE YEAR

552
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,348
I'd say your honest heart-to-heart

553
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,685
did not turn out as you may have thought.

554
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,071
Your Majesty,

555
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,114
Officer Yoon sent a message.

556
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,176
You are here?

557
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,561
I am the assassin who attacked you

558
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,521
at the royal hunting.

559
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,608
I needed to infiltrate the palace

560
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,027
so I could assassinate the former King.

561
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,364
All this time, I have deceived you.

562
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,827
And for that,
I will gladly accept any punishment.

563
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,416
I ran into him while tracking the evidence

564
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,501
related to your father's murder.

565
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,836
He saw…

566
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,256
the final moments of the late King.

567
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,140
You had already left the palace,

568
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,268
you could have buried the truth
and just stayed away.

569
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,605
And so what is your reason
for coming forward now?

570
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,111
The late King had…

571
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,781
shared a piece of this tally
with my father.

572
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,453
I wish to honor their legacy.

573
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,968
"The last night of the year."

574
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,095
He is Kang Eun-seo,

575
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,514
son of Preceptor Kang Hwa-gil.

576
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,434
His father was executed as a traitor

577
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,103
after being framed by Lord Sangheon.

578
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,945
GANGNYEONGJEON

579
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,618
What is it that you saw?

580
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,245
Tell me…

581
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,749
I need to know
who murdered my father that night.

582
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,470
I… I have committed a great sin. Please.

583
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,263
I beg for your forgiveness.

584
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,767
Just exactly how much
does His Majesty know?

585
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,560
Huh…

586
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:45,482
Does he know of the weapons
we are going to send to Yeoyeon?

587
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,069
I… Uh… I would never tell him that.

588
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,156
All he knows is that I've been
hoarding rice meant for the soldiers.

589
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,910
You must now go far away

590
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,038
from the palace until you hear otherwise.

591
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,707
Yes.

592
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,376
Oh. Oh, yes.

593
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,837
I'm humbled, Lord Sangheon.

594
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,505
Humbled by your benevolence.

595
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,728
He is aware of the affairs in Yeoyeon.

596
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,148
You must deal with him accordingly

597
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,692
so he cannot talk to anyone.

598
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,197
You… are sure that it's the only way?

599
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,541
It's true, he's made
only one simple mistake,

600
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,670
but now it will continue
to be much easier.

601
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,215
That's why I can never forgive

602
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,927
even a single mistake to begin with.

603
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,031
Commander Jung, what are you…

604
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,335
Come back here!

605
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,005
Commander Jung.

606
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,549
Commander Jung?

607
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,614
Father.

608
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,453
You're home, I see.

609
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,290
Yes, I see you're still awake.

610
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,459
The night air is refreshing.

611
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,963
Right.

612
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,008
Hold on, you don't seem well.

613
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,885
Is something troubling you?

614
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,054
I'm just tired.

615
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,985
My, he's so worn out by everything.

616
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,075
I will stay with His Majesty

617
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,870
so all of you may excuse yourselves.

618
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,580
Give him some peace and quiet.

619
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,041
Yes, Court Lady Kim.

620
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:58,944
Well…

621
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,238
I better get a blanket.

622
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,702
Your Majesty?

623
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,958
Your Majesty, where are you?

624
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,330
He looks so nice…

625
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,667
napping out here in the sunshine.

626
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,872
Your Majesty?

627
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,665
Ah…

628
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,796
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

629
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,382
I was just brushing
something off your face.

630
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,968
Are you injured?

631
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,344
No, no, I'm fine.

632
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,021
Ah.

633
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,482
Let's go.

634
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:09,277
Why don't we go share
a kettle of tea in our quarters?

635
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,946
That sounds great.

636
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,283
I actually came bearing fragrant tea
for you to enjoy.

637
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,285
I will request for it to be served.

638
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,196
What are you doing alone
behind the tree?

639
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,074
What are you up to?

640
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:57,909
Huh?

641
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:55,216
Was there a specific reason
the Queen was here?

642
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,095
Uh, she just visited.

643
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,016
Ah, I see.

644
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,439
You must have been very tired.

645
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,816
In the open, just dozing off.

646
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,526
Yes?

647
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,779
What I'm trying to say is,

648
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,032
you didn't even have a guard with you.

649
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,118
You know that the, the palace
can be very, very dangerous?

650
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,624
Sorry, Your Majesty.

651
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,296
So what?

652
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,883
Are you feeling
a little jealous right now?

653
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,677
No, of course not.

654
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,679
I only wanted to say it because you…

655
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,514
you could get hurt.

656
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,435
I was worried.

657
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,480
But you are jealous.

658
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,649
Okay, from now on,

659
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,442
whatever you say goes in the diary.

660
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,861
So you better choose your words carefully.

661
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:39,070
Your Majesty, the director
of the Office of Royal Decrees

662
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,363
has requested an audience.

663
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,949
Okay. Send him in.

664
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,931
Why does His Majesty want to see me here?

665
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,234
Your Majesty.

666
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:28,870
Oh…

667
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:31,998
What are you…

668
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,888
I rather not be teased by you,
Your Highness…

669
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,848
-Your Majesty.
-Tease you?

670
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,809
I'm serious.

671
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,436
Huh?

672
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,855
I remember you told me once.

673
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,399
That you would endure everything.

674
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,821
I will now do the same for you.

675
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,744
I'll bear the consequences of love.
