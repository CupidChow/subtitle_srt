1
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,478
Lord Sangheon,
has he been apprehended yet??

2
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,687
Not yet.

3
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,105
But they are searching everywhere.

4
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,482
They will.

5
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,152
Please do not worry.

6
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,530
Every soldier in Pyongan
and Hamgyong is looking.

7
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,782
We will find him soon.

8
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,869
And Yeoyeon? Anything?

9
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,081
Commander Jung will arrive
sometime tomorrow.

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,086
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,596
Hyun, what…
what brings you here at this hour?

12
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,681
I needed you to see this.

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,683
Here, Your Majesty, look.

14
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,524
This poem,

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,861
is it not the one that Lord Wonsan wrote
a long time ago?

16
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,987
Why bring this here?

17
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,826
The word he initially used
in the poem it means "moonlight."

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,911
"Manseongongjaewolmyeonggwi."

19
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,249
"So I come back to shore
with an empty boat filled with moonlight."

20
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,129
"Manseongongjaeamonggwi."

21
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,174
"Back to shore with an empty boat

22
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,467
filled with my dream."

23
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,847
I believe that it is treason
that my brother's plotting.

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,602
You must postpone
tomorrow's coronation immediately,

25
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,939
and then assemble the army, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,903
MY DREAM

27
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,280
Your Majesty, what brings you
and Jaeun this late?

28
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,574
Please listen very closely, all right?

29
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,535
Your coronation's being delayed.

30
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,580
I will set another date and let you know.

31
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:30,001
Until I do that, I want you to leave
the palace with Hyun for the time being.

32
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,044
What?

33
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,838
But why are you asking this of me?

34
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,131
There's no time to explain.

35
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,967
Now, come on, Hyun will fill you in
on everything, okay?

36
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,804
And please protect Gyeom with your life.

37
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,016
I'll go with you,
and I will keep you safe, my lord.

38
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,227
Why now?

39
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,438
Everything is all right.

40
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,565
No harm will come to you, okay?

41
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,235
You should both hurry. Go now.

42
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,530
You must get to safety, Your Majesty.

43
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,199
I have to make sure Gyeom
can get out of the palace.

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,575
You can't.

45
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,203
Those people will use me
to justify treason.

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,581
Gyeom being king means
that they will no longer have an excuse.

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,377
It's imperative that we ensure
Gyeom gets out unharmed tonight.

48
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,716
I cannot allow my grandfather
to take control of the royal court again.

49
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,430
Go to Gyeom, Eun-seo.
I will stall them here.

50
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,725
It is vital you help Hyun as quickly
as possible to get Gyeom out of here.

51
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,976
Do you understand?

52
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,227
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,279
Treason?

54
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,781
I cannot leave His Majesty
and just run away.

55
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,908
You have to stay alive, okay?
It's the only way.

56
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
The King will be able to stop this.

57
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,037
But…

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,663
Just follow me closely.

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,835
DAEHYEONJEON

60
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,233
That is a woman claiming to be the King.

61
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,027
Arrest her this instant!

62
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,822
You have all betrayed the state!

63
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,367
Arrest every man
that stands against me, now!

64
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,498
You will hand him over.

65
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,669
This is it? That dream of yours
in the poem, right?

66
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,089
I told you not to show your face again.

67
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,592
Do not blame me.
You brought this all upon yourself.

68
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,115
Hyun! No, please!

69
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,468
Hyun, please.

70
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,681
-Hyun!
-You can't!

71
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,651
Lord Wonsan, what do you think
you are doing?

72
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,946
Grandmother.

73
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,133
It is too dangerous for you to be outside.

74
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,636
The men will now handle this.

75
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,097
Please return inside, Grandmother.

76
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,976
Have you no decency?

77
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,729
Not only did you wield your sword
at your brother,

78
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,024
you are also committing
this heinous act of treason.

79
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,361
Did you think I would gladly let you

80
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,155
ascend to the throne
if you killed Prince Jehyeon?

81
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,534
I think you are opposing me,
because you are afraid.

82
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,038
You became the Queen a long time ago
by committing treason.

83
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,832
I'm the late King's eldest grandson.

84
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,584
And I…

85
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,170
carry his bloodline.

86
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,631
What are you doing?

87
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,342
Escort my grandmother inside.

88
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,472
And that is where she will stay
until everything has been settled by us.

89
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,312
Get your hands off me!
How dare you try to block my way?

90
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,524
Grandmother!

91
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,668
No!

92
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,178
No.

93
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,889
No.

94
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,436
No, this can't… How could you…

95
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,230
No…

96
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,442
This can't be.

97
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,326
Listen to me.

98
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,038
I'll never forgive you
for what you've done.

99
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,500
-Not in a thousand years.
-I do not expect you to…

100
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,210
Hyun.

101
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,942
Damn you!

102
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,223
Bok-dong!

103
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,974
Huh! Your Majesty.

104
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,579
I order you to bring me
the head of the King!

105
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,706
Yes!

106
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,963
Father.

107
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,977
I will stop them here.
Escort His Majesty to safety.

108
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,065
All the roads leading from Gwanghwamun
to Shinmumun are blocked.

109
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,236
Leaving the palace is impossible.
Go find somewhere safe.

110
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Your Majesty…

111
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,657
You must survive.

112
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,827
I have not yet forgiven you.

113
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,747
You must stay alive
and face your punishment.

114
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,199
I must help to stop them here.
Go on without me.

115
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,867
Scribe Jung.

116
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,328
Do not worry about me.
I'll be with you soon.

117
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,087
You must get inside.

118
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,964
We must go, now.

119
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,675
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

120
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,801
Your Majesty!

121
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,773
Hyun.

122
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,205
Your Majesty.

123
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,875
Gyeom.

124
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
How…

125
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,141
How could this…

126
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,439
Gyeom. You need to wake up.

127
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,192
Please wake up now.

128
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,404
No.

129
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,616
You cannot leave like this.

130
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,202
This is all my fault.

131
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:17,625
I should not have never brought you
into the palace. Never…

132
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,715
Please open your eyes.

133
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,137
Gyeom…

134
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,589
Lord Wonsan has been hurt.
I'm afraid he may not make it.

135
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,342
What? Is he still breathing?

136
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,261
Yes, he's still breathing,
but it looks bad.

137
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,517
It is vital that no one finds out
he is injured, understand?

138
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,362
You are badly injured.

139
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,197
I will stop them. You go.

140
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,199
There's one thing I need to do.

141
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,447
Kill him.

142
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,763
Father, forgive me, please.

143
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,309
Father, no, you can't die like this.
Please stay with me.

144
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,312
You need to try to keep your eyes open.

145
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,943
There is… something I must tell you.

146
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,157
I was never able to say it, but…

147
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,286
Do you know

148
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,041
what it is that I liked
the most about you?

149
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,297
You did not follow in my footsteps.

150
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,385
Please stop talking.

151
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,721
Your wounds are bad.

152
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,100
Your wounds…

153
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,106
I do not deserve your forgiveness.
Do you hear me?

154
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,947
Ji-un.

155
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:22,202
My… Ji-un.

156
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,456
Father.

157
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,797
It is your turn now.

158
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,301
I killed Prince Jehyeon like you wanted.

159
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,766
Oust that woman.

160
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,480
And put me… on the throne.

161
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,149
The wound is too deep.

162
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,860
Given the severity, I don't think…

163
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,447
Do what you can.

164
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,950
He needs to live at all costs.

165
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,427
Soldiers are already coming.

166
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,056
You will not be safe here now.
You must leave here, okay?

167
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,770
I will not simply from this fight.

168
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,063
Oh, no.

169
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
No.

170
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,402
You must leave.

171
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,834
My father is dead.

172
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,546
We won't be able to hold them back.

173
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,008
Go to Changdeokgung.

174
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,634
I'll try…

175
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,887
to break through Geonchunmun.

176
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,268
You must escape.

177
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,230
All that matters now…

178
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,318
is that you're able to keep you alive.

179
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,708
I will meet with my grandfather.

180
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,543
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

181
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,839
And I will tell him that I will hand over
the throne to Lord Wonsan.

182
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,424
No, Your Majesty. Not now.

183
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,094
You won't be safe here.
It's not the right time to act.

184
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,804
If I do not surrender, then…

185
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,350
my grandfather will come after all of us.

186
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,519
Your Majesty, tell us,
what are you going to do?

187
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,645
What now?

188
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,980
I will…

189
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,525
try to reason with my grandfather.

190
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,781
No. They came here to kill you,
it cannot be reasoned with.

191
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,699
You know you will never be safe.

192
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,701
Eunuch Hong is right.

193
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,079
You know what your grandfather is like.

194
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,999
He's never going to stop
trying to kill you.

195
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,086
Please, Your Majesty. I beg you.

196
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,421
I will not be able
to do anything right here.

197
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,757
And I won't let…

198
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,635
everyone die for me.

199
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,805
I can no longer…

200
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,350
just stand back and watch this.

201
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,186
I have to stop this right now.

202
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,191
Would you give us a moment?

203
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,071
I must talk to Scribe Jung alone.

204
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,928
I am sorry.

205
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,268
Please don't do this. Don't.

206
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,820
Do not worry.

207
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,989
Everything will be fine.

208
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,077
You haven't given me what you promised.

209
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:20,208
Do you remember what you told me that day?

210
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,337
You asked me what it was that I wanted.

211
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,467
I thought about it a lot,

212
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,470
and there is one thing.

213
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,558
What can I…

214
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,103
get for you?

215
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,357
A pin.

216
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,570
A pin for my hair is what I want.

217
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,324
No ribbons, just…

218
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,118
a beautiful hairpin.

219
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,124
If we can leave the palace
after all this is over,

220
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,336
that is what I want from you.

221
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,887
I do want to live.

222
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,681
And so…

223
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,977
I'll make sure I do that.

224
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,980
I will look for a way to get out of here.

225
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:29,444
Please order me
to keep you safe, Your Majesty.

226
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,487
I beg you.

227
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,500
You are my love.

228
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,881
Since we first met each other so long ago…

229
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,846
…not a moment has gone by
that I have not been in love with you.

230
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,369
I will give up the throne.

231
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,872
That is a wise decision.

232
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,540
Of course, you must.

233
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,420
I will do whatever it is you wish.

234
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,090
So let there be
no more needless sacrifices.

235
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,736
For hiding the fact that I am a woman

236
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,323
and for deceiving you
and the royal family,

237
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,534
I accept any punishment.

238
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,205
To be precise,

239
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,832
you are not entirely responsible.

240
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,001
Are you?

241
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,546
For taking the throne
and becoming the King.

242
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,887
The first mistake was committed by me.

243
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:08,144
I did make sure with my own eyes
that you had died.

244
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,523
And the second mistake

245
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:16,361
was made by my daughter
misguided by love as your mother.

246
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,239
One could say…

247
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,661
that you are only
an innocent victim in this.

248
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,540
Your fate was determined

249
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,003
by the people all around you,
regardless of your need or your desires.

250
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,594
But once you realized what had happened,
you should have been obedient.

251
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,600
And so, the last mistake
was committed by you.

252
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,731
And today, all of this madness

253
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,775
is entirely your fault.

254
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,320
So it is.

255
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,870
You may not understand,

256
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:12,542
but living this life has been very hard
and often frightening.

257
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,045
Because, you see, I had to live

258
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,424
someone else's life as if it were my own.

259
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,011
It's so very unfortunate.

260
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,055
Because the person who protected me

261
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,517
turned out to be you, my Grandfather.

262
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,899
I resented you
every single day of my life.

263
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,026
But…

264
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,696
I was grateful to you as well.

265
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,240
But you see,

266
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,577
I cherished you, Your Majesty.

267
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,122
If you were the grandson
you should've been,

268
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,708
it would have been wonderful.

269
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,913
This will be my last act
of kindness to you.

270
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,457
Really, must I die…

271
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,628
simply because of the fact
that I am a woman?

272
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,631
You were never actually born,
to begin with,

273
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,426
so there is no reason

274
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,805
to fear death of your own.

275
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,984
Will you accept one last cup of tea
served to you by your granddaughter?

276
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,573
This will be the last time
I get to relax and enjoy

277
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,868
a cup of good tea with you.

278
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,749
Come to think of it,

279
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,254
I actually feel glad
that I was born a girl.

280
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,468
If I had been born a boy
and become the King,

281
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,970
and you had stayed by my side

282
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,556
just like we're sitting here right now,

283
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,851
it would have been hard for us both, then.

284
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,521
Worlds that you and I envisioned…

285
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,483
were completely different.

286
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,325
Scribe Jung gave these
to me a long time ago.

287
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,412
He said they would ease anxiety

288
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,039
and help me be courageous.

289
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,645
Before my grandfather comes…

290
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,900
please brew tea with this

291
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,653
and then take it in to us.

292
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,198
This is…

293
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,454
Your Majesty.

294
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,957
What could you be thinking of doing?

295
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,795
I will not.

296
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:13,009
No. I cannot. I can't do this.

297
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,435
You have been like… a mother.

298
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,022
After my own mother passed away…

299
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,944
I've thought of you as my mother,
and I thank you.

300
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,656
Your Majesty.

301
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,869
I beg of you to please change your mind.

302
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,208
How can I stop you
from taking this terrible step?

303
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,504
I'm sure you know

304
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,257
that this is the only way
that we can put an end to this.

305
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,094
Won't you please help me?

306
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,972
I did not want…

307
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,643
insult you by lying to you.

308
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,981
Please understand my decision.

309
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,401
Help me.

310
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,922
Court Lady Kim!

311
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,510
Put her down.

312
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,184
Court Lady Kim, why would you do
this terrible thing?

313
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,478
Tell me. Why?

314
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,855
Let go of me.

315
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,401
I am going to follow after His Majesty.

316
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:59,490
No! I'm going to leave
this world with His Majesty!

317
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,744
What happened?

318
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,249
What on earth do you think
you're doing, huh?

319
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,419
Court Lady Kim!

320
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,398
Please protect His Majesty.

321
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,775
I beg of you.

322
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,905
Save His Majesty, please.

323
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,740
Please.

324
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,204
And so…

325
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,920
I am truly joyous

326
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,215
that we can die together.

327
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,303
The tea you just drank
has been laced with poison.

328
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,180
Sonangcho, isn't it?

329
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,642
The exact same poison that you used…

330
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,311
to kill my father.

331
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,817
Join me on the other side…

332
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,278
Grandfather.

333
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,909
Are you insane?

334
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,497
What have you done to me?

335
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,542
You disrespect me,
even at the last moment!

336
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:39,757
I have no regrets,
because of me dying, I'm giving you

337
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,969
the punishment you deserve.

338
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,615
I will not forgive you.

339
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,078
You will never be forgiven.

340
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,774
Your Majesty.

341
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,776
Your Majesty.

342
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,611
What have you done to yourself?

343
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,613
Please wake up.

344
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,535
Hey, someone help me now!

345
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,370
Your Majesty.

346
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,707
Your Majesty.

347
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,044
Your Majesty.

348
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,590
Your Majesty…

349
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,560
Your Majesty…

350
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,759
Can I say what a beautiful princess
you are, Your Highness?

351
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,389
Today is your wedding ceremony.
Are you going to be late again?

352
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,767
The groom has already entered
the palace a long while ago.

353
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,895
So soon?

354
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,689
It's time. Where is Bok-dong?

355
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,066
Your Highness!

356
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,322
His Royal Highness
has sent a present for you.

357
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,074
My brother sent that?

358
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,327
Yes. He is very grateful
to you for taking his place

359
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,954
at his last lecture.

360
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:20,584
You mean that you are still
switching places with His Royal Highness?

361
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,381
Well, I think that
something urgent came up, so…

362
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,301
Oh, we should go. He must be waiting.

363
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:33,472
Your Highness, be careful.
Please do not run so!

364
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,682
Your Highness!

365
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,442
Lord Jung!

366
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
Ah, our Princess.

367
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,394
What took you such a long time?

368
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,688
You kept me here waiting.

369
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,955
Yeon-seon.

370
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,628
I'm so thankful you'll marry me.

371
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,297
I swear to you…

372
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,634
I will make you happy.

373
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,723
Yeon-seon.

374
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,753
Can I ask you…

375
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,758
are we dreaming?

376
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,964
Lord Jung, where…

377
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,759
Lord Jung.

378
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,470
Please do not leave.

379
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,100
When are you coming back?

380
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,232
Bok-dong.

381
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,651
Court Lady Kim.

382
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:41,076
Where did everybody go? I'm all alone.

383
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,707
Do not leave me alone.

384
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,669
Do not leave me alone.

385
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,577
Don't leave me here, please.

386
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,706
Your Majesty.

387
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,210
Don't leave. Please come back.

388
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,677
I'm here now.

389
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,935
I promised you, didn't I?

390
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,271
We'd be together.

391
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,282
Your Majesty.

392
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,577
Your Majesty, are you awake?

393
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,955
Can you…

394
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,082
Can you see me?

395
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,714
Your Majesty.

396
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,717
Oh, my…

397
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,344
How did I…

398
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,729
You're still alive.

399
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,232
Thank you.

400
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,610
Thank you for staying alive, Your Majesty.

401
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,245
We were so worried.
Are you feeling all right?

402
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,875
I will go and bring some warm water.

403
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,270
What happened? Tell me.

404
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,566
Is he…

405
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,112
Lord Sangheon has…

406
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,492
He has passed away.

407
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,876
It's over now, Your Majesty. It's done.

408
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,004
Everything.

409
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,089
You see?

410
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,344
No more for you to worry about.

411
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,820
Take him outside the palace.

412
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,823
There will be no funeral.

413
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,950
And he will not…

414
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,786
receive a burial.

415
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,746
Yes, Your Highness.

416
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,854
I have not informed

417
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,983
the officials of your recovery
and that you are awake.

418
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,614
Now that your secret
has been revealed to all,

419
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,117
as soon as they find out
that you are awake, you must…

420
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,454
face your punishment.

421
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,125
And so, I will tell them you died.

422
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,298
I will say that you never regained
consciousness since that day.

423
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,301
Go to a place where no one knows you.

424
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,597
And just pretend none of this was real.

425
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,767
This is the last act of kindness

426
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,228
I'll be able to show to you.

427
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,816
I cannot do that.

428
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,279
Secrets like this are impossible to keep.

429
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,532
If this secret were to come out one day,

430
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:16,244
it would lead to more spilled blood here.
I can promise that to you.

431
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:21,333
If that comes out, you and Lord Jaeun
will be on the throne,

432
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,879
and everyone who helped me hide
will be in danger.

433
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,714
So you must live in hiding.

434
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,386
If you live a quiet life,
nothing will happen.

435
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,637
That is how…

436
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,431
I have lived so far.

437
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,728
I was alive. And yet, I was not.

438
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,107
That was my whole life.

439
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,402
I no longer wish

440
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,489
to go on with life, pretending
to be someone else.

441
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,955
And far too many lives
have already been lost due to my actions.

442
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,583
I know I will not be able to lie anymore.

443
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,547
If I must be punished,

444
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,134
well, then I must accept it.

445
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,179
Your Majesty.

446
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,434
"Ascending to the throne

447
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,728
while lying about her gender

448
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,188
is an act that has made a mockery

449
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,859
of the royal court and the people
of this nation.

450
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,112
This is a serious offense
that will weaken…"

451
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,238
ROYAL ORDER

452
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,699
"…our nation's very foundation."

453
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,873
I am ready to accept
any punishment you give.

454
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,421
Your Majesty.

455
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,299
I apologize for intervening.

456
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:57,596
I would just like to say this one thing
to His Majesty before this court.

457
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,560
Neo-Confucianism states that men
and women have different duties,

458
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,228
accordingly,

459
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,731
what she has done
is indeed a very serious offense.

460
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,277
However, the preceding king did not intend

461
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,446
to become the Prince years ago

462
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,825
and was forced to switch roles
with the preceding young prince.

463
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,454
Upon ascending to the throne,

464
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,831
she acted as a true king
and set out to rule.

465
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,126
She ruled the kingdom with care
for all her people

466
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,670
unlike anything seen before
in our history.

467
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,339
It is therefore unjust

468
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:37,344
for her to be harshly punished,
Your Majesty, based only on ideology.

469
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:42,099
The preceding king did not make
a mockery of the people.

470
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,520
The people were mocked and disrespected
by a group of corrupt rebels

471
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,731
who, instead of serving our king,
were chasing power.

472
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,110
I ask that the first
to be punished

473
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,321
should be all those
who had turned a blind eye

474
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,658
to these acts of deception and corruption

475
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,829
and not the preceding king, Majesty.

476
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,969
Please forgive me
for intervening.

477
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,056
I served as her teacher

478
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,559
when she was the Crown Prince.

479
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,020
And during her reign,
as her Chief Royal Secretary,

480
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,897
I stood by her side.

481
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,694
I wish to share the punishment.

482
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:46,246
I share as her teacher and subject.

483
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,044
We beg of you humbly, Your Majesty!

484
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,963
We beg of you humbly, Your Majesty!

485
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,217
We beg of you humbly, Your Majesty!

486
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,762
We beg of you humbly, Your Majesty!

487
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,724
We beg of you humbly, Your Majesty!

488
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:10,270
We beg of you humbly, Your Majesty!

489
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,194
This is a serious offense,

490
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,155
and yet, the truth is more complex.

491
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,410
You are right.

492
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,122
And it shall be taken into consideration.

493
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:35,670
Please sentence Yi Hwi
to paenghyeong, Your Highness.

494
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,173
And what would that mean?

495
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,301
Yi Hwi never existed, to begin with.

496
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,554
Because the prince died a long time ago.

497
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,349
Sentence Yi Hwi to paenghyeong

498
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,851
and remove all records of his life.

499
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,063
And restore the identity

500
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,318
of the dead court maid, Dam-i,
so she may lead a new life.

501
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,905
I beg of you.

502
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:06,493
Yi Hwi who lied about her gender
and then ascended to take

503
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,161
the royal throne…

504
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,251
Paenghyeong is your sentence.

505
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,800
Thank you
for your boundless generosity.

506
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,654
And so, Dam-i, the twin sister

507
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,783
who was abandoned
just because she was born a girl,

508
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,496
will return to live a new life of her own.

509
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,865
This story took place a long time ago

510
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,701
in the mighty palace, so listen carefully.

511
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,162
A beautiful, porcelain-skinned woman,

512
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,291
who was as powerful as steel,
took hold of the throne.

513
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,253
She was totally fearless, and she exposed
all of the palace's corrupt officials.

514
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,006
And then just like dew…

515
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,009
Did she disappear like the dew?

516
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,138
Then what, huh? Then what happened?

517
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,390
Like the dew,

518
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:56,770
the water in the cauldron was pure,
and she was suddenly immersed in it.

519
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,440
She faced Paenghyeong,
then she lived her life anew.

520
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,318
Paenghyeong? But what is that?

521
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:06,404
It's a punishment,
you're put in boiling hot water.

522
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,615
When you emerged,
it's like you don't exist.

523
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,868
Your entire existence
disappears magically.

524
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,411
Boiling water?

525
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,664
-She went into the boiling water?
-Of course, she didn't.

526
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,750
That's just how the story goes, you know?

527
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,855
Hello! Going to the palace now,
Commander Kang?

528
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,526
Now…

529
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,195
Here, before you go.

530
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,782
You have to guard His Majesty all day.
You can't do that hungry.

531
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,326
Thank you.

532
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,670
Right. Take this.

533
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,465
What is this?

534
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,093
It's for when you go to herbs.

535
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,471
How pretty.

536
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:18,059
What's that? And me, too?

537
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,609
Hey, where's mine?

538
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,365
I have a question to ask.

539
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,119
Why is it that you wanted
to become a commoner?

540
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,455
Because…

541
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:43,251
with my father in exile,
it'll be so much easier to visit him.

542
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,129
Is that the only reason?

543
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,844
I didn't want my life
at the palace erased.

544
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,224
After all, some memories are very joyful.

545
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,438
Well, it's good that His Majesty gave
your title back to you after you left.

546
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,150
It was very kind of him to erase
your record of being the Queen.

547
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,321
And so now, you will be able
to meet a nice man and get married.

548
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,544
I know this would look so beautiful
on His Majesty.

549
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,390
I wish he's doing well,
having a good life.

550
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,173
Your Majesty!

551
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,968
You're up here again!

552
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,680
Why did you not tell us you were leaving?

553
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,683
The preceding king,
before leaving the palace,

554
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,561
made sure we would never leave your sight.

555
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,604
Oh, I…

556
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,442
She gave us an order before she left.

557
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,903
If she finds out, oh, the trouble.

558
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,871
I like to think that they're…

559
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,416
doing well.

560
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,732
I give up. Okay?

561
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,444
We'll just eat seasoned vegetables today.

562
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,528
Go on your way.

563
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,511
My lady, you really startled me there.

564
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,638
I haven't held my bow in a while,

565
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,848
so I still feel a little rusty.

566
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,642
Yeah. But it was still--

567
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,937
Well, since you're having
a hard time catching any fish,

568
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,231
I needed to hunt for us
to put food on our table.

569
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:36,317
What? Who's saying that? Huh?

570
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,069
That really upsets me.

571
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:41,489
And I'm not catching fish,
so you don't get sick of them, all right?

572
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,742
Just yesterday, or it was two days ago,

573
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,537
when I tried to catch this fish,
and the creature almost ate me…

574
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,796
Wait.

575
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,757
Wait!

576
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,055
Where are you running off to?

577
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,350
Remember? I promised
I would never let go of you.

578
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:55,396
I always wondered about the ocean
and what lies beyond it.

579
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,735
Would you like to go
and see what's out there?

580
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:14,874
Not now.

581
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,503
It's not something
I'm curious about anymore.

582
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,135
Staying here with you
seems pretty good right now.

583
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,398
Uh, um…

584
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,984
here.

585
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,154
This is…

586
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:49,283
You told me that you wanted me
to get you a pin.

587
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,246
Let me pin it in your hair.

588
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,765
You're beautiful, Yeon-seon.

589
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,101
So beautiful.

590
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,292
Everything that has happened to us,

591
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,086
it all still feels like a dream.

592
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,799
A very long, frightening,

593
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,552
yet beautiful dream.

594
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,598
Your dreams
will no longer be frightening.

595
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,851
They will only be beautiful.

596
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:43,940
I will always… be right by your side.

597
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,130
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE KING'S AFFECTION
