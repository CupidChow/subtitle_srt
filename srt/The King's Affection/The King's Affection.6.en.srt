1
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,246
Your Highness, are you… okay?

2
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,022
What happened, Your Highness?

3
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,068
Well, you see,

4
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,737
there was just a minor accident.

5
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,915
Oh, dear. What happened?

6
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,293
I'll get someone
to clean this up right away.

7
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,629
But what are you doing here,
Royal Tutor Jung?

8
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,800
Royal Scholar Yang wanted me
to escort His Royal Highness.

9
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,929
I just told him that His Royal Highness
would not be able to attend the lecture.

10
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,974
I should attend the lecture today.

11
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,143
Go tell him I changed my mind.

12
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,477
Your Highness but…

13
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,068
JWAJEON

14
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,071
Your Highness.

15
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,929
EPISODE 6

16
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,657
"Spring is born in spring."

17
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,869
"Spring grows in summer."

18
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,726
"Spring is harvested in autumn."

19
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,521
"And spring is treasured in winter."

20
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,066
That is correct.

21
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,709
Oh, Royal Tutor Jung.
His Highness is already here.

22
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,254
I thought you went to go and get him.
Where were you?

23
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,677
Well, there… was a small accident.

24
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,138
Accident? What happened to your finger?

25
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,554
Why… why did…

26
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,308
And you also look like
you have a terrible hangover as well.

27
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,690
"So the scholar said,

28
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,777
the best of the four morals is similar
to the best virtue of the five, sympathy."

29
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,322
"If we decide
to look at the moral values individually,

30
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,531
there are many values."

31
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,618
"But if we look at them as a whole,
one value includes all four moral values.

32
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,787
And this is the truth."

33
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,931
"All these moral values
make up the truth."

34
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,476
"And the universal truth

35
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,020
will be clear as day."

36
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,314
Do you understand?

37
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,954
Why are you staring at each other?

38
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,837
I… wasn't staring at him.

39
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,340
And I see your face is

40
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,094
the very same color as red wine.

41
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,515
What is it, Your Highness?

42
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,018
I… forgot to get my book.

43
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,771
Your book is here.

44
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,315
The one for the evening lecture.

45
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,775
Oh.

46
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,443
Please, will you excuse me.

47
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,531
Don't trouble yourself.

48
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,578
Please stay here.
Don't worry, I will take care of it.

49
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,331
Royal Tutor Jung.

50
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,458
Yes?

51
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,294
You must have time on your hands today.

52
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,840
No. I have a lot of work to do.

53
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,427
Okay. Whatever. Go get a book
from the Crown Prince's office.

54
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,762
His Highness needs it
for the evening lecture.

55
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,141
Go now. Hurry.

56
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,763
DAEHAKYEONUI

57
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,307
JWAJEON

58
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,143
JWAJEON

59
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,606
Oh, no.

60
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,483
What… what is it?

61
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,821
Your Highness!

62
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,824
Where on earth are you going?
Your Royal Highness!

63
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,622
Did I do something to upset him?

64
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,393
JWAJEON

65
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,022
Your Highness.

66
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,402
Why do you have this particular book?

67
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,987
JWAJEON

68
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,836
What are you doing with that book?

69
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,422
That is not the one
you were supposed to go get.

70
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,717
I have it because that book belongs to me.

71
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,348
But this book is Dam-i's. No?

72
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,893
See, I transcribed this book myself
for a girl I liked.

73
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,859
I have no idea
what you are even talking about.

74
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,529
I will look for the book myself.

75
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,740
I want you to leave now.

76
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,786
You really don't remember
a court maid named Dam-i?

77
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,789
Back when your grandfather
was still alive,

78
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,416
I had a private audience with you.

79
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,003
And you personally gave me
the present she left for me.

80
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,882
The palace is full
of countless court maids.

81
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,969
How can I remember something
that happened so long ago?

82
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,095
But what about…

83
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,725
you did remember me.

84
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,439
When we first met at…

85
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,859
at the courtesan house, you remembered me.

86
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,655
Well…

87
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,618
I only remembered you because

88
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,413
I thought you were good at flattery,
even for a brazen boy.

89
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,956
Does that answer you?

90
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,680
JWAJEON

91
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,972
Dam-i?

92
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,770
When I was young,
she was a court maid that I liked.

93
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh.

94
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,275
The girl from the banquet
who you fell in love with at first sight?

95
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,949
The Crown Prince had
the book I gave to the girl.

96
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,742
The Crown Prince?

97
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,332
Why do you think…

98
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,838
Dam-i just disappeared like that?
She didn't say goodbye to me.

99
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,508
If she's still alive,

100
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,720
she's probably already married, right?

101
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,725
And she must have kids
who look just like her, right?

102
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,978
What a surprise.

103
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,440
I never would have guessed that
you could be a hopeless romantic too.

104
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,568
Didn't you tell me
that you went to off to Ming

105
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,028
because the women in Joseon
weren't good enough for you?

106
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,162
What about you?

107
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,997
Is there someone you like?

108
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,458
Someone I like?

109
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,002
You're very handsome,
and you're wealthy too.

110
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,964
Plus, you're a member
of the royal family with a heart of gold.

111
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,219
There is.

112
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,766
There is? Who is it?

113
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,226
Which clan is she? Is she a relative?

114
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,104
Is she pretty? Is she kind?

115
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,024
Don't say…

116
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,860
you already set the wedding date.

117
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,865
She's very beautiful.

118
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,950
She's warmhearted.

119
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,913
How come you didn't say anything to me?

120
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,000
So when will you introduce me to her?

121
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm a good judge of character
with the ladies.

122
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,547
I'm not sure.

123
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,052
I don't even know
if I'll get the chance to do so.

124
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,307
Don't tell me…

125
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,228
that your love is one-sided.

126
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,928
You had a very long week,

127
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,889
and you seem quite fatigued at the moment.

128
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,142
Your Highness, would going
to sleep early be a good idea?

129
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,110
Wait.

130
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,242
Your Royal Highness, what is it?

131
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,579
Do you know how my record…

132
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,956
No.

133
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,211
Do you happen to know how Dam-i's record

134
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,422
has been settled?

135
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,844
Why are you asking me that?

136
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,856
It is my understanding

137
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,902
that your mother had it taken care of
when she was alive.

138
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,581
DAM-I

139
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,666
DAM-I

140
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:30,095
DAM-I

141
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,561
DAM-I
DAY 21 OF MONTH 4

142
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,105
LEFT THE PALACE DUE TO ILLNESS

143
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,538
What is this regarding?

144
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,708
Why did you come
all the way here this morning

145
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,585
to meet an imprisoned physician?

146
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,339
I'm embarrassed to ask you for a favor,

147
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,759
but my daughter
made a promise to the physician.

148
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,806
So I came here to ask for your help
despite my shame.

149
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,058
I hope you understand my situation.

150
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,565
I thought you were so sure of yourself
even before His Majesty and Lord Sangheon.

151
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,777
But even you, the Minister of Personnel,

152
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,404
need help when it's your child.

153
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,544
Please wait over there.
I'll bring out the physician.

154
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,451
I apologized to that girl.

155
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,580
I didn't only do it
because you told me to.

156
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,458
I also know what is right and wrong.

157
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,129
I came by to tell you that.

158
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,011
Are you surprised to see me here?

159
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,098
Or touched that I came to see you?

160
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,267
Who are you?

161
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,399
What are you doing?

162
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,864
Where… is that physician?

163
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,491
What are you doing here?

164
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,551
LIST OF COURT MAIDS

165
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,595
What is this, may I ask?

166
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:24,269
I might have been
a bit curt with you the other day.

167
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,607
That court maid…

168
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,237
in fact, she died.

169
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,366
It happened
right after she left the palace…

170
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,701
due to an illness.

171
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,378
DAM-I

172
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
DAM-I

173
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,008
LEFT THE PALACE DUE TO ILLNESS

174
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,568
I see.

175
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,156
That explains
why you couldn't remember her.

176
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,412
That girl…

177
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,499
must have been someone special to you.

178
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,838
She was my first love.

179
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,719
She helped me become a better person.

180
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,307
I wanted…

181
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,226
to thank her…

182
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,898
if I ever saw her again.

183
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,653
I guess I won't be able to.

184
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,664
I didn't mean to make you concerned,
Your Royal Highness.

185
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,499
My apologies.

186
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,204
NOKUNGAK

187
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,306
Goodness. What are you doing?

188
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,225
I'm helping you with the laundry.

189
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,108
Do you know the story
behind these deserted quarters?

190
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,359
What story?

191
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,531
A long time ago, a court maid loved a man
who lived outside the palace.

192
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,951
She couldn't overcome
the sadness of unrequited love.

193
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,829
So she hanged herself here in this place.

194
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,124
Afterward, people stopped coming here.

195
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,668
And the deserted quarters
became an eyesore.

196
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,838
So the Kings tried to demolish
this place over generations.

197
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,466
But anyone who tried
either got sick or died

198
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:26,970
as if they'd been given a terrible curse.
That's what I heard, anyway.

199
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,890
After that, they weren't
able to tear this place down.

200
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,850
So instead, they just closed it.

201
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,477
Well…

202
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,856
aren't you scared
to be alone in a place like this?

203
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,317
Why would I ever be scared?

204
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,028
I like that no one comes here
thanks to that story.

205
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,664
NOKUNGAK

206
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,459
A ghost!

207
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,628
You startled me!

208
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,174
Stop. Wait up!

209
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,887
Wait until I catch you!

210
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,395
Come on, wait up! I'm scared!

211
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,265
I thought you'd be busy
with the reception. What brings you here?

212
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,101
I heard the Crown Prince
ended the lecture early today.

213
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,520
So, is there something wrong then?

214
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,022
Oh, he went to his usual spot.

215
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:07,070
You know, the spot he always goes to
when he has a lot on his mind.

216
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,024
This place is a true gem.

217
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,360
You'll never find a breeze
more refreshing than up here.

218
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,488
Hyun.

219
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,116
I thought you'd be in Ganghwa
for the reception.

220
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,493
You haven't left yet?

221
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,119
I postponed it to tomorrow.

222
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,623
I have a more important matter
to take care of today.

223
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,418
A more important matter? What is it?

224
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,262
You mentioned you wanted
to have these the other morning.

225
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,016
I happened to remember what you said.

226
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,811
I hope…

227
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,148
you didn't delay your trip
because of this.

228
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,652
Well, it was one reason.

229
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,003
You always told me
that you wanted to run free.

230
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,007
So why do you always stop… here?

231
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,680
Because I have to go back to the palace.

232
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,974
And this is…

233
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,603
the extent of the path I know.

234
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,690
You told me once

235
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,943
that you had traveled
some place far, right?

236
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,285
What all did you find far away from here?

237
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,580
If you keep going
straight past the gate,

238
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,832
is it true that you'll see the ocean,

239
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,127
which is longer and wider
than anyone knows?

240
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,339
Does that really exist?

241
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,050
Yes. It does.

242
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,888
And there is also
a sturdy ship with a big sail as well.

243
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,226
Once you get on the ship,
you can go anywhere.

244
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,146
Even if it's very far.

245
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,532
If you ask me for directions,
I will give them to you.

246
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,285
You can count on it.

247
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,344
You only have an hour left out here.

248
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,848
Unfortunately, in an hour,
the sun will be set.

249
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,142
So until then, why don't you enjoy

250
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,645
the refreshing breeze
and the beautiful view.

251
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,819
I have been working hard lately.

252
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,821
So I can't stop dozing off.

253
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,256
Flowers for
the Crown Prince's quarters?

254
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,468
I wasn't informed about this.

255
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,929
Can you tell me what they are for?

256
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,223
Well, you see…

257
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,308
The thing is--

258
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,146
If I may ask, can I get some flower seeds?

259
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,069
Well, I'm done planting the flowers,
and I do have some left.

260
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,407
Just a few, hmm?

261
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,909
Can't you give me some of the flowers?

262
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,870
Hmm?

263
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,708
Why do you have those?

264
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:40,672
Oh, these? I want to plant flowers.

265
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,173
I've got a spot picked out.

266
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,633
Mm.

267
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,843
I see.

268
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,512
Thank you…

269
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,724
for looking into her court record.

270
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,981
Yes.

271
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,693
I heard that
you are attending lectures again.

272
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,404
I know you've been busy lately.

273
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,080
Hey! Royal Tutor Jung!

274
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,128
What on earth are you doing?
You have a big problem!

275
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,130
What problem?

276
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,757
Well, the Minister of Personnel

277
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,010
lodged a demand for your resignation.

278
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,515
My resignation?

279
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,782
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un of the Crown Prince

280
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,702
is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?

281
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,623
Unfortunately, yes, he is, Your Majesty.

282
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,132
If what you're telling me
is the truth,

283
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,302
who is the imprisoned physician
at Hanseong Magistracy?

284
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,681
He used to work at Samgaebang
as a mere assistant, Your Majesty.

285
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,769
Left State Councilor,
I need you to explain this.

286
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,689
You were the one, Councilor,
who recommended Royal Tutor Jung.

287
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,448
Everything that the Minister of Personnel
has presented is true.

288
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,661
Then are you telling us
that you recommended

289
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,746
a lowly physician from the street

290
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,458
to be the royal tutor of the Crown Prince
despite knowing his history?

291
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,627
He may be a lowly physician
from the street,

292
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,379
but he does have wisdom to share.

293
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,508
Your Majesty,
didn't you compliment his wisdom

294
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,218
during the last exam?

295
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,596
Jung Ji-un displays an excellent character

296
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,308
plus, great literary talent
compared to other tutors.

297
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,769
This good-natured man
ran a pharmacy to share

298
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,481
his medical knowledge with the people.
Samgaebang is its name.

299
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,234
You cannot possibly hold
this act of kindness against him.

300
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,154
His history running a pharmacy
isn't the problem.

301
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,032
Hiding this from His Majesty
and the Crown Prince is a crime.

302
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,534
I'm sure that you would all agree.

303
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,621
On top of that, if the Inspector General

304
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,707
went and ordered the closure of Samgaebang

305
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,167
for corrupting public morals
within the community,

306
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,171
then I am confident there must have been
a far bigger issue than meets the eye.

307
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,940
I resented the Minister of Personnel
for not siding with me.

308
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,736
Now he's tipped the scales my way.

309
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,488
He's a difficult man to decipher.

310
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,366
It's too early to celebrate.

311
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,368
You know the Left State Councilor.

312
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:02,582
He'll probably try to make this go away
by reprimanding a lecturer.

313
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,000
That's why we must help him.

314
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,088
His Majesty expects
extraordinary things from Prince Jehyeon.

315
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,176
Don't you think
it's time for us to finally step up

316
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,262
and weaken the position
of Lord Sangheon and the Crown Prince?

317
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,271
Why did you allow them to live?

318
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,442
I'll explain everything in person
to the Minister of Personnel.

319
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,195
Do you think
you can so easily hold sway over him?

320
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,366
I practically spoon-fed you,
but you couldn't even handle that

321
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,452
and made a mess.

322
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,412
I'm sorry, my lord.

323
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,249
I will do whatever it takes
to handle this.

324
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,876
Of course you will

325
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,546
because your precious son's life
will depend on it.

326
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,844
Let me through,
I must talk to the Minister of Personnel.

327
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,346
-I only need a moment.
-No.

328
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,349
He said he wouldn't meet with you
until His Majesty approves it.

329
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,101
Please leave.

330
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,064
Wait. I only need a moment of his time.

331
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,524
How dare you!

332
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,421
I want you to release them now.

333
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,050
I'll take responsibility for everything.

334
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,927
You will take responsibility?

335
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,223
You've deceived the royal family,
so now your life is in danger.

336
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,226
How will you take responsibility for it?

337
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,770
You could have just punished me
right from the beginning.

338
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,315
Why do you insist on torturing my friends
and putting everyone in danger?

339
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,943
His Majesty will decide

340
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,404
in three days at the morning assembly.

341
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:01,367
Do whatever it takes
to secure your position until then.

342
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,577
If you fail,

343
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,122
those friends you cherish,
as well as the two of us,

344
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,708
and your dear mother

345
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,712
will not live to see another day.

346
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,451
Your Highness.

347
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,955
Tell me. What has happened?

348
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,000
It looks like
matters have gotten pretty serious quick.

349
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,753
His Majesty will punish Royal Tutor Jung,

350
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:58,049
and he will also punish his father
for turning a blind eye to his son.

351
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:07,058
I very much doubt that
Inspector Jung Seok-jo was acting alone.

352
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,061
Everyone must know that he was only doing

353
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,896
what my maternal grandfather

354
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,232
had told him to do.

355
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:20,279
Anyway, I say it all worked out.
You weren't exactly keen on them.

356
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,865
So driving them out of the palace--

357
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,701
It's getting late.
You can go now, Bok-dong.

358
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,953
Yes?

359
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,915
Oh. Yes, Your Highness.

360
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,384
Are you bothered by the scandal
with Royal Tutor Jung?

361
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,014
You know he's Jung Seok-jo's son.

362
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,142
The one responsible
for murdering the Prince.

363
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:55,481
And also, the one who tried to kill you,
Your Royal Highness.

364
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,649
I know.

365
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,318
I do.

366
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,281
You must not forget that.

367
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,700
Not ever.

368
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,704
So please do not forget.

369
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,605
It's all my fault that he's in trouble.

370
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,401
The Minister of Personnel
scared me out of my wits.

371
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,280
Maybe… maybe it's not too late?

372
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,617
If I say
I'm the real physician at Samgaebang,

373
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,537
Yeong-ji and Ji-un will live, right?

374
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,039
What nonsense is this?

375
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:57,501
The Inspector… No.
Ji-un's father told me that…

376
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,005
that if I recant it all,
everyone will be okay.

377
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,841
You idiot. Do you seriously buy that?

378
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,219
Once he hears that, he's more likely
to find a nice place to bury you.

379
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,847
-You dimwit.
-What am I supposed to do?

380
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,600
Ji-un is about to die because of me.

381
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,728
Chief Gu!
You've got to get out of here now.

382
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,022
I'll tell Royal Tutor Jung everything.

383
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,609
So don't do anything stupid, okay?
Say you know nothing.

384
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,277
Stick to that. Got it?

385
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,029
Come on, hurry up!

386
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,864
You know nothing.

387
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,091
My lady!

388
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,342
-My lady.
-Father.

389
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,968
Wait!

390
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,723
-What are you doing?
-They are about to get hurt because of me.

391
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,183
Father.

392
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,435
Just please would you look the other way.

393
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,145
They aren't bad people.

394
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,106
I'm sure it wasn't their intention.

395
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,651
How can we be certain that
they are not bad without any evidence?

396
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,738
I will only see them
as either innocent or as guilty.

397
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,451
Father. Father, please no.

398
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,329
That's enough.
I already reported it to His Majesty.

399
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,040
For now, the decision is in his hands.

400
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,127
Father! Father!

401
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,892
His Majesty will issue a royal order
at tomorrow morning's assembly.

402
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,437
It's unfortunate, but I believe today

403
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,606
will be the last time that I see you.

404
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,442
You haven't been here long…

405
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:50,614
but I'll remember your lectures
as somewhat useful.

406
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,575
I cannot leave the palace yet.

407
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,494
I'm in need of your help.

408
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,290
You're the only person
who can help me now.

409
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,252
Why do you think that I would help you?

410
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,298
Did you forget that I wanted you gone
more than anybody else

411
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,551
when you first arrived here at the palace?

412
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,679
I know that. That's why
I'm asking you for your help.

413
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,558
You knew from the beginning
that I was a physician at Samgaebang.

414
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,935
But you still accepted me
as your lecturer, anyway.

415
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,023
That was because I lost the wager.
I did promise after all.

416
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,195
Could you keep

417
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,781
your promise to me
just for one more time, Your Highness?

418
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,506
Unfortunately, there's nothing
that I can do for you.

419
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,550
So I advise you to stop asking.

420
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,197
Royal Tutor Jung…

421
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,700
There you are.

422
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,579
Where on earth have you been?
I looked everywhere for you.

423
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,457
What about Jil-geum? He's okay, right?

424
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,209
It's about your father.

425
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:29,880
I think he's going to
just go and pin the whole thing on him.

426
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,883
I don't know what to do.
I can neither stop him nor support him.

427
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,386
Chief Gu! Chief Gu!

428
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,347
What do you mean, "pin it"?

429
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,141
That fool wants to save you and Yeong-ji.

430
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,396
You don't think
that he'll kill them, do you?

431
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,190
I mean, you cherish them
like your family. Right?

432
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,901
No… Jil-geum. No!

433
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,238
Hey, wait a minute. Tutor Jung!

434
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,282
Tutor Jung, wait!

435
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,126
Your Highness,
Prince Jaeun is here to see you.

436
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,843
You're back.

437
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,681
Was your trip to Ganghwa pleasant?

438
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,849
Yes.

439
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,519
I have something to tell you.

440
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,438
What is it?

441
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,237
Royal Tutor Jung ran Samgaebang

442
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,200
with the sole purpose
of helping poor kids from the slums.

443
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,661
That's what you're telling me?

444
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,163
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

445
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,832
He only accepted
the position at the palace

446
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,168
to save his friends from Samgaebang.

447
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,629
He never wanted the title at all.

448
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,259
-Why are you even telling me all of this?
-Because--

449
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,928
I know Jung Ji-un
is an old friend of yours.

450
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,515
I understand that
you want to help him out.

451
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,810
But this is pointless.

452
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,187
Whatever the reason,

453
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,482
he still broke the code of morals
and deceived our family.

454
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,734
His actions will not be forgiven.

455
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,237
He may be my good friend,
but he's also your tutor.

456
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,618
I'm very tired.

457
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm sure you're exhausted
from your trip as well.

458
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,123
We should talk some other time.

459
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,948
I cannot leave the palace yet.

460
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,282
I'm in need of your help.

461
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,952
You're the only person
who can help me now.

462
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,198
What did you wish for?

463
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,956
Do you remember the slum
we passed by earlier on our way here?

464
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,875
Hmm?

465
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,918
I wished that the kids in the slum

466
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,337
would be well fed
and grow up in good health.

467
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,423
That is what I wished for.

468
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,967
What?

469
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,512
It's a parents' job
to take care of their children, though.

470
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,638
Wouldn't you say?

471
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,974
But most of them are orphans.

472
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,269
I grew up there as an orphan too.

473
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,274
My heart breaks for them,

474
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,610
but I don't have the means to help them.

475
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,112
So if I make a wish for them,

476
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,532
perhaps, maybe someone
might help them out one day.

477
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,917
So, tell me. What did you wish for?

478
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,461
Oh. That?

479
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,464
Uh, I don't…

480
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,884
Just a second, Dam-i, hold on.

481
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,222
Young Master.

482
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,803
Why did you do that?

483
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,391
Well, after hearing your wish,

484
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:36,436
my wish just sounded
so petty and extremely selfish.

485
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,273
-Oh?
-So I changed mine.

486
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,527
My wish is to actually become that someone
who can help those kids.

487
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,674
Should I have not mentioned it?

488
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,051
No.

489
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:12,598
If I didn't, Jil-geum would be framed
for everything and end up dead.

490
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,684
I couldn't let that happen to him.
Of course, not.

491
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,062
Right!

492
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,608
Royal Tutor Jung is on it.
I'm sure he has come up with a plan.

493
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,819
I doubt that he's gonna kill
his own son. Right.

494
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,743
No. No way, no way.

495
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,623
What if Royal Tutor Jung gets killed too?

496
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,125
The Inspector is capable of doing so.

497
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,714
This is driving me crazy!

498
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,342
What do I do? What do I do now?

499
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,061
Who exactly is going to get killed?

500
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,283
Who are you?

501
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,390
Who… who are you?

502
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,767
Wait a minute.

503
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,602
Where are we going?

504
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,482
Where are you taking me?

505
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,028
Oh. Oh, sir.

506
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,208
-Yeong-ji!
-Jil-geum!

507
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,419
What is this?

508
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,963
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

509
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,809
Are you really…

510
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,480
-going to kill them too, father?
-Step aside.

511
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,191
How much more
can you possibly disappoint me?

512
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,943
I said, step aside.

513
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,770
Are you really going to kill me?

514
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,773
Please let them go.

515
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,234
I beg you.

516
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,654
They will live some place else.

517
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,365
Tell yourself that.

518
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,951
That is the only thing you can do.

519
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,966
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

520
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,176
No!

521
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,847
-What are you doing?
-If I do this…

522
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,728
you have no reason to kill both of them.

523
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,581
If you dare lay a finger on them,

524
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,293
I will never forgive you.

525
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,130
Even if you are my father!

526
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,842
Ji-un!

527
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,469
Lock him up until I return.

528
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,266
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

529
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,242
Take the girl away for now.

530
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,286
Jil-geum!

531
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,372
-Jil-geum!
-Yeong-ji!

532
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,832
Write down what I say.

533
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,086
You were scared, so you lied.

534
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,339
And you are the physician at Samgaebang.

535
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,884
You were scared of your punishment,

536
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,636
so you bought off
guards and escaped. Got it?

537
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,226
No…

538
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,023
Please spare me.

539
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,858
Please let me live!

540
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,069
It's my fault. Please don't kill me.

541
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,780
I heard that Ji-un saved you and that girl

542
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,116
when your lives were in danger.

543
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,702
You can…

544
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,246
pay him back now.

545
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,421
Yeong-ji.

546
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,140
Please spare me…

547
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,018
Yeong-ji…

548
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,570
Please spare me.

549
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,744
I AM THE PHYSICIAN OF SAMGAEBANG

550
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,329
I ESCAPED

551
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,122
BANG JIL-GEUM

552
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,171
Wait. As you promised,

553
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,757
please spare Ji-un and Yeong-ji.

554
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,219
Please don't kill them.

555
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,264
Please…

556
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,686
Please let them live.

557
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,463
I see some crooks
secretly took the prisoners

558
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,757
from Hanseong Magistracy.

559
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,763
As the Crown Prince, I demand

560
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,142
give the prisoners to me.

561
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,185
If you do,

562
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,857
no one will shed
one drop of blood here tonight.

563
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:23,361
Did Lord Sangheon approve of this?

564
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,032
Was I unclear?

565
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,077
I ordered you
as the Crown Prince of Joseon.

566
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,872
Unless there is a royal command,

567
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,750
no one may dare to disobey.

568
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,838
Your Highness.

569
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,051
Is that what you truly believe?

570
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,059
You must not agree with me,

571
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,520
seeing how you aren't

572
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:01,149
laying down your weapon and submitting.

573
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,657
If he so much
as moves his hand even one inch,

574
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,327
then I want him dead

575
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,163
and bring his head to me.

576
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,253
What? Don't think
I'll go through with this?

577
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,175
I doubt that my grandfather

578
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:31,221
will punish his dear grandson
for killing his dog.

579
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,155
What is going on?
Tell me what happened.

580
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:54,661
Your Highness.
You even took the royal guards with you.

581
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,414
Won't you please tell us
what on earth you were doing?

582
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,667
And what if Lord Sangheon finds out…

583
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,097
Why did you do that?

584
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,600
Why…

585
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:03,229
why were you so very arrogant,
Your Royal Highness?

586
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,112
Those men took away the prisoners.

587
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,032
I understand that it was on your order,

588
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,784
but it seemed unjust to me.

589
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:21,122
So I only did
that which I felt must be done.

590
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,806
You're wrong,
Your Royal Highness.

591
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:47,190
Your moral convictions will not be allowed
to influence your actions.

592
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,485
There is only thing that you must do,

593
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,446
and that is listen to me,
your grandfather,

594
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,574
and never challenge me.

595
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,118
That's it.

596
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,664
Do you understand?

597
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,000
Do not forget.

598
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,295
Whatever path ahead that I choose…

599
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,091
will also be your path.

600
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,678
And if you deviate from that path,

601
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,347
I will never forgive you,

602
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,976
no matter how much I love you.

603
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,884
Get up.

604
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,553
It's time for the assembly.

605
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,892
Where are they? What about my friends?

606
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,479
I need you to tell me
if they're both safe first.

607
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,859
You'll see for yourself
after the morning assembly.

608
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,485
Are they still alive?

609
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,988
You didn't…

610
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,326
kill them, did you?

611
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:41,346
Let me sum it up.
This man here, Jung Ji-un,

612
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,264
recommended and prescribed

613
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:46,476
only expensive and rare medicinal herbs

614
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,520
under the pretense of treatments.
Is that true?

615
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,938
Yes, that's true.

616
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,815
There is more.

617
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,734
When I visited Samgaebang,

618
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,904
not only did he make me wait
with the people of low birth,

619
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,864
he also humiliated me

620
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,575
by turning me away
at the gate in front of them.

621
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,288
Jung Ji-un neglected
the custom of our class

622
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,457
and tarnished
the authority of the nobility.

623
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,919
Inspector Jung Seok-jo protected his son.

624
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,505
I ask you to punish them, Your Majesty.

625
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,632
Please punish them,
Your Majesty.

626
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,847
Is everything they said true?

627
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,059
Yes.

628
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,145
It is true.

629
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,449
Here is the punishment…

630
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,620
for Royal Tutor Jung
and the two prisoners.

631
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,666
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un

632
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,710
of the Royal Institute

633
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,212
ran a clinic called Samgaebang
as a nobleman.

634
01:01:57,004 --> 01:02:00,508
He exploited people and tarnished
the prestige of the nobility.

635
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,261
Moreover, he deceived
me and the Crown Prince

636
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,513
and disgraced the royal family.

637
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,015
So his sentence will be quite severe.

638
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,268
Therefore,

639
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,854
he is no longer a lecturer
for the Crown Prince

640
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,024
and will be banished
after facing 50 lashes.

641
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,109
And those who helped him

642
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:22,530
to run Samgaebang
will be forced into do manual labor.

643
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,327
If you decide this is the punishment
I deserve, I will accept it.

644
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,874
But without the prisoners,
the punishment can't be executed.

645
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,335
My assistants from Samgaebang are missing.

646
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,546
Please tell me where they are.

647
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,840
What are you talking about?

648
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,384
I thought they were imprisoned
at Hanseong Magistracy.

649
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,847
Your Highness, someone took them away.

650
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,609
Allow me…

651
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,072
to answer that question.

652
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,628
Your Highness.

653
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,712
You turned out to be a

654
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,757
a man of outstanding generosity.

655
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,261
Please allow me to be
in charge of receiving the envoys.

656
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,055
Put your faith in me this time.

657
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:14,308
I'm truly grateful
for this grand welcome.

658
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,103
That is enough.
You are in the palace of Joseon.

659
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,648
I've asked you to come
so I could show you something interesting.

660
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,984
What the hell do you think you're doing?

661
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,861
Your Royal Highness.

662
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,406
I put my faith in you.
And you disappointed me.
