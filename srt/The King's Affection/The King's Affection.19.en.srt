1
00:00:54,471 --> 00:01:00,810
YEON-SEON

2
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,132
Dam-i.

3
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,535
Is it you, Your Majesty?

4
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,499
Dam-i?

5
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,530
Why did you never tell me?

6
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,119
Why didn't you tell me it was you?

7
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,959
I just didn't think it was that important,

8
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,087
considering that…

9
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,805
we are together now.

10
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,980
Also, I could not bear to see you…

11
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,316
getting hurt because of me.

12
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,571
I didn't want you to put any
further strain on the relationship that

13
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,740
you have with your father.

14
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,248
I'm sure it was painful for you to…

15
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,667
think about all that.

16
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,257
I'm well aware that you…

17
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,636
also endured a lot of pain
for a long time.

18
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,972
This was a path…

19
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,726
A path that neither of us chose to take.

20
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,565
So I hope you don't blame yourself
for my pain.

21
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,990
I looked for you…

22
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,869
for a long time.

23
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,040
I went to the bridge
whenever I visited the Capital.

24
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,088
Despite having a lonely life,

25
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,258
that girl…

26
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,014
she held strong and always
had a smile on her face.

27
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,060
I kept pushing for that girl…

28
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,689
to be happy…

29
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,318
no matter where she was.

30
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,783
I wanted that for you as well.

31
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,538
I don't know if I would have endured…

32
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,791
all the pain
without all of those memories.

33
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,420
The two of us meeting each other…

34
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,506
and how happy we were…

35
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,551
back in those days.

36
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,891
And now look,

37
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,187
you're here, you're in front of me again.

38
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,941
That alone…

39
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,487
is enough for me. It is.

40
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,867
EPISODE 19

41
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,417
You're like an angel
that descended from the heavens.

42
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,920
So let me see.

43
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,089
It's a bit long on this side,

44
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,966
but we can fix that
by taking it in at the waist.

45
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,219
That won't be necessary.

46
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,137
Sorry?

47
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,431
Uh, what do you mean?

48
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,892
You may leave now.

49
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,520
Hmm.

50
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,398
There is something I must tell you.

51
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,482
I'd like to…

52
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,568
speak first if you will allow.

53
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,823
I've thought about it and…

54
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,035
I think we should break off
our engagement.

55
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,664
Agreeing to a loveless marriage…

56
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,376
will be painful and unfortunate.

57
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,211
It would hurt the both of us.

58
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,385
I'm well aware of the fact
that your heart belongs to…

59
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,430
someone else.

60
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,225
And our heart…

61
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,228
is not something we can control.

62
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,399
Especially when it comes to someone…

63
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,068
that we love.

64
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,781
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,784
I truly am.

66
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,662
There is no need to apologize.

67
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,708
I'm the one who made this decision.

68
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,713
I will let my father know about it.

69
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,234
I hoped it would be true love,

70
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,487
but I guess pain was meant to be.

71
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,617
The memories I shared with you
will remain as such.

72
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,120
As memories.

73
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,339
In the end,
you chose to cause trouble.

74
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,094
Your decisions could be dangerous
for His Majesty.

75
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,762
Do you not care about that?

76
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,390
Father, answer me this…

77
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,353
Has it ever been your intention
to serve and care for His Majesty?

78
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,063
What do you mean by that?

79
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,359
Why did you never tell me
that His Majesty is in fact Dam-i?

80
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,032
Did you really plan
on killing her, Father?

81
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,660
You killed an innocent court maid

82
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,954
and then tried to kill her.

83
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,792
Answer me, Father.

84
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,962
Is this the kind of life you want to live?

85
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,549
What other crimes have you committed…

86
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,344
that I don't know about?

87
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,305
What do you want me to say?

88
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,852
I couldn't forget how loving you were
as a father when I was young,

89
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,397
so I suffered for a long time.

90
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,150
I also wondered meaninglessly

91
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,861
what it would be like
to forget everything…

92
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,740
and go back to how things used to be.

93
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,744
Maybe I won't be able
to forgive you completely but…

94
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,789
I was at least…

95
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,503
starting to feel even just a hint of hope…

96
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,507
that I finally understand you, Father.

97
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
No need to understand me.

98
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,978
We've come this far,

99
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,941
I have no other choice
but to do what I have to do.

100
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,993
If you must murder His Majesty
to keep the secret buried…

101
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,293
your blade will have to pierce me first.

102
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,313
Ji-un.

103
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,396
Why did you not tell me

104
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,440
that His Majesty was attacked…

105
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,609
by Lord Changun?

106
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,986
His Majesty did not wish for it
to be known.

107
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,240
You followed royal orders?

108
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,698
So this is how it's going to be.

109
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,508
So tell me now.

110
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,430
How do you think you could
possibly be of use to me?

111
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,518
Well, I'll help you
in any way you want, of course.

112
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,315
Hyun is being followed by my men.

113
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,568
Whenever His Majesty is up to something,

114
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,237
no one else will move
as quickly as he will.

115
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,199
So maybe that could be of use to you.

116
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,593
Your Majesty!

117
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,846
Why did you take the life of Eunuch Cho?

118
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,309
Uh, how…

119
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,896
could you even ask something like that?

120
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,398
If you tell me
the whole truth right now then,

121
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,653
I will at least let you walk
out of here alive.

122
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,531
We have evidence that it was you
who obtained the sonangcho.

123
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
So…

124
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,452
it would be unwise to try to fool us.

125
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,547
After the late King's death
was finally confirmed,

126
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,633
Lord Sangheon

127
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,927
ordered me to take Eunuch Cho's life.

128
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,390
Since Eunuch Cho served
the late King for a long time,

129
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,266
there was always the risk

130
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,603
that he could change his mind at any time.

131
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,484
Spare my life, Your Majesty.

132
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,154
Please, I'm begging you,
don't kill me now!

133
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,199
Do you know where
we can find the sonangcho?

134
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,871
Lord Sangheon…

135
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,459
wouldn't bring in any more sonangcho
after the incident.

136
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,461
It would entail too much danger.

137
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,176
As far as I know, Lord Sangheon
is the only one with the batch.

138
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,934
Eun-seo, go to Ganghwa
and escort Gyeom back here.

139
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,812
Once he learns
that I'm investigating the poison,

140
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,606
I'm sure my grandfather
will go after Gyeom.

141
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,567
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,449
I will think of an excuse
to visit his residence,

143
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,576
so I can look for the poison myself.

144
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,995
If you go there, Your Majesty, then…

145
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,665
Lord Sangheon will inevitably
increase security, so…

146
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,333
I will go instead.

147
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,210
Uh… But it's too dangerous.

148
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,171
You cannot do this alone.

149
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,131
Once Eun-seo returns from his--

150
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,841
Lord Sangheon will find out.

151
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,802
You said it yourself,
he'll discover our plan.

152
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,015
A covert operation is best executed alone.

153
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,892
Yes, but--

154
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,186
I will not get hurt and leave you alone.

155
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,021
Trust me on this one.

156
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,940
Scribe Jung…

157
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,236
If you are that concerned…

158
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,824
well then, would you give me a hug?

159
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,218
Don't worry about it, Dam-i.

160
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,264
When I was young,

161
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,350
a pretty little girl made fun of me.

162
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,395
Scolding me for not being
more skilled in the fighting arts.

163
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,150
If only she knew
how hard I trained since then.

164
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,081
There's nothing to worry about.

165
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,541
I'll return in one piece.

166
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,755
So then, I'll return to the palace

167
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,590
to try to buy you some time.

168
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,599
More rumors?

169
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,520
Rumor has it
that the late King and Queen had twins.

170
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,815
And that one of the twins
was actually a girl.

171
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,572
Uh, Your Majesty, that is preposterous.

172
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,242
How could you believe such bizarre words?

173
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,202
You should never again even--

174
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,746
There's no need for you
to pretend anymore, Grandmother.

175
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,710
Yesterday, my grandfather,
exposed me to the whole truth.

176
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,339
He said I did, in fact,
have a twin sister.

177
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,765
In the year I was born,

178
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,894
everyone who worked
at the Royal Maternity was killed.

179
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,479
I heard those people were killed

180
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,692
so that the truth about the twins would be
buried along with those who knew it.

181
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,112
Is that actually true, Grandmother?

182
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,200
How could you have told him?

183
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,662
Well, all I did was speak of the truth.

184
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,625
How much longer do we have to keep hiding?

185
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,503
A secret of this magnitude
from His Majesty.

186
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,468
You must forget everything
you just spoke of.

187
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,888
Once people find out
that you shared a womb with a girl,

188
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,766
the royal family's authority
will be heavily weakened.

189
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,019
It'll be even worse when they find out
what was done to cover it up--

190
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,687
Saji is what they say.

191
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,191
It means that a secret between two

192
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,818
will surely be exposed to others someday.

193
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,490
The rumor has started
to spread like wildfire,

194
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,784
and it will cause social unrest.

195
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,953
You must stop the rumor from spreading,

196
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,330
or it will certainly weaken your position
on the throne.

197
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,333
My position being weakened
doesn't scare me, Grandmother.

198
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,460
However…

199
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,504
I am…

200
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,673
concerned about the hardships

201
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,467
that you and my grandfather
will be submitted to

202
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,263
once you're held responsible for what
was done to keep the secret buried.

203
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,015
The two of you…

204
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,270
sacrificed countless innocent lives
for my sake,

205
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,775
and you must be held accountable
for all those gruesome crimes.

206
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,781
But… you don't need to worry.

207
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,660
They are nothing more than rumors.

208
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,162
Unless my dead twin sister…

209
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,499
suddenly comes back from the dead.

210
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,668
The secret…

211
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,505
will remain forever and ever buried.

212
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,804
Of course, it will.

213
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,350
A twin sister coming back from the dead?

214
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,649
If that were ever to happen,

215
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,822
wouldn't I be able to just shed more blood
for Your Majesty once again?

216
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,617
So please don't worry, My King.

217
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,597
The Chief State Councilor
send this to you.

218
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,945
Help me!

219
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,155
Let go…

220
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,574
Let go of her right now!

221
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,244
Drop your sword.

222
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,621
Let me talk to Lord Sangheon.

223
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,582
-I'll explain everything.
-That won't be necessary.

224
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,085
Lord Sangheon said
all he's gonna need is your head.

225
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,843
Tie him up.

226
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,941
Mother! Mother, are you all right?

227
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,535
Mother!

228
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,375
-Yeong-ji, Jil-geum!
-Ji-un?

229
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,335
Ji-un!

230
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,377
-The door.
-What?

231
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,670
-What's going on?
-Get the door.

232
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,130
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

233
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,763
Was it Lord Sangheon's men?

234
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,891
But why?

235
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,353
Because I knowingly kept
His Majesty's secret from him.

236
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,522
He probably knows.

237
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,239
I hear he's in possession
of the sonangcho.

238
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,367
If you know where it is,

239
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,202
just tell me.

240
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,915
What do you intend to do
with the sonangcho?

241
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,001
I'll expose Lord Sangheon's crimes.

242
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,546
And you really think you can do that
just by finding some poison?

243
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,548
Our family is now in danger also.

244
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,883
So please…

245
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,303
you must tell me where it is.

246
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,524
Court Lady Kim…

247
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,244
Lord Jaeun…

248
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,810
You've gone too far,
you need to stop this.

249
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,855
Please let them go, Jeong.

250
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,237
Prince Jaeun and His Majesty are close,
are they not?

251
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,948
His existence…

252
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,702
will only be a hindrance
to what I have planned.

253
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:49,459
Anyone who wants to be a King
must be coldhearted, so…

254
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,463
if you have what it takes
you must be ready to…

255
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,550
rise above your family
and their lives if needed.

256
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,969
Are you…

257
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,305
saying I should kill my brother?

258
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,936
The King's closest eunuch and court lady

259
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,022
are currently being escorted
to safety by your brother.

260
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,567
Just bring them to me.

261
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,447
Maybe, I will give your offer
some thought then.

262
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,658
I'm sorry, Hyun.

263
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,079
You can resent the fact
that we were born brothers.

264
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,503
-Lord Jaeun!
-Lord Jaeun!

265
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,556
No…

266
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,855
No!

267
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,403
Lord Jaeun…

268
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,615
Consider this my last brotherly act.

269
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,325
Do not…

270
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,704
show your face again.

271
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,625
Move out.

272
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,296
Lord Jaeun!

273
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,213
Lord Jaeun!

274
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,424
Lord Jaeun!

275
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,833
You'll find it
in Lord Sangheon's study.

276
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,336
I hear that's where
he keeps his valuables.

277
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,255
The blue incense case is what you want.

278
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,008
You'll find the sonangcho inside.

279
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,872
I see you made it out alive, huh.

280
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,215
Please forgive me, my lord.

281
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,678
I cannot end things in this way.

282
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,431
Please give me another chance.

283
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,227
Your mistake is too grave
for me to forgive you.

284
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,481
You couldn't even handle
killing a little girl.

285
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,568
Now, my original plan is hindered.

286
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,403
On top of that,

287
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,531
you even tried to keep the truth hidden.

288
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,536
Then spare my family.

289
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,581
Please do that at least.

290
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,840
So… you say you're aware
of His Majesty's plan.

291
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,592
His Majesty…

292
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,429
will expose the private army
you are forming in Yeoyeon,

293
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,016
and then he'll pass the throne
to his younger brother.

294
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,270
She'll hide that she's a woman…

295
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,898
then abdicate the throne?

296
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,075
Thief!

297
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,078
What is this ruckus?

298
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:32,385
Is this how you return
the favor I've bestowed upon you?

299
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,938
Stop!

300
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,194
Father?

301
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,537
One small movement

302
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,206
and I will cut off his head immediately!

303
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,507
Get out of here.

304
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,635
But, Father…

305
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,596
Don't make this any harder.

306
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,889
Leave now!

307
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,694
Father!

308
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,511
Scribe Jung?

309
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,096
Scribe… Scribe Jung.

310
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,353
Looks like you owe me one, Lord Sangheon.

311
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,992
But this is urgent, okay?

312
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,953
Please, you must let me in!

313
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,913
I must talk to His Majesty.

314
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,332
Come on! It's a matter of life and death!

315
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,210
As if someone like you
could have any news for the King.

316
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,131
If Ji-un doesn't come back

317
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,091
one hour after leaving the palace,

318
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,302
you will have to notify the King
of what is going on.

319
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,221
His Majesty…

320
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,306
must hear of this.

321
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,267
I'm counting on you.

322
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,856
Please let me in!

323
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,941
Please, just this once. I'm begging you!

324
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,860
Wait, Jil-geum?

325
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,736
What are you doing here?

326
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,157
Chun-saeng!

327
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,283
Chun-saeng.

328
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,576
What's wrong?

329
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,202
Uh…

330
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,371
Are you crying?

331
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,063
Hyun!

332
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,943
Hyun? Hyun?

333
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,153
Hyun!

334
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,072
Oh, Hyun, no…

335
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,824
Forgive me, I couldn't…

336
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,535
I tried, but…

337
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,954
I couldn't protect them in the end.

338
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,123
Hyun, no…

339
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,083
No, wait, Hyun…

340
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,836
Bring the royal physician! Now!

341
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,962
Yes, Your Majesty!

342
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,506
Oh, no, please.

343
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,635
What happened?

344
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,709
A father and a son…

345
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,422
risking their lives together
just for this little case here?

346
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,893
You're such a fool.

347
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,438
You said you wanted
to protect your family.

348
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,941
And this is how you do that?

349
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,155
Since he is the son
you so wished to protect,

350
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,951
then I will let you watch
his last moments.

351
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,759
No! Wait, no!

352
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,219
Kill me instead!

353
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,054
He didn't do anything wrong!

354
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,308
No! No! No!

355
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,058
Any man who stands against my royal guards

356
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,060
will be considered a traitor!

357
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,109
-Your Majesty?
-Your Majesty!

358
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,950
What is the meaning of this?

359
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,495
I should be asking you that.

360
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,914
You took the words right out of my mouth.

361
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,377
How dare you hold my eunuch
and commander against their will

362
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,212
at your private residence.

363
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,381
If you ask me,

364
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,424
this is clearly treason.

365
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,093
Treason?

366
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,096
You of all people…

367
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,809
dare to speak about treason before me?

368
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,944
Yes.

369
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,322
Standing against me, Your King,

370
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,950
makes you a traitor.

371
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,577
Does it now?

372
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,962
And this…

373
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,881
is evidence of that treason.

374
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,011
What are you waiting for?

375
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,514
Arrest Lord Sangheon
and his men immediately

376
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,099
on charges of high treason!

377
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,225
Yes!

378
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,278
You are making a big mistake,
Your Majesty.

379
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,030
The one who made a mistake is you.

380
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,616
Didn't you, Grandfather?

381
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,372
Let's go.

382
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,174
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty!

383
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,094
I apologize for not coming sooner.

384
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,597
Don't apologize.

385
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,266
Are you doing all right, Your Majesty?

386
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,317
Father. Father, are you all right?

387
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,360
Ji-un!

388
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,070
Scribe Jung!

389
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,699
Goodness, look at you. You two look awful.

390
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,078
Ji-un, are you all right?

391
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,413
What are you doing here?

392
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,582
Your father told me in advance

393
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,292
to escort His Majesty here.

394
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,795
Oh! Uh…

395
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,297
Father. Father!

396
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,759
-Steady, steady.
-Come on.

397
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,476
Father…

398
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:59,743
Your Majesty, do you really think you can…

399
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,122
get away with treating me like this?

400
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,707
Yes, I really do.

401
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,876
I've been looking forward to this.

402
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,170
Have you now?

403
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,426
And what if…

404
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,554
I choose to expose your secret
to everyone?

405
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,180
What would you do then?

406
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,474
You're nothing but a traitor

407
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,894
who murdered the late King
and framed the innocent.

408
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,773
So who would possibly believe your words?

409
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,319
People are going to see you

410
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,322
as a crazy fool
startled by his imminent death.

411
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,241
Do you think you can reveal the truth

412
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,078
by simply presenting
a poisonous herb then?

413
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,079
Yes.

414
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,706
I will make sure of it.

415
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,126
By comparing the sonangcho poison you used

416
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,004
to the busohwa poison
that was allegedly used,

417
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,175
I'll be able to prove
that my father's death was fabricated.

418
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,887
Royal Physician Seo who killed Eunuch Cho

419
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,181
is going to testify to that too.

420
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,684
I also have the ledger,

421
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,729
the one that caused
Commander Yoon his life,

422
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,067
which confirms that you have
a private army in Yeoyeon.

423
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,363
And that, Grandfather, is more than enough

424
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,075
to expose your traitorous desires.

425
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,869
My soldiers

426
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,914
are currently on their way
to Yeoyeon as we speak.

427
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,918
The crimes you have committed…

428
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,587
with no exceptions…

429
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,466
are going to be exposed to all tomorrow.

430
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,470
My grandchild…

431
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,306
I expected no less from you.

432
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,020
I'm proud of you, Your Majesty.

433
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,444
He poisoned the late King

434
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,405
and fabricated the evidence.

435
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,533
In doing this, many innocent people died.

436
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,493
I sentenced traitor Han Gi-jae

437
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,412
to execution by beheading.

438
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,672
Also, Prince Jehyeon who is

439
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,465
falsely accused by Han Gi-jae,

440
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,093
as well as Royal Preceptor Kang Hwa-gil

441
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,637
who was framed and executed for treason

442
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,432
will be restituted
to their previous titles,

443
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,853
in hopes that this
will appease their sorrows.

444
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,020
Let them enter.

445
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,348
You will pass the throne?

446
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,225
Yes.

447
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,144
That is correct.

448
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,730
I will be passing the throne
to Prince Jehyeon.

449
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,398
Why would you do that?

450
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,401
Where is any of this
even coming from, grandson?

451
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,910
During the year of Sinsa,

452
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,789
the Crown Prince's twin sister…

453
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,249
did not die that night.

454
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:48,430
GANGNYEONGJEON

455
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,352
She returned to the palace
as a court maid

456
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,187
at the age of 12.

457
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,441
After finally figuring out the truth,

458
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,319
my grandfather secretly tried
to kill the child,

459
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,323
but he ended up killing
the older brother instead…

460
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,409
who had swapped clothes
with the girl that very day.

461
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,375
What are you saying?

462
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,003
What on earth
are you talking about right now?

463
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,422
I'm the girl…

464
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,467
I'm his twin sister.

465
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,936
Please bear with me until
Lord Sangheon's punishment is finalized.

466
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,896
Once I see the end of it,

467
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,650
I will pass the throne over
to Prince Jehyeon.

468
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,319
If you are to punish me…

469
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,739
for deceiving everyone
and becoming the King,

470
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,285
I will gladly accept it.

471
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,082
And I will leave the decision
regarding my punishment

472
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,460
on your hands
and on those of the new King.

473
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,756
Your Highness!

474
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,341
Your Highness.

475
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,885
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness…

476
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,720
Are you all right, Your Highness?

477
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,663
My lord, you're awake.

478
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,250
Where is Ji-un?

479
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,363
His Majesty has exposed
Lord Sangheon's crimes.

480
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,824
Those who followed his command…

481
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,495
will also be executed.

482
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,874
Bring me fresh clothes.

483
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,337
I will inform His Majesty of my crimes.

484
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,050
As I…

485
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,637
shall also receive my punishment.

486
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,564
Take good care…

487
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,111
of your mother.

488
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,003
The attire suits you, Eun-seo.

489
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:23,895
I don't want the throne.

490
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,149
Your Majesty, our Grandmother told me
of your intentions.

491
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,735
I'm asking you to please reconsider.

492
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,988
Get on your feet.

493
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,949
You are the King of this nation.

494
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,704
How can you… possibly expect me
to take your place?

495
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,792
The crimes of my grandfather
have been uncovered.

496
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,880
In the eyes of all the innocent lives
that he took,

497
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,966
I'm not worthy of holding this position.

498
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,426
But it is…

499
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,513
rightfully your position.

500
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,224
If you are not worthy of it,

501
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,352
then who else could ever be worthy?

502
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,355
The throne is yours.

503
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,525
It can't be anyone else's
but yours, brother.

504
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,831
This is not an order,

505
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,625
but a request.

506
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,754
I know that you'll be a great King.

507
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,466
Keep our father's wishes in your heart.

508
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,969
Your Majesty…

509
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,167
I am here…

510
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,673
to disclose all my wrongdoings.

511
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,093
Are you seeking forgiveness?

512
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,974
I have no intention of forgiving you.

513
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:28,687
For you… took the lives
of guiltless people,

514
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,774
and even killed an innocent girl
while your son watched you.

515
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,651
Also…

516
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,320
you killed my older brother

517
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,991
who actually should have been
the King of this nation.

518
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,286
With your own hands.

519
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,415
That's why…

520
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,209
…even if you are sentenced
to death right now,

521
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,837
that wouldn't be enough
to pardon everything you've done.

522
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,797
I am aware of that.

523
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,348
I heard Lord Wonsan
is colluding with my grandfather.

524
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,976
I have sent soldiers to Yeoyeon,

525
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,396
so I am sending you there to supervise.

526
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,024
Because…

527
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,652
you know that area
better than anyone else does.

528
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,324
Once this task is complete,

529
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,453
I will come to a decision
on your punishment.

530
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,249
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,235
I understand
you have the body of the girl.

532
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,029
Show me her body at once.

533
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,658
No!

534
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,910
No, Father. Please, stop.

535
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,912
Why are you trying to kill her?

536
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,163
This has nothing to do with you. Now move!

537
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,164
Father! Stop it!

538
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,333
No!

539
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,472
You asked for me, Your Majesty?

540
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,057
Yes, Bok-dong.

541
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,059
Yes, what can I do for you?

542
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,270
I actually have a request.

543
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,857
I'd like you to arrange
a date tonight with the Queen.

544
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,150
What?

545
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,653
A… A date with the Queen, Your Majesty?

546
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,988
What do you plan on doing?

547
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:54,582
Your father colluded with Lord Sangheon
to raise an army in Yeoyeon.

548
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,627
Yes, I am aware of it.

549
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,630
I'm also aware that

550
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:04,592
there are appeals from my removal
or even a criminal sentence.

551
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,306
Any punishment
will be accepted with honor.

552
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,811
I will do what I can to stop your father

553
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,813
from being executed.

554
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:18,732
And you…

555
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,610
should leave the palace.

556
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,992
I will say that you succumbed
to an illness so that…

557
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,411
you can live a new life.

558
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,872
Oh, what…

559
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,957
what do you mean by that, Your Majesty?

560
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,543
Why would you…

561
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,297
I promised…

562
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,509
that I would tell you everything.

563
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,804
So I will tell you now.

564
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,680
I, uh…

565
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,809
I'm not actually a man.

566
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,065
Majesty, how could…

567
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,193
I'm truly sorry.

568
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,532
Please forgive me for all this time…

569
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,660
I've been deceiving you.

570
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,039
This is impossible.

571
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,919
That's the reason why I couldn't find
the words to explain anything before.

572
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,172
I am a woman.

573
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,635
That's why I… why I couldn't…

574
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,014
be there for you as a friend
or as a husband.

575
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,894
I felt a lot of guilt,

576
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,065
and it was keeping me from embracing you.

577
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,234
I can't…

578
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,029
Why did you choose
to tell me the truth about this?

579
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,198
And why do it now?

580
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,160
Why are you telling me this now?

581
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,413
You should have kept the secret buried.

582
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,708
And what if I blackmail you?

583
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,793
What if I use this information
against you to make it

584
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,879
so that my father's crimes
can be forgiven?

585
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,048
What if I choose
to threaten your very life with this?

586
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,595
If that is what you choose to do,

587
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,972
I will just accept it.

588
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,225
Because the way I have wronged you…

589
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,978
is way greater than that.

590
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,899
My Queen…

591
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,986
it's safe to say
that I'm not worthy of you.

592
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,199
You didn't do anything wrong towards me,

593
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,535
so if anyone is to blame,

594
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,539
that person would be me, not you.

595
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,997
I hope you can…

596
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,709
rest easier now.

597
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,963
MEMORIAL TABLET OF PRINCE DOHYEON

598
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,599
Are you here to see your father?

599
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,351
Yes.

600
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:26,771
Could you tell me
if Lord Wonsan has also been here?

601
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,115
He has.
It was three days ago.

602
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,951
Ah…

603
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,501
Your brother asked that I give you that.

604
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,055
A LONG FISHING LINE
PROPERLY SETS IN THE WATER.

605
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,224
ONCE A LONG-AWAITED RIPPLE APPEARS,
MANY FOLLOW AS THEY SPREAD OUT…

606
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:07,020
Do you, by chance, know
where he happen to be headed?

607
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,396
Please forgive me,

608
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,023
but I do not.

609
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,647
This is where you were, Majesty.

610
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,779
Tomorrow, you will…

611
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,240
pass the throne to Prince Jehyeon.

612
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,620
I've been looking forward to this day,

613
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,831
but still, I can't say
I'm in good spirits.

614
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,541
Maybe I am…

615
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,961
putting too much weight
on Gyeom's shoulders.

616
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,091
I'm sure that Prince Jehyeon

617
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,593
is going to be a great King.

618
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,473
Commander Jung stopped by to see me.

619
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,142
He reported his wrongdoings.

620
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,481
I'm aware of that.

621
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,653
I apologize…

622
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,698
because I have yet to forgive…

623
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,826
your father for everything he's done.

624
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,578
If I'm being honest,

625
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,500
there's a chance I'll never
really be able to forgive him.

626
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,963
You don't have to forgive him.

627
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,092
Especially if you're doing it for my sake.

628
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,096
Of course, I won't resent you.

629
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,891
No matter what you decide to do.

630
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,277
Your Majesty!

631
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,028
Your Majesty!

632
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:27,452
I've just received news that Lord Sangheon
has disappeared from his cell.

633
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,494
What?

634
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,789
How can this be?

635
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,828
A long fishing line
properly sets in the water.

636
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,164
Once a long-awaited ripple appears,

637
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,500
many follow as they spread out.

638
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,253
This quiet night, the water is cold,

639
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,004
and fish are all but biting.

640
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,132
So I come back to shore…

641
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,679
with an empty boat filled with my dream.

642
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,431
Wolmyeong.

643
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,851
Among.

644
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,603
Not moonlight, no. It's…

645
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,314
His dream he returns with.

646
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,112
MOONLIGHT, MY DREAM
