00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,720
(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,580
I haven't seen you for years
You're still so pretty

3
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,140
When you were a kid
I knew you'd have a promising future

4
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,200
Working in Beijing must be exhausting
Make sure you take care of yourself

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,580
You're almost 30, right?

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,820
Seems like you still don't have a boyfriend

7
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,720
You know, it won't be easy for girls
to find a man when you get older

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,060
Isn't my cousin sister married for
three years? They still don't have a baby?

9
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,340
She should have a child soon
now that she's 30

10
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,040
Want me to recommend her
a specialist in Beijing?

11
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,900
It's fine. They're good. There's no hurry

12
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,699
Got it. Her husband is weak

13
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,100
How much does your job in Beijing pay you?

14
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,640
The houses in Beijing are expensive
Have you bought one?

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,100
How big is it?

16
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,060
Did my cousin brother
get laid off last month?

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Has he found a new job?
It's hard to find one these days

18
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,740
He's not bumming around at home, is he?

19
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,140
Want me to ask my classmates
to help him ask around?

20
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,600
No need

21
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,440
Right. He's so competent

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,120
He wouldn't be interested in jobs
with a low salary. Pretend I never asked

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,140
I say it's better for you to stay at home
instead of working in Beijing

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,700
I heard that you people have to work
from dawn to dusk and often get scolded

25
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,540
I'm sure you got reprimanded a lot
with that temper of yours

26
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,640
How did you know?

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,320
I should really control my temper

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
It's not easy for my team of 20-over kids
working under me

29
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,400
I shouldn't scold them all the time

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,020
I can't scold my boss either. He's sensitive

31
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,740
What if he quits, right?

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,980
Ask me some more

33
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,820
I want to chat with you all. Ask me some more

34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,260
(Episode 11: Sentiments On Returning Home)

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,320
- Run faster!
- I can't go on anymore

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
You can't give up
or you'll have to retake the exam next year

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,560
Exactly. What about being
an all-round good student?

38
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,640
What about those dramas? Your idol?
Keep running

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,900
- For my idol!
- Five!

40
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,820
Four! Three! Two! One!

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,980
You did it!

42
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,300
- I knew you could do it
- Did I pass?

43
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,900
- Yes
- You passed!

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,380
Seriously

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,060
- What would I do without you two?
- Nonsense. You'll always have us

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
You two. Make sure
you live life earnestly from now on

47
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,300
Do you hear me? Keep it up

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,540
What does that mean?

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,500
Hu Jing Jing, where are you going?

50
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,020
Hu Jing Jing

51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,320
Hu Jing Jing!

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,420
Hu Jing Jing!

53
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,460
(Alarm)

54
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,900
What's up?

55
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,940
Are you all going home for New Year's Day?

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Why are you looking so down in the morning?

57
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,420
You gave me a fright

58
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,720
What's wrong?

59
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,200
I've eaten my breakfast

60
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,700
It's nice

61
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,820
It's actually my breakfast

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
Why didn't you say so? Here. Have it

63
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,220
Why are you having your breakfast so late?

64
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,740
President Han wanted to see me

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,220
Getting summoned by your boss first thing
in the morning must be bad news

66
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,500
Not when you're looking for me, of course

67
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,000
See? I even get coffee

68
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,660
Why did he want to see you?

69
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,860
To discuss work. What about you?

70
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,140
Why are you sighing away in the morning?
Tell me about it

71
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,220
I quarreled with Xu Yan

72
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,500
You quarreled with Xu Yan?

73
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,480
Not exactly

74
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,460
To be exact, the three of us
including Nan Jia, quarreled

75
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,940
No one's saying a thing in the chat group

76
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,659
Why are you laughing?

77
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,940
I just think that...

78
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,180
It can be solved
if you girls just talk it out

79
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,840
But it's really bothering me

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,300
It's the first time we haven't spoken
for so long since we've known each other

81
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,480
Do you think I sound
quite conceited sometimes?

82
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,659
And quite selfish?

83
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,400
Someone who thinks they're always right

84
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,900
Think they know everything. But they're
actually causing more damage to others

85
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,980
Whether it's Miao Miao, Xu Yan
or even Su Qing

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Of course

87
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,740
That includes Jing Jing

88
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,440
All those years, whenever I was happy or sad
I would tell her everything

89
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,900
I was even envious of her

90
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,840
I thought
"How does she live without any worries?"

91
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Now that I think about it
I was such an idiot

92
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,980
It's impossible for someone to live
without having any worries

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,620
It's just that I dumped all my worries on her

94
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,340
So she has no energy left to worry about hers

95
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,480
Jian Yi Fan, stop patting me
I'm about to throw up

96
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,860
Why are you here?

97
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,960
I saw your Moments this morning
I thought you'd have blocked me

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,980
I wanted to, but I was afraid I couldn't
reverse it once I've calmed down

99
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,080
Were you here reading all night?

100
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,980
Don't interrupt
Listen, I want to tell you this

101
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,180
Raising a child isn't easy

102
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,140
- That's what you've read all night?
- Stop cutting in

103
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
Raising a child
isn't the same as having a pet

104
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,580
It's also not something you can do
just because you have money

105
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,800
Firstly, being pregnant and giving birth
is an extremely difficult process for women

106
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,940
With the current advanced technology
there are treatments for many types of cancer

107
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,940
But how come there's no way to prevent the
physical damages women face from child birth?

108
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,620
Not to mention
the changes in body shape, aging...

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
You might even get postpartum depression

110
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,740
Are you ready to handle all that?

111
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,380
Secondly, there's more to this

112
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,940
Human child evolves the slowest
among all mammals

113
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,340
Kittens start running around after a month

114
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,820
But a human child only becomes an adult at 18

115
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,700
Eighteen years
That involves a lot of responsibility

116
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,140
Are you prepared
to take on these responsibilities?

117
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,980
Even if you have
what if he doesn't end up the way you wished?

118
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,480
What if he's rebellious?
What if you start to regret then?

119
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,300
- Is it my turn to speak now?
- I said, stop interrupting

120
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,460
Ji Nan Jia

121
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,820
I'm telling you all these not because
I think it's wrong to want a child

122
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,760
If you want a child, that's not a problem

123
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,300
But I want to know
if you have thought this through

124
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,140
Do you truly love kids
or are you doing it for yourself?

125
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,500
At first, I came here
to read up on raising a child

126
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,540
I wanted to see if I'm capable of it

127
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,500
What I want to say is, the reason
I grew up to be the man I am now

128
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,300
so vibrant, adorable, and positive

129
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,480
it's all because of the love I received
from my parents

130
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,880
It has allowed me
to do anything with confidence

131
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,740
So, if you want to have a child

132
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,280
I hope that we can give him
the same kind of love

133
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,260
We?

134
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,580
Yes, we

135
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,220
- Are you serious about this?
- Yes, I am

136
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,740
I admit it

137
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm not ready to be a father yet

138
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,580
But as long as you want a child
I will give it my all

139
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,060
But if you're still uncertain about it
listen to me

140
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,800
The best gift to a child is loving parents

141
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,580
So I hope you can forget about
all those nonsense

142
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Let's be in a proper relationship

143
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,260
And once we're both ready to have this child

144
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,260
that would be the best time
to bring this child to this world

145
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,280
- Hello?
- Yan Yan

146
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,280
- Are you up?
- Yes

147
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,440
- When is your shift today?
- In the afternoon

148
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Why do you sound upset?

149
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,880
Go grab a bite and go shopping with Chen Chen

150
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,260
Why must I go out with her?

151
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,760
What's the matter?
You two are close enough to share clothes

152
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,160
Did you two quarrel?

153
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,520
Yan Yan, besides Shen Zi Chang
you don't have many friends in Beijing

154
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,540
Now that Jing Jing is gone
you should get along with Chen Chen

155
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,300
I got it, Mom. We're good

156
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,800
That means you quarreled with Shen Zi Chang?

157
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,260
Mom

158
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Do you think...

159
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,380
Have I been treating Shen Zi Chang badly?

160
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,980
Why? Did he blame you?

161
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,480
He wouldn't dare

162
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,180
It's just that I've been feeling this

163
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,560
It seems like all these years, he's the one
following me around, doing whatever I like

164
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,500
Do you think...

165
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,980
Have I become too dependent on him?

166
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,220
Forget it. You won't understand

167
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,100
I can't talk anymore
I've got to get out of bed. Love you

168
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,320
Don't drink the iced cola
You'll catch a cold

169
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,660
I made you ginger cola

170
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,780
The weather is cold today

171
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,020
Shen Zi Chang

172
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,540
Wait

173
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,340
I was wrong

174
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,060
It's my bad habit

175
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,180
I tend to speak out of spite

176
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,740
But you know I don't mean it, right?

177
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,680
Xu Yan, I think we should break up

178
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,100
Why are you saying that?

179
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,540
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

180
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,260
Tell me. What can I do to appease you?

181
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,100
Xu Yan, I'm not saying this because I'm mad

182
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,940
I've been thinking about this
the past few days

183
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,580
From the time we first met
until we got together

184
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,960
From the time we got to college
until you stayed in Beijing for me

185
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,700
- I've never forgotten any of that
- Alright

186
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,940
You don't have to say all that
I'm aware of it

187
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,160
As I've said, Shen Zi Chang
it was my fault this time

188
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,980
I apologize
I shouldn't have said all those things

189
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,260
You don't want to buy a house. Fine, we won't

190
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,740
You want to have cola
Sure, drink all you want

191
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,900
If you want to hang out with your friends
I won't interfere anymore

192
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,940
- I won't
- Xu Yan

193
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,260
I know you want to live in a big house
and earn lots of money

194
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,540
You want to buy bags and clothes
and live the life that everyone yearns for

195
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,780
But I don't

196
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,660
Perhaps I'm one of those people
whom you call good-for-nothing

197
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,700
I just want to work eight hours a day

198
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,260
Have enough to get by
even though I may not earn much

199
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,580
Have time to spend
with my parents and my girlfriend

200
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,740
Have time to play and hang out
with my buddies

201
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,140
I don't want to work myself to the bone

202
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,860
I just want to live a simple and happy life
Is that wrong?

203
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,220
No. But am I in the wrong then?
Is it my fault?

204
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,940
Neither of us is wrong

205
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,900
What's wrong is we want
different kind of lives

206
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,060
Perhaps you didn't think it was a problem
back then. Neither did I

207
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,920
Just like you said

208
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,380
we're passed the age
where we can act recklessly

209
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,520
The other day, my mom told me
she's willing to sell the house for us

210
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,360
And the two of them will rent a place to stay

211
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,580
Shen Zi Chang
you know I don't mean that, right?

212
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,900
That's definitely not
how I want things to turn out

213
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,320
I know you don't

214
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,940
But I came to realize it at that moment

215
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,560
Since I can't give you the life you want
then perhaps I should let go

216
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Wait a minute

217
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
Who said you could let go?

218
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,900
Who are you to make that call?

219
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,680
When you were courting me
you said only I could suggest breaking up

220
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,260
You can't say that

221
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,660
Xu Yan

222
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,880
- I have to go. Let go of it
- Shen Zi Chang

223
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,420
Let go, Xu Yan!

224
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,200
I'm sorry

225
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,560
Shen Zi Chang

226
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,240
Shen Zi Chang, stop right there
You can't leave!

227
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,140
If you walk out that door
I'll never talk to you again

228
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,860
Shen Zi Chang, come back!

229
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,600
(Remembrance of Things Past)

230
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
Miss, we've escalated your feedback
to the technical team

231
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Someone will contact you shortly

232
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,800
I'm sorry, Miss
But the maintenance team has...

233
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,860
Miss

234
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,260
Our company has to follow procedures. I...

235
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm sorry, Miss. It is our responsibility
but the maintenance team...

236
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,220
The maintenance team follows
a scheduled appointment. We...

237
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,320
It is our fault. I apologize. I'm...

238
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,660
Sorry, sir

239
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,640
Didn't you want to take leave?

240
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,800
Take the rest of the day off
Submit your application later on

241
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,960
Thank you, sir

242
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,800
Yes, ma'am?

243
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,200
Hello

244
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Hello, I'm from the courier company
I can't get to your floor

245
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,340
- Could you come get it?
- Where are you?

246
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,960
- Hi
- Thank you

247
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Mom

248
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
You don't have to pick me up
I'm not bringing any luggage

249
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,400
Just cook something nice
and wait for me at home

250
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,340
Love you

251
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,760
Got it!

252
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,240
I've snapped them up, girls

253
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,440
One box for each of you
They'll be sent to your office

254
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,480
These are kiwis from Shibadong Village
in Hunan province

255
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,520
We should buy more agricultural products
to help the farmers

256
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,740
But I'll be going to Disneyland
with Shen Zi Chang soon. Will they go bad?

257
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,140
They won't. The kiwis will only be delivered
at the end of the year

258
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,960
- What?
- That's so many months away

259
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,180
Exactly. That's so many months away

260
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,640
It can last until 2021

261
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,040
I guess so

262
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Jing Jing

263
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,360
It's going to be 2021 soon

264
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,060
Nan Jia, there's a package for you

265
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:08,400
(The kiwis that Jing Jing ordered are here)

266
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,800
Jing Jing bought these earlier
during the summer

267
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
She said it would last us until 2021

268
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,260
I wonder if the two of them
have received theirs

269
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,500
Stop it. We're at the office
Don't touch my head

270
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,780
The company has no rule
saying that I can't touch my girlfriend

271
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,980
You just had to play with words
I said no touching means no touching

272
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,820
Then where am I allowed to?
Let's go there right now

273
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
Enough already
Do I look like a walnut to you?

274
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,520
You've been rubbing my head until now

275
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm going to end up bald at this rate
Quickly dig in

276
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,960
You took leave. Where are you planning to go?

277
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,160
Do you remember Mu Mu?

278
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,560
He invited me to Yunnan for a few days

279
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,080
- Want to come along?
- No, I'm going home

280
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,760
I'm going back to visit Jing Jing's parents

281
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,200
And my parents too. The vegetables are cooked

282
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,180
What I meant was, you're such a good friend

283
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,680
Do you know what's my QQ email signature
in high school?

284
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,000
What?

285
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,280
"With utmost righteousness
Xiao Qiao of Baishan"

286
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,080
It sounds so unsophisticated

287
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,660
What's wrong with that?

288
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,440
Why do people associate it with
negative traits these days? I think it's nice

289
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,500
Really. Sometimes I think...

290
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,100
Jing Jing should be more like that
and behave more coarsely, then...

291
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,360
Am I right?

292
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
That's enough

293
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,520
I feel like I'm always the one talking
Why don't you tell me something?

294
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,160
Actually...

295
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,360
My parents were the busiest when I went home
every year during the holidays as a kid

296
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,840
They're too busy to spend time with me

297
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,320
As work gets busier these days
the times I go home become lesser

298
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,280
Don't you miss home?

299
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,640
I do, sometimes

300
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,220
I remember my dad told me this
when I was a kid

301
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,040
Home is wherever you are

302
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,600
What your dad said is right

303
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,600
However...

304
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,140
A lot of people
look forward to those few days

305
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,200
during the new year to rest
after busily working all year long

306
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,980
They would travel all the way back
to their hometown

307
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
The young and old would gather

308
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,080
It's something they look forward to

309
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,720
Why don't you follow me back home?

310
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,560
So soon?

311
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,280
- What?
- I'm pretty confident

312
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,880
About what? No, I'm not

313
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,900
What were you thinking?
I just wanted to bring you home for dinner

314
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
- You mistook my words
- I can have dinner too

315
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,400
- No, forget it
- No?

316
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,800
Tell your parents you'll be bringing me home
with you during Spring Festival

317
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,220
They don't know I have a boyfriend

318
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,680
Isn't it a good idea to tell them
when you get home this time?

319
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,720
No. They still think of me
as their little princess

320
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,340
- You're my little princess too
- Quickly eat

321
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,800
Here you go

322
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,160
Coming right up

323
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,780
This is the feast you were referring to?

324
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,220
The food here is amazing
especially their beef noodles. Quickly try it

325
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,120
- You've been here before?
- No, first time here

326
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,720
Then how do you know it's good?

327
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,360
People say it is

328
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,680
You trust words of random people?

329
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,200
If people say something bad
I'll never believe them

330
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,560
But if they give praises
I'll surely believe them

331
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,840
You've clearly never been beaten down by life

332
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,280
Aren't I getting tortured by you now?

333
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,880
I haven't even started

334
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,580
Here you go

335
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,040
- Beef noodles are ready
- Okay, I'll come get it

336
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,680
The noodles look delicious

337
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,320
Let's dig in

338
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,760
It's really good. Quickly try it

339
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,400
Why are you laughing?

340
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,680
It must have been tough for you
ever since we met

341
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,120
What?

342
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,760
Don't get me wrong

343
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,280
I know. You're going to say
we're not right for each other. Am I right?

344
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Save it

345
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,440
I have to eat my noodles. Don't interrupt me

346
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,440
I'll be honest with you
I'm afraid of putting myself out there again

347
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,920
I'll be frank with you too
You can rest assured

348
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,020
If you don't trust me
you can just be mean to me

349
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,980
I can't guarantee
how we'll end up in the future

350
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,080
But I am certain of one thing today

351
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,720
I really like you today
I'll definitely like you the same tomorrow

352
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,200
So let's just enjoy today
and tomorrow for now. Okay?

353
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,720
- Why so serious?
- I mean it

354
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,520
- Okay?
- Just eat your noodles

355
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,120
- Can't you answer me?
- I will after I'm done eating

356
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,480
- Just tell me now
- I'm flipping this table

357
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,880
Alright, alright. Let's eat

358
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,480
- Drink up
- Cheers

359
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,280
Let's drink

360
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,800
- Why are you laughing again?
- I'm happy. Is that a problem?

361
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,160
Not at all

362
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,160
Special offer for grapes, 10 yuan for 2 kg!

363
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,400
Come buy some!

364
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,680
Aren't you going to visit
Jing Jing's parents?

365
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,380
Go on. I can manage on my own

366
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,480
I'll go after we're done buying stuff

367
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,440
Okay. Let's have a look at the mushrooms

368
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,840
How much are the mushrooms?

369
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,280
These expensive ones cost 120 yuan

370
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,760
- 120 yuan?
- Yes

371
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,600
- Mom, I'll go buy some roasted snacks
- Yes, go get some kuaci

372
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,240
Why is it so expensive?

373
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,280
It's so pricey

374
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,920
It's clean, neat, and delicious

375
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,760
- They just came in today
- Ma'am, how much are the kuaci?

376
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,480
Sorry, Miss. How much is it for 500 g?

377
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,520
How come you have a pretty face
but bad eyesight?

378
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,280
- Sorry, sir
- It's 25 yuan for 500 g

379
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,700
What? That's so expensive

380
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,060
These are big kuaci from the northeast
They're really tasty. Try it

381
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,120
- I'll take 500 g
- 500 g?

382
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,160
It'll be gone before
the sketches at the New Year's Gala start

383
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,040
- Everyone buys at least a few kilograms
- Fine. I'll buy 1 kg

384
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,480
I wasted my breath on selling you 1 kg

385
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,080
- Yan Yan
- Mom, I'm getting some kuaci

386
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,920
- How much is it per 500 g?
- 25 yuan

387
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,400
What? Was it roasted in a golden skillet?

388
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,760
I know it's almost New Year
but the price is ridiculous

389
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,920
Were you ripping me off
thinking I wasn't a local?

390
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,760
- How could you?
- Wait a second

391
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,080
Young girl, you should have said so

392
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,440
- 15 yuan for 500 g. Deal?
- No, thanks

393
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,760
He can't be trusted
Let's buy from the store ahead

394
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
The store ahead belongs to me too

395
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,400
- Hey, I'd like to buy some
- The ones at the back as well

396
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,480
It's enough, Mom. There's only three of us

397
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,200
- Why did you cook so much?
- Here it is

398
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,980
Pickled cabbage with pork belly

399
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,880
- A grand meal in the middle of the day?
- Exactly

400
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,960
This is too lavish. Don't blame me now

401
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,080
Shouldn't we have a drink to go with this?

402
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,360
- Don't urge her to drink
- I'll drink with you tonight

403
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,840
I'm visiting Jing Jing's parents in the
afternoon. I shouldn't be reeking of alcohol

404
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,400
Then you really shouldn't

405
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,680
Chen Chen, spend more time
with Jing Jing's mom later

406
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,600
- We'll wait at Huaqing Hot Springs. No hurry
- Okay

407
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,760
- Yes. Take your time
- Stay

408
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,440
I...

409
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,580
- Let's eat
- Here

410
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,940
You bought so many things

411
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,040
Yes. Why did you buy so many stuff?

412
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,520
This is for Aunt
I'm going to visit them this afternoon

413
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,520
You just got off the plane
and traveled so long in the car

414
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,679
- You should get some rest
- I'm not tired

415
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,719
Have dinner without me. I'm going to meet
Qiu Ying and Da Dong after that

416
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,639
Speaking of which, I've been fretting over it

417
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,639
Both families always gathered at
her grandmother's place every year

418
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,239
Now your grandmother isn't around
So is Jing Jing

419
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,960
I don't know if we...

420
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,920
Why are you bringing this up
when she just got home?

421
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,159
- Go on, Jia Jia
- Don't be like this, Mom

422
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,159
I'll visit them later and book a table
at a nice restaurant tomorrow

423
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,639
Both families can meet over a meal

424
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
- Have some mandarins
- It's alright

425
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,040
It's really sweet. I'll peel one for you

426
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,800
- Thank you, Aunt
- See if it's sweet

427
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,679
- Jia Jia. Have some kuaci
- I'll have them later

428
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,720
These kuaci are delicious

429
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,120
Right. I'm thawing frozen pears
in the kitchen. I'll bring them out

430
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,840
These frozen pears are delicious
You can't get them in Beijing

431
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,080
Thank you, Uncle

432
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:18,240
Thank you for remembering us
and coming here to see us

433
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,040
You even brought so many gifts

434
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,440
Don't joke with me, Uncle. This isn't a gift

435
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,120
Who gives pillboxes as new year gifts?

436
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,300
I bought this for you two a while ago

437
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,800
Aunt, you have high blood pressure, right?

438
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,560
This pillbox has compartments for seven days

439
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,160
It's been labeled. So you just have to put
your daily medication accordingly

440
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,800
That way you won't miss it

441
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,320
This is a fascia gun
You use it to relax your muscles

442
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,800
You can use it to give each other a massage
when you're tired

443
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,400
And this too

444
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,480
It's a humidifier
I think the air in the house is too dry

445
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,520
Leave it on overnight. It won't dry up

446
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Aunt

447
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,600
- This is for you
- Oh my

448
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,840
- Try it on
- Li Fang, you'll look good in it. Try it on

449
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,960
- Isn't this mink fur?
- Try it on

450
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,280
This is too expensive

451
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,640
Jia Jia, this gift is too expensive

452
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,840
Thank you so much
but I have to pay you back for it

453
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,880
Don't be silly, Uncle. I bought one
for my mom too. Does she have to pay me back?

454
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,120
I got you a down jacket too
You've been wearing the old one for years

455
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,880
- I've got a gift too?
- Hurry up, you two. Try it on

456
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,240
Thank you, Jia Jia

457
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,940
Try it on

458
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
Quickly try it on

459
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,580
Let Jia Jia have a look. I'll try it on too

460
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,840
Fifth floor

461
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,320
Isn't it the fifth floor?
There isn't a fifth floor. Where is it?

462
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,560
I came to the wrong place

463
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,560
Reply me. Where is the place?

464
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,740
Sir, this is the department store, right?

465
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,840
Yes. Isn't it written right there?

466
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,040
Is there another department store?

467
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,720
- Where are you going? Have a look
- This place. I'll show you

468
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,640
Isn't that the new plaza?
That place is popular among young people

469
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,400
They have all sorts of fashion there
Go have a look at this plaza

470
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,880
- The new plaza?
- That's right

471
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,600
She's here

472
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,400
- What took you so long?
- Quick

473
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,000
Please have a seat

474
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,200
It was hard to find
with so many department stores

475
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,760
- You got lost
- You got to the wrong place

476
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,760
- We waited so long for you
- I couldn't find it

477
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,280
We're starving. As usual
the one who's late has to down three glasses

478
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,720
- Drink up, everyone
- Cheers

479
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,640
- Welcome back, Nan Jia
- Down it

480
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,140
- I can't hold my liquor anymore
- Cool

481
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,000
- You're still the same
- Take it easy

482
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,440
- Listen to me
- I'm drunk

483
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
Drop the act. I have good news to announce

484
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,800
After New Year
I'm thinking of holding another wedding

485
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,640
All of you must come. Every single one of you

486
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,740
Did I remember it wrongly?
Aren't you already married?

487
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,040
You should ask him
how many times has he gotten married

488
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,440
- Let him say it himself
- Say it

489
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,760
It's my third time now

490
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,080
If I end up divorcing again this time
I'll return all your wedding gift money

491
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm begging you, Da Dong

492
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,580
Just live a good life
after receiving our money. Okay?

493
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,720
- I'm begging you
- Listen, guys!

494
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,880
That's what you call a good classmate

495
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,320
- Come on! Let's drink to Qiu Ying's words
- Of course

496
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,840
Let's drink to a happy married life for me
and Nan Jia's return. Cheers!

497
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,240
Where should we bring Nan Jia after this?
Spa or karaoke?

498
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,000
- Anywhere will do
- Tell us

499
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,200
To the spa, of course
What's there to sing here?

500
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,040
Spa, it is. I'm sure you can't find
that kind of spa in Beijing

501
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,720
Beijing has it too
I just don't have time to go

502
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,760
- Which spa should we go to?
- Li Jing Palace

503
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,160
- Come on! Give a better suggestion
- What's wrong with that place?

504
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,880
We should go to Buckingham Palace

505
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,480
That's even more outdated

506
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,480
Huaqing Hot Springs

507
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,240
- It's near
- That's it

508
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,640
The one that's newly opened

509
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,840
- Quickly search for it
- I'm on it

510
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,720
- Let's see
- Why are you looking at me?

511
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,720
I heard of it

512
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,760
- It looks new
- I haven't got a good scrub for days

513
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,160
- I didn't know about this place
- You can't find this in Beijing

514
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,200
- Wait a minute
- It's changed so much

515
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,560
Stop looking

516
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,960
- Alright
- Eat this garlic

517
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,440
Nan Jia

518
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,160
Be honest
Do you still feel awkward coming back here?

519
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,680
Are you going to chase me back to Beijing?

520
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,140
That's how we are here

521
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,960
In Beijing

522
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,000
you clock out at seven or eight, then
have dinner at nine or ten if you're lucky

523
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,320
For us, we would have been drinking
a few rounds by nine

524
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,960
When I'm back in Beijing, I see some of you
drunk in the evening when I check Moments

525
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,240
It felt as if we were living in
different time zones

526
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,640
It's alright, Nan Jia

527
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,100
When you get tired, just come back often

528
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,520
Da Dong and the rest of us
are just a phone call away

529
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,840
Since I've decided to go there
I have to earn money even if I'm exhausted

530
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,680
But honestly, you won't be able to stand it
living like this every day

531
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,000
That's for sure

532
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,800
But I get to come back once in a while
to forget about Beijing

533
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,680
That's still pretty nice. Drink up

534
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,080
Stop dreaming. Hurry up. Let's eat and drink

535
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
Come on. Drink up!

536
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,060
- Did you blow your hair dry?
- Yes, it's dry

537
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,660
You mustn't leave your hair wet

538
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,900
Mom, they even have buffet?

539
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,420
They have lots of good food

540
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,020
They're serving prawns. I'll go get some

541
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,620
Since when did Huaqing Hot Springs
become so luxurious?

542
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,180
Mom, I'm almost home

543
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,780
Aunt Shao fell down?

544
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,880
Where did she fall down? Did she get hurt?

545
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,580
Okay. Go check up on her

546
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,060
Don't worry about me
I can settle my own dinner

547
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,300
You should be careful too. Don't fall down

548
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,340
Okay

549
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,900
They only charge 35 yuan per person

550
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
- for the buffet here
- Have another one

551
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,700
And they made the place so posh-looking
How are they making profit?

552
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,380
The price here is considered expensive

553
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,460
Your mom said we seldom dine out
So we must go somewhere nice

554
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,260
It's because my daughter is back

555
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,860
Eat more, my girl

556
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,080
This place isn't too bad, right?

557
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,820
Things are still great back in this hometown

558
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,840
It's our 28th wedding anniversary in two days

559
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,980
What do you think that means?

560
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,300
It means, you two can't get along anymore?

561
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,620
Look at this brat saying nonsense

562
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,900
The secret to us
keeping our marriage fresh is one word

563
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,540
- Tolerance
- Oh, shut up

564
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,100
You'll get it from Mom

565
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,660
- You're in danger, Dad
- Don't listen to his nonsense

566
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,320
Let me tell you what that means

567
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,980
- What?
- It means, you're 27 now

568
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,660
You should find yourself a boyfriend

569
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,860
How do you know
if she has a boyfriend or not?

570
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,700
Maybe she does, but she didn't tell you

571
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,620
You're so funny. Do you think
she would tell you instead of me?

572
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,900
Let's stop arguing
She's your daughter, but not mine?

573
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,580
Why can't she tell me?

574
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,160
I've never heard of daughters being close
with their dad instead of their mom

575
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,620
Besides, what's the use of telling you?
How can you tell if he's good?

576
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,300
All you can do is test if he's good at
holding his liquor

577
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,140
Of course
That obviously has to be the first test

578
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,060
Perhaps my future son-in-law
can't drink as much as my daughter

579
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,380
She took after me

580
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,980
I'm Big Bottle, she is Little Bottle

581
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,280
Don't be ridiculous

582
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,780
Why don't you two carry on the debate?
I'll come back when you're settled

583
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,900
You still haven't told us
Have you found yourself a boyfriend?

584
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,260
Make a guess

585
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,500
- This brat...
- I'm going to the sauna

586
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,180
She's killing me here

587
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,940
- You just had to joke around
- My fault again?

588
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,660
(What are you girls up to?)

589
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,820
(Want to chit chat?)

590
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,940
Close the door

591
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,700
(Mrs. Lin)

592
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,380
Mom?

593
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,200
I came to Huaqing Hot Springs
after dinner with my classmates

594
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,740
What do you mean?

595
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,920
Did Aunt... Calm down. Stop yelling

596
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,940
Did Aunt tell Uncle where she was going?

597
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,660
When did she leave the house?

598
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,540
Okay, I got it

599
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,380
I'll talk to you later. I'll go get changed

600
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,460
What happened?

601
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,700
My aunt is missing

602
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,100
Mom, your hair is still wet
Maybe you two should stay a little longer

603
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,260
You're going to get a headache

604
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,240
How can we stay? Jing Jing's mom is missing

605
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,220
- I'll come with you to look for her
- Don't cause them more trouble

606
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,360
- I'll take you home
- Hold on

607
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,260
Uncle, Aunt. Your bills have been settled

608
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,920
- I feel bad
- Don't worry about it

609
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,620
The weather is really cold

610
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,020
We'll look for her. You should go home

611
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
Chen Chen, I've called your uncle just now

612
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,060
He knows a lot of people
at the police station. He'll come get you

613
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,580
- Don't worry
- Let me know when you're home

614
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,660
- It's fine
- Alright

615
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,460
- Let's go
- Where is Nan Jia?

616
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,860
- Over there
- Why? She's there

617
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,060
- All of you drank, right?
- Yes

618
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,260
- Qiu Ying, tell your husband to come now
- He'll be here soon

619
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,460
Great. Nan Jia will go in your car

620
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,940
I know. We're heading out to look for her now

621
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,900
My wife will be here soon and we're taking...

622
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,100
- Xu Yan
- What about you?

623
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,220
- My uncle is coming
- You've all seen her picture, right?

624
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,980
- Yes
- Okay, let's go

625
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,060
Chen Chen, don't panic. Think carefully

626
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,220
Where would she most likely go?

627
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,500
There's a riverside ahead
I'll go look around over there

628
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,380
Could she have gone to the cemetery?

629
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,260
Maybe she wanted to talk to her daughter

630
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,340
No. Nan Jia called the cemetery caretaker
before you arrived

631
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,260
Their doors are locked
She couldn't have gotten in

632
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,420
Could she have gone to our school
to visit places Jing Jing used to hang out?

633
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,500
I thought of a place. Go straight

634
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,220
- Straight ahead?
- Yes

635
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,140
- I hope she isn't freezing in this weather
- She won't

636
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,980
I'm sure she knows how to keep herself warm

637
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,340
Sir, I just need ten minutes. It's urgent!

638
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,500
Thank you

639
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,740
Quick

640
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,700
Once we're done running
we'll go grab a bite!

641
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,220
Hurry up!

642
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,740
Stop right there

643
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,420
Qiao Xi Chen

644
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,500
There's more. Open your mouth

645
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,900
Good. That's right! Pick up the pace

646
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,260
Aunt

647
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,180
Aunt!

648
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,860
Three! Two! One! Go!

649
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,180
- That's why I prefer glutinous ones
- I'll get you those next time

650
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,180
Thank you. Cheers!

651
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,820
Honey, I think it's the road ahead

652
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,220
- Step on it, honey
- Don't...

653
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,260
Nan Jia is crying

654
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,020
Don't cry. Calm down. Don't worry

655
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,820
Did you just get off from work?

656
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,860
- Then you came here to play with me?
- My outfit

657
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,220
It looks weird and
completely out of place, doesn't it?

658
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,700
It's comfortable like this

659
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,500
You're pretty good at this

660
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,420
Look. I can even turn around

661
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,780
I can even do a split

662
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,540
I can even turn around

663
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,100
- Aunt
- Jia Jia, what are you doing here?

664
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,820
My mom and I have been
looking everywhere for you

665
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,540
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

666
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,500
I wasn't ignoring your calls
I didn't know you called

667
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,060
I think I didn't bring my phone

668
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,260
I've found her. I'll send our location

669
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,300
They found her. Turn right ahead

670
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,620
I'm glad they found her

671
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,980
How did this happen?

672
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,940
Actually, I know that Aunt has been
kind of depressed, so I went to see her today

673
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,820
She seemed fine so I thought she got better

674
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,180
No one can accept something like that

675
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,740
Think about it. Children will certainly
be devastated losing their parents

676
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,540
But it's something they have expected

677
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,620
Their parents will leave them one day

678
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,280
But no parent will expect losing their child

679
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,900
There's a Chinese saying
"To see one's child die before oneself"

680
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,980
Uncle, how have you been lately?

681
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,340
At this age, having illness is common

682
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,840
The doctor said it's a lifestyle disease

683
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,380
It's chronic. There's no use worrying

684
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,140
Taking medications on time
and living healthily is treatment itself

685
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,160
I've always been quick-tempered

686
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,260
I've caused you lots of trouble
in Beijing last time

687
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,540
I hope you won't be mad at me

688
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,740
How can I be mad at you?

689
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:08,320
As long as you and Aunt are well
that's all that matters

690
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,140
I'm alright. Don't worry

691
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,780
I'm fine

692
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,020
What are you two doing here?

693
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,980
Gosh

694
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,020
I'm fine. I was just forgetful

695
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,940
I left my phone at home. I'm fine

696
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,180
I know

697
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,740
Jing Jing had depression. I know that

698
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,020
I've also looked it up on the internet

699
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,500
Many people are suffering from it nowadays

700
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,540
Even their closest friend or their parents
won't be able to tell

701
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,660
That is why...

702
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,580
It's none of your fault

703
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,700
Don't be hard on yourself

704
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,820
Jing Jing doesn't like
seeing all of you cry. Okay?

705
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,820
All of you are my children

706
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,540
This is what I think

707
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,420
It doesn't matter if you're in Beijing
or back at the hometown

708
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,380
Or anywhere in the world

709
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,380
As long as you are all happy and healthy

710
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,020
then I'm happy. Okay?

711
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,380
That's enough

712
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,260
Don't cry

713
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,260
Don't cry, okay?

714
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,020
Hush now

715
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,420
I'll always be with you all

716
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,780
Those who are gone, are gone

717
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,020
Those who are alive
still have to carry on living

718
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,180
We've sent your aunt home
What about the three of you?

719
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,460
You all were even crying together earlier
Why are you keeping quiet now?

720
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,580
I guess you just need a drink
How about this?

721
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,700
Since you're Nan Jia's younger sisters,
that means you're like my younger sisters

722
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,620
Come to our place
My wife will make you supper

723
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,860
Let's get some drinks
I'm sure you'll be able to talk it out

724
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,380
Come on. Let's go to my house

725
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,180
Come and take a look at our posh little place
that my wife decorated

726
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:09,420
It's huge. A floor-through apartment
with an open balcony

727
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,180
I don't think it's nice for us to visit

728
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,140
Just drop us off somewhere ahead

729
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,820
We're almost at our house
Listen to me. Come to my place

730
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,660
Plus, a house like ours
would cost at least 10 million in Beijing

731
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,340
But in Baishan, you can get
a 200 m² house for less than one million

732
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,420
That means it's only 5,000 yuan per m²

733
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,620
- So the down payment for 100 m²...
- Less than 100,000 yuan

734
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,780
- That's even considered steep
- Less than 100,000 yuan?

735
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,500
Drop us off at Huaqing Hot Springs

736
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,980
Come on. You must have a sincere talk

737
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,140
- You talk too much
- Fine

738
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,340
Okay then. I'll listen to my wife

739
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,180
Huaqing Hot Springs, it is

740
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,340
- What was that for, Nan Jia?
- I thought you've turned against me

741
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,580
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back for New Year?

742
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,260
You didn't tell us either

743
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,420
Are you two ganging up on me now?

744
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,060
Thanks for helping me find my aunt earlier

745
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,520
She's right. We should look ahead

746
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,900
- Drink up
- Cheers

747
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,340
Okay. I'll say it first

748
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,700
I'm sorry. I was wrong that day

749
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,740
I know you two said it for my own good

750
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,940
I think what you said that day
wasn't wrong either

751
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,620
I'm somewhat responsible
for what happened to Jing Jing

752
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,940
In that case, I'm mostly to blame
I'm her cousin sister

753
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,860
If Jing Jing were to be here now
I'm sure she wouldn't like hearing these

754
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,020
So from now on, whoever
says things like that, I'm going to...

755
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,980
- Stop gawking
- Cheers

756
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,300
I'm still hanging out
with two young girls at my age

757
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,660
Stop laughing! Your hand

758
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,180
Be honest with me. What's going on
with you and Shen Zi Chang?

759
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,860
You've broken up for real?

760
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,520
We kept quarreling, but this time
he's adamant about breaking up

761
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,300
I realized something from this

762
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,060
We used to say that...

763
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,300
Jing Jing never opened up to us

764
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,360
But with friends...

765
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,120
No matter how close you are, you still

766
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,740
don't wish to let others see
the pathetic side of you

767
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,620
What are friends, Xu Yan?

768
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,220
Friends are people who protect you
when you're going through your dark days

769
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,380
Those are real friends

770
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,660
Some people don't like troubling others
as they don't want others to trouble them

771
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,300
But real friends. I mean, your real friends

772
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,580
They won't care
if you trouble them or vice versa

773
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,700
Well said

774
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,300
Listen up, you two

775
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:58,420
If there's anything I can trouble you with
in the future, I'll never handle it myself

776
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,620
What are you going to do?

777
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,860
I'll knock on your door

778
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,700
- What if I refuse to let you in?
- I'll camp at your doorstep

779
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,580
You'll come outside eventually

780
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,260
Then let's do this from here on

781
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,060
Whether we're happy or sad...
Whatever that is bothering us

782
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,380
we must tell each other
Don't keep it to yourselves

783
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,460
- Make sure you keep your word
- Pinky promise

784
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,540
My noble fingers

785
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,900
This is so childish

786
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,700
- Cheers!
- Cheers

787
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,420
Who's playing music?

788
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,160
Why is there music?

789
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,340
- Who is it?
- It's midnight. I have to change the water

790
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,980
Go outside and take a break
You can come back in when I'm done

791
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,060
You!

792
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,380
- Who is that guy?
- No idea

793
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,180
- You're the guy who ripped me off
- Why did you...

794
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,980
- Why did you rip her off?
- Yes. Why?

795
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,620
Why are the three of you
accusing me with that pretty face?

796
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,700
Don't compliment us or we can't argue back

797
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,420
How come you're a street seller by day
and a hot spring cleaner by night?

798
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,100
- Yes. How come?
- How come?

799
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,540
This place is mine

800
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,740
- You opened this place?
- Can't you tell from how I look?

801
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,220
What's so funny?

802
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,460
Give us free kuaci

803
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,620
- But...
- Yes. Kuaci

804
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,780
Why did you rip me off when you're rich?

805
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,860
Why do you keep saying that I ripped you off?

806
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,620
If you call me "Brother", I'll give
each of you 1 kg of roasted seeds after this

807
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,980
- Give me 1 kg, Brother!
- Brother...

808
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,960
I'll give you 2.5 kg each if you get out
I have work to do

809
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,900
- We will
- Let's not take things too far

810
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,300
After all, he has lost 7.5 kg

811
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,980
Did I do the math right?

812
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,180
I have a suggestion for you. The water
is too hot that my legs have turned red

813
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,300
- Give it a good scrub
- Keep up the good work

814
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,540
Make sure you scrub it clean

815
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,260
Gosh, those drunk ladies

816
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,700
There's even a place like that in this region

817
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,660
I couldn't believe it when I came here today

818
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,220
Bathhouses are the pillars of the industry
here in the northeast

819
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,640
I think we should just open
a bathhouse together

820
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,740
- We'd definitely make more money
- It's not that easy

821
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,580
You must know the people, place,
and the industry well to do business

822
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,860
None of us know anything

823
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,900
We do. Isn't this our hometown?

824
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,260
I seriously don't. No kidding

825
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,460
When we were still in school, I remember
we used to meet up at that department store

826
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,420
I almost couldn't find it today

827
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,180
Everyone seemed to have other places to go

828
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,620
Only old people were hanging around
that department store

829
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,060
That's just you
Coming back home this time round

830
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,580
I think it's pretty nice here

831
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,580
I can get anything I want here

832
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,260
Even shopping malls and cafes

833
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,520
Whatever the big city has
we have it here too

834
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,840
Plus, didn't you hear what Da Dong said?

835
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,180
Down payment for a house
is only about 100,000 yuan

836
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,580
If Shen Zi Chang and I buy a house here
so many problems would've been solved

837
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,940
Tell me about it. I felt sentimental
coming home this time

838
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,240
Back then when I was a student
I always thought

839
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,660
"I must travel as far away from home
as possible. All the way to space"

840
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,780
But after coming home this time
I felt that...

841
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,240
It's pretty nice back home
There's everything I want

842
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,660
Me too

843
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,080
Then...

844
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,760
Why can't we come home?

845
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,540
I've changed the water
You can get back in there if you want

846
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,180
- You're working so hard, sir
- Seriously, you three

847
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,460
You drank from the year 2020 to 2021

848
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,820
- It's the new year already?
- It's 2021!

849
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:42,420
Let's make a toast, girls
I've thought of what to say

850
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,300
May all the unhappy things in 2020 be gone

851
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,900
- Be gone
- Cheers!

852
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,500
- Happy new year
- Happy new year!

853
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,100
How much have they drank?

854
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,740
Those local girls can't live without alcohol

855
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,260
You two are ridiculous

856
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,260
Hey!

857
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,380
What are you doing?

858
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,500
Come here

859
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,180
Right here. See?

860
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:33,340
I've linked my account for you

861
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,740
Just tap here
if you want to buy anything next time

862
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,860
Don't make payment though
I'll pay for it myself

863
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,980
I snapped up two red packets this morning
but I can't find the money

864
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,020
- Money-grubber
- I'll show you

865
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,940
Tap here. See the money?

866
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,500
Here, where you pay
Tap this and you can see the amount

867
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:52,980
- Got it?
- Okay

868
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,380
Download the application where
I just have to scan and it will translate

869
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,980
Pretending to keep up with trend

870
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,060
- You need a translation app?
- That's right

871
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,100
- I have to keep learning, right?
- By the way, Chen Chen

872
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:10,860
The robotic vacuum cleaner you got for us
isn't working anymore

873
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,460
Your dad couldn't fix it

874
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,940
Don't worry. I'll fix it for you

875
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,860
Stop buying these high-tech gadgets

876
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,940
The two of us can't operate it
You'll just be wasting money

877
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,220
Don't be silly
Just give me a video call anytime

878
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,740
I'll teach you step by step
I guarantee you'll know how to use it

879
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:30,900
It's not that we're worried
we don't know how to use it

880
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,940
We just don't want you to spend money on us

881
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,900
You need to spend a lot
living alone in Beijing

882
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,140
- That's right
- Keep those hard-earned money for yourself

883
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,020
- That's right
- Listen. I have more than enough to spend

884
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,660
If you say that
then I have to talk to you seriously

885
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,900
About what?

886
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,680
You'll be turning 27 soon

887
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,780
If you've found a boyfriend in Beijing
then I...

888
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,900
I have to stop you right here
What are you talking about?

889
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,120
Let's set this boyfriend matter aside first

890
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,580
So what if I'm 27?

891
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:11,140
There are many girls my age in Beijing
who aren't married

892
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,740
My silly girl. Do you think your mom and I
are so eager to marry you off?

893
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:26,980
I'm still reluctant to let my precious girl
be someone else's daughter-in-law

894
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,900
What I want to tell you is
you're not young anymore at 27

895
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:37,340
But your dad and I aren't forcing you to
get married quickly just for the sake of it

896
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,220
You're a big girl now
You have your own thinking

897
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,620
Your dad and I trust your judgment

898
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:50,180
We didn't raise you just so that you could
look after us when we're old

899
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,400
Earlier you said the money you've earned
is for us. It shouldn't be

900
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,260
Furthermore, we're both not retired yet

901
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,700
Even if we are
our retirement salary would be enough

902
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,020
- Yes
- We didn't support your education

903
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,140
expecting you to be very successful

904
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,260
Are you saying we shouldn't have let
our daughter go to school?

905
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,580
- That's against the law
- Alright. My goodness

906
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,940
That's not what I'm saying

907
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:19,300
What I'm trying to say is
it's difficult living in Beijing

908
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,900
There's nothing much we can do to help you

909
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,380
We don't expect you to make it big in Beijing

910
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,860
Nor do we need you
to have a big house in Beijing just for us

911
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,220
And work yourself to the bone to earn money

912
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:36,300
We don't need all that
We just want you to be happy

913
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,980
As long as you're happy in life
your dad and I will be happy

914
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:47,060
If you're happy working in Beijing now
then work hard for your career

915
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:50,700
If you're not happy in Beijing in the future
and want to come home

916
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,540
the two of us would be over the moon

917
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:59,400
But of course. If you want to go
somewhere else, we'll also support you

918
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:05,660
Remember this. You must live for yourself

919
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:09,700
Don't worry about us
We have lives of our own

920
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,980
Yes, my daughter. Your mom is right

921
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:17,980
As long as you're happy
you can do whatever you want

922
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,220
You two are the best

923
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,940
You're my only daughter
Who else is going to dote on you if I don't?

924
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,540
That's enough
How did we end up buying so much?

925
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,420
- Is there something you don't like?
- I'm old. Fashion doesn't matter anymore

926
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:44,060
You're not that old
Everyone in Beijing dresses fashionably

927
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,060
Besides, don't you have a wedding
to attend next week? Wear what I got you

928
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,080
Yes, you're right. You're so thoughtful

929
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,420
Here you go, Mom. Let's rest for a while
then we'll go buy shoes

930
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,780
Didn't I get you those shoes two years ago?
I'll get you new ones

931
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,720
These shoes get comfier the more I wear them

932
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,200
New shoes hurt my feet
I don't like wearing new shoes

933
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,460
Stop buying things for me
You should save up for yourself

934
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,980
When do you and Shen Zi Chang
plan to get married?

935
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,160
You said you two were saving up
to buy a house. How is it going now?

936
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,300
What does that mean?

937
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,740
Are his parents still against it?

938
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,740
How about I go to Beijing with you
to meet them?

939
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:37,740
You two have been together for so long
but I haven't properly met his parents

940
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:41,980
Why would you go to them?
They should be coming to you

941
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,260
It doesn't matter who goes to whom

942
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,980
- I don't mind
- I do

943
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,380
You brat...

944
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,140
- Be honest with me. Did you two fight again?
- No

945
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,900
- Then why...
- Please, Mom! Just stay out of it

946
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,740
Most importantly, register your marriage
first. The rest can be discussed later

947
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,500
Listen to me

948
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,580
Mom. Happy new year! I love you!

949
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,300
Love you

950
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,100
You always interrupt me

951
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,740
Ready?

952
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:47,899
Let's go

953
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,899
The hometown we were once familiar with
has become a strange place to us

954
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,500
Even though our family that we miss are here

955
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,899
and also friends we have known for years

956
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,899
and also the flavors that we miss the most

957
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:50,399
Those streets that are no longer
familiar to us

958
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,860
Those conversations
that we aren't able to join in

959
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,740
Those drastic changes

960
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,300
They are constantly reminding us

961
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,020
that this is no longer
the hometown we remembered

962
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:18,440
Can we still return to this hometown?
