1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Neither of them are to my taste

2
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,000
Mom, I've chosen two pieces for you
Which one do you like?

3
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,340
Oh

4
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,000
Neither of them are to my taste

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:34,000
(Remembrance of Things Past)
Neither of them are to my taste

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
How about this? I think the color is nice

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
This is too flashy

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,039
It's not. All the Beijing ladies
at your age dress like this

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,120
Do you think it is appropriate
for me to wear this in hometown?

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,600
- It looks nice
- It suits you better

11
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,450
You rarely come to Beijing
Why don't you buy some clothes?

12
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,120
- Pick the ones you like
-Is it a must to buy new clothes here?

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,759
- I need to answer a phone call
- Okay

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Director

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,670
- May I help you?
- Can you do me a favor?

16
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,320
Tell my daughter none of these suits me

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,800
Madam, you are funny
Your daughter looks obedient

18
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,710
She is but I don't want her
to buy me clothes

19
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,520
I don't need new clothes. Help me, okay?

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,120
- Alright, I'll help you
- Thank you very much

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,260
Mom

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
What's your pick?

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,640
None of these suits me
and they don't have my size

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,520
Lady, you've run out of my size, right?

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,960
Sorry, we run out of certain sizes

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,560
Look, they don't have all the sizes

27
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
Why don't we go to the discount area?

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Mom, I am not broke

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,760
I know you are not but they don't suit me

30
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,040
How about this? It looks good

31
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,010
- This looks okay
- Right?

32
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,030
- Yes
- Try it on

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,880
Alright. Lady

34
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
- I'll take you there
- Alright

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,560
(Episode 8: Family Tie)

36
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,280
Lady, you had an operation

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,320
Why don't you take a longer rest?

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,840
It's just a minimally invasive operation

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,440
Also, the new product is going to launch
I can't even miss a day

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,720
Do you have to work so hard?
Did you forget about Xiao Jia?

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,960
I didn't

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,280
Don't worry, I am certain
that my condition is good

43
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,680
Mr Jian entrusted me
with this important task

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,800
I must not drop the ball, right?

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
You're right

46
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,680
You must come to me if you need help

47
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't worry, I'll definitely do so

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,800
- I'm going over
- Okay

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,160
You just got discharged, cut down on coffee

50
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,260
Have some fruit juice to get enough vitamin

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,600
It helps in recovery

52
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,120
It doesn't look nice but it tastes good
I've tried it

53
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,720
You can give it a try

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,520
Thank you for that day

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,180
No worries, I won't turn
a blind eye to such situation

56
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,560
You just happened to be there, right?

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
You are a busybody, right?

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
No, I'm just...

59
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,380
Hello

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
What?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,880
I'm in office

62
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,020
No

63
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Where are you?

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
Alright, I'll be right there

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,320
Mr Jian, can I take an emergency leave?

66
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,160
I'll give you back after washing it
Thank you

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
Yes, Mr Jian

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
I need to talk to you

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,159
Qiao Xi Chen

70
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,280
Here we are

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,020
Chen Chen, don't bother

72
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,680
- We are going out soon
- We will just stay for a while

73
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Come in!

74
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
Your place looks pretty new

75
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,240
The decoration is nice

76
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,640
Chen Chen, how many bedrooms are there?

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,080
There is only one
The one on the right is the washroom

78
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,040
Feel free to use it

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,400
There's only one bedroom?

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
We'll need to squeeze up, right?

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,400
- It's fine, we'll sleep on the sofa
- That's right!

82
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,120
It can accommodate us

83
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,420
Don't worry, let's take the seat

84
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,720
- It looks pretty
- Did you sleep on the couch too?

85
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,720
We seldom come here

86
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,440
If it weren't for Brother

87
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,900
we wouldn't come here

88
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,820
Just rough it

89
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,760
Well

90
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
- It is a bit hot
- Drink slowly

91
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
It's fine

92
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,800
Uncle, what do you want to have? My treat

93
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,400
Since we are in Beijing
we must not miss the roast duck, right?

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,980
It's the most famous restaurant in Beijing

95
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,240
What is the name?

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,320
The most famous restaurant for roast duck

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,540
We'll go there!

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,220
Uncle, that is a bit far

99
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,440
We're not in the downtown. How about
going to a nearby restaurant today?

100
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
- Okay
- Sure

101
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
It's fine! The distance is not an issue

102
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,100
We are not hungry yet

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,050
Dad, it's really far
The trip takes two hours

104
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,200
Together with the traffic jam,
it'll be a torture

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,540
Yes. It is not necessary

106
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,960
Uncle, we have
a nice roast duck restaurant downstairs

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,820
A lot of locals come all the way here
for the roast duck

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,880
Brother, the locals approve of it
It is absolutely authentic

109
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,520
- We'll have our dinner there
- Sure, we are fine with anything

110
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,300
- Aunt!
- Why is there a cat?

111
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,100
No

112
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,380
It's fine

113
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,760
- Why is there a cat?
- Don't worry, Aunt

114
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,120
It's Gou Dan and it is nice

115
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
It is gentle and doesn't scratch

116
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,760
Its fur will be everywhere!

117
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,320
It's fine, I'll clean it

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,720
It is Chen Chen's pet

119
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
Have some orange

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,500
Uncle, Aunt, have some orange
Mom, help me clear the bedroom

121
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,880
Okay. You'll get some rest here
I'll help her clear the room

122
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,360
- Thank you, Chen Chen
- Just leave it alone

123
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,320
You should have let me know beforehand

124
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,800
It is an urgency

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,520
The doctor said something
seems wrong with your uncle's liver

126
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,240
during his medical check-up last month

127
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,440
The doctor suggested
going to a major hospital

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,520
So your aunt decided to come to Beijing

129
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
And so, here we are

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,960
Is Uncle fine?

131
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Beats us

132
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,120
- I hope he is fine
- Which hospital are they going? How about

133
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,880
staying in a hotel nearby the hospital?
My place is away from downtown

134
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,440
Well

135
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,880
Seriously? Are you really staying here?

136
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,400
Your father is to blame

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,000
He casually gave a promise

138
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,240
When your aunt proposed staying at your place

139
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,800
he said yes before I could respond

140
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,600
You can see that my place
is too small for all of you

141
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,740
Your father never considers this

142
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,240
Well, we can't blame your father

143
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,480
Your aunt has made the request

144
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,680
We can't say no, right?

145
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,920
- No, he is to blame
- Listen

146
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,760
It's just few days, just bear with it, okay?

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,660
- Thank you, my good daughter
- You must sleep in the bed

148
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,640
- I'll sleep on the ground
- No!

149
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
Alright

150
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,240
- Enjoy your meal
- Thank you

151
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,760
Here, Uncle. They are
as good as the restaurant you mentioned

152
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,880
- It's packed during the meal time
- Let's have a taste

153
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,680
The locals approve of it, it's surely good

154
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,320
Brother, let me toast to you

155
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,760
Go easy on that. Uncle has a bad liver

156
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,440
Yes, Chen Chen is right. Restrain yourself

157
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,660
Beer is water for me

158
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,820
Chen Chen

159
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,400
It's said that some card is needed
to receive medical advice in Beijing

160
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,480
Can you get one for your uncle

161
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,120
and make an appointment for him?

162
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,700
Sure. Which hospital are you going?

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,560
Your cousin had searched online

164
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,620
There is a hospital called You Hao Hospital

165
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,680
with an excellent specialist named Zhang

166
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,840
You Hao Hospital is indeed good

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,380
But it's hard to book an appointment
I have to check it online

168
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,340
I think there will be a waiting list

169
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,380
How long will the waiting time be?

170
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,600
It's hard to gauge
It might take a month or two

171
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,880
if the Dr Zhang is really skilled

172
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,460
A month or two?

173
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,100
I might be dead before I got to see him

174
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,800
- What nonsense are you talking?
- That's right! Don't talk nonsense

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,460
Don't worry, Uncle
The medical standards here are high

176
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,660
You don't have to choose the doctor

177
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
The main thing is do the examination

178
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,540
I'll get a general doctor
and maybe you can get it done tomorrow

179
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,940
That's right!

180
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,820
- There's no difference
- That's right

181
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,180
It's definitely different

182
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,320
Chen Chen has been
staying in Beijing for years

183
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,320
She surely has a way to book the appointment

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,380
Chen Chen, am I right?

185
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,180
- Aunt
- Brother

186
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,240
Why don't we

187
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,220
just leave this matter to Chen Chen?

188
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
You should enjoy your stay in Beijing

189
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll accompany you to the hospital
after the appointment is made

190
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,700
Girl, this tastes good

191
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,300
Gou Dan

192
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
You can't fall asleep too, right?

193
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,700
Don't worry

194
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,220
They are leaving soon

195
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,200
I'll buy you canned food tomorrow

196
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,440
Do you have any suggestion on the pricing?

197
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,280
Feel free to say it out

198
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,240
Allow me to point it out

199
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,920
Our featured product is the Master Series

200
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,540
But it is still an instant coffee

201
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,120
19 yuan has reached the price threshold

202
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,260
Now, you set the price at 25 yuan

203
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,460
To be honest

204
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,700
people can get a fresh ground coffee
at this price

205
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,400
Why should they choose our instant coffee?

206
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,180
Why should they buy our instant coffee?

207
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,820
The raw material prices in Kenya

208
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,460
have risen, so we have to
make an adjustment accordingly

209
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,540
What is the point if it doesn't sell?

210
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,900
Basically, I agree with the sales department

211
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,500
Well, I'll give you half a month's time

212
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,580
to find a replacement
for our current coffee beans

213
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,820
We're doing it but we haven't
found one with a good quality

214
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,800
We'll keep looking for it

215
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,450
- Please hurry
- Okay

216
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,200
Got it. Sorry for the trouble

217
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,240
Are you okay?

218
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm fine

219
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm sorry, Mr Jian

220
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,320
Well

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,540
Sorry, Mr Jian. The sun made me sleepy

222
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,840
It's okay. I just want to know

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,960
if the project is too tiring

224
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,780
I'm tired but it's not because of the project

225
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Is it because of Lin Rui?

226
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
No!

227
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,000
It is a family issue

228
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,640
Do you need help?

229
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,880
No, thanks

230
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,960
I should go

231
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,640
By the way

232
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,420
if you can't rest well here
I'll pass you my car key

233
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
The car is more comfortable

234
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
It's fine, thank you

235
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,400
Tell Lao Ma we will order
the seafood from him this time

236
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,400
Give him the list
of categories and quantities

237
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,920
- Got it
- Let me check if I left out anything

238
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,200
The seafood, the beef

239
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,480
Yes, Mom. What's going on?

240
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
What? What happened to Aunt?

241
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,200
Calm down, talk slowly

242
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,080
I personally like your coffee beans
It's good

243
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,000
But I don't have the say

244
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,040
I need to wait for the feedback
from superiors

245
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,120
Alright, thank you

246
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,880
I'll buy you a meal when you come here
or when I'm in Yunnan

247
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
Alright, have an early night

248
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Why are you still working at night?

249
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,560
I have no choice, I have to
settle this issue to give an account

250
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,140
I think your superior is good

251
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,260
He was so manly the other day

252
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,340
Something must be going on

253
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,620
Did I smile?

254
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Seriously, I'm really upset

255
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,720
What's bothering you?

256
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,440
This is my situation now

257
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,320
I can't work him out

258
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,040
If you say he has a crush on me

259
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,520
he never expressed it

260
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,140
If you say he doesn't like me

261
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,200
he always shows his concern to me

262
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,960
What about you?

263
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,280
I do have a soft spot for him

264
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,840
But it's doesn't count
I can't ask him, right?

265
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,760
What if he doesn't have any feelings
for me and I got him wrong?

266
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,320
We're in the same company
and he's my superior. Should I quit then?

267
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,440
That's true. This is the problem
with office romance

268
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,400
Could you pass me the corn?

269
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,720
Can you stop eating?

270
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,480
You've eaten two. You'll gain weight

271
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,280
The corns from our hometown taste good

272
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,860
The taste is great. Else, why should
my parents bring them all the way here?

273
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,180
They kept reminding me to give you more

274
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,660
Thank them for me

275
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,380
Talking about this

276
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,620
I don't know what my father is thinking

277
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,660
He insisted on letting
my uncle and aunt stay at my place

278
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,440
I proposed booking a hotel for them
and he refused

279
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,680
He said I wasn't being a good host
if I didn't let them stay with me

280
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,880
So I wanted stay at your place
and he said no again

281
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,140
Then, he was angry
and complained that I threw a tantrum

282
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,460
Fortunately, my mother is sensible

283
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,440
This is a small case. I remember living
in a shared house before graduation

284
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,120
Those distant relatives came to my place

285
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,620
My mother insisted on them staying with me

286
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,180
There was just a single bed
and the couple lied on it

287
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,280
The husband fell down
and almost broke his arm

288
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,400
My mother wanted to show off
that I was in Beijing. That's annoying

289
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,760
They think staying in Beijing
equates living a good life

290
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,560
This is their mentality

291
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,580
They only see the apparent bright side

292
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,740
Can you read more?

293
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,840
Shut up!

294
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,840
(Remembrance of Things Past)

295
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,940
Do you hear that, Sister? She's shameless!

296
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,340
Do you know what the others say about us?

297
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,980
It's nothing to do with me

298
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,020
Why can't I

299
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,420
have my own child?

300
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
Lin Li Fang, listen!

301
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,780
- Try it if you dare!
- Keep your voice down!

302
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,660
Here you are! Come in

303
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,600
Talk to your aunt

304
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,660
She insists on an artificial insemination

305
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,220
- Fang!
- Aunt!

306
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,660
See who is here

307
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,820
Jia Jia

308
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,220
You understand me

309
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,460
Your mother and the rest don't understand me

310
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,980
But you know me the best

311
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,340
Right?

312
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,260
Aunt

313
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,620
Just tell me what you want to do

314
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,380
I just want a child of my own

315
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,980
Am I causing anyone trouble?

316
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,580
Why can't I do it?

317
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,500
It is good that Jia Jia is here

318
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,760
Jia Jia, look
Your aunt is already 52 years old

319
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,740
Have you seen a woman
in her fifties bearing a baby?

320
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
People will surely laugh at you

321
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,420
That's because

322
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,100
they didn't lose their daughter
in their fifties!

323
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,460
Just cry it out

324
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,300
Why are you lying here
and not going for lunch?

325
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,220
Miao, you're here just in time

326
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,420
I need your help. Do you know any scalper?

327
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,520
It's not Spring Festival

328
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,120
- Why do you need a train ticket?
- No

329
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,380
I need to book an appointment at hospital

330
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,390
A relative of mine came here
for medical advice

331
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,620
He insists on seeing the expert he wants
and not anyone else

332
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,780
I've checked every apps

333
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,600
The waiting time is two months,
isn't it crazy?

334
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,620
What are you laughing at?

335
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,580
I really don't have a way for this

336
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,300
But I can give you an idea

337
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,320
Now, appointments are made online
You need to keep refreshing the page

338
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,780
His appointments are fully booked

339
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,780
In this case, you can only
go to the hospital and try your luck

340
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,300
I must get it done
even at the expense of my sleep

341
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,420
How does it taste?

342
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,420
It isn't fruity enough

343
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,640
Please try this

344
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,300
Ou Yang and I think its fruity flavor
is the closest to the one we want

345
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,840
Hmm

346
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,100
Do you agree?

347
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,940
It tastes similar to that

348
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,380
Where is this coffee bean from?

349
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,820
It is from Yunnan

350
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,460
The feature of Kenya coffee beans
is the fruitiness

351
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,510
So I wondered
how to find the best replacement

352
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,500
Thanks to its geography, Yunnan

353
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,940
produces strong coffee beans

354
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,420
with sweet fruit notes but less bitterness

355
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,880
I went to Yunnan for a business trip before

356
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,540
So I asked my friend
to get me some coffee beans

357
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
These are the pick after my careful selection

358
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,040
They are similar to the original one

359
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,100
We're lucky, right?

360
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
- Right?
- Yes

361
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,380
What is the annual production

362
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,380
of this coffee bean?

363
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,800
It is enough to cope with our new launch

364
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,420
And its price is half of the current one

365
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,300
Well, what are we waiting for?

366
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,760
Send it to the R&D department
and let them evaluate it

367
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,860
Alright!

368
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,460
Wait a minute!

369
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,580
I heard you are going to book
a doctor appointment tomorrow

370
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,260
How do you know about it?

371
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,300
You talked so loud with Miao Miao
It's hard for me to ignore it

372
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm going to hospital too. We can go together

373
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,140
- Which hospital are you going?
- I...

374
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,260
I can go to any hospital
Which one are you going?

375
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,320
- You Hao Hospital
- I can go to there too

376
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,740
So we're going together
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning

377
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,100
What are you looking at? Lose no time
and send it to the R&D department

378
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
Mr Jian

379
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,900
What if I'm not going to You Hao Hospital?

380
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm kidding. I'm going there

381
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
- I'll scan you
- Goodbye

382
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,300
Goodbye, Madam Zhang

383
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,100
- Nan Jia, you are back
- I'm back to visit my parents

384
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,140
You're back in time

385
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,640
Talk to your aunt

386
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,060
Something seems wrong with her recently

387
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,540
What is wrong with her?

388
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,540
Didn't your mother tell you?

389
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,260
I thought you already know it

390
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,240
I heard that your aunt

391
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,340
wants an artificial insemination

392
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,440
She wants a child, come on

393
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,760
Is that so funny?

394
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,960
Why are you out, Uncle?

395
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,700
Come on, have a drink with me

396
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,400
Here! Your noodles!

397
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,960
- Alright! Here!
- I'll help myself

398
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,340
Let's eat

399
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,240
- Uncle, don't bother
- Enjoy your meal

400
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,880
Dumplings for welcoming
and noodles for parting

401
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,980
We made you back all the way

402
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,860
- Here! Eat this!
- I have one here

403
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,160
- Eat it, Uncle
- This is better than Beijing's

404
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,200
Eat it, Jing Jing loved their noodles too

405
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,980
Uncle

406
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,920
- I think my aunt...
- I know

407
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,020
Since Jing Jing passed away

408
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,460
your aunt looks out the window
in a daze every day

409
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,700
Sometimes, she just sits there
almost the entire day

410
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,380
We don't know what she's looking at

411
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,660
One night

412
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,180
she suddenly asked me

413
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
if she can die before me

414
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,080
as she doesn't know how to live alone

415
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,280
Jing Jing was our only child

416
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,440
We never expected her
to support us when we're old

417
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,780
But Jia Jia

418
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
every parent

419
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,280
longs for their child

420
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,700
Can you imagine that?

421
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,280
The one you long for is gone all of a sudden

422
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,640
and you end up being alone

423
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,520
Stop talking like that, Uncle

424
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,540
I'm still here for you

425
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,380
- I know
- Ming and Cheng will be your support too

426
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,100
We are all your children

427
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,500
I understand

428
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,560
I understand and it's true

429
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,780
But something is still different

430
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,820
Your aunt...

431
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,260
In fact, Jia Jia...

432
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,420
You know me. I've lived half my life

433
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,700
I really have no way out now

434
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,360
Please persuade your aunt

435
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,700
You're successful
and have been living in Beijing

436
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,660
She will listen to you

437
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,960
Can you please help me?

438
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,040
I'm begging you! You didn't see her condition

439
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,640
I know, I want to change her mind too

440
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,600
I'll talk to her

441
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,400
Eat the noodles, it's getting soggy

442
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,300
Eat it

443
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,360
I approached my ex-colleague abroad

444
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,620
He has a way to get
the AA grade Kenya coffee beans

445
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,620
with only one-third of the price

446
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,300
I've brought back the sample

447
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,100
Should we send it to the R&D department?

448
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,700
All Kenya coffee beans are sold by CBK alone

449
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,700
- Your friend's channel...
- It's absolutely safe

450
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,060
He was a coffee bean procurer
when he was abroad

451
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,940
So I believe he has his own way

452
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,420
Qiao Xi Chen brought back
coffee beans from Yunnan

453
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,580
The quality is similar to the one we want

454
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,380
It's been send to the R&D department
and they are refining the taste

455
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,180
Mr Jian, with due respect

456
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,460
there's still a gap
between the one from Yunnan and this

457
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,140
But its price is only half of the price now

458
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,020
I'm not price-sensitive

459
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,860
However, when the qualities are similar

460
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,020
the pricing is one of my main concerns

461
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,420
I got it

462
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,060
Well, I'll meet with my friend again

463
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,060
and see if we can get a cheaper price

464
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,620
Send the beans to the R&D department
and let them try both

465
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,020
Alright

466
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,780
By the way, Jia Jia

467
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,020
I want to clarify something

468
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,980
Do you remember

469
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,140
your aunt's cholecystitis surgery
in Beijing three years ago?

470
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,120
I do, is there any problem with the surgery?

471
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,620
No, she recovered very well

472
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,600
The thing is...

473
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,440
Did Jing Jing borrow 20,000 yuan from you?

474
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,220
I just want to know if she's paid you back

475
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,660
I'll repay it if she hasn't

476
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,720
When did she borrow money from me?

477
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,300
No way

478
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,220
Wait, your aunt

479
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,220
insisted on having her surgery in Beijing

480
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,540
We were so anxious

481
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,420
Suddenly, Jing Jing told us she got the money

482
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,320
We were wondering

483
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,720
where she got the money.
She told us it was from you

484
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,740
Did you forget it?

485
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,120
Uncle

486
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,540
I got to ask you a question

487
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,200
Did you and Aunt notice

488
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,020
if something was wrong with Jing Jing
before she passed away?

489
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,780
Try to recall it. When she called you

490
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,820
did you notice something unusual?

491
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,600
Frankly speaking, her mom
was the one who talked to her

492
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,800
Your aunt told me she was alright
What's wrong?

493
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,000
Uncle

494
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,680
I only learned it after she passed away

495
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,860
She was suffering from depression

496
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,240
What?

497
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,240
Wait

498
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,320
Isn't depression a kind of mental disorder?

499
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,120
- How could it...
- It's not what you think

500
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,320
She did suffer from mental illness

501
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
but it wasn't psychosis

502
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,940
Wait, Jia Jia

503
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,679
Jing Jing is your cousin

504
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,239
She's outgoing. That can't be

505
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,960
No way, no one in our family suffers
from this. Where did you hear this?

506
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,880
The doctor said it

507
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,000
It can happen to anyone

508
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,060
It can be caused by acute stress
or repressed emotions

509
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:36,739
That's why I asked you
when her symptoms set in

510
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,120
Your aunt answered her calls
and said she was alright

511
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,440
- and you were doing very well
- I'm sorry, Uncle

512
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,800
It's not a large amount

513
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,900
I just paid the 30,000 yuan deposit
The doctor said that's about it

514
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,940
Do you still have money?
Should I wire you some?

515
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,960
I do

516
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,520
You just got a job, stop pretending

517
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,580
Stop focusing on me

518
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,380
You have to mind your health

519
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,080
I've made your doctor appointment next month

520
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,200
I'll send you the screenshot, save the date

521
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,100
Why are you still sitting here at this hour?

522
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,780
- I'm looking at this
- What is this?

523
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,540
Enough

524
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,000
Stop crying

525
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,540
Mom, I have to ask you a question

526
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,300
What's the matter?

527
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,980
I am sure Jing Jing
didn't borrow money from me

528
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,740
Why did she lie to Aunt?

529
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,280
Don't you know your aunt's character?

530
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,700
She's the youngest daughter in the family

531
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,980
No matter what happens
as long as she opens her mouth

532
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,740
I, her eldest sister

533
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,140
and your uncles

534
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,100
never hesitate to lend her a hand

535
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,300
It stands to reason

536
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,180
for her to think

537
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,220
that you helped Jing Jing

538
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,150
You're Jing Jing's cousin
and both of you were in Beijing

539
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,820
Also, your salary is higher

540
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,880
Jeez

541
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,160
Don't you know Jing Jing's character?

542
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,360
She's a tough person

543
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,780
Would she ask for help?

544
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,080
I would rather she were weaker

545
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,800
I only learned these from your aunt
after Jing Jing's passing

546
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,920
Over the years, Jing Jing was supporting her

547
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,420
Her operation, the new house

548
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,460
and the whip-rounds

549
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,580
I got it

550
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,340
Jing Jing claimed she borrowed money
from me, in fact, she didn't

551
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,900
No wonder she was thrifty

552
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,740
She complained that
she wasn't able to save money

553
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,960
What a silly girl!

554
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,840
She was a nice girl

555
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,560
I'll park here, the hospital
has limited parking lots

556
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,840
- Alright
- You'll stay here

557
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,120
Give me the card, I'll do the registration

558
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,200
- Why?
- I checked online

559
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,440
There will be a long line

560
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,000
You can catch up on some sleep here

561
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,760
No, we can go together

562
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,480
I am your superior, listen to me
You'll catch some sleep here

563
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,320
It's not the office hours
Don't pull rank on me

564
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,380
Tell me which department
you're going, I'll...

565
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,640
I got it

566
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
I got it

567
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,680
There are only the two of us here

568
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,440
Is it something which you're shy to tell?

569
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,000
What?

570
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,960
It surely is. Look

571
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,200
- Come on
- I understand it

572
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,680
- I am in the pink of health
- I won't leak it

573
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,400
It is not. Give me the card and don't dawdle

574
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
The line might have been longer

575
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,760
Fine, go ahead

576
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
I forget what I heard, thanks

577
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,080
- I am healthy
- I understand, go

578
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,680
Give me a call if you need help

579
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,320
It's understandable

580
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,460
(Remembrance of Things Past)

581
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,480
You're up

582
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,360
You got it done so soon

583
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,000
- Thank you
- I didn't get the number

584
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,000
- You didn't get it?
- Yes, there is a large crowd

585
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,580
They came at around 5 am

586
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,960
It's okay, we will come tomorrow

587
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,360
Well, I talked to a nurse receptionist

588
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,800
She said Dr Zhang is indeed an expert

589
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,380
But the imperative now is
to make a diagnosis of your uncle

590
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,100
After that, we'll consult a doctor

591
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,580
She recommended me a doctor

592
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,740
His name is Liu Yan, the mentee of Dr Zhang

593
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,340
So I took the liberty
to make an appointment with him

594
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,840
You did it right. Really

595
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,600
Actually my uncle hasn't been diagnosed yet

596
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,500
- This is sufficient
- Great

597
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,740
Thanks, that's a big help

598
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,020
That's really you, Mr Jian

599
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,780
It took you just few minutes
to chat a nurse up

600
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,660
It's all for your sake

601
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,400
What does it mean?

602
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,020
I...

603
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
Nothing

604
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,320
So, what does it mean?

605
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,540
- It means "nothing"
- Come on

606
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,580
Jian Yi Fan, you're such a geek

607
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,920
Well, I'll just be blunt
I've run out of patience with you!

608
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,540
You are...

609
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,880
Why have you been so equivocal

610
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,300
and saying ambiguous language?

611
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,600
I have to ponder over your words
instead of focusing of my job!

612
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Are you fond of me?

613
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,060
Yes, I like you

614
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,260
I planned to formally confess to you

615
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,720
in a better place. Ended up...

616
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
This is a worse place than our office

617
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,780
Qiao Xi Chen, look at me

618
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,940
Look at me

619
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,700
Although it is not the right time
and right place

620
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,700
I believe you're the right one

621
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,380
What do you think about me?

622
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,400
I feel nauseated
maybe I was eating too fast

623
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,580
I feel carsick, I'll take the subway, bye

624
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,660
Thanks for this

625
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,100
You're a coward, why do you run away
after bracing yourself to ask?

626
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,860
Here it is

627
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,440
- Have your food
- It smells good

628
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,080
What a big city Beijing is

629
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,120
I thought I didn't walk far

630
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,420
Yet, the records in my phone shows
I've waked more than 20,000 steps

631
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,020
Today, I am the number one
on WeRun Leaderboard

632
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,640
Chen Chen, is the appointment made?

633
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,340
- Yes, it's the day after tomorrow
- Really?

634
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,440
The appointment is made!

635
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,560
I told you

636
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,340
- Chen Chen is capable
- Indeed

637
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,260
It's not Dr Zhang

638
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,680
It's hard to make an appointment with him

639
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,700
This doctor

640
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,180
was recommended by my friend.
He's an attending doctor

641
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,520
Also, he's a student to Dr Zhang

642
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,340
Uncle, your diagnosis can't be delayed

643
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,020
We'll have a physical examination for now

644
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,820
If it's a serious case
we'll try our best to reach Dr Zhang

645
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,060
Well, I think

646
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,320
they rely on the devices
for physical examination

647
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,100
Our imperative is to do an examination

648
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,860
As for who the doctor is, it doesn't matter

649
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,580
Do you agree?

650
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,360
Indeed

651
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,780
Just go for the examination.
It'd be great if you're alright

652
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,140
Fine then

653
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,300
The way they propose to the girlfriends

654
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,020
have been the same

655
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,340
There is nothing new

656
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,760
You don't understand
It's not about novelty but affection

657
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,680
All a girl wants to hear at that moment

658
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,220
are "I love you" and "Marry me"
The rest are unneeded

659
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,300
Then...

660
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,820
Do you want to hear these?

661
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,420
Of course

662
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,660
What do you mean?

663
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,120
Xu Yan

664
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,780
Let's get married

665
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,460
Shen Zi Chang

666
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,220
Why are you so lazy?
Is this your marriage proposal?

667
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,060
This does save you bother

668
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,300
That's just a question

669
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,820
Will anyone ask it in advance?

670
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,800
Don't I deserve a surprise?

671
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,260
You said affection is what matters

672
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:51,800
I feel like cut open your head
and see what's inside. Get up! Go!

673
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,000
- No, let me stay longer
- Forget it

674
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,560
No more staying, go

675
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,960
- Chang, you're here
- He's going home

676
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,800
Let me stay longer

677
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,160
Stay my foot, take your shoes and leave

678
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,920
Mind how you go

679
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,800
Take care, Chang

680
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,640
Bye, Chang

681
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,280
What happened?

682
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,320
Am I the reason?

683
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,800
It has nothing to do with you

684
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,180
That's great then

685
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,280
Qiao Xi Chen

686
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,700
Are you awake?

687
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,720
No

688
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,020
Why do you ignore me?

689
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,380
What's up?

690
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,580
Why are you still awake?

691
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
What's on your mind?

692
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,200
Jian Yi Fan confessed to me today

693
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,400
What's the matter with you?

694
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Really? How did you respond?

695
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,440
I ran away without a word

696
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
- What?
- He caught me off guard

697
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
I wasn't prepared yet

698
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,640
I knew something what going on
What are you going to do?

699
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,800
Look at this face

700
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,080
No, what should I do?

701
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,360
I think you need to talk to him

702
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,080
Well, let me figure it out

703
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,560
Why don't you ask about me?

704
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,520
Why are you sleepless then?

705
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,480
Shen Zi Chang proposed to me

706
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,240
He proposed?

707
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,660
What is your plan? Will you say yes?

708
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,080
This is the reason I quarreled with him

709
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,360
He just said it casually

710
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,340
That's so different
from the proposal I imagined

711
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,320
If he were someone else
I'd say that's unacceptable

712
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,660
But that's typical of Shen Zi Chang, right?

713
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,620
You wanted to get married a while ago

714
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,300
My mother mentioned this a while ago

715
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,300
Don't tell me about your mother
What about you?

716
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,380
Come on!

717
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,720
Well, I got it

718
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,840
I'll start saving
for the whip-round tomorrow, okay?

719
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,780
You'll only start tomorrow?
How much can you save?

720
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,640
Xu Yan, do you count on that to get rich?

721
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,760
Well, I don't count on you to get rich

722
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,540
I don't count on your whip-round
Be my bridesmaid

723
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,600
I can get Sister Nan Jia and...

724
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,560
If Jing Jing were alive

725
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,880
she'd be the first one cheering for you

726
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,280
Hug

727
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,960
You're getting married soon

728
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,320
Can I wear a pink off-shoulder dress?

729
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,120
Off-shoulder? That's gross

730
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,540
Shen Zi Cheng, listen

731
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,280
Can you do your best today
and make my baby say yes?

732
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,180
Sure, thank you

733
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,760
I'll invite you to witness our wedding

734
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,580
Forget it. The witnesses

735
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,880
are normally grand old people.
I will be the bridesmaid

736
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,580
I have to hang up. I'm not
going back tonight. The two of you

737
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,840
try your best

738
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,720
Alright, thanks, Sister

739
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,560
Bye

740
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,260
A silly couple

741
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,300
Sister Nan Jia isn't home. I will...

742
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:12,040
Well, I'll go to a hotel

743
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,160
The electricity bill has just been cleared.
What's wrong?

744
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,320
Shen Zi Chang, what are you up to?

745
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,760
What is this? A cake?

746
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,220
My purpose here today

747
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,000
is to do you a magic show

748
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,260
Three, two, one

749
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,440
Xu Yan

750
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,940
I am willing to share
half of my happiness with you

751
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,140
Are you willing to share...

752
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,060
Are you willing to share
half of your happiness with me?

753
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,380
You can't even memorize the two lines well
Do you really love me?

754
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,260
Don't get bogged down by details

755
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,300
Well, where is my diamond ring?

756
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,260
I guess

757
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,660
Is it inside the cake?

758
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,100
That's smart of you, baby

759
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,420
But it is not

760
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,520
The diamond ring is here!

761
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,960
There are 101 chocolates here

762
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:14,400
I can get you the diamond ring
from here with my eyes closed

763
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,100
- I don't believe it
- It took me so long to master it

764
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,100
But, let's make a deal

765
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,140
If I am able to find the ring right away

766
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,160
you will marry me

767
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,840
Hey, look

768
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,960
What's going on?

769
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,920
I found a hidden camera in the room

770
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,680
I almost stripped myself off!

771
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,160
Miss, calm down
No one has ever complained about this

772
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,080
Do you mean I brought it here?

773
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,200
I can't tell

774
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,780
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. He's there

775
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,800
I told you

776
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,780
You didn't have to come. I am alright

777
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,120
You've scared me

778
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,160
Shen Zi Chang, that's smart of you

779
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,480
There's not even a proposal gift
I can't find it

780
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,140
There are so many chocolates. You wastrel

781
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,100
Be patient

782
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,760
Have you ever watched Forrest Gump?

783
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,080
There's a line

784
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,380
Life was like a box of chocolates

785
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,800
You never know what you're gonna get

786
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
In fact, it's quite romantic

787
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,880
You might as well put it in the cake!

788
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,560
I'd just pretend to be surprised

789
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,920
When can I find it?

790
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,880
Xu Yan

791
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,560
I don't know if the seven words are enough

792
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,880
Even if I'll never strike a lottery again

793
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,000
even if I'll never win a football game again

794
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,360
even if I'll have my luck run out

795
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,100
I still believe

796
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,380
the price for the encounter with you

797
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,220
is my luck for a lifetime

798
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,540
I love you

799
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,240
Marry me

800
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,420
I wasn't ready. Say it again

801
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,820
I love you

802
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,740
Will you say yes?

803
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,720
Hurry up! It took such a long time!

804
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,340
You're annoying! Silly boy!

805
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,200
Stop laughing, Did you see
how the man ended up?

806
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:36,760
Sorry

807
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,340
I just find that he was out of luck

808
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,980
He was out of luck?

809
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,240
He even argued with me about that
The hotel is nasty

810
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,920
- Get a better hotel next time
- The price will be higher too

811
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,680
This one costed me 300 yuan

812
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,200
Anyway, let me know immediately
when such a situation occurs again

813
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,220
If you really have nowhere to go
stay at my place

814
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,260
What?

815
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,800
I mean you'll stay at my place
and I'll stay in the hotel

816
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,700
I'm a man, there's nothing to be fear

817
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,820
Jian Yi Fan

818
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,220
Something's wrong with you

819
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,620
Do you remember what you said that day?

820
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,060
Which day?

821
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,560
You forgot?

822
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,400
I remember

823
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,760
Is it still valid?

824
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,000
You said

825
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,480
the timing and place weren't right
and we were at the hospital

826
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,100
Today, this place is nice

827
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,600
The timing isn't bad, too

828
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,940
- Qiao Yi Chen
- Jian Yi Fan

829
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,000
You said I am your right one

830
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,060
I am not sure about it

831
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,580
However

832
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,940
in my happy and sad moments

833
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,460
I think of you

834
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,260
I feel comfortable and happy being with you

835
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,600
In short, I care about you

836
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,740
Are you willing to be my boyfriend?

837
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,300
Why would you be the first who confesses?

838
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,480
Well, forget my last sentence
and ask me again

839
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,360
You've said it. I am

840
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,500
And then?

841
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,760
It's my mother

842
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,200
- Hello, Mom
- Chen Chen, have you left office?

843
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,580
Yes

844
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,480
Can you come home?

845
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,700
What's wrong?

846
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,960
Got it, I'm going back now, bye

847
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,400
Something came up, I have to go home

848
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,580
I'll give you a ride

849
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,720
Mind how you go

850
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,920
I'm already home

851
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,440
Why do you get out of your car?

852
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,520
I'll accompany you home

853
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,900
What for?

854
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,340
I'll meet your parents

855
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,340
- Jian Yi Fan
- It's a joke

856
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,960
Your uncle is mad because of the appointment

857
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,900
I made the appointment for him

858
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,280
You can push everything to me later

859
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,480
I'm an outsider
Your mother won't complain much

860
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
Got it, you're here to take the blame

861
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,880
Can't you put it in a nicer way?
I am protecting my girlfriend

862
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,680
Joking apart, it's really too soon

863
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,120
- I want to take things slowly
- In the next hour

864
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,480
I am only your superior, is that okay?

865
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,080
Okay then. We'll get into a relationship
after an hour

866
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,680
The timer has started

867
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,520
Hey, what if my mother is on the balcony?

868
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,240
Young man, come on

869
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,760
- Have a sip
- Thank you

870
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,480
Take your seat

871
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,380
Chen Chen

872
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,600
needs your guidance and help at work

873
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,860
Qiao Xi Chen takes her job
seriously and she is smart

874
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,400
But something happened tonight

875
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,260
- I think...
- I didn't perform well

876
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,780
What happened?

877
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,180
I didn't perform well at work

878
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,760
So he criticized me

879
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,440
Your call happened to come in
and he just came along

880
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,540
How about continue with your scolding?

881
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,880
My bad. I made the call at the wrong time

882
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,080
So many of us came to her suddenly

883
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,400
and have caused her a lot of troubles
I am so sorry

884
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,560
Come on, how can your visit be a bother?

885
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,080
Stop frowning
It will cause forehead wrinkles

886
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,720
Jian Yi Fan, you did it on purpose
I told you not to leak it but you did

887
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,200
You should tell your parents about it

888
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,000
If I were you, I'd let them know
they have caused me troubles

889
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,480
That's not. My uncle and aunt
watched me growing up

890
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,040
What's more, don't family members
bother each other?

891
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,640
When I am working in Beijing

892
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,840
that's how they help
and take care of each other

893
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,500
We're a family

894
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,580
I was being overly subjective

895
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,320
Sorry

896
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,440
Don't say sorry, you did it for my sake

897
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,540
Great that you know it

898
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,480
Do you have unfinished work?

899
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,260
I thought of buying you supper

900
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,720
What's up?

901
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,720
Your boyfriend is now here

902
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,680
It's already an hour?

903
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,040
Let's go on a date, my treat

904
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,020
Alright

905
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,600
Uncle

906
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,960
The doctor said you have a fatty liver.
You should avoid certain foods

907
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,880
You and my father should cut back on alcohol

908
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,200
The doctor was brushing you off

909
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,220
I've been taking alcohol all my life

910
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,960
I would rather die than abstain from drinking

911
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,760
You say this only after knowing the results

912
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,520
Someone was so frightened
that he couldn't sleep

913
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,880
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

914
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,280
Anyway, it wasn't me

915
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,080
That's something happy, right?

916
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,020
Getting married is a big occasion

917
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,960
How can you just make the announcement?

918
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,100
It's so unexpected

919
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,740
Mom, it's not. I am already 28
It's a marriageable age

920
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,660
I'm not against it

921
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,020
The marriage is between the two of you

922
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:47,780
If you think it's good as parents
we have no comments

923
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,520
Xu Yan

924
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,640
Have you talked to your mother?

925
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,480
Yes, I talked to her over the phone

926
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,800
Shen Zi Chang and I had a discussion
We're having a break soon

927
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,640
We'll go back and discuss with her

928
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,320
Yes, send our regards to her

929
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:13,760
By the way, my mother asked me to talk to you

930
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,320
about buying a house
She knows the house price in Beijing

931
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,760
and both of us don't have much savings

932
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,000
She means that my family

933
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,640
can pay part of the down-payment
and we'll try to make up the figure

934
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,440
What does she mean?

935
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,460
Are you buying a house?

936
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,480
Mom, here's the thing

937
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,800
Xu Yan and I are getting married

938
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,060
Renting a house isn't ideal. We are
thinking of having a house of our own

939
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,680
even if it is just a small one

940
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,720
We're not asking you to rent a house

941
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,360
You'll live here.
Isn't our place big enough for you?

942
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,000
- Where are you going to live?
- We'll sleep in a room

943
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,120
Come on, are you going to move out

944
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,840
right after you get married?

945
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,320
Did we do you wrong?
Do you have a thing about us?

946
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,760
Listen up

947
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,680
This will be your home if you get married

948
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,160
Else, just don't get married

949
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,580
Gou Dan

950
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,760
Mom, can you check
if Gou Dan is in the kitchen?

951
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,640
I haven't seen it since I came home

952
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,500
Gou Dan

953
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:37,960
Stop looking for it

954
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,000
Aunt has thrown it out

955
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,760
Thrown out? What does it mean?

956
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,720
No, it ran out as soon as I opened the door

957
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,520
I set it free

958
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,360
Who gives you the right to do so?

959
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,440
That's my cat. Did you throw it away?

960
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,640
I didn't know my mother would say that

961
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,500
I also find her words too harsh

962
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,360
Our marriage is not up to her
I am the one who makes the decision

963
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,640
But she got a point.
We shouldn't rush into buying a house

964
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,040
Fine, tell me when

965
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,760
Next year? In five years?
There must be a time limit, right?

966
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,160
Shen Zi Chang
do you really want to get married?

967
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,660
- You'll only marry me with a house?
- Watch your attitude

968
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,920
Is it a rule to buy a house
when you get married?

969
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,320
Be honest, do you really want to marry me?

970
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,760
Would I buy you a diamond ring if I don't?

971
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,240
If you have had some savings

972
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,880
would my mother turn her nose up at you?

973
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,560
It ran out on it own. I didn't throw it

974
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,280
What's more
stray cats should stay outside, right?

975
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,980
Chen Chen, stray cats
have fleas and ticks on them

976
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,060
What does it have to do with you?

977
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:07,220
This is my place
Who are you to throw it away?

978
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,680
Stop quarreling, it's just a dog

979
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,940
A dog? It's a cat!

980
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,060
That's my cat!

981
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,360
Who are you to throw my cat away?

982
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,200
Shen Zi Chang, do you think
that I have no other choices?

983
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,680
- Xu Yan, I...
- I don't want to marry you either!

984
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,480
She's outrageous
How could she yell at her aunt?

985
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,200
Brother!

986
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,080
Don't you think you're too much?

987
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,960
Chen Chen has been running around for you

988
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,760
since you came here

989
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,800
Why are you still unsatisfied?

990
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,400
Chen Chen is living alone in Beijing
That's not easy for her

991
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,620
Is Chen Chen in your debt?

992
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,640
Were you the one who woke up
at 5 am to make the appointment?

993
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,920
You've been plaguing her

994
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:26,240
She isn't born to you
so you don't cherish her

995
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,560
But I do!

996
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,560
Brother, I've been holding it back!

997
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,240
I kept quiet because you're my brother!

998
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,640
But I won't allow anyone
to bully my daughter!

999
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,880
Gou Dan!

1000
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:51,560
Gou Dan!

1001
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,580
- Gou Dan!
- Gou Dan!

1002
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,300
Gou Dan!

1003
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,760
- Kitty!
- Come home, Gou Dan!

1004
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,640
Gou Dan!

1005
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,880
Hey, you!

1006
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:06,880
It's windy, why don't you bundle up?

1007
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:08,920
- I'm worried.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,859
We can surely find it today

1009
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,460
Gou Dan!

1010
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:16,100
- Gou Dan!
- Gou Dan!

1011
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,420
Gou Dan!

1012
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,859
Gou Dan!

1013
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,380
How long have you not
seen your parents from behind?

1014
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,000
Dad! Mom!

1015
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,420
Fewer meetings and calls

1016
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,380
Adapting to the living alone

1017
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,140
We thought this is growing into maturity

1018
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,240
But we often forget as we're growing older

1019
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:48,660
so do our parents

1020
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,830
- Every time you leave home
- Okay

1021
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,740
- Every unfinished call from you
- Mr Huang

1022
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,160
Hey, Mom

1023
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,040
Your smile with hidden sadness and pain

1024
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,680
You think they know nothing

1025
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,920
In fact, they know everything
but they didn't speak up

1026
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,020
No matter what you've gone through

1027
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,560
parents are your toughest armor

1028
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,640
Forgive me, come back

1029
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,160
- I found it, it's hiding here!
- It's found!

1030
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:50,240
They are also the ones I care about the most

1031
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,280
You made us so worried!

1032
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,200
Where did you go?

1033
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,680
Our family will be happy when you're found

1034
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,600
Alright, you're happy now

1035
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,360
Alright, it's found

1036
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,440
What's up?

1037
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,320
Let's have another child

1038
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,560
Stop it, sleep now

1039
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,080
Let's have another child

1040
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,400
Is something wrong with you, Lin Li Fang?

1041
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,280
You! Listen!

1042
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,400
You don't want, right?
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow

1043
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,440
I'll get sperm inserted and bear my own baby!

1044
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,760
Nonsense! What are you talking about?

1045
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,220
What's wrong with having another child?

1046
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,600
What is wrong with that?

1047
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,080
Jing Jing was crazy, so are you!

1048
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,060
Who?

1049
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,920
- Jing Jing was crazy?
- No

1050
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,760
- Tell me
- My bad

1051
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,800
- I was still half asleep
- What? How was Jing Jing crazy?

1052
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,200
- Tell me
- Listen to me

1053
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,260
Here's the story

1054
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,580
Two days back

1055
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,700
Jia Jia told me

1056
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,740
Jing Jing suffered from depression

1057
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,720
That's why she...

1058
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:29,960
She...

1059
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,640
I'm sorry
