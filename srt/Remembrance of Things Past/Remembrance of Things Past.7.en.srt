00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,759
(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,760
(I'll send it to you when I am home)
Why are you here?

3
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,240
Why don't you put on your pants?

4
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,320
(What time are you home?)

5
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
It's 4:30 pm, you're still in bed?

6
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
(Around 7 or 8 pm. Is it okay?)

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,020
What are you up to?
You invited me for dinner. Did you forget?

8
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,520
I didn't. Come in

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
(It's too late. Send it before 4 pm)
What's going on?

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm sorry. I got drunk last night

11
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,780
It was my buddy's birthday

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,380
(I'm watching a movie, it ends at 3:30 pm)
and he insisted on having liquor

13
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,180
(Sorry, Mr. Huang)
I told him I am a light drinker

14
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,720
But he insisted

15
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,380
That's setting things back!

16
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,340
I didn't forget about it

17
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,740
(We're working overtime here)
I planned to pick you up from the bank

18
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,980
(and you are watching a movie?)
Luckily you didn't

19
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,380
I came here after meeting a client nearby

20
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
Do you feel better?

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,140
(First, weekends are days off)
I'm sorry

22
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,579
(I have the right to whether watch a movie)
I messed up our first date

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,980
(or go shopping)
We'll take a rain check

24
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,200
(As long as I don't break the law)
No! We can have it today

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,720
Let me do the wash-up, just a minute

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,520
(no one can interfere. It's up to the rest
if they want to work overtime)

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,260
(But I won't do so without a valid reason!)

28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,900
(Fourth, I signed the employment contract
Not a slave contract!)

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,080
(Delete)

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
(Okay)

31
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,320
(Above are my questions)

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,880
(Episode 7: Decluttering and Detaching)

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,280
I have checked it

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,920
This is not vitamin supplements
but Paroxetine

35
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,200
What is that?

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
It is an antidepressant drug

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,960
Antidepressant?

38
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,079
It is a prescription drug

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
Generally, it is not available in pharmacies

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,880
Nan Jia

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,840
We've known each other for years

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
You may share your problems with me

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
It's not mine

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,240
That's great

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,800
If someone close to you is taking this

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,959
be more concerned about them

47
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,839
By the way, great that you're here today

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
This is your examination report

49
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Is there any problem?

50
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,220
Everything is good

51
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,380
According to your current status

52
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
you need a follow-up check
only every half a year

53
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
You don't have to come every three months

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,820
I just want to be cautious

55
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,300
Well, I'll come back in six months

56
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,159
I remember you insisted
on preserving fertility during the operation

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Do you still want to bear children?

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,920
I can only go with the flow

59
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,200
I do want to bear children

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,400
if I meet the right person

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
Why?

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
You have had an operation after all

63
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,720
Although your recovery went well

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,460
it still affected your hormone levels
at certain degree

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,480
Also, considering your age

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
if you consider conceiving a child

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
I suggest you not leaving it too late

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,760
How late can I delay it?

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Getting pregnant
within these two years would be ideal

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,600
Else, your fertility will decrease over time

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,440
Also, childbearing will put you
at increased risk of health problems

72
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,920
Got it. You mean I won't be able to

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,240
get pregnant after this period, right?

74
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
This is not absolute

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,520
Just take it easy

76
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,159
My goodness

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,960
- Alright! Thank you, Dr Zhao
- No problem

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,120
(Beijing Yi He Hospital)

79
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,600
After meeting with Bai Fan
I can't figure out

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
why she played the stock market
and why she needed so much money

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,880
So I searched her belongings and found this

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Was Jing Jing really taking this?

83
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,320
I saw her eating this

84
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
What are you eating?

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,880
It's vitamin pills, from you

86
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,720
I am not taking it regularly

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
If you're taking, you can take mine too

88
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,240
Alright. I'll get from you
after finishing mine

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Okay

90
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,080
I didn't even think of that

91
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,880
Look, it is a prescription drug

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,460
To get it, Jing Jing had
to get the doctor's prescription

93
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,360
Do you mean we can know more about it

94
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,740
- if we have Jing Jing's medical record?
- Yes

95
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,120
- Let's go
- Let's find it

96
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,140
Look

97
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,640
Since college, Jing Jing
stayed around eight years in Beijing

98
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,520
In the end, her belongings
were just three boxes in total

99
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,640
People think they have plenty assets

100
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,480
but in the end, only these few are left

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,940
I can't accept it

102
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,780
I have to take away everything I bought

103
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,020
- Let's do it!
- Let's get started!

104
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,920
The medical record is easy to spot

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
There are only toys in this box

106
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,680
Why would she keep this?

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
- What's that?
- Isn't that her basketball club uniform?

108
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,500
Right! It's been so long

109
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,980
I remember Jing Jing was so determined

110
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,280
There were so many clubs

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,420
but she was hell bent
on joining basketball club to do scut work

112
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,360
Why did she join basketball club?
Did she love sports?

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,080
You reminded me of that

114
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,960
She were infatuated
with a boy during her time in college

115
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
She dated someone in college?
I didn't know about it!

116
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Don't rush

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,300
She didn't

118
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,420
She was hell bent on joining the club

119
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,840
Xu Yan and I found it fishy

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,680
We were wondering if she fancied...

121
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,880
The basketball club's chairman
What's the senior's name?

122
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,960
- His name is Gao Tian Yang, right?
- What? I don't remember

123
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,440
How can you forget it?
You were so excited about it!

124
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,280
We egged her on to make
a confession. Did you forget it?

125
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
I have a bad memory
I can't remember everything

126
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,520
What's next?

127
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,140
Nothing, he got a girlfriend

128
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,559
Then, we stopped bringing it up

129
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,640
Jing Jing still kept the shirt

130
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,360
She was really in love with him

131
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,800
Her things are like nesting dolls

132
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,560
Xu Yan, do you remember this sweater?

133
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,080
Xu Yan! Why are you in a daze?

134
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,780
Nothing. There is an empty box

135
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,500
- It looks gorgeous
- It is empty

136
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,540
I found it

137
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,960
The medical record

138
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,060
I'll make an appointment
with this doctor to find out what happened

139
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
What's this?

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,040
Look! Why are there so many tickets?

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,200
Let me have a look

142
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
We have been here before!

143
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,720
But look, she got double tickets
for each attraction spot

144
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,920
That's right

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,980
Why did she revisit
the places we went together?

146
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,600
And look

147
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,120
She had double tickets for the same spots
But one of them isn't torn

148
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,240
- What's going on?
- Was Jing Jing stood up?

149
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,740
Let me check the dates

150
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,260
She didn't seem to be in a relationship
with Gao Yang at this time

151
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,400
So, who do you think
Jing Jing wanted to go with?

152
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,340
Let's go! Come on, cheer together with me

153
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,180
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going to cheer

154
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,680
Aren't you tired?
Which one are you talking about?

155
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,340
Did you see the one holding the ball?

156
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,900
Now he is passing the ball!

157
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,700
- Is it No. 23?
- No. How could it be No. 23?

158
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,500
But he looks okay. He's tall

159
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,380
This, the one getting the ball

160
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,180
No, No. 11. Did you see him?

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Group Leader Lin!

162
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,800
- Brother Qiang
- Good morning!

163
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,280
Please don't call me that

164
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,740
It hasn't been officially announced

165
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,440
You're just an email away from it

166
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,160
I heard from the sales department

167
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,600
that your presentation was wonderful

168
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,680
In fact, I didn't perform well
out of nervousness

169
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,040
You didn't perform well?

170
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
I can't imagine how good you are
when you perform well

171
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,920
You oversea elites are brilliant

172
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,200
Please give me a leg up in the future

173
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,280
Brother Qiang, that's very flattering

174
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,380
I'm new in the company

175
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,260
I still need your help and support

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,480
You are overly modest

177
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,060
Well. I'll buy you a meal
to celebrate your promotion

178
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,960
No problem! I'll buy you a meal

179
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,600
- If you insist
- Sure

180
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
Come in!

181
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,120
Mr. Jian, may I know when
the product development officially starts?

182
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,060
You are here just in time
I was about to call you. Have a seat

183
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,600
Regarding the new product development

184
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,680
after the discussion
with the sales and R&D directors

185
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,040
I decided to adopt Qiao Xi Chen's proposal

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,230
As for the candidate
for the second group's leader

187
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,240
I need some time to think it over

188
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Mr. Jian, I don't get it

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Is my proposal not good enough?

190
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,680
It's the opposite

191
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,080
I think your proposal is extraordinary

192
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,800
especially the sales section,
it's distinctive

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,560
I can't get it

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,380
You bring the concept of craft beer to coffee

195
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,960
and make our cold brew stand out

196
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,120
At the same time
there's a breakthrough in the packaging

197
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,120
However, if my memory serves me right

198
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,660
a popular foreign coffee brand called Sanders

199
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,280
employed the same concept last year

200
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,640
You adapted their strategy wonderfully

201
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,120
However

202
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,840
it's still their idea

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,360
Mr. Jian, such adaptions
can be found everywhere here

204
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,280
- Also, most of them...
- That is their business

205
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
Yann Coffee is different

206
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,960
Just because everyone else is doing it
doesn't make it right

207
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,360
Also, domestic market is different nowadays

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,960
People nowadays are in clover

209
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,600
They will definitely realize it
if we put this on the market

210
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,240
I don't want to be doxed by the netizens

211
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,360
and labeled as a plagiarist

212
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,600
Lin Rui

213
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,240
I told you that I like
those who take shortcuts

214
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,320
but shortcuts may get you lost

215
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,360
I got it, Mr. Jian

216
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,820
What happened?

217
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
Beats me

218
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,440
Wasn't it almost finalized?

219
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,200
The winner is not determined yet

(Beijing Medical Institution)

221
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,760
Hu Jing Jing started her treatment
with me in March of this year

222
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,200
Her initial diagnosis was moderate depression

223
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,000
She was on medication over four months

224
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,360
She was supposed to come
for a follow-up visit three months ago

225
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,920
However, she didn't show up

226
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,640
The nurse hasn't been able to get hold of her

227
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,640
I thought she was getting better
and decided to stop medication

228
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,280
(Beijing Medical Institution)
(Medical Record)

229
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Next week?

230
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes, I'm free

231
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
Anyway, I'm not going home
on the National Day

232
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,040
Okay, you can count on me

233
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,600
- Who was that?
- Nothing

234
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Nan Jia, is your Polo car still here?

235
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,380
I offered it to you but you said
you have nowhere to park it

236
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,620
That's right. Can I use it on National Day?

237
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,640
Aren't you going
for a business trip that day?

238
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,260
I'll tell the manager
to send someone else, it's okay

239
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,820
Can I borrow it on National Day?

240
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,620
Who is the important person?

241
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,800
It's just a college friend

242
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,200
Who is this college friend?

243
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,960
(National Stadium Beijing)

244
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,520
Mine?

245
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,720
Really?

246
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,220
Are you kidding me?

247
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,680
Do you think I have nothing to do?

248
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,240
I don't mean that

249
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,320
The rub is I didn't perform well that day

250
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,800
Indeed

251
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,100
But I remember I told you on the rooftop

252
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,580
that I like your proposal

253
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,680
I thought it was words of comfort

254
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
Well

255
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,880
It's half and half

256
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,560
In fact, I had another meeting

257
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,040
with the directors of R&D
and sales departments that day

258
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,880
We compared the proposals
of yours and Lin Rui's in details

259
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
At last, we found your proposal more suitable

260
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,800
What about the position
of the second group's leader?

261
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,040
You don't have to think about it now

262
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm just curious

263
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,340
But it isn't Lin Rui

264
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,880
There is some problem with him

265
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,080
His proposal is suspected
of plagiarizing a foreign case

266
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
This is absolutely unacceptable to me

267
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,540
I guess

268
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,440
he was eager to win, just like me

269
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,440
Being competitive isn't an issue

270
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,040
but everything should
remain open and aboveboard

271
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,760
Just give me a word, yes or no?

272
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,240
It's a yes for sure!

273
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,020
Why are you still sitting here?

274
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,580
The R&D department is awaiting you

275
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,080
Mr. Jian, should I say thank you?

276
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,380
You are welcome

277
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,460
Anyway, it's part of your KPI
if it's not selling well

278
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,000
Forget it!

279
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,280
Open the door!

280
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,240
Ji Nan Jia!

281
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,020
- Who is it?
- You finally opened the door

282
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,380
I'm so thirsty
I talked for more than two hours

283
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,820
I almost lost my voice

284
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,120
I need water

285
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,360
You're taking here as your home

286
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't be shy. I'm not here for the first time

287
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,460
Why are you here?

288
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,640
I got you a big business

289
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,160
- Thanks but no thanks
- Why?

290
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,900
Is it because of the banquet last time?
Listen

291
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,720
My boss will be in full charge of this event

292
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,020
Don't worry, he is still single
No one will pester you

293
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,860
Listen! I won't accept any order
from Yann Coffee again. Leave now

294
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,480
You got quite a personality. I like it

295
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,920
I don't need it, leave now

296
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,860
Please do me the favor

297
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,100
Can you please help me?

298
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,620
Aren't we friends?

299
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,980
Not at all

300
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,540
- Don't be my friend
- Wait!

301
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,000
To be honest, your couch is pretty good

302
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,020
- Lying here that night, I was...
- Hey, you!

303
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,280
Please do me the favor

304
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,560
The marketing department
is having a team building event

305
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,160
- I'll send you three contacts, go to them
- Don't!

306
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,040
Of course I know whom to contact

307
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,080
But I'm thinking to have you help me

308
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,700
- You don't want it? I'll delete it
- Don't! I want it

309
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,840
(Remembrance of Things Past)

310
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,660
Here! Hurry up!

311
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,880
- We're all waiting for you
- Long time no see

312
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,820
It's been a long time

313
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,620
You finally came back

314
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,840
- Have a seat
- Have a seat

315
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,260
- He is getting more handsome
- You're more handsome

316
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,820
We have some meat to be served

317
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,780
Let's eat while waiting
We'll paint the town red tonight!

318
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,620
- Okay
- Okay?

319
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,900
I'm late, let me punish myself

320
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,460
- I'll drink with you
- Let's drink!

321
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,680
Come!

322
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,920
Qiao Xi Chen, hurry up

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,520
- It's getting cold
- I'm coming!

324
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,540
Oh my goodness!

325
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,900
You've ordered too much

326
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,500
Do you have other guests in this house?

327
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,760
How can you complain about
having too much food? We must finish it all

328
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,320
You're a spendthrift

329
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,080
Shen Zi Chang has really driven you mad

330
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Don't mention his name, he's pesky

331
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,400
I've been on your side

332
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,020
but I'll be fair this time

333
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,600
Let me speak for Shen Zi Chang

334
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,700
Well, I'm not asking you to scrimp on things

335
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,620
but you can't just spend all you have

336
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,340
as if your salary were swinging by you

337
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,860
I didn't spend it all on myself

338
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,660
I want to make him happy

339
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,860
What do you mean?

340
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
He fancied a pair of shoes

341
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
but he begrudges
spending money on it. I see it

342
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,540
Also, each of his buddies seems to have one

343
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,080
So I was thinking to buy him one
and make him happy

344
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,980
I went to a lot of purchasing agents

345
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,580
and finally bought it 400 yuan cheaper

346
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,260
Enough talking, that's annoying

347
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,340
How dare he complain about me

348
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,760
You should've told him directly

349
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,580
How should I tell? I feel disgusted

350
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,780
upon thinking how his mother
and he criticized me behind my back

351
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,020
Alas!

352
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,080
Relationship is troublesome!

353
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,140
You get into a quarrel, either you say
everything or you keep everything

354
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,060
It's really a headache

355
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,960
Is something going on?

356
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,640
No

357
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,060
No? Well, Lin Rui is back

358
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,100
How are you getting along?

359
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,440
You want to know if we reconciled, right?

360
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,740
- Did you?
- What do you think?

361
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,580
Do you think it is possible?

362
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,400
You broke up because he went abroad

363
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,620
Now, he is back and you have been single

364
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,960
No. That wasn't the reason we broke up

365
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,800
The reason was
that I wasn't in his plan for future

366
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm the gift for "buy one free one"

367
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,680
Besides, I am not in a relationship

368
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,920
because I haven't met the right person

369
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm not waiting for him

370
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,340
You always use this as an excuse

371
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,060
What do you mean by "the right one"?

372
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,480
If you ask me

373
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,880
I'd say your thought becomes your destiny

374
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,920
- Do you remember our monitor?
- Yes

375
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,360
He was enrolled in graduate school
upon graduation

376
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,640
He was so enviable

377
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,920
- But you know what?
- What?

378
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,000
I saw him in our company two days ago

379
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,360
He was looking for a job

380
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,740
He went to your company?

381
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,780
He came with his resume for job application

382
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,080
Isn't he like a bachelor's degree holder?

383
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,900
All things are possible

384
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,280
That's because you're doing well

385
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,300
Some of our classmates are
still paper pushers after a few years

386
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,780
Please don't say that

387
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,260
To me, you are
the most successful one among us

388
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Lin Rui, why would you come back?

389
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,120
Is the Pope a Catholic?

390
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,600
For sure it is
because the domestic offer is better

391
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,320
I believe the overseas elites like him
are paid annual compensation

392
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,760
Right?

393
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,120
We got it

394
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,980
- It is confidential
- This can't be tell?

395
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,420
I've eaten too much again. That's frustrating

396
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,740
I have to lose weight. I must stop eating

397
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,900
I've heard this for 20 years

398
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,620
I can only soothe my anger with food

399
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,900
Alas!

400
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,800
I feel like having a hot spring bath
in Hokkaido too

401
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,760
Alas! Forget it

402
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,100
I'll give you a big bucket
of hot water at home

403
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,240
You'll just sit inside

404
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I can also adjust the temperature for you

405
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,000
The return ticket to Hokkaido is enough
to cover your water bills for three years

406
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,940
That's a dangerous speech

407
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,340
You must not say this before Shen Zi Chang

408
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,700
You're showing him bad examples

409
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,100
If we hadn't had a quarrel
I'd be enjoying the landscape

410
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
and taking nice pictures now

411
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,120
It's all your fault, Shen Zi Chang!

412
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,320
I can't afford to bring you to Hokkaido

413
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,000
but is Xiao Tang Shan okay for you?

414
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Is your company having a team building event?

415
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
The place isn't bad

416
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,800
Who proposed it? He got a great taste

417
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,800
Don't bother about it. Are you going?

418
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,900
Why should I join your company's
team building event?

419
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,980
Why not? We are allowed
to bring family members

420
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,500
You are my family member, aren't you?

421
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,920
We just need to pay some additional charges

422
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,160
How much is it?

423
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,360
It's definitely cheaper
than your normal trip there

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,340
Three, two, one

425
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,720
Yes!

426
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,260
Should we invite Shen Zi Chang?

427
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,540
Don't say the three words!

428
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,100
- Let's go!
- Sorry

429
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,540
Why didn't you hire a designated driver?

430
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,920
Listen, this is a matter of principle

431
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,340
Don't take any chance! Do you hear me?

432
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,100
- Where's your car?
- Yeah!

433
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,840
I didn't drive. As you said
we were going to have a drink

434
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,560
I left my car at the company

435
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,480
Look! He is the smartest!

436
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,120
- Smart guy!
- Alright!

437
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,160
You look really drunk, let's get back

438
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,800
- Alright. Goodbye!
- Goodbye

439
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,720
Take care. We'll just leave you

440
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,520
Be safe! We'll drink again!

441
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,560
Regarding the new product development

442
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,280
I decided to adopt Qiao Xi Chen's proposal

443
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,510
As for the candidate
for the second group's leader

444
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,200
I need some time to think it over

445
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,360
(Qiao Xi Chen)

446
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,200
(Qiao Xi Chen)

447
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,640
Are you really not staying over?

448
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,880
No. I'm going back to change this shirt

449
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,860
- It is smelly
- What do you mean?

450
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,620
Why don't you wear my clothes?

451
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,040
Look at yours. Look at what you are wearing

452
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,380
- I'll see you to the subway station
- It's fine

453
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,920
Get lost then. Hurry up!

454
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,380
Alright, I'm leaving. Goodbye!

455
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,360
Send me a message when you got home

456
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,780
Okay! Don't miss me!

457
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,300
- Drop over whenever you miss me
- Bye

458
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Why are you here?

459
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,100
I got your address from Miao Miao

460
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,300
so that I can pay you a call

461
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,480
What for?

462
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,640
To be honest

463
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,520
I have been wandering around here
over an hour

464
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,520
Can we sit down and have a chat?

465
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,060
A cafe nearby is open till late night
Let's go there

466
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,060
Are you drunk?

467
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,940
Don't worry, I'm sober

468
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,040
Don't you know my tolerance for alcohol?

469
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,140
That's right. During our college time

470
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,580
the basketball club had a celebration
for winning a match

471
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,120
I remember you drank everyone under the table

472
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
I remember it too

473
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,120
You followed me with half a bottle of liquor

474
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,040
and stopped anyone
who wanted to drink with me

475
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,640
The next day, everyone started saying that

476
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,480
Lin Rui's girlfriend had
a higher tolerance for alcohol than him

477
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,760
Well. Thinking about it

478
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,080
that was the happiest moment in my life

479
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,520
Come on, in your life?

480
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,800
You still have a long way to go

481
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,560
We have to look forward

482
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,680
Didn't you say this before you left?

483
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,900
Xiao Xi

484
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,580
- It was because...
- Alright

485
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,360
It's over, let's not bring it up

486
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,200
Can we still be friends?

487
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,680
To be honest

488
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm frustrated today

489
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
I read your proposal and it is impressive

490
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
If you had performed well

491
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,240
the winner would be hard to predict

492
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,240
I am speaking as if my proposal were selected

493
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Do you know what I like about Beijing?

494
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
It's big enough

495
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,880
It's tolerant

496
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,960
You can make the grade if you are talented

497
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,920
If you are ordinary yet diligent

498
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,400
you can still make a decent living

499
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,040
And if you have nothing
but you are willing to work hard

500
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
you still can gain a foothold

501
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,240
So

502
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,320
don't push yourself so hard

503
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,240
I am quoting someone as saying. A while ago

504
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,040
someone told me this and I find it justified

505
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,480
Don't put yourself under pressure

506
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Relax

507
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,840
Xiao Xi, you...

508
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,560
How have you been all these years?

509
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,060
It's kind of weird. I thought meeting you

510
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,360
would be awkward

511
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,160
because of the past

512
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,340
But somehow I don't have any special feelings

513
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,560
So you don't have to worry about it

514
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,080
Since we are colleagues now

515
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,480
we'll interact normally

516
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
and work in peace

517
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,860
We might have a chance
to work together, right?

518
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
I see

519
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,480
Wait a moment, I'm leaving home

520
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,160
Okay, I got it

521
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,660
- We have chemistry
- I have no time for jokes

522
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,040
I am tied up, go do your thing

523
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,640
What's going on? Why are you in a hurry?

524
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,900
I know!

525
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,540
They didn't mention
the expired date before shipping

526
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,960
We didn't ask about it too

527
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,520
So it's not their problem

528
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,720
Persimmons can't keep long

529
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,380
That's right

530
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,920
I know!

531
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,940
- I am going now
- I'm dizzy

532
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,080
Can't you understand my words?

533
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,800
You didn't get it but I did

534
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,900
The Fu Ping Persimmons
that your company bought

535
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,560
weren't stored well and have gone bad, right?

536
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,120
It is no big deal,
buy some more and it's settled

537
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,880
No big deal? I need them now
and they have gone bad

538
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,840
It's too late to get the seller ship it again

539
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't waste my time. Hurry up and leave!

540
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,700
Wait

541
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,160
If you are not going to buy it,
where are you going now?

542
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm going back to office
Where else can I go?

543
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't go back, follow my lead

544
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,960
I can get you big and sweet persimmons

545
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,520
I have no time to play with you now

546
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,340
I'm not messing around

547
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,700
Do you want persimmons?
If you do, listen to me and go

548
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,440
Although I look unreliable

549
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I never tell a lie. Here it is, let's go!

550
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,820
I'll kill you if there is no persimmon

551
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,800
How do you kill me?

552
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,600
- Navigation! Turn on the sound
- Turn right at the front

553
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,300
Hello, Qiao. Can you do me a favor?

554
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,960
I might be late

555
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,540
No. I have it all arranged

556
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,040
All the rooms are registered

557
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,360
You'll just distribute the keys later

558
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,560
Alright? I'll send you the contact
of the resort manager

559
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,320
Alright. Thanks. See you

560
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,960
Are you in the middle of something?

561
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,440
I told you, right?
I have a team building event

562
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Just send me the location
and I'll go by myself

563
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,440
Listen, you won't get the persimmons
if I don't go along

564
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
- How is it?
- There is a bathtub!

565
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,660
Not too bad!

566
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,260
There is a pool outside!

567
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,100
It's no big deal, don't be so surprised

568
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,180
Take a picture for me

569
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,580
- We can come here tonight
- This is nice

570
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,740
- Let me take a photo for you
- Is this okay?

571
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,100
Come on, look here

572
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,660
- It looks nice!
- Is the pool captured?

573
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,980
Yes

574
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,660
Alright! Come in

575
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,340
Are you sure? Don't brush me off

576
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,240
My goodness, it looks great

577
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,820
Well, I'm just asking

578
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,620
We are staying here for a night

579
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,060
Why do you bring so many things?

580
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,440
You bumpkin. You don't understand it, do you?

581
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,280
- What are you going to do here?
- Look!

582
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
Why do you bring a lamp?

583
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,100
What is this?

584
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,100
- A dog?
- Is it a dog?

585
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
It is a panda, a bear

586
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,199
- The wine is good
- This!

587
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,159
This is for taking pictures

588
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
You'll pretend it were someone else's hand

589
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,880
- Are you filming a horror movie?
- Come on, don't be mean

590
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,699
- Are you filming a horror movie?
- This is a magazine shoot idea

591
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,739
You have no sense of artistic at all

592
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,300
- A selfie stick
- Well, let's take pictures

593
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,719
I found a perfect spot for pictures

594
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,340
- Go to the front
- It's perfect

595
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,900
- Can you take pictures for me?
- Go to the front

596
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,340
I've been your photographer
I want to take pictures too

597
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,420
I want to take pictures!

598
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,219
Let's go, be my photographer!

599
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,139
You are too bad, Qiao Xi Chen!

600
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,820
Are you sure it's here?

601
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,280
Trustworthy is my middle name

602
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,380
Here we are!

603
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,600
Uncle Wei, you're still listening to this?
Haven't you got tired of it?

604
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,080
You know nothing about it

605
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,540
Each repeat brings something new

606
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,200
Why are you here again?

607
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,880
Nothing, I'm just wandering around

608
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,680
My uncle's Korla fragrant pear
is always sweet

609
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,080
What are we doing here?

610
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,560
Well. Uncle

611
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,680
Can you get me two boxes of
fresh Fu Ping persimmons?

612
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,920
Why are you getting picky about food?

613
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,640
No. Do you see it selling here?

614
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,640
I'm keeping it for myself

615
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,760
Let me give you a leg massage

616
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,880
It's for this beauty, not me

617
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,980
I told her that you have
the best persimmon in Beijing

618
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,860
She didn't believe it and so we have a bet

619
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,900
She will be my girlfriend
if she loses our bet

620
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,020
Talk properly

621
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,980
Don't play tricks

622
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,740
- It's true
- Uncle, it's quite urgent

623
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,420
Can you sell me two boxes if you have it?

624
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,980
I don't have Fu Ping persimmons

625
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,960
but I have two boxes
of Zhang Fang's Mopan persimmons

626
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,120
How about Zhang Fang's Mopan?

627
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,540
Mopan persimmon isn't sweet enough

628
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,440
Is he angry?

629
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,200
What did I say?

630
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,220
Look, we both tried to goad him

631
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,440
Why doesn't my trick work?

632
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,100
- Forget it. Let's go
- No

633
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,780
- I have to ask him
- Hold on

634
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,560
Don't irk him, lest he refuse to sell us this

635
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,820
Don't worry, Uncle Wei is absolutely reliable

636
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,680
Try it. Is it crispy?

637
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,000
How is it?

638
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,480
How is the taste?

639
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,140
Not bad. You know what?

640
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,060
Zhang Fang started planting persimmons
since the Ming Dynasty

641
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,780
They used to be the royal tribute

642
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,360
It's not worse than Fu Ping persimmon

643
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,380
The sweetness is really different

644
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,620
The flesh tastes better

645
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,800
Uncle, can you sell me two boxes?

646
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,800
Please, I need it urgently

647
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,320
Then, tell me

648
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,120
Have you lost the bet?

649
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,100
I didn't make a bet with him
Please sell it to me

650
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,920
Persimmons

651
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,860
Yes, I lost

652
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,240
This is the best persimmon in Beijing

653
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,280
Uncle, please, it's urgent

654
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,100
Boy, come here

655
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,520
That's all I can help you

656
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,540
You have my respect for good!

657
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,980
Yes, they are in my trunk

658
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,340
Okay, I'll keep them in my car

659
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
I'll take them to the venue tomorrow noon

660
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,420
Okay, are other details confirmed?

661
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,480
- Okay
- No one picks up such a big order?

662
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,000
- What's up?
- Get into the car, I'll give you a ride

663
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,700
Wait

664
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I know you still care about me

665
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
I regret it, get out

666
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,980
Don't, please

667
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,440
I did you a huge favor

668
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,460
Besides, there is really
an emergency at the hotel

669
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,760
They are waiting for me

670
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,880
Sounds like you're important

671
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,160
You are right, I am

672
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,900
Turn on the navigation

673
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,360
Turn on the sound

674
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,840
It's okay. I'll navigate you

675
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,060
You are not as unreliable as I thought

676
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,060
Now you realized it

677
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Frankly speaking, the bet just now...

678
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,180
- Is it...
- What's blocking? Check the map

679
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,320
Don't sidetrack me. The bet just now

680
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,500
- The bet
- Yes, we're in a traffic jam, it's red light

681
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,200
The bet

682
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,160
Another picture here, come on

683
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,080
(Remembrance of Things Past)
Another picture here, come on

684
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,760
Another picture here, come on

685
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,080
That's old school. Didn't you
take a picture at the water pipe?

686
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,320
Do I look good? Okay, come on

687
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,280
Let's have another one

688
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,540
Enough, let's go to the hot spring

689
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,380
Stop thinking of that
You can soak there anytime

690
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,500
until your skin falls off.
Listen, Ou Yang said

691
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,460
there are rabbits and peacocks
Can you resist them?

692
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
That's nonsense

693
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,520
Qiao Xi Chen
Are you hiding something from me?

694
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,740
- You're having a suspicious mind
- Which of us is acting weird?

695
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,940
Can you feel it?

696
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,080
- It's snow
- From this hotel?

697
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,400
There's artificial snow

698
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,780
- Silly girl
- You call me silly?

699
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,520
- Rabbit, peacock!
- Forget it!

700
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,340
What?

701
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,220
Did you call him here?

702
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,540
Don't pull a long face, it makes you ugly

703
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,480
Talk it out face-to-face
so that you won't have any regrets

704
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,760
Anyway, I've given you an out
The ball is in your court now

705
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,020
Well, go

706
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,520
Your cell phone

707
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,720
Baby

708
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,240
Qiao Xi Chen told me about it

709
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,320
You went to the purchasing agent
to buy me shoes

710
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,360
Why didn't you tell me?

711
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,160
You've caused me to misunderstand you

712
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,240
This flower is for you

713
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,880
What do you mean? Are you blaming me?

714
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
No, I am not!

715
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,860
It is my fault

716
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,180
I should have listened to you before I...

717
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,940
What do you mean? You can buy it but I can't?

718
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,320
I can't make it clear now

719
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,880
Anyway, I apologize

720
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,080
Please don't be angry

721
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,340
It's your fault! I had to cancel
the booking of the homestay!

722
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,580
I know, I am here to make up for my mistake

723
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,880
Look at this snow

724
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,040
- You made it?
- I made it

725
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,880
This flower is also for you

726
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,480
Hold it

727
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,920
Later

728
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,020
we have to take hundreds of photos of it

729
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,060
Then, you will post on Moments
that you are in Hokkaido

730
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,700
Are you stupid?

731
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,380
Is it snowing in Hokkaido now?

732
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,320
I'll check what places
are having snowfall now

733
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,240
Isn't it snowing here now?

734
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
- You're annoying
- Well

735
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,960
You're silly

736
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,340
I'm going to grab a bite

737
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,920
Let me know what you and Shen Zi Chang want

738
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,440
Since you are here, stay with us one more day

739
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,820
I have tons of work, enjoy yourselves

740
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,900
What?

741
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,020
It's fishy

742
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,780
Come on, wait a minute

743
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,580
You're taking pictures. One more

744
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,740
No, wait

745
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,520
Come on, Ji Nan Jia, come clean

746
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,940
Why do you come here all the way?

747
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,740
Are you here for the hot springs?

748
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,380
When did you start hanging out with him?

749
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,060
Since when? You look so close

750
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,460
We are not

751
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,500
We are

752
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,880
Get out and enjoy yourself

753
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,060
- Don't
- Don't

754
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,540
No. You are already here, get out

755
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,100
Have a hot spring bath before you leave

756
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,360
Go away

757
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,820
I have other fish to fry

758
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,700
Xu Yan and Shen Zi Chang are being dramatic

759
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,840
Don't you want to take a look?

760
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,720
Great minds think alike

761
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,280
Let's join them, too

762
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,860
- I'll give you a bunch of five!
- Hey

763
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,060
You know what I saw?

764
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,140
There's a 24-hour chess and card room

765
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,000
Mahjong?

766
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,400
Shen Zi Chang can't play, we lack one player

767
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,480
The ace mahjong player is here

768
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,000
- I will park the car
- No, I'll do it

769
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
Look here

770
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm coming after you

771
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,360
- Seven dots
- There are no more dots

772
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,820
No more dots

773
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,600
There are so many winds

774
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,520
West

775
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,620
- Can you play?
- Of course

776
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,020
I am thinking of the strategy

777
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,520
Just throw one, hurry up

778
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,460
- Nine bamboos
- Won!

779
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,560
- You won?
- I just won

780
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,120
You gave her the tile she wanted

781
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,460
I would've won by self-drawn

782
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,960
Okay, I lost, I'll drink

783
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,100
Wait, do we have the beauties
saving heroes nowadays?

784
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,180
You read too much into it

785
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,020
With us, only the winner is eligible to drink

786
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
- Come on
- Hurry up

787
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,100
Don't you have team building activities?

788
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,560
Let me introduce him

789
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,060
I'm sorry, brother

790
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,080
He's a newcomer in the marketing department
Be nice to him

791
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,800
Let me introduce him

792
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,400
I'm sorry, brother

793
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,140
Hey, brother

794
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,780
You've started drinking.
Are you going to join the activities?

795
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,200
Who is your brother?

796
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,260
- Sister
- What's so fun?

797
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,940
It's the same every year

798
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,940
Frankly speaking, the event this year

799
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,380
is planned only by me, it'll be exciting

800
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,040
It is. You even got Nan Jia here

801
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,420
Honestly

802
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,300
Wait and see

803
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,240
Not bad

804
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,680
- Very good
- I didn't know you were coming

805
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,160
so we didn't do any preparation

806
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,800
What preparation do you need?

807
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
I know that the marketing department
is having a team building event here

808
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,200
I happened to meet a friend nearby
so I just drop by

809
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,160
The marketing department has
worked hard and needs some relaxation

810
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,280
Everyone worked hard for the projects lately

811
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,880
Come on, everyone
Mr. Jiang has something to say

812
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,600
Well, don't make it so formal

813
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
I know that your department
is here for team building. I just swung by

814
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,420
to express our gratitude to you

815
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,240
Your department has been working hard lately

816
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,760
But I believe the hard work is worth it

817
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,480
Because the entire Yann Coffee knows

818
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,440
your department's performance is fabulous

819
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,160
I hope that under Mr. Jian's leadership

820
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,000
you will continue to work hard

821
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,400
Let's strive together!

822
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,940
Great!

823
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,600
Okay, that's all from me

824
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,660
I believe you won't enjoy my presence

825
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,140
I'll leave you be

826
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,860
- See you, Mr. Jiang
- I'll see you out, Mr. Jiang

827
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,840
Just stop here

828
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,760
The wines in this hotel are fabulous

829
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,200
I need to relax too
I'll have a drink by myself

830
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,120
- You'll stay with them
- Mr. Jiang, take care

831
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,700
Ou Yang

832
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,300
Introduce your activities

833
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,360
Copy that! I won't let you down!

834
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,120
Friends, let us get excited

835
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,900
Let me explain the rules of the game

836
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,640
As soon as I release it, you have to

837
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,560
find out the person holding
the opposite end of your rope

838
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,360
That will be your partner today

839
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,620
You'll complete all activities together

840
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,940
- Okay?
- Okay

841
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,220
Be ready, I'm going to let go

842
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,320
Three, two

843
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,100
one!

844
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,520
It seems that we're made to be a pair

845
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,180
Mr. Jian, we are destined to be partners too

846
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,020
Alright, you already know your partners

847
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,420
Be ready for the first game

848
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,140
Before you start
let me announce today's prizes

849
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,500
The prize for first place
is three-day paid leave!

850
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,140
Wow!

851
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,880
Okay, come on

852
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,060
Three, two, one!

853
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:39,980
Come on!

854
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,960
I hereby announce the game
goes to Luo Jing and Dan Jia!

855
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,440
What's the matter with you?

856
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,460
Next, we'll have Mr. Jian, Mr. Wu

857
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,480
Qiao Xi Chen and Lin Rui, come on

858
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,980
Mr. Jian, don't worry

859
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,540
With their sizes

860
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,460
you can fully rely on me and just rest

861
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,080
Just because they are the superiors
doesn't mean you should throw the game

862
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
They don't want the leave, but we do

863
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,580
Don't worry, we'll get it
as long as you want it

864
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,260
Bragger

865
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,520
Are you all ready?

866
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,140
Three, two, one

867
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:23,900
Come on!

868
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,980
Hey, easy!

869
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,780
Come on!

870
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,000
I hereby announce the game
goes to Qiao Xi Chen and Lin Rui!

871
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,280
Next group, hurry up!

872
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,220
Can you fill me in?
I need to use the bathroom

873
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,260
The moon hang high tonight

874
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,040
But no stars come out

875
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,880
Baby, we've been watching
the moon for an hour

876
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,680
I'm dying, really, let's go out of here

877
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,920
What's wrong with being here an hour long?

878
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,140
I have to stay a little longer
Have you ever had a hot spring bath?

879
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,140
Don't try to drag me out

880
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,620
Honestly

881
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,160
Thank you

882
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,120
I found you familiar from the back
I didn't expect it would be you

883
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,920
Can I sit here?

884
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,500
Sure

885
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,920
Excuse me!

886
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,320
- I'll have the same drink
- Okay

887
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,920
You didn't change at all

888
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,120
But you did

889
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,720
Thanks

890
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,300
- Have you...
- I have fully recovered

891
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,720
Great

892
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,960
Nan Jia, you know what? Actually...

893
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,760
I've been asking myself

894
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,220
I often ask myself
what our relationship would be

895
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,660
if I didn't leave you that night

896
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,200
By the way, I'm so sorry about the banquet

897
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,660
I didn't know the person in charge was you

898
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,020
It's true

899
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,060
I didn't expect Han Yi Ting
would be so sensitive

900
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,220
I'm really sorry

901
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,080
I didn't know
you are Mr. Jiang from Yann Coffee

902
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,160
If I did, I wouldn't have accepted the order

903
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,460
Why?

904
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,620
Actually

905
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,960
everyone thinks I'm doing well
in the past few years

906
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,000
In fact, I'm not

907
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,480
Apparently, I am the powerful
general manager of Yann Coffee

908
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,160
who has married a beautiful wife
from a well-to-do family

909
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,040
It's said the men are spared
from working hard with such marriage

910
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,400
It's only known to myself

911
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,440
that Han Yi Ting and her dad

912
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,240
never treat me as their family

913
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,700
You have to be responsible
for your own choice

914
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,400
That's right

915
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,240
That's my choice

916
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,960
I chose to break up with you

917
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,100
I chose to marry Han Yi Ting

918
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,700
But this is different from what I thought

919
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,560
When we first knew each other
Han Yi Ting said she admired me

920
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,520
She said she didn't care about
the gap between our families

921
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,120
Now what?

922
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,940
It's hard for me to bare my heart with her

923
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,380
I can even read her distaste through her eyes

924
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,680
You don't need to tell me this

925
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,040
Maybe I've been keeping this all this way

926
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,820
and couldn't pour out to anyone else

927
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,220
Since I happened to run into you today

928
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,180
I am being long-winded
Don't take it to heart

929
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,620
I don't mean anything else, really

930
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,200
I am "somebody else" to you now

931
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,720
- No, Nan Jia, you are different
- I am not

932
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,700
I'm not different from others

933
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,340
So many years have passed

934
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,540
Living your own life well is what matters

935
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,220
I don't know why you are telling me this

936
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,380
Do you expect I'd comfort you

937
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,660
or join your tirade on your wife?

938
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,440
I can't actually do both

939
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,860
If any problems arose in your marriage

940
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,860
I think you should find a solution

941
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,640
I've seen Han Yi Ting only once
and it wasn't a happy encounter

942
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,460
But I think it is thanks to her help

943
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,040
that you're able to spread your wings

944
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,480
at a large company like Yann Coffee

945
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,340
Jiang Hao, be fair

946
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,520
While complaining about her changes

947
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,380
you should also ponder

948
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,200
if you're still the same person
whom she won't hesitate to fall in love with

949
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,320
I am leaving, I think I drank too much

950
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,240
What are you doing here?

951
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,820
If my boss knows
that I listened in on his gossip

952
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,340
he'll surely kick me out of the company

953
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,260
Why did you do that then?

954
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,460
The interesting story is worth it

955
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,960
Then again

956
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,500
you are Mr. Jiang's ex-girlfriend

957
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,340
No wonder you looked awkward that day

958
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,780
When and why did you break up?

959
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,800
Aren't you afraid that
I'll kill you after you know the story?

960
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,100
- What's up?
- Come on

961
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,960
I know you're upset right now

962
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,020
Take it out on me

963
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,020
Who told you I'm upset?

964
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,600
People normally get upset by this, right?

965
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,500
You know what?

966
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,580
Mr. Jiang is surely
still remorseful about leaving you

967
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,580
He surely is

968
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,340
Do you think I was dumped because he married
a rich wife and looks high-spirited now?

969
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,160
No, brother, I dumped him, okay?
You are really interesting

970
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,640
No, then

971
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,120
It stands to reason that I assumed

972
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,120
What's wrong?

973
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,040
Why?

974
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,260
I was diagnosed with cancer five years ago

975
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,940
It was cervical cancer

976
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,040
I had to undergo an operation

977
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,980
If it failed, my uterus would be removed

978
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,380
If it succeeded

979
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,800
it might recur at any time in five years

980
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,120
That's when he left you? He's not a man!

981
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,480
I told you I brought it up, are you deaf?

982
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,040
I didn't want him to waste time on me

983
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,680
What's more

984
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,200
five years is quite a long period

985
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,040
Humanity cannot withstand any test

986
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,360
I am not sure if my feelings
for him will change in five years

987
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:17,840
Instead of having an ugly breakup

988
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,560
we might as well end the relationship early

989
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,660
Then, we can leave a good impression
for each other

990
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
It's cheesy, right?

991
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,160
I do think you are cool

992
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,480
If I were you

993
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,000
I might not be as courageous as you

994
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,800
But if I were Jiang Hao

995
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,320
I wouldn't leave you

996
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,920
I've drunk too much, I'm leaving

997
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,520
Hey!

998
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:03,140
Don't tell Qiao Xi Chen and the rest
about my past with Jiang Hao

999
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,980
and my cancer, they don't know it

1000
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,660
Don't worry

1001
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,280
Hey!

1002
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,140
You're super cool

1003
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,300
Screw you

1004
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,980
Some people are upset after losing the game

1005
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,520
- I am not
- But you're pulling a long face

1006
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,580
That's not the reason

1007
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,360
What's wrong?

1008
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,920
Leave me be, just enjoy yourself

1009
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,500
Leave you be?

1010
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,820
Why are you speaking so tartly?

1011
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,580
What's wrong with you?

1012
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,260
Let's call a spade a spade

1013
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,660
Ou Yang is good at event management

1014
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,360
The game, the atmosphere
and everything are pretty good

1015
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,820
It's better than mine last year

1016
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,200
Of course, all of these

1017
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,920
are thanks to your support

1018
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,340
The hotel room

1019
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,100
is the best room I have
ever stayed in. Thank you

1020
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,360
You finally know what is supposed to be said

1021
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,560
- Qiao Xi Chen!
- You...

1022
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,120
You're here. I've been looking around for you

1023
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,900
- Mr. Jian
- Have the finals started?

1024
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,680
No, it's still a while to the start

1025
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,200
I have something to talk to you

1026
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,320
We can talk about it while walking there

1027
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,660
Go ahead

1028
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,080
See you later

1029
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,760
Hey, go get my phone and take a picture of me

1030
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,700
Okay, I like the idea

1031
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,100
Go quickly

1032
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,800
It's cold outside

1033
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,480
- Hurry up!
- Alright

1034
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,120
Baby, what is this?

1035
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,340
Don't leak it to anyone else

1036
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,060
Anyway, you have no one to tell

1037
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,140
This is

1038
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,240
what Jing Jing gave to Lin Rui

1039
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,860
Jing Jing to Lin Rui?

1040
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,320
Jing Jing was so attached to Lin Rui

1041
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,640
Really?

1042
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,500
Don't you believe me?

1043
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,020
Look, what is this?

1044
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,860
A lock and a key

1045
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,440
You can open it

1046
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,860
In the basketball club...

1047
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,300
Nan Jia

1048
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,160
Why are you still here?
You've been here for quite a while

1049
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,700
Your skin is about to fall off. Get her out

1050
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,340
Remember what I just said?

1051
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,240
I'll get you a towel, wait here

1052
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,800
You are really good

1053
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,340
Qiao Xi Chen stuffed her face
during the buffet last time

1054
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,900
And now, you get shortness of breath
because of the bath

1055
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,200
- Do you have any chocolate? Get her one
- Yes

1056
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,280
Nan Jia, weren't you at the event?
Why are you here?

1057
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,180
With whom do I build the team?
I'm not part of their company

1058
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,300
Do I need that?

1059
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,760
- Yan
- Yes

1060
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,560
What happened between Jing Jing and Lin Rui?

1061
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,500
Hey

1062
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,500
Don't you have something to tell me? Say it

1063
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,640
Tonight is my most relaxing day
since I returned

1064
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,140
That's good

1065
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,900
And then?

1066
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,140
What do you think our relationship would be

1067
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,600
if I hadn't gone abroad?

1068
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,240
What's the point of
making such an assumption?

1069
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,680
Of course there is

1070
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,120
Maybe we can start again

1071
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,060
Give me a break

1072
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,940
That being said

1073
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,820
Jing Jing bought the tickets when she
showed Lin Rui's parents around Beijing

1074
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,580
No wonder she borrowed my car

1075
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,380
I wondered with whom she was going out

1076
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,640
She was on a business trip back then.
She even gave up the bonus

1077
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,800
Why must she help Lin Rui?

1078
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,160
Actually, they had been in contact

1079
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,720
and Lin Rui always went to Jing Jing for help

1080
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,400
Jing Jing helped him with all the errands

1081
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,820
like his friend's wedding
and getting the degree certificate

1082
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,220
She didn't hesitate to help
when Lin Rui approached her

1083
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,380
Why did he approach Jing Jing

1084
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,020
when his parents came to Beijing?
What did he take her for?

1085
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,220
That's funny

1086
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,160
Nan Jia

1087
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,800
Actually...

1088
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,600
Actually, the person

1089
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,560
she fancied wasn't Gao Tian Yang

1090
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,800
Xiao Xi

1091
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,340
I didn't expect to see you again

1092
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,700
and become your colleague after coming back

1093
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,120
Lately, our past story came to me off and on

1094
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,240
I remember them all

1095
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,680
I just came to realize that you are
the one who really understands me

1096
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,680
No one cares about me more than you

1097
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,500
Xiao Xi

1098
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,480
Can you accept me again?

1099
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,120
I promise

1100
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,540
I won't leave you again this time

1101
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,220
I cross my heart

1102
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,780
Back then, it was Jing Jing who brought
me and Qiao Xi Chen to his basketball club

1103
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,120
Qiao Xi Chen got to know Lin Rui through this

1104
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,560
But we can't blame Qiao Xi Chen

1105
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,240
Qiao Xi Chen doesn't know
Lin Rui is the one Jing Jing fancied

1106
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,180
She thinks it is Gao Tian Yang

1107
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,260
Jing Jing didn't want Qiao Xi Chen
to get the wrong idea

1108
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,780
so she kept quiet and acquiesced in it

1109
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,440
Do you think Lin Rui knows about this?

1110
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,920
You mean Lin Rui knows Jing Jing fancied him?

1111
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,360
If he doesn't know it,
why did he contact Jing Jing

1112
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,720
after breaking up with Qiao Xi Chen
while knowing they were good friends?

1113
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,200
If he knew it...

1114
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,920
He was making Jing Jing his back-up

1115
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,020
- Where are you going?
- I am going to him!

1116
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,960
In this? Get changed

1117
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,680
I'm going to change clothes

1118
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,720
It's inappropriate

1119
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,120
Lin Rui, do you know

1120
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,860
what broke my heart the most over the years?

1121
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,160
I know

1122
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,300
It is when I suddenly went abroad
and left you behind

1123
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,420
I know, I can make it up to you

1124
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,020
No, it's not

1125
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,020
It's true

1126
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,840
The most saddening part

1127
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,540
is that I used to think that my world
would collapse after you left

1128
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,080
But then I found out that it didn't

1129
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,100
Not only that, I was doing quite well

1130
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,340
The most saddening part

1131
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:23,100
is that I wasn't as heartbroken as I thought

1132
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,960
Xiao Xi

1133
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,680
It means that we can start over again
Don't you think so?

1134
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,880
Lin Rui, let me make it simple

1135
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,320
I used to think love was everything in life

1136
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,840
At least I really thought so for once

1137
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,240
But now, I know it is not

1138
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,920
There are so many important
people and things in my life

1139
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,280
I love them and they love me too

1140
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,480
I like my new life

1141
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,380
Although my life hasn't been smooth sailing

1142
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,720
there are sadness
and frustrations and even...

1143
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,520
Even Jing Jing left me

1144
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,420
But I still like my new life

1145
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,480
I've grown up, you should grow up too

1146
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,760
You will have your new life

1147
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,700
True

1148
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,980
- Xu Yan!
- What did you take Hu Jing Jing for?

1149
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,920
Do you know she fancied you?
What did you think of her?

1150
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,400
No, wait

1151
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,340
Xu Yan, I'm here

1152
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Who fancied whom? What are you talking about?

1153
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,440
I'm her sister, tell me

1154
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,800
What did you take her for?

1155
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,100
Xiao Xi

1156
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,900
Let me explain it

1157
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,880
It was probably the second year
I was overseas

1158
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,180
I went abroad after finishing my junior year

1159
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,940
It happened to be my graduation

1160
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,580
There were tons of things to deal with

1161
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,300
Besides, I was still adapting the life abroad

1162
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,500
I was in a fix and didn't have any way out

1163
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,780
So I emailed Jing Jing

1164
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,900
and asked her to help me
deal with some school matters

1165
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,060
Why did you approach her for help
since you broke up with Qiao Xi Chen?

1166
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,240
Jing Jing and I were classmates
before I knew you

1167
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,220
We were on friendly terms
Although we broke up

1168
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,580
I don't think she would ignore me for that

1169
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,740
Later...

1170
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,520
She helped me settle everything very soon

1171
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,340
I was really having a difficult time abroad

1172
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,220
I couldn't keep up in class

1173
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,140
I barely had friends

1174
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,080
I couldn't help but pour out to her

1175
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,360
Her encouragement and support
were to the point

1176
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,860
I remember I mentioned
missing the taste of Lao Gan Ma

1177
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,760
Then, she sent me a box of it

1178
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,380
Only then I vaguely felt her feelings for me

1179
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,980
So you exploited her feelings for you, right?

1180
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,660
You bossed her around

1181
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,240
Why did you get her to accompany your parents
when they came to Beijing?

1182
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,980
She took your parents around

1183
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,540
She bought an extra ticket
at all the attractions

1184
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,380
Why did she do so? For whom did she buy it?

1185
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,080
Lin Rui, that's not the way to go

1186
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,840
Hu Jing Jing was cherished by her parents

1187
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,180
She wasn't obliged to do that

1188
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,700
Yes, Xiao Xi

1189
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,979
I didn't think about that

1190
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,460
What were you thinking then?

1191
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,819
Do you think Hu Jing Jing's death
doesn't pain me?

1192
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,479
Hmm?

1193
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,520
But you can't push the blame to me

1194
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,939
Did she commit suicide
just because I didn't reply to her email

1195
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:48,580
and tell her that I fancied her? No way

1196
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,319
Is it a rule that I must respond to her love?

1197
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:54,020
Xiao Xi

1198
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,180
You're the only one I love since then

1199
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,120
Why didn't you tell me?

1200
01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:03,819
Xiao Xi

1201
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:18,620
Hello, Mr. Jian

1202
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,740
I need to talk to you

1203
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,300
Okay, I'll be right there

1204
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,160
Qiao Xi Chen

1205
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,700
Mr. Jian

1206
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,600
We like to cling to the past

1207
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,120
It could be the old clothes
that we might never wear again

1208
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,000
the old photos taking up the space
which we are reluctant to delete

1209
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,680
and the ex-lovers

1210
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,320
whom we occasionally think of
in those sleepless nights

1211
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,120
The nostalgia for the good old days

1212
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,360
is due more to uncertainty about the future

1213
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,000
But the past is over after all

1214
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,000
We should all learn to say goodbye

1215
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,440
Move forward, be brave

1216
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,140
- Just say it
- Qiao Xi Chen

1217
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,420
- What is it?
- Qiao Xi Chen

1218
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,420
What's up?

1219
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,120
Sorry

1220
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,180
Sorry

1221
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,460
What happened?

1222
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,400
- It hurts
- Where does it hurt?

1223
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,540
My stomach

1224
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,100
Let's go

1225
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,080
It's acute appendicitis
But luckily it's not serious

1226
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,340
What are you doing?

1227
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,320
It drips too slow

1228
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,800
Does it hurt?

1229
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,840
- How do you feel?
- A lot better, thank you, doctor

1230
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,620
Generally, acute appendicitis
can easily become chronic

1231
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,220
You should pay more attention to it

1232
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,100
If there is uninterrupted pain

1233
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,170
you must seek medical care
as soon as possible

1234
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,500
- You'll be in trouble if perforation occurs
- It's so troublesome

1235
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,280
You can also have it removed
to save you bother

1236
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,940
The appendix has no other function
except for having inflammation

1237
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,000
- That's okay
- I'll have it removed

1238
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,080
I'll have it removed

1239
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,780
- Take a rest, I'll make the arrangement
- Thank you
