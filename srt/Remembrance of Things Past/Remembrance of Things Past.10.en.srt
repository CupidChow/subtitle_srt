1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840
Buy three, get two. 34 yuan

2
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,440
The total should be...

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,440
Buy five, free two sounds good too

4
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, it's just 386 yuan

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,360
(Remembrance of Things Past)

6
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,759
104 yuan
(Remembrance of Things Past)

7
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,560
(Remembrance of Things Past)

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,720
1,800 yuan
(Remembrance of Things Past)

9
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,360
1,800 yuan

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,479
Oh, what are you doing here?

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,479
Look how much all these only cost

12
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,479
1,800 yuan. Amazing, right?

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,560
- Great, right?
- Let me check

14
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,960
The second bottle of your
cleanser may be at half price

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,980
but this brand's cleanser
is only good for a year

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,560
By then, you're going to throw half of it

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,280
This is usually 19.9 yuan

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
It's only three yuan cheaper now

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,160
But, you have to buy at least ten

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
You can't use them all
You'd have to give them away

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
And this lip balm

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,000
There's three in a bundle

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,960
You won't be using at least two of them

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,760
So, you spent twice
the amount to buy one item

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,220
It's a trick. Cancel this

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,320
This brand of shower gel is awful

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
This sunscreen too

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
Look, the total would be

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,520
Only 500 yuan

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,960
There may be a lot of items here

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,360
but you won't be using half of them

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,600
- That makes sense
- So, remember this

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,680
There are thousands of marketing tricks

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,320
The first thing you should do
is to guard your purse

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,120
Li Na, you're awesome

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,340
I must ask for your suggestion next time

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
It's really cheaper now

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
Look how much I've saved for you

39
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,920
(Episode 10: Sorry)

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,600
You scared me

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,040
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,520
You were nowhere to be found

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
I thought something happened to you

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,240
What, you think I was committing suicide?

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
It's not that serious

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
How is it not serious?

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,600
You're just acting cool in front of me now

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,960
I can see through you

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
I didn't want you to worry about me

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,280
Can I stop worrying just
because you don't want me to?

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm your girlfriend

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Hey, listen

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,800
I know who leaked the recordings

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Miao Miao

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
How did you know?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Most parts of the recording
was my work conversation with her

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Since you knew it

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,880
why didn't you tell me?

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,100
Someone's actually manipulating
Miao Miao from behind the scenes

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,100
Lu Yi Ning

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,120
Fine, I wasted my time coming here

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
Why are you so smart?

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
How did you know everything?

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,680
I've been thinking about what
transpired for the past few days

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
There's no bad blood
between Miao Miao and me

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,360
She has no reason to frame me

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,560
She must have done that
because someone bribed her

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,480
The person who would benefit
the most out of this is Lu Yi Ning

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
But, I have no proof yet

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
It's okay, I'm sure we'll find
a way to gather evidence

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,080
What were you telling me
at the door just now?

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong?

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,400
Other than my conversation with Miao Miao

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,520
there's another recording
of me with someone else

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Who?

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,840
Lin Rui

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Listen, I didn't expect
that he's that sort of person

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,120
Had I known earlier

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
I wouldn't have dated him

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,880
Back when we were studying

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,800
I knew he's always been competitive

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,680
But, I didn't expect that
he'd do something like that

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,200
Don't look at me like this

84
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,120
You're making me feel more awkward

85
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,040
Fine, take it that I was blind

86
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,040
It's okay

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Still, I can understand Lin Rui

88
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,320
He felt indignant because he never
got to shine while working under me

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
So, just like Miao Miao

90
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,680
he was easily persuaded by Lu Yi Ning

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,640
You're pretty level-headed

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,300
But, not me

93
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,300
No matter what his reasons are

94
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,840
since he did something like that
that makes him a lousy character

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
What's wrong?

96
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
Ou Yang got a friend

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,920
to analyze that the recording was edited

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,200
That's all he could find, though

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,880
He can't prove that I'm innocent

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Since he can prove that the recording is fake

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,080
it means they've submitted false evidence

102
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,880
This means they're framing you

103
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,520
How can that not prove your innocence?

104
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
What everyone wants to see

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,840
is how a demonic boss lashed out
towards his poor subordinate

106
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,080
and how the subordinate
fought back and valiantly won

107
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,200
To the netizens, the truth isn't important

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
What matters is what they want to see

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
How awful

110
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Come on

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,400
A few days ago, we didn't
have an inkling of what happened

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Now, we've found the root of the problem

113
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
We just need to solve it

114
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
- Right?
- Hmm

115
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
You're right

116
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,020
This isn't the time to be discouraged

117
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,159
We need to find a solution

118
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,040
Actually, I think we've got
a lot of information now

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's start from Lu Yi Ning

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,280
She took so much effort
to execute such a huge move

121
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
It'd be hard to make her change her testimony

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,400
Then, Miao Miao...

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,560
Actually, I talked to her today

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,480
Judging from how she is now
I think it'd be hard to persuade her

125
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,159
Fine

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,760
It's settled. I'll take care of Lin Rui

127
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,660
No, I don't want you to seduce him

128
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,500
Who's seducing him?

129
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,000
You think beauty is my only advantage?

130
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,340
Listen, I have beauty and this

131
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,840
Hey, ma'am

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,880
Two egg pancakes, please

133
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Extra sausages, extra spicy

134
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,800
- Make another two for takeaway too
- Okay

135
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,200
- Thank you
- Why do you want so many?

136
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,880
Since we're here
I'll buy extra for your supper

137
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Girl, I haven't seen you for years

138
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
I thought you're not in Beijing anymore

139
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,840
- You remember me?
- Of course

140
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,640
You'd buy egg pancakes here every morning

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,520
Then, you'd munch on them as you walk

142
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,840
I thought, poor girl, she's so busy
until she's got no time for breakfast

143
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
I wasn't busy then
I was just starting to work

144
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,040
I was worried that they'd
deduct my pay for being late

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,880
Ma'am, can I ask you something?

146
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,000
Has she always been so
foul-tempered since then?

147
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
Your boyfriend?

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
- No
- Yes

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,700
Girls from the northeast have a temper

150
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,480
Oh

151
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
Anyway, ma'am

152
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
How do you know she's from the northeast?

153
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,840
She still spoke like a
northeastern girl back then, unlike now

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,360
She's dropped the accent

155
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,400
Ma'am, I thought you've gone
home already after so many years

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,960
At first, I did quit this job
I did return home

157
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
My son had graduated too

158
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,880
Since he's working, he wanted me
to spend my days happily at home

159
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,320
But, I just couldn't stay put
I'm used to living in Beijing

160
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,520
That's why I'm back

161
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,400
I want to work for a few
more years and earn more

162
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
I need to save up for
my son's wedding someday

163
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
- Hey
- How nice

164
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,400
- Two pancakes
- Thank you, ma'am

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
You're welcome

166
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,440
Ma'am, this is delicious!

167
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Hey, we have the same interest now, right?

168
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,720
Shen Zi Chang

169
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,600
Why are you wearing this?

170
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,800
This is so embarrassing

171
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,020
You even bought flowers?

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Where did you get the money?

173
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,920
Tell me, where did you get the money?

174
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
Take it off

175
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,160
Hey, who are you?

176
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm waiting for my girlfriend

177
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me using my money?

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,680
No, no

179
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
I mistook you for the wrong guy

180
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
I couldn't see your face
I thought you were...

181
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,160
Oh, I'll put it back

182
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Your girlfriend would love your outfit

183
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,800
Trust me, I wish you success. Good luck!

184
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,520
What kind of girl would like that?

185
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
How tacky

186
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,240
Shen Zi Chang, you jerk

187
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,380
Attention, everyone

188
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,440
I have two things to announce

189
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,800
From today onward

190
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
Lin Rui will be the second group's leader

191
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,520
Secondly, the Pink Ribbon project...
Miao Miao

192
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,580
Yi Ning

193
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,480
You will be the correspondent

194
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay, understood

195
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Okay, get back to work

196
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,160
Yi Ning, I need to ask you something

197
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,840
I've been in charge of
the Pink Ribbon project

198
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,760
Then, prepare the documents
and hand them over to Miao Miao

199
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
Can you give me a reason?

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,160
The reason is

201
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,920
I think you're no longer
fit to handle this project

202
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Any more questions?

203
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,640
No more

204
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,080
Hey, I said that you're going
to treat me lunch someday

205
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I got it right, didn't I?

206
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,760
Brother Qiang, since you mentioned it

207
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
feel free to order whatever you like

208
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,720
- I'm footing the bill
- Great! What do you want to eat?

209
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,280
How about Japanese food?

210
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Sure

211
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,680
Japanese food, then

212
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,920
Brother Qiang, I just remembered
that I have some unfinished work

213
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,560
Why don't you go first?

214
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
Hey, are you trying to run away?

215
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,280
Am I that kind of person?

216
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
- You're sure?
- Yeah

217
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,320
Okay, we'll wait for you there

218
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,760
Let's wait for him there

219
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,640
Hurry up. You're the star

220
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,180
Congratulations

221
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Thanks

222
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,800
- I thought...
- You thought what?

223
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
You're my direct supervisor now

224
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,520
I need to butter you up

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Are you serious?

226
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Yeah

227
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Can you let me handle the
Pink Ribbon project again?

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,280
Sister Ning has already made her decision

229
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Don't be upset

230
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,200
In the future, you can pick
any project you like in our group

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
Really?

232
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,320
- Xiao Xi
- Yes?

233
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,000
I haven't seen you smile
at me for a long time

234
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,240
Do I look good when I smile?

235
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,160
You do. You look good anytime

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,840
So, can I ask you out for dinner tomorrow?

237
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,400
No problem

238
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,040
Let's go to that place we wanted
to go when we were studying, Si...

239
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
- What's that again?
- Si Ji Hotel

240
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
How about it?

241
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,560
Why don't I find a hotel and book a room?

242
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I'll treat you to dinner

243
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
It's the same. Your treat, then

244
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,120
But, I might be a little late tomorrow

245
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,320
- Can you wait?
- I'll wait, no matter how late

246
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Bye

247
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,560
(Voice recording)

248
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
Shen Zi Chang, you jerk

249
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,680
You've been ignoring me for a week

250
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
You've grown a spine

251
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
You want me to go to you first? No way

252
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,000
(View profile)

253
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,480
Having fun now, aren't you?

254
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,300
Wow

255
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Pretty lady

256
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
Want to go for a ride?

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
Nice bike

258
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,400
How can I ride with these clothes on?

259
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Hey

260
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
I came well-prepared

261
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Oh

262
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,640
This will keep you warm now

263
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,520
Also, about the place we're going

264
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,320
I guarantee, even if you
freeze to death, it's worth it

265
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,520
- Here
- Really?

266
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Hop on

267
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,360
- All set?
- Yeah

268
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,720
Come on, a round of drinks

269
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,520
Cheers!

270
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
It's been so long

271
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
The food here isn't good

272
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,320
It's not spicy enough

273
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
This isn't spicy enough?

274
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,920
Were you an adopted kid from Sichuan?

275
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Look how swollen your lips are

276
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,640
You're like a fire-breathing dragon now

277
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,840
Come on, I love spicy food

278
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Fine

279
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
What's wrong?

280
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,760
I think something's going down inside me

281
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
Ha ha ha

282
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
I need to use the loo

283
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,400
- Hello. How many persons?
- I'm looking for someone

284
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,600
We got to squeeze him dry today

285
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,600
He always bails out
when he's footing the bill

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
So what if he's got a girlfriend?

287
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,619
That's not how he was

288
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,240
He's getting so stingy
He won't even buy us a can of coke now

289
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
About that ride-sharing trouble last time

290
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
if we hadn't helped him back then

291
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,319
he wouldn't treat us to dinner

292
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,400
What a stingy guy

293
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,920
Xu Yan, you...

294
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,319
Shen Zi Chang, come on

295
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,020
Why did you choose this place
to treat your friends?

296
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,360
What's so good about this place?

297
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,040
Waiter, get us a set of cutlery!

298
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,360
Sit down

299
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,800
What's going on?

300
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, Hua Zi was craving for Sichuanese food

301
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,160
There's this new place here
so I brought them here for dinner

302
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,880
I'll treat you to something
better next time, okay?

303
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,240
See, if there's one thing
good about Shen Zi Chang

304
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,480
he's dependable

305
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,200
How much can this meal cost, anyway?

306
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,480
We can afford to treat, no problem

307
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
Is this enough food? Order more if you want

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
It's enough

309
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,760
We've been waiting for that line!

310
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Waiter!

311
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
Menu, please! We're ordering!

312
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
Okay, coming

313
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
- Get me a plate of beef
- A plate of beef

314
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,440
Just get me one of each dish
from the first three pages of the menu

315
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,620
- Hurry up
- Sure

316
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
Eat up

317
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Zi Chang

318
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,440
You should've brought Xu Yan here earlier

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,200
Eat up

320
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,680
Yeah, dig in

321
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,680
Thank you

322
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,120
Here's your food!

323
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Ou Yang, if I ever believe you again

324
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,320
I'll write my name backwards

325
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,560
I asked Qiao Xi Chen about it

326
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
She said that when you
first started your business

327
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,160
you often brought her here
late at night after work

328
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Not this place

329
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
It is

330
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,520
They moved to this shop. Try it

331
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
It's the same, right?

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,320
- Oh
- Right?

333
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh, it really is the same place

334
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,000
Even if you freeze to death
it's worth it, right?

335
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
It's not

336
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,360
If I die, I wouldn't be able to eat this

337
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,480
My cousin could eat
two portions of their radish

338
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,680
Hey, waiter, get me another plate of radish

339
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,920
Okay

340
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
What are you doing?

341
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Hey, look

342
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,560
We have another thing
we like in common, right?

343
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,560
Are we getting more compatible now?

344
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Okay

345
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
You've put in a lot of effort to help me

346
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,000
So, if there's something
you like or want to do

347
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,640
just tell me, and I'll see if I can help

348
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh

349
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,680
Something I like...

350
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,960
Do you count as that?

351
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,880
I'll throw you out

352
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,760
Something memorable

353
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,080
Memorable...

354
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,320
Oh, that's right. My 18th birthday

355
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,560
I remember it well

356
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,160
My parents had returned from overseas

357
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,600
The entire family was there to celebrate

358
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
Back then, my dad patted my shoulder and said

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
"Son, you're 18 today"

360
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
"Tell me what you want to do"

361
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,920
What did you want to do?

362
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,800
I said, "Dad"

363
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
"I want to do something only adults can do"

364
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,680
Must be something dirty

365
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,000
Blood donation
I'm talking about blood donation

366
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,240
You're the dirty one here

367
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,120
All you think about are the lewd stuff

368
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,080
What did I think about?
I wasn't thinking about anything

369
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
Listen, I remember I did
so many things that day

370
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,540
I went to the blood mobile

371
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,840
and slapped my ID on the counter

372
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,880
I said, "I'm 18. I want to donate blood"

373
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,320
I felt that I was so amazing

374
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,840
Then, I told my dad

375
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,440
"I'm an adult. I'm going
to stay outside for the night"

376
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,180
My dad said okay. I was overjoyed

377
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,580
I bought two dozen cans of beer
and called my friends up

378
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I booked a hotel room

379
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,320
and we were planning to have fun

380
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,520
Guess what happened?

381
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,480
No one was keeping an eye on me
and I suddenly felt awkward

382
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,900
I felt bored

383
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,000
Then, I spent the whole night
gaming with my friends

384
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,160
So, you spent the night of
your 18th birthday playing games?

385
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,640
Of course not

386
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,240
I went back home before 12

387
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
My grandma cooked me
a bowl of longevity noodles

388
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,160
The noodles were already
cold and soggy at that time

389
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,120
but that was the best
longevity noodles I've ever had

390
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,040
Really. I've never had it since then

391
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,960
Okay, it's worth a bottle of booze

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,120
Shen Zi Chang

393
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,560
What's with you?
You don't even have 1,000 yuan?

394
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,560
I give you 6,000 yuan every month

395
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,160
You also maxed out all my credit cards

396
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm broke

397
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,480
What should we do, then?

398
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,520
I saved up our money

399
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,000
Otherwise, I might spend it

400
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,560
Then, why did you show off?

401
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
I could have settled this with 300 yuan

402
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
Great, it's 1,300 yuan now

403
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,960
You didn't hear what Hua Zi said about you

404
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,600
I couldn't stomach it
I had to redeem your pride

405
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,920
Excuse me, who's paying?

406
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,760
Oh, hold on

407
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,200
Qiao Xi Chen, help me

408
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,680
Qiao Xi Chen, I love you

409
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,080
Once I'm done with things here
I'll tell you what happened

410
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,240
Since you're borrowing money

411
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,160
you could've borrowed an extra 100 yuan

412
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,040
I don't even have five yuan in my pocket now
How can we even hire a taxi?

413
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
The more I borrow, the more we have to pay

414
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
You want to get a taxi?

415
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
We're taking the bus

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,320
Look at the bill. 1,346 yuan

417
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,560
My heart is aching

418
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,700
I'll just tell them to go Dutch

419
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,200
You dare?

420
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,080
We're getting our pride back today

421
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,320
Stop slouching and act like a boss

422
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,320
Okay, let's go

423
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,120
Hey, we've paid the bill, let's go

424
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Let's go

425
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,920
Excuse me, sir
You still need to pay for the cola

426
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,560
What cola?

427
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,800
We ordered some cola while waiting for you

428
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
Right? Okay

429
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,640
We'll wait for you downstairs. Take your time

430
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,520
- How much is the cola?
- Eight yuan

431
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Please show your QR code

432
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Waited long?

433
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,160
Not really

434
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,200
I said I'd wait for you no matter how late

435
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,760
Right, they're serving your
favorite yellow croaker here, and...

436
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,480
Oh, no hurry

437
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
There's still someone coming

438
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Hey

439
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,760
Well

440
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,880
Since I'm eating with my ex
I have to report this to my boyfriend

441
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Thank you

442
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,020
Lin Rui, do you want to listen yourself
or should I play it for you?

443
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
(Voice recording)

444
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,520
You look good anytime

445
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,640
Choose any project you like in our group

446
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,840
I'll book a hotel room

447
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,840
I'll wait for you, no matter how late

448
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
What is this?

449
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,160
Actually, this is why we're here

450
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,120
I can hand this recording to Sai Wen directly

451
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,520
and say that you're sexually harassing me

452
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,480
I can let you have a taste
of your own medicine

453
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,840
We have gathered the evidence

454
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,840
We'll show the original recording to HR

455
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,840
and the truth will be revealed

456
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,840
But, I didn't do so

457
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,400
We're friends, after all

458
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,200
I hope you can salvage
even a shred of your pride

459
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,860
and explain everything to Sai Wen

460
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,100
I have nothing to explain

461
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
That's right

462
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,080
It was Lu Yi Ning who ordered me
to call you to talk about work

463
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
I recorded the call

464
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,280
Since both of you already know
I have nothing to say

465
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,800
But, I'll never prove your innocence

466
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Lin Rui

467
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,640
Let's talk as friends

468
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Can we?

469
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Sit

470
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
I know Lu Yi Ning's motive

471
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,440
I can guess Miao Miao's motive too

472
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
But, what about you?

473
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,200
I'd like to ask you this too

474
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,320
What problem do you have with me?

475
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
Why do you keep putting me down?

476
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
You didn't even give me
a chance to prove myself

477
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
That's what you feel?

478
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
What else?

479
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
I made you start over

480
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,920
because you've never worked in China

481
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,640
I care more about practical skills
than your academic qualifications

482
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,520
About the new product development

483
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,680
my opinion is still the same

484
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,560
I don't care about others

485
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
But in Yann Coffee
we do not tolerate plagiarism

486
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,200
You keep boasting that
you're better than everyone else

487
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,840
When did you ever prove that?

488
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,520
Is it because I never gave you a chance

489
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,200
or because you didn't seize the chance?

490
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,480
Lin Rui, this is the workplace, not a school

491
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,000
No one cares about your pride and emotions

492
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,880
If you want to win everyone's admiration

493
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,280
show us some convincing results

494
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,040
Ranting, feeling indignant

495
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
and even pulling lowly
tricks behind the scenes

496
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
Is this what you're capable of?

497
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,480
Lin Rui

498
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Lin Rui

499
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,160
Why have you become like this?

500
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,320
I've always thought that you're outstanding

501
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,920
Really

502
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,560
I've never thought of you
as someone despicable

503
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,320
Until today

504
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,440
After all that you've done

505
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,920
when you get what you want

506
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,560
will you really be happy?

507
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,360
Say, when we can't even afford cola

508
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,640
can we even buy a house?

509
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,840
I thought about it just now

510
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,520
We can't keep on like this

511
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,520
Hey, baby, you've finally thought it through

512
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,120
That's what I think too. This is too tiring

513
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
You know what they say, save as you earn

514
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,440
We can't just save

515
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,280
We need to earn too

516
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,960
We need to find a way to get more money

517
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,760
Earn more money?

518
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,320
I already thought of an idea

519
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,560
- Oh?
- Ride sharing

520
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,600
I can work as a ride-sharing
driver after work every day

521
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,400
I mean, I should do
something to help too, right?

522
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,200
I can't make you do all the work

523
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,200
I need to find a part-time job too

524
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,160
What kind of part-time job can you do?

525
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,680
Are you looking down on me?

526
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,920
There are so many things I can do

527
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,560
Before I came up with this plan

528
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,840
I just wanted to do an easy job every day

529
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,480
and look for you or my friends after work

530
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,760
But, it's different now

531
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,720
We're planning to buy a house now, right?

532
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,640
So, I don't want to waste every minute

533
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,560
I want a place of our own in Beijing!

534
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,440
Oh, yes

535
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,920
- Do you love me?
- Love you

536
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,040
Do you love me?

537
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,040
Love you

538
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,920
Let's go

539
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,360
Mix the noodles well

540
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,120
Mix it with a pair of chopsticks

541
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,880
- Okay, thank you
- Here you go

542
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,520
Okay, come on

543
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,600
The first thing I can see is
that the noodles look good

544
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
Hand-pulled noodles

545
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
Now that I bite it, it's chewy

546
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,440
Do you think he listened to what we said?

547
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,120
Hey, did I lay it on a bit thick?

548
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,000
I think you made some good points, though

549
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,120
Really, they make sense

550
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,920
I wonder if Lin Rui will
explain everything to Sai Wen

551
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,480
Do you think he will?

552
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Hey

553
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Hey!

554
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm talking to you!

555
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,320
Why does it seem that
I'm more worried than you are?

556
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,200
What are you thinking?

557
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,680
I was thinking that whenever it rains

558
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,280
I can always hold an umbrella for you

559
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,200
And?

560
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Hello

561
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,000
Omu Customer Service. How can I help you?

562
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,640
Okay

563
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,360
Oh, you want to change your address?

564
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,800
You just need to contact...

565
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,480
Which platform did you
complete your purchase?

566
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,820
Hello, Omu Customer Service
How can I help you?

567
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,600
Hello, Omu Customer Service
This is number 116 speaking

568
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,120
May I know your name?

569
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,200
Mr. Guo, right?

570
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,840
How can I help you?

571
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,440
(Part-time opportunity)

572
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,280
(Part-time click farming
Earn money while you do a facial)

573
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,320
Hello, I hear you

574
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,840
Yes, I've been listening

575
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,600
Let's try

576
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,440
Sai Wen

577
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,240
There's something I need
to tell you about Mr. Jian's case

578
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,000
Lin Rui still has his phone recording

579
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,880
He has also submitted
the edited voice recording

580
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,360
So, he has admitted that it was
Lu Yi Ning who manipulated him

581
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,280
to coerce Miao Miao into framing you

582
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,320
So, has my innocence been proven?

583
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
I have always believed in you

584
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,280
But, from a professional standpoint

585
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,120
I couldn't speak up for you

586
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
I understand

587
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Thank you

588
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
I've also reported this to Old President Han

589
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,280
He has decided that

590
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,240
we will mete out
punishments according to our system

591
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,440
Oh, right, there's something else

592
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,520
We might announce this later

593
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,560
Mr. Jiang has officially resigned

594
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,360
Once he hands over his duties

595
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
he will leave Yann Coffee

596
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,080
Is it because of Lu Yi Ning?

597
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,160
He has already divorced Han Yi Ting

598
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,520
Old President Han didn't trust him either

599
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,240
Now that this has happened

600
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,240
there's no way he'd let him stay here

601
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,160
It looks like a resignation

602
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,960
but he's actually just forced to leave

603
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,260
Mr. Jiang isn't that incapable, actually

604
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,720
Hey, how was it?

605
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,120
What did Sai Wen tell you?

606
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,679
Lin Rui approached Sai Wen
and told her everything

607
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,520
The company will issue
a statement later to clarify the truth

608
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,280
This is great!

609
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,800
I need to prepare a special brew

610
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,120
and celebrate this event!

611
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Ou Yang, thank you

612
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,679
Serving the people!

613
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,639
What about Miao Miao?

614
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,659
Miao Miao...

615
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,239
She will be asked to resign

616
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,080
This is the best outcome I could get for her

617
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,480
That's good enough, thank you

618
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,239
I know that this request
is a bit too much for you

619
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,239
But, I've known Miao Miao for so many years

620
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,719
I know her. She's not that kind of person

621
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,199
She just...

622
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,639
Made a bad decision

623
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,000
She apologized to me just now

624
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,880
I think it's enough of a lesson for her

625
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,480
- Then...
- Lu Yi Ning...

626
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,360
President Han should
have other arrangements for her

627
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,880
After all, she's been here for so many years

628
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,200
and she's just given birth

629
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,040
As for Lin Rui...

630
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
It's a pity

631
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,600
What's wrong?

632
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,960
Your problem is solved

633
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,040
Why does it seem that
Ou Yang and I are happier than you are?

634
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,400
Don't you think that this is meaningless?

635
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,840
What are you referring?

636
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,480
Be it me, Lu Yi Ning or even Jiang Hao

637
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,920
what's the point of this power struggle?

638
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,360
You've never gone through
this in Wake Coffee?

639
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,600
Competition happens everywhere

640
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,880
But, this is my first time
seeing such a blatant frame-up

641
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,640
I've been thinking for the past few days

642
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,760
Look what people can do just for a job

643
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,880
If it weren't because I refused to be wronged

644
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I'd rather let her take it

645
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,560
You're thinking like this
because you've been tired, right?

646
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I guess so

647
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,440
I just don't want to waste
my time in their conflict

648
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,440
I want to do something I like

649
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,160
What do you like, then?

650
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,440
What I like

651
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,960
is right in front of me

652
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,960
You know the blinds are open, right?

653
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,040
You said you're not afraid
of being seen, didn't you?

654
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,160
That's because you were in trouble back then

655
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,120
I'm not the kind of guy who only
shares his woes and not his happiness

656
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
I already told Sai Wen about our relationship

657
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,480
The marketing department will know
about it before work ends today

658
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Really?

659
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,120
Scared now?

660
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,080
You're joking. Me, scared?

661
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,640
My boyfriend is the boss of
the marketing department, right?

662
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,320
From now on, if anyone sees me...

663
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,800
They're looking

664
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
So be it

665
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,080
They're really looking. Stay away

666
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,160
They're really looking

667
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,440
- They're looking
- I'll pull the blinds down

668
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,720
Ah

669
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,200
Shen Zi Chang, are you
allowed to lie down here?

670
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,680
Who cares about that?

671
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,440
I think this bed is a little uncomfortable

672
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,360
It is uncomfortable

673
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,760
We'll buy a softer mattress

674
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,440
The best

675
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,840
There's a better mattress?

676
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,680
Then, I'll call it

677
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,280
- The Knockout Bed!
- The Knockout Bed?

678
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,160
Okay, time to get knocked out

679
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,320
Hey, Shen Zi Chang!

680
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,440
I'll show you the other room

681
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,960
Oh

682
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,600
This room is nice too

683
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,280
You can put your handbags here

684
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,000
Let me plan this

685
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
I'll put my stuff here

686
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,600
and you can put your tattered shoes here

687
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,760
My friend's boyfriend has
an entire wall of sport shoes

688
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,160
and the lights are voice-controlled

689
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,920
Like this, clap, and the lights are on

690
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,240
Hey, my inspiration is here again

691
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,640
Here's my plan

692
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,900
In my future home, I want...

693
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't want this. No TV too
I want a large projector screen

694
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,600
I'll invite Qiao Xi Chen and Nan Jia
over for barbecue, games and drinks!

695
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Wow, the view down here is amazing!

696
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,240
I feel like this isn't Beijing

697
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,640
What does this look like, then?

698
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,360
Like Maldives

699
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,600
I've never been there, though

700
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,360
(Built-up area: 7618 m²
21,800 yuan per m²)

701
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,720
But, baby

702
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,240
We might not be able
to afford a nice house like this

703
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,920
Let me show you something

704
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Look

705
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,600
What's this?

706
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,800
It's the money I got from my part-time job

707
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,500
Do you know click farming?

708
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,200
It's when I place an order online

709
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,920
then I get refunded

710
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,880
and I get a commission from it

711
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,600
You know what's best about this?

712
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,340
I just need a phone to do this

713
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,060
That means I can
earn money anytime, anywhere

714
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,400
Then, we can buy a house sooner

715
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,280
and bring our parents to
our huge abode in Beijing!

716
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,200
Hmm?

717
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,160
Okay, baby

718
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,440
I'll work hard on my part-time job too

719
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,660
Just focus on your job

720
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,920
By then, we'll invite our
friends and family over

721
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
to make them cook for us

722
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,640
Cook for us?

723
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Okay

724
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Come in

725
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,560
I know it's quite shameless
of me to say this now

726
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,080
But, I still want to try my luck

727
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,960
Can you give me another chance?

728
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,640
Sai Wen said she will let you
have the final say on my case

729
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,640
Why must you stay at Yann Coffee?

730
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,880
Judging from your resume

731
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,200
it shouldn't be hard to find a similar job

732
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,800
If you're worried that I might
badmouth you in this industry

733
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,760
- I can promise...
- That's not it

734
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
I want to prove to you

735
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,080
that I, Lin Rui, am not
the type of person you described

736
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,280
My capabilities are more than what you saw

737
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,040
I know what I did is overboard

738
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,200
So, if you insist on firing me

739
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,240
I can fully accept it

740
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,440
But, if you can give me another chance

741
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,960
I can start from scratch and work earnestly

742
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,840
Most importantly

743
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,560
I don't want Qiao Xi Chen
to feel that she wasted her youth

744
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
That's all

745
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,360
This year is unusual

746
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,480
We might have to cancel all our
offline new year activities

747
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,700
Other than working with
traditional e-commerce websites

748
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,700
I want something different too

749
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,480
Are you up to it?

750
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
No problem

751
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,160
I'll email you the details

752
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,200
One week from now
I want to read your proposal

753
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
I've given you a chance

754
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,920
It's up to you to seize it

755
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,440
(Insufficient balance. Please top up)

756
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,460
- Hello?
- Hey, Qiao Xi Chen

757
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,880
Do you have 5,000 yuan?

758
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,680
Please lend me the money
I'll return it tomorrow

759
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,980
I saved my money in fixed deposit

760
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,120
I'd lose the interest if I take it out now
Lend me money, please

761
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,440
Wait, why do you need 5,000 yuan?

762
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,520
I can't explain everything now

763
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,400
Do you have it? If not, I'll ask Nan Jia now

764
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,880
Calm down

765
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,640
I didn't say I won't lend you

766
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,720
Let me check my card balance

767
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,600
Hurry up. I'm waiting

768
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I really need the money now

769
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,440
Okay, calm down

770
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,720
Okay, bye

771
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,680
What is she doing?

772
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,960
(Insufficient balance
in account for transfer)

773
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,720
(Hi, I'm the click farming administrator)

774
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,280
(Place your order now, or I'll have to
pass this chance to someone else)

775
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,360
(Have you checked? Enough money?)

776
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,120
(Have you checked? Enough money?)

777
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,900
Hey, Qiao

778
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,840
Hey, Nan Jia, did Xu Yan
ask you to lend her money?

779
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,980
No

780
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,600
Xu Yan is asking me to lend her 5,000 yuan

781
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,880
She sounded urgent
but she wouldn't tell me why

782
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,960
She just borrowed 1,000 yuan
from me the other day

783
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,420
and I thought...

784
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
She returned it soon after

785
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,120
and she said it was for dinner
so I didn't think much about it

786
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,520
Why do you think she needs the money?

787
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,780
Don't lend her yet
It's not that I don't trust her to return it

788
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,920
This looks fishy to me

789
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,280
Are you free now?

790
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,040
Let's visit her

791
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,160
Oh

792
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,740
Why did I put my money in fixed deposit?

793
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,600
Just for that measly interest?

794
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,320
This isn't worth it at all
- How long have you been working on this gig?

795
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,240
Not that long, just a week

796
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,960
It's because I'm just starting

797
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,400
Otherwise, you know what?

798
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,880
If I take one order per day

799
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,360
I get 500 yuan per order

800
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,400
How much can I earn in a month?

801
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,840
10,500 yuan! More than my salary!

802
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,120
Wait

803
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,520
Xu Yan, I think I got it

804
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,720
Don't count your chickens yet

805
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,720
This is a scam

806
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,000
If money comes so easily

807
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,280
I don't have to work anymore
I'd just join this gig with you

808
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,920
Yeah, see? You're losing out
because you don't believe it

809
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,440
I believe it, so I'm earning

810
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,340
Can you come to your senses?

811
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,880
I know what I'm doing!

812
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,520
Nan Jia

813
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,320
Do you have spare cash around?

814
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,280
Can you lend me 10,000 yuan?

815
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,800
I swear, I'll pay you back in a month

816
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,920
No, in two weeks

817
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,360
Xu Yan, listen

818
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,180
It's not about whether you can repay me

819
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,520
If it's really urgent, I can
lend you as much as you need

820
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,920
But, Qiao and I think that this is a scam

821
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,120
Think twice

822
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,080
Why won't you girls believe me?

823
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,240
Is it because you're too old
to not know about this?

824
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,640
- I'll skin you alive
- I earned money!

825
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,440
Okay, stop stomping, will you?

826
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,980
Why would Nan Jia and I ever harm you?

827
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,000
Why would we stop you from earning money?

828
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,460
We feel that something is wrong here

829
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:29,440
When you lose all your money over this
you won't even have a roof above you to cry

830
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,880
I know you're stressed over buying a house

831
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
I can lend you the money to buy a house

832
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,360
- I don't want it
- But, don't do this gig, will you?

833
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,440
No, this is a totally different thing

834
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,400
I just want to rely on myself

835
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,320
and earn money to buy my own house!

836
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,440
Forget it, you won't understand

837
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,280
- Where are you going?
- Poop

838
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,720
What kind of game is this?
She's not a kid anymore

839
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,400
- What should we do?
- Keep an eye on her

840
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,000
Keep a close eye on her

841
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,880
She's really gone bonkers now

842
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,040
Hi, baby

843
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,160
What's wrong? Having trouble at work?

844
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,640
So, how much money do you have in your card?

845
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,400
I'm not hiding any money

846
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,160
Other than my basic expenses
I've given you all my money

847
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,720
I'm not saying that you're hiding money

848
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,400
I mean, well...

849
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh, you want to buy bags and accessories?

850
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
- Or is it...
- I'm not that silly

851
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,120
Me, buy a bag?
We can't even afford a toilet now

852
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,640
Then, why do you need money?

853
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,240
I've been doing this click farming job

854
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,160
Most of the orders only pay a little

855
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,720
like a few dozen yuan

856
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,600
I saw an order worth 750 yuan today

857
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,600
I wanted to take it

858
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,480
but I couldn't fork out so much money

859
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,480
So, I couldn't earn it

860
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,520
Xu Yan

861
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,760
I think we need to talk
about your click farming job

862
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,320
Let's talk

863
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,960
Look, I know our main goal now

864
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,040
is to save up quickly
buy a house and get married

865
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,400
But, recently, I realized
that I'm getting burnt out

866
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,280
I can afford to eat less

867
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,880
or buy less bags or accessories for you

868
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,280
But, I'm not even allowed to buy
something as basic as a can of cola now

869
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,280
I'm not buying milk tea anymore too

870
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,520
You're suffering, and so am I

871
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,440
I know, but I don't want to suffer

872
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,120
I don't want you to suffer too

873
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,560
Besides, I think there's no need
for us to suffer like this

874
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,400
Shen Zi Chang, what do you mean by that?

875
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,880
What do you not want, buy a house
or marry me?

876
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,400
Of course I'll marry you

877
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,000
But, who said we can't
get married without a house?

878
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,540
We agreed to buy a house first
before getting married

879
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,380
What's wrong with you?

880
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,640
Renting a house is good too

881
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,960
Many married couples in Beijing
live in rented houses too

882
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,360
Why can't we?

883
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,560
Besides, I'm not saying that
we're not buying a house anymore

884
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,320
I just don't want to rack
my brains over a stupid house

885
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,040
for the next five or ten years!

886
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,280
I get what you mean

887
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,060
You just don't want
to work hard for our future!

888
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,880
That's the future. This is the present

889
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,680
I want to be happy now too

890
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,400
Just let everything
come naturally in the future

891
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,340
Shen Zi Chang!

892
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,240
Why did I get a
good-for-nothing boyfriend like you?

893
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,640
How am I good-for-nothing?

894
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,600
I just want to enjoy a happy life
What's wrong with that?

895
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,480
I just want to be happy. Am I wrong?

896
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,680
Am I only good if I have
a big house and a fancy car?

897
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,320
That's not how my mother
taught me since I was a kid

898
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,760
I didn't say I want
a big house or a fancy car

899
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,400
I just want a home with you

900
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,600
I just want a place for us

901
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,200
even if it's only 20 m²!

902
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,760
Hush now

903
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,480
You promised not to get mad anymore

904
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,960
You started this

905
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,920
It's my fault, my bad

906
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,880
But, baby

907
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,640
Please stop working on this click farming job

908
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,040
When I see the money we saved
from ditching cola and milk tea

909
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,320
gets all thrown into this gig
I don't feel secure

910
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,960
Besides, it wasn't easy to save up so much

911
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,480
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me

912
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,160
- I'm downstairs now
- Coming

913
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,520
I'm coming down

914
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,720
Okay, hold on

915
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,040
Okay

916
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,680
Yo, switching to a new style today?

917
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,160
What, can't I?

918
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,600
You can. You can wear any style you like

919
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,200
So, where are we going today?

920
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,600
Come on, follow the leader

921
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Okay

922
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,880
Here, find your memories from 18 years old

923
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Wait

924
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,200
Oh, my

925
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,680
Let's stop here. We don't have to do this

926
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,280
We have to. It's your memory

927
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,320
- Seriously?
- Go in

928
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,120
I haven't topped up my bike's petrol

929
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,320
I haven't donated blood since I was 18!
I faint when I see blood!

930
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,240
(Withdrawable balance: 0 yuan)

931
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,560
(Why is my balance zero?)

932
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,820
(You have been blocked by this user)

933
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,200
When I saw Miao Miao's table empty today

934
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,240
I felt quite upset

935
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,920
She's just asked to resign

936
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,960
It won't affect her future job-hunting

937
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,880
I know. I'm not worried about that

938
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,040
I just feel that

939
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
I've known her for so long

940
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,800
If I don't feel bad at all

941
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,920
that would be so heartless of me, right?

942
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,360
- Hello
- Are you Xu Yan?

943
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,440
Yes, I am

944
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,520
Did you join a click farming group lately
and performed several jobs?

945
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,080
Yes

946
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,680
Who are you?

947
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,240
I'm the police

948
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,860
We just busted a scam syndicate that
operates under the guise of click farming

949
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,600
Have you been scammed?

950
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,860
I don't know if I've been scammed

951
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,020
but I transferred 20,000 yuan to him

952
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,740
and he blocked me

953
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,840
- I don't know what to do now
- Do you know that click farming is illegal?

954
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,120
Illegal? I didn't know that's illegal

955
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,880
So, when can I get my money back?

956
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,880
- You've caught them, right?
- It's not a huge problem

957
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,280
You linked a bank card to their app, right?

958
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,240
Yes, I did

959
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,840
Give me the card number and password

960
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,880
I need to calculate
the total amount you got scammed

961
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,960
I know how much I got scammed

962
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,200
It's 23,100 yuan

963
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,120
Not including the rebates

964
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,280
I can't just take your word for it

965
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,840
I need proof

966
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,280
Forget it if you won't tell me

967
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,600
I'll just ignore your case

968
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,560
No, I'll tell you the card number now

969
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,120
I'll give you the card number

970
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Miao

971
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,080
Don't come here

972
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,360
The password is 714600

973
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,720
Call me as soon as you get the records
I'm always available for calling

974
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,200
- Wait for our news, then
- Okay, thanks

975
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,040
Hey, baby, what are you doing?

976
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,480
I'm not doing anything. I'm waiting for you

977
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,520
It's so cold down here. Come on up

978
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,600
- Let's go
- Let's go

979
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,400
Hey, my mother made noodles
with soy bean paste today

980
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,120
What are you doing?

981
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,000
I got my retribution

982
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,960
What are you saying?

983
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,560
My boyfriend doesn't want me anymore

984
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,200
Miao Miao, come down and talk, okay?

985
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,600
Don't come here

986
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,800
- Can I open my eyes now?
- Yes

987
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,480
My mother cooked these pork ribs for us

988
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,280
- Try it
- She saw how hard we've been working

989
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,240
Eat more

990
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,420
Is this the surprise you mentioned?

991
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,420
You told me about this before

992
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,760
So, I learned and tried making it

993
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Try it

994
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,920
Okay

995
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,480
Hey, Xu Yan

996
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,200
Don't use your phone while eating

997
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,440
Stop meddling with your phone

998
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,160
What's wrong?

999
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,160
What's wrong?

1000
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,880
What happened?

1001
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,000
Isn't this our bank account?

1002
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,720
- Where's the money?
- What money?

1003
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,440
I have nothing left

1004
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,840
I lost my job, I lost my boyfriend

1005
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,840
I can't live in this city anymore, seriously!

1006
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,600
Wait...

1007
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,940
He's breaking up with me

1008
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,040
He couldn't continue
this long-distance relationship

1009
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,160
He's in love with someone else

1010
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,640
I just wanted to earn more money

1011
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,640
so I could marry him soon

1012
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,440
and end this long-distance relationship!

1013
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,120
I know, Miao Miao, I know

1014
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,120
I know what kind of person you are

1015
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,600
That wasn't what you wanted to do

1016
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,760
Wait

1017
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,040
I...

1018
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,000
I have something to tell you

1019
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,560
Xu Yan, are you still
doing that click farming gig?

1020
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,800
Where's the money?

1021
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,080
What money?

1022
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,760
Xu Yan, explain

1023
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,880
I know that you're a kind person

1024
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,800
You just made a bad choice

1025
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,440
It's okay, this is over now

1026
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,800
We can start again, right?

1027
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,120
How can I start again?

1028
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,960
Qiao Xi Chen, tell me

1029
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,600
I have nothing left now

1030
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,440
I have nothing left!

1031
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,600
I don't know why!

1032
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It's gone

1033
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,460
Where did the money go?

1034
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,240
I got scammed

1035
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,160
Wait, let me get this straight

1036
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,600
You want a child

1037
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,920
but you don't want the father?

1038
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,960
What have you been
trying to do this whole day?

1039
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,600
To trick me into bed?

1040
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,360
I wasn't acting during the day

1041
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,640
I was just blinded. At that moment...

1042
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,880
What happened at that moment? You regretted?

1043
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,800
What the heck are you doing, Ji Nan Jia?

1044
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,800
Xu Yan, you promised me that you'd stop

1045
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,680
You were lying, right?

1046
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,160
I told you about my situation, right?

1047
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,600
I wanted to try my luck

1048
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,640
Have you asked me if I wanted
to join you and try your luck?

1049
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,280
I didn't lie to you, I didn't...

1050
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:31,280
My money's in there, and I was worried

1051
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,960
I didn't know that they're really scammers

1052
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,560
Forget it
Let's just call it quits between us

1053
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,800
Call it quits?

1054
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,840
Is that something you can
decide on your own, Ji Nan Jia?

1055
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,920
Is there something wrong with your brain?

1056
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,520
You really think that you're a little angel?

1057
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,700
You can blame everything on me?

1058
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,800
Actually, you're the stupidest fool!

1059
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,160
Shen Zi Chang, why are you talking like this?

1060
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,040
That's not what I meant

1061
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,240
I was wrong, but...

1062
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,120
I did that for both of us

1063
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,120
I want to earn more money, so we
can buy a house and get married

1064
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,480
If only you'd work harder

1065
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,840
and earn a few hundred yuan
would I be in this state now?

1066
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,040
You are the most selfish

1067
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,000
arrogant and clueless person I've ever met

1068
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,080
Listen, this is how I've always been

1069
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,840
I've only been a student before this

1070
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,040
I didn't have to worry about anything

1071
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,420
But, are we the same now?

1072
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,420
Can we still mooch off our parents now?

1073
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,060
How will we live after this? How?

1074
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,280
I'm asking now, right?

1075
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,200
You're only asking now? And before this?

1076
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,920
No house, no life? I don't buy this!

1077
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,260
- No...
- Ji Nan Jia, listen

1078
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,400
I'm making this clear today!

1079
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,760
From now on...

1080
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,200
I'm not buying a house anymore

1081
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,920
We're not getting married anymore!

1082
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,600
We don't know each other anymore

1083
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,040
Xu Yan!

1084
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Xu Yan!

1085
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,080
To live is to solve problems

1086
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,640
You know what?

1087
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,360
If you jump down from here today

1088
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,520
your boyfriend wouldn't be sad

1089
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,440
Lu Yi Ning wouldn't be sad too

1090
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,400
No one in Yann Coffee would be sad

1091
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,400
You know who'd be sad because of you?

1092
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,240
Your parents would be sad over you

1093
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,560
Those who love you would be sad

1094
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,960
Your friends would be sad

1095
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,960
Those who love you would be just like me

1096
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,480
They'd live in regret forever
blaming themselves

1097
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,120
They'd keep asking themselves, why?

1098
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,640
Why didn't I hold her back?

1099
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,820
Qiao

1100
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,000
I'm sorry

1101
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,480
You scared me

1102
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,760
Nan Jia, I'm hungry

1103
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,800
- When will it be ready?
- Almost

1104
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,360
Now...

1105
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,640
When I close my eyes

1106
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,080
I see how Miao Miao stood on the rooftop

1107
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,240
I keep relating this to Jing Jing

1108
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,360
It's heart-wrenching

1109
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,680
Upsetting

1110
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm in a troubled mess now too

1111
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,920
What happened?

1112
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,840
We fought

1113
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,760
He stormed off

1114
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,280
It's a long story

1115
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,600
I'll talk about it some other time

1116
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,920
Xu Yan

1117
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,360
Are you hungry?

1118
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,000
Baby Yan, how many dumplings do you want?

1119
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,880
Hey, baby

1120
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,000
I'll throw you an apple

1121
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,000
Bump it with your head, will you?

1122
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,400
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

1123
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,720
Why aren't you saying anything?

1124
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,320
Did you fight with Shen Zi Chang again?

1125
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:25,520
Shen Zi Chang said that
he's not buying a house anymore

1126
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,600
He's not marrying me too

1127
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,000
Huh? Why?

1128
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,800
What happened?

1129
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,000
What is this nonsense?

1130
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,280
- Drink some water. What's wrong?
- What happened?

1131
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,080
I...

1132
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,360
I've been scammed

1133
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
How much?

1134
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,760
In total, around 80,000 yuan

1135
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,160
I'll transfer it to you

1136
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,960
I don't want it

1137
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,200
What do you want, then? Just take it

1138
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,600
- Get Shen Zi Chang to calm down first
- I don't want it

1139
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,800
I told you it's a scam, see?

1140
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,680
What's your account number?

1141
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,320
I don't want it, really

1142
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
I have her account number

1143
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,400
Say, who hasn't been tricked before?

1144
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,360
Yan

1145
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,240
It's just 80,000 yuan

1146
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,840
You've always been a smart girl

1147
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,400
Why did you lose your mind over this?

1148
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,560
This one, right?

1149
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,360
How annoying. I'll forward it to you now

1150
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Done

1151
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay, the money's transferred

1152
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,380
Say, you've always
been enjoying the good life

1153
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,920
Why are you trying
to skimp on everything now?

1154
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,880
What's wrong?

1155
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,440
Say something

1156
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,120
Xu Yan, if you feel upset

1157
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,760
don't keep it all in, okay?

1158
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,680
Tell me, or you'd end up like Jing Jing

1159
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
Don't touch me, Qiao Xi Chen

1160
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,640
- Don't touch me
- What's wrong with you?

1161
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,160
- Don't get depressed now
- Don't touch me!

1162
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,300
- What's with you?
- Qiao Xi Chen

1163
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,280
You...

1164
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,960
Don't mention Jing Jing anymore

1165
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,600
How can you be so full of yourself?

1166
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,120
What gave you the right to decide for me?

1167
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,180
Is my money any of your business?

1168
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,800
Couldn't you tell that
Jing Jing liked Lin Rui?

1169
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,520
Have you ever
considered Jing Jing's feelings?

1170
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,080
You tell Jing Jing everything

1171
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,680
Whom can Jing Jing confide to, then?

1172
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,480
You know how Jing Jing died?
You drove her to her death

1173
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,760
Xu Yan, what are you talking about?

1174
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,200
What am I talking about?

1175
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,399
Sister Nan Jia

1176
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,240
We call you Sister

1177
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,040
You think you're really a big sister?

1178
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,200
Do you even behave like one?

1179
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:30,080
Jing Jing did so many things for you
when she knew you're sick, and you?

1180
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,899
Did you only know that
she was sick after she died?

1181
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,920
How did she die?

1182
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,359
- Shut up!
- Jing Jing had depression!

1183
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,720
- Why should I shut up?
- Just shut up!

1184
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,479
- I won't!
- Shut up!

1185
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,420
Listen, Xu Yan!

1186
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,080
Don't go overboard

1187
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,399
Are you throwing a tantrum now?

1188
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,560
You think losing your money
is such a big deal?

1189
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,840
What nonsense are you spewing?

1190
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,359
Who drove Jing Jing to her death?

1191
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,960
It's all my fault, isn't it?

1192
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:54,040
You're faultless, aren't you?

1193
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:55,800
I didn't know she liked Lin Rui

1194
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,120
But, you knew, right?

1195
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,680
Did you give me a chance to choose?

1196
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You think you didn't do anything wrong?

1197
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,880
Who do you think you are?
You think you're all high and mighty?

1198
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,240
Here are three words for you

1199
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,640
Serves you right

1200
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:09,700
Serves me right?

1201
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,120
Serves me right for knowing you people
and treating you like my best friends!

1202
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,439
I've wasted so many years on you!

1203
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,779
- Who wants to be your friend, anyway?
- Have you had enough?

1204
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,520
We were four, and now we're three
You want to break us apart?

1205
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,399
Sure, why not?

1206
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,500
I don't want to see you people ever again!

1207
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,120
I didn't expect

1208
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,120
that we've been holding so many grudges

1209
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,840
If we can't stay as friends anymore

1210
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,160
let's just break it off, then

1211
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,000
Don't force ourselves

1212
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,680
All these dumplings have
turned into a soggy mash

1213
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,400
Yeah

1214
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,800
Even a tree hole can become full

1215
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,680
Do you also have a friend like this?

1216
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,320
Hu Jing Jing!

1217
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,320
She's the first person you want
to share your joys and woes

1218
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,240
Whenever you need help

1219
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,720
you'd think about her right away

1220
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,920
You can also confide all your secrets to her

1221
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,520
You feel lucky

1222
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,480
that you have a good friend like her

1223
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,960
Wow, so cute!

1224
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,280
It's not for you, though

1225
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,640
It's for me and Lin Rui

1226
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,080
But, you forget that she has
her own joys and sorrows too

1227
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,160
She also needs help too

1228
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,400
She also has her own secrets

1229
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,200
If you have a friend like that

1230
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,120
please remember that
before she became your tree hole

1231
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,720
she is your friend
