00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,520
(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,960
Go left, go right, go forward

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,479
Red light, yellow light, green light

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
Staying and leaving

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,440
Together and apart

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
I want to thank those

7
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,479
who made me understand
what it means to love and be loved

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,320
Yo, Sai Wen

9
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,880
I've seen the recruitment notice

10
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,440
Actually, my standards for
an assistant aren't that high

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,680
You can loosen up a little on
having five years of relevant experience

12
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,160
(Episode 1: Birthday)

13
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,360
Hello, welcome to Metro Line No. 15

14
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,480
Disembarking passengers are
kindly advised to get ready

15
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
Please sit steadily and hold tight

16
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,760
Excuse me

17
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm not going down! This isn't my stop!

18
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,120
Girl, thank you so much

19
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,880
(We're going to celebrate
Jing Jing's birthday tomorrow)

20
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Baby Jing Jing, happy birthday!

21
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,720
Jing Jing, happy birthday!

22
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,920
Ha ha ha, I've received
your messages, thank you!

23
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,780
Don't work overtime tonight
Don't be late for your birthday party

24
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,180
The tourism industry is waning
There's no way she can work overtime

25
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,960
Touchwood, the industry is picking up now

26
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,040
Right now, I'm meeting a client

27
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm going to strike a deal today!

28
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
Go ahead, then

29
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,680
Why are you still chatting with us?

30
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,180
I came early

31
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm waiting for the client to come to work

32
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,440
Qiao Qiao, awake yet? Going to work?

33
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
Reached your office yet?

34
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
Yes, yes

35
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
- Morning, Qiang
- Morning

36
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
Morning

37
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,480
Xu Yan, I'm at the office now

38
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm going to work, so remember to wake up

39
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
- Morning, Miao
- Morning

40
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah, yeah, I'm awake

41
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,960
How else did I send you that message?

42
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
Have you had breakfast?

43
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,200
Not yet

44
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,960
Who knows, maybe your
hubby used a voice changer

45
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,440
You said Shen Zi Chang uses
a voice changer when he plays online

46
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,640
Get this clear. He's not my hubby

47
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm still a single, childless girl

48
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,440
Baby Yan, girls don't care
about being single or having kids

49
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,760
Come in

50
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,159
Sister Jia, this is bad

51
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,840
What's wrong?

52
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,960
Tonight is the Beijing alumni gathering
of Zhi Yi Fourth High School

53
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,040
They just requested this morning
that they want to change the wine

54
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,040
Why? Didn't they ask for
ten boxes of wine from 2017?

55
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,920
They said some teachers are coming

56
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,240
so they want something better

57
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
They want wine from 2012
They want everything changed

58
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
Everything?

59
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,400
But we've already paid
the deposit for the 2017 wine

60
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,800
If we're changing now
we might not find the wine

61
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
Even if we do find it, it'd cost
more than 200,000 yuan

62
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
We've already paid over
100,000 yuan upfront for this event

63
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,240
The finance department said
we only have 100,000 yuan now

64
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,800
Don't open the boxes for the 2017 wine yet

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm contacting someone now

66
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,320
- They want 2012, right?
- Yes

67
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,680
If I find it, don't worry about the money
I'll pay for it first

68
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
- This...
- Go back to work

69
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,520
Hello, Mr. Zhang
I'm Nan Jia from Si Nan Event Planning

70
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,640
I'd like to know if you have wine from 2012

71
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,880
Amy

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,920
- Hey, you're earlier than me
- I came early

73
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,820
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet

74
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,820
- I brought some breakfast for you
- Oh

75
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
You're so thoughtful, thank you

76
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,560
Alert, alert!

77
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,040
- What, is there another fire drill?
- No, look!

78
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,120
You see that guy behind Sai Wen?

79
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,340
- Where?
- There

80
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,600
I heard he's the new director
President Han found to replace Yi Ning

81
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
I didn't see him

82
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,260
Mr. Jiang is going to be in deep trouble now

83
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,700
What are you talking about?

84
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,440
Yi Ning hasn't even taken her maternity leave

85
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,620
What trouble are you talking about?

86
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,780
Look at Yi Ning's tummy

87
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,780
She's going to take maternity leave soon

88
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,600
I heard that Mr. Jiang and
President Han Jr. are getting a divorce

89
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,840
Yi Ning is Mr. Jiang's trusted subordinate

90
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,080
Now that Old President Han
is replacing Yi Ning

91
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,679
our marketing department
is going to enter a storm

92
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,340
Hey

93
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,560
We're sitting right next to each other

94
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,980
You get far more information
than I do from the grapevine

95
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,920
Where did you get it? I'm astonished

96
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,200
That's what you call disparity, got it?

97
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,960
Qiang

98
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
Qiang

99
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,180
I've proofread your inventory list

100
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,280
You've mixed up the entries
for cold brew and Blue Mountain coffees

101
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,440
- Is it?
- I've corrected it. It's in your inbox now

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,920
- Thank you so much
- It's okay

103
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Seriously, I've been befuddled from work

104
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,700
Check again before you send it to Yi Ning

105
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,260
Don't send the previous version

106
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,520
- Thank you
- I've sent it to your inbox

107
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,780
- Qiao Xi Chen
- What?

108
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,120
We're supposed to not hide
anything from each other

109
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,360
Did you pick up any gossip? Tell me

110
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,440
I do know something

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,960
Ten minutes later
we have a meeting for the 818 promotion

112
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,240
- Your period is here?
- Yeah

113
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,720
Don't eat so many painkillers

114
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,920
It's bad for health

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
If I don't, how can I survive
through the meeting?

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,440
When do you think we girls
can get menstruation leave?

117
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,400
Don't think about that
Have you finished your prize list?

118
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,080
The meeting is starting soon. Hurry up

119
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,200
Okay

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,840
Hello? Just give me any boxes you have

121
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,300
Or any bottles you have

122
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,780
I have an emergency here

123
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,940
Can you help me today?
I'll get someone to pick them up

124
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,720
I'm okay with the price

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,780
Reply me if you have the wine, thanks

126
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,860
What is it, Mom?

127
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,420
- Are you busy?
- Yeah, I'm busy

128
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,540
Go back to work, then

129
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,980
I'm going to work till late today

130
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,140
Just speak what's on your mind

131
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,640
Listen, do you remember Aunt Wang
from the organization department?

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,760
Yeah

133
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
No, wait, I don't. Who's that?

134
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,420
Oh, darling

135
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,380
How can you not remember her?

136
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,160
She has a pair of twins

137
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,100
We used to take you and the twins
to the public bath at the office

138
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,860
So what? Get to the point

139
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,580
Mom, I'm busy, hurry up

140
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,420
Here's how it is

141
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,360
Aunt Wang's sister has a son

142
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,580
He's about the same age as you

143
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,940
I think he's a fine fellow

144
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,380
Why did you tell someone else
about my private life again?

145
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,340
I didn't tell him about your private life

146
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Alas, listen, even if I don't tell him

147
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,860
he can check your company online

148
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,060
He's even checking on me now?

149
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,080
I don't know if he's checked on you

150
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,680
Anyway, he's interested in you

151
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,580
Why don't you add his contact?

152
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,180
I'm busy, and you want
me to add him, seriously?

153
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,600
About this...

154
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,180
No, you must seize the moment

155
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,980
Why are you so anxious about this?

156
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,800
How can I not be anxious?

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,120
Your birthday is coming soon

158
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,460
35 and 36 years old
is a huge difference, isn't it?

159
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,580
One is 30-something,
and the other is almost 40

160
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,980
I'm still months away
from 36 years old, okay?

161
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,420
- What's wrong with you? That's it
- Don't hang up!

162
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,620
Listen, Jia Jia

163
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,180
To put it nicely, you're an ordinary lady

164
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,100
But in another sense, you're just plain ugly

165
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,580
Think about it. What advantage do you have?

166
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,640
What, me, ugly?

167
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,440
Whom do you think I got my looks from, Mom?

168
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,140
Bye

169
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,660
You darned child

170
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,140
Jing, how was the discussion?

171
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,200
It was a huge success

172
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,000
I almost got her to seal the deal right there

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,340
Impressive, right?

174
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Come in

175
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,880
Manager Lu

176
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,360
Looking for me?

177
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
I've been looking for you the entire morning

178
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,780
I went to Travel Net this morning

179
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,280
Amy and the rest are very
interested in our Dali project

180
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,620
She said it has potential

181
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,580
- That's why I...
- About that...

182
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,960
Listen to me

183
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,860
As you know, 5G technology has
a profound impact on our industry

184
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,060
The company is planning a strategic
transformation in the next half of the year

185
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,700
I know, our whole team is committed

186
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,680
We've been working really hard

187
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,340
The industry is picking up

188
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,820
Don't worry, we'll do our best

189
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,380
As long as we work hard,
the company is going to get better

190
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,220
We have two proposals for the 818 promotion

191
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,240
First is our classic latte in tins

192
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,400
There are 12 tins in a carton

193
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,060
along with six tins of Americano
and three tins of Macchiato for free

194
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,900
The second proposal is our new product,
instant cold brew

195
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,380
There are ten packets in a box

196
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,260
along with three tins of Americano,
six tins of Macchiato

197
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,820
and a custom celebrity mug for free

198
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,140
Which proposal would you choose?

199
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,940
I'd go for cold brew

200
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,620
The first deal may look like
a good bargain since it has more tins

201
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,700
But, Americanos are cheaper

202
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,260
One tin costs around 6.88 yuan

203
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,540
That makes it a 28% discount

204
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,540
As for the second one
the retail price of cold brew is higher

205
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,440
There's also a free
custom-made celebrity mug

206
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,300
So, that makes a 42% discount

207
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,060
Therefore, the second
proposal is a better deal

208
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,700
Come on, how many of our customers
would bother calculating such costs?

209
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,500
You think our customers are like you
counting every single cent spent?

210
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,220
What kind of proposal is this?

211
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,960
I can't see the promotional advantage at all

212
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,700
Don't forget our goal

213
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,900
It's to sell off our cold brew inventory

214
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,480
Are we having trouble
selling the classic tins?

215
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
Not at all, they're just there as support

216
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,300
Adjust the free gifts

217
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,020
I want a deal that obviously shows

218
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
the advantage of buying the cold brew package

219
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,020
Yi Ning, the production cost
of cold brew is higher now

220
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,140
We're minimizing our profits here

221
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
If we lower it further
it's not going to work out

222
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,020
Also, there's a lot of people
waiting for the 818 promotion

223
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,740
Before you get off work today

224
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,580
send me the new list of
free gifts and cost report

225
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,860
- Today?
- Any problems?

226
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,420
No problem

227
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,780
Let's discuss about the stock now

228
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,900
Yi Ning?

229
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Why don't we take a break now?

230
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,500
It's okay

231
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,640
Miao Miao, it's lunch time now

232
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
Get some pizza for everyone
We'll eat and discuss at the same time

233
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,680
Okay, I'll order now

234
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,580
- Quick!
- Yi Ning!

235
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,860
- Sit down
- Slowly

236
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,180
- Take a deep breath
- Is this early labor?

237
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,460
Don't panic

238
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,120
Get me my phone

239
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,560
- Quick
- Yi Ning

240
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,660
Hubby

241
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,860
I'm about to give birth

242
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,620
I've packed everything

243
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,740
Go home and get my things
Wait for me at the hospital

244
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,120
Nonsense, of course
I know I'm giving birth, go!

245
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Careful

246
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,460
- Yi Ning
- We're almost there

247
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,320
- Yi Ning, please let us accompany you there
- We will go with you

248
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,700
There's nothing you can do to help

249
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,140
- Move!
- Careful!

250
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,580
Careful

251
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,060
The 818 products...

252
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,660
- Settle the products for 818 today!
- Okay!

253
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,500
Open the door

254
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,380
- Send it to me!
- Sure, just go now!

255
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,580
Good luck!

256
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,720
Oh my

257
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,140
Even now, Yi Ning
is still thinking about work

258
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,260
That's why she's the director

259
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
She's really a tough lady

260
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,980
But President Han is tougher

261
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,980
He's replacing Yi Ning
while she's having a baby

262
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,940
Enough, let's get back to work

263
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,339
Let's go

264
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,700
You girls go ahead, I need to take this call

265
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,980
Okay

266
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,500
Hello?

267
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,700
Yes, that hotpot restaurant

268
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,260
We're booking a private room?

269
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,100
Okay, I'll confirm and send you the details

270
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,060
Aloha

271
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,380
Woke up yet?

272
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,280
I told you, I woke up a long time ago

273
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,900
Why did you wake up early for a noon shift?

274
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm going to World Trade Center today

275
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,620
to buy a present for Jing Jing

276
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,100
Xu Yan, you're crazy
Did you strike the lottery?

277
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,980
How much would it cost
to buy something there?

278
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,000
You barely paid your credit card debt
with your salary last month

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,580
If Jing Jing knows about this
she's not going to take your present

280
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,500
Jing Jing already knows about this

281
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,340
I've sent her the screenshot
from the official site

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm going to surprise her tonight
and render her speechless!

283
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,460
Hey, you've sent her the screenshot

284
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,060
You think you can surprise her?

285
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,720
She'd probably just act along, got it?

286
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,500
Xu Yan, ask Shen Zi Chang to
bring you to the hospital someday

287
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,300
to get your brain checked

288
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,380
Curse you, nonsense

289
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,420
Send me the private room number

290
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,780
I'll have the cake sent there

291
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,420
Ask Nan Jia. She booked that restaurant
to accommodate you, Miss Workaholic

292
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,620
She specially picked it since
it's right below your apartment

293
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,580
Otherwise, we were
planning to have French food

294
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,460
Nan Jia is always
inviting us to mooch off her

295
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,040
Jing Jing must have felt that
Nan Jia has been spending too much

296
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,460
so she chose that hotpot restaurant

297
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,660
Look how thoughtful Jing Jing is, unlike you

298
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,300
Yeah, she's thoughtful, and I'm not?

299
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,540
Wait for it, Qiao Xi Chen
I'm going to beat you at drinking tonight

300
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,080
- Are they here?
- They are here

301
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,620
My car is parked at B2
Three boxes of wine in the trunk

302
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,460
Get a pump truck to bring them
to the multi-functional hall

303
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,620
Okay

304
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,740
- It's Mr. Zhang and Mr. what?
- Mr. Wang

305
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,580
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Wang

306
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,100
- Oh, you're here
- Thanks for waiting

307
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,240
Sorry, I could only get
three boxes of wine from 2012

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,940
- Three boxes?
- Still, there are ten tables, right?

309
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,220
I'd suggest changing the layout tonight

310
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
I heard there are four teachers coming

311
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Let them sit at the main table

312
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,580
There are 18 bottles of wine
in the three boxes

313
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,580
Serve one bottle at each table
and there would be eight left

314
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,180
Give them to the teachers
I've pasted stickers on them

315
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,660
They will be placed inside gift bags

316
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,820
We've included a card that says,
"Sincerely from Zhi Yi students"

317
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,820
They can take them as commemoration
What do you think?

318
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,980
We don't really mind

319
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,620
We must serve the best to our teachers

320
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
Of course

321
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,320
Now that we're reseating everyone,
this is going to look discriminating

322
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,100
Listen, in such gatherings

323
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,740
we don't want to slot
everyone into categories

324
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,220
Yes, I understand, you're right

325
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
I remember when we were
preparing the invitations

326
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,100
two are medical workers
who have served in Wuhan

327
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,940
I suggest we seat them with the teachers

328
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,180
I'm sure the others won't mind

329
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,220
The previous wine will be served as planned

330
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,820
Each table gets seven bottles
and if there are 16 people

331
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,120
from our experience, it's enough for
everyone to enjoy without getting drunk

332
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,500
Everyone can still catch up

333
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,120
Fine, we'll do as you say

334
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,340
Thank you for understanding

335
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,640
I just set up the multi-functional hall
beside here for you

336
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,000
You can go there and take a break
Enjoy some tea while waiting for everyone

337
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,220
- It's free
- Let's go

338
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,700
Thank you for understanding

339
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,100
Okay

340
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,260
- Are the gift boxes here?
- Yes

341
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,740
Miss

342
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,860
This is the latest model we have

343
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,900
It's not sold in other stores
It really suits you

344
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,140
It's not for me. It's for someone

345
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,180
Miss, your payment wasn't successful

346
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,860
Why don't you use another card?

347
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,120
You can pay 6,000 yuan with my card

348
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,120
then 2,600 yuan from my Alipay

349
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,740
We did as you requested
but it wasn't successful

350
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,540
Why don't you use another card?

351
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,680
Hold on, let me ask someone

352
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,300
Sorry

353
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Hey, Shen Zi Chang

354
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,640
What's wrong with you?

355
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,300
Isn't there 3,000 yuan
in our joint Alipay account?

356
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
I tried to pay 2,600 yuan
and it was unsuccessful

357
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,900
Oh, I noticed that you never used it

358
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
I thought you're not using it anymore

359
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,780
So, I bought a pair of sport shoes

360
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,460
Shen Zi Chang, nice job

361
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,740
Hello, so...

362
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,000
I guess I'm not buying this today

363
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,740
Thank you

364
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,940
Miss

365
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,140
Why don't you check this out?

366
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,280
It's from the same series as that one

367
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,980
It's smaller, and it's cheaper
by around 2,000 yuan

368
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,660
Actually, I think girls don't have
so many things to carry

369
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,080
This size is just perfect

370
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,020
Try it

371
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,460
This is a waist bag, isn't it?

372
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,620
You like it?

373
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,140
Get me! I'm No. 1 at school!

374
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,480
I'm the best in school at kicking the ball!

375
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,040
You've been working here for over four years

376
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,760
Your performance has always been well, but...

377
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
Manager Lu, I think...

378
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,720
There must be an explanation
or reason if I'm getting fired

379
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
On what basis am I getting sacked?

380
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,080
The basis is your work performance, of course

381
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,480
Think about it

382
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,380
Among your team mates, you're the one
who works overtime the least, right?

383
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,580
That's because I finished my work on time

384
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,680
After you finished your work
you could have helped the others

385
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,900
You youngsters can't be selfish

386
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,200
When I was your age

387
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,120
we did everything the old-timers did

388
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,080
including cleaning work

389
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Manager Lu, I don't understand

390
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,590
I'm getting sacked because

391
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,360
I didn't help them complete
the work they're supposed to do?

392
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,200
Then, why don't you sack those
who didn't complete their work?

393
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,520
Based on your logic,
I even need to help the cleaning janitor, do I?

394
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm just giving an example

395
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,040
I can explain it clearer

396
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,560
Either you have the network

397
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,400
or it depends on your overtime performance

398
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,860
You need to think comprehensively

399
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,400
Actually, I'm letting you go
for your own good

400
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,200
Who knows, you can unleash
your potential in other companies?

401
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,080
Fine

402
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,240
Manager Lu, I get what you mean

403
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,040
Let's discuss about compensation, then

404
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,560
Listen

405
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
Maybe I didn't make it clear just now

406
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
I hope you can resign

407
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,440
Don't worry, I can write you
a recommendation letter

408
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,200
You want me to resign?

409
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,640
I think this is too much!

410
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,760
You're even trying to skimp
on compensation now?

411
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,040
What if I don't resign?

412
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,680
We have an elimination system in place

413
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,280
We can sack those who do not
meet their target for half a year

414
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,360
That would leave a blemish on your record

415
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,880
Don't even expect
a recommendation letter by then

416
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,280
Aunt!

417
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,160
Call me Sister

418
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,560
Our ball is stuck on the tree

419
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,160
Can you get it down?

420
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,600
Sure, what should you call me?

421
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,680
Sister, thank you

422
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,680
Okay, let me check

423
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,860
Let me see

424
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,780
How should I get it down?

425
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,080
I'll use my blazer, then

426
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,720
Step aside. Look closely

427
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
Yeah!

428
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,100
- Thank you, Sister!
- You're welcome

429
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,360
Aunt, what about your blazer?

430
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,400
It's Sister!

431
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,840
Sister, what about your blazer?

432
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,900
I'll just leave it there

433
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,560
Run along, it's okay

434
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,300
- You've got your ball, go!
- Time to go home!

435
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,200
- Qi Qi!
- Let's bring it back home!

436
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,800
Jing Jing, I've gotten you a present

437
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,440
It's smaller, but it's really pretty!

438
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,880
Come on, Xu Yan.
How is it a surprise when you've revealed it?

439
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,500
Don't toy with Jing Jing's feelings

440
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,600
You're just jealous. I'm sure Jing Jing
will love my present the most tonight

441
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,720
Are you making light of Nan Jia?

442
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Listen, Nan Jia has never lost
when it comes to presents

443
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,800
Nan Jia, I don't mind celebrating
my birthday earlier today

444
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,400
Today is Friday
The roads are going to be jammed for sure

445
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,960
If you get there early, eat first
Don't wait for me

446
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,480
Just order anything you like

447
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,520
Happy birthday

448
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
Happy birthday

449
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,360
What's going on?

450
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,720
Why isn't there anyone here
when it's just noon?

451
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,400
- Where were you? I couldn't get to you
- Buying lunch

452
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
Go, it's time for a meeting

453
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,260
- What meeting?
- About the new director replacing Yi Ning

454
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,400
So fast? Yi Ning's baby
probably hasn't even come out yet

455
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,200
Hurry up. Don't say anything wrong later

456
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,060
Hello, my colleagues
from the marketing department

457
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm Jian Yi Fan

458
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,960
Starting from today

459
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,740
I will replace Miss Lu Yi Ning
as the director of marketing department

460
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
I hope that in the future
we can work together...

461
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,520
Thanks

462
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,520
Since we have another colleague coming in

463
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,480
let me introduce myself again

464
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm Jian Yi Fan

465
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,200
I'm going to skip the formalities

466
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,320
I only ask for two things from all of you

467
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,680
First, do what you're supposed to do

468
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,780
Second, enjoy

469
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,200
Our industry's nature requires us

470
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,080
to keep observing our customers' preferences

471
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,920
so we can create successful products
and marketing strategies

472
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,300
So, other than work

473
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,600
I welcome you to approach me
for a meal or chat

474
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,320
I play tennis pretty well

475
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,580
Feel free to ask me out for a match

476
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,920
I spoke so much just now because I think

477
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,880
work and rest are equally important

478
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,080
So, unless you have to

479
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,480
I don't want any of you to bring
your meals to your desk or meeting room

480
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,060
If you eat at where you work
no matter how delicious it is

481
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,660
it's not going to taste as nice

482
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,020
Work-life balance is important. Thank you

483
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,800
Everyone

484
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,200
Miss Lu is officially
on maternity leave starting today

485
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,640
but our work in the
marketing department cannot stop

486
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,360
Mr. Jian was just giving
a simple self-introduction

487
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,800
I'm sure you can see that he is
a leader who is easy to get along with

488
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,480
Next, Mr. Jian has
something important to announce

489
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,320
Okay, let me get down to business

490
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,260
Before you leave today

491
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,840
I hope to receive a work report
for the past six months from each of you

492
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,200
I want details of your work scope
in every project you've worked in

493
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,360
and an ROA analysis

494
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,640
Remember, I want details

495
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,040
(Qiao, someone barged into your house)
This will decide whether I can still

496
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,780
see you next month at Yann Coffee

497
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,300
(What's going on? I'm at work)
You heard it right

498
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,680
What I'd like to announce
is that starting from today

499
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,480
the marketing department will have
an elimination system in place

500
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,780
like other departments such as sales

501
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,560
That means on this day next month,

502
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,280
one-third of you will be leaving Yann Coffee

503
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,960
That's all

504
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Now, please introduce yourselves

505
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,360
Who wants to go first?

506
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,880
Let's start from our colleague
who hasn't had lunch, then

507
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,700
How should I call you?

508
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,820
Qiao Xi Chen

509
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,160
How should I call you?

510
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,560
Hello, I'm Qiao Xi Chen, I'm so sorry

511
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,880
I have an emergency
Can I take leave for two hours?

512
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,480
- Hello?
- Hello, Jing Jing

513
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,780
Where are you?

514
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,260
What's wrong?

515
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
My neighbor messaged me and said that

516
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,080
someone barged into my house
and apparently it's the landlord

517
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,300
- I don't know what's going on
- Okay, don't panic

518
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,040
Are you okay? I'm coming

519
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,840
I'm free, don't panic
I'll be there right away

520
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,600
Who are you guys?

521
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,580
Who let you in my house?

522
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,320
Miss

523
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,820
It's great that you're back

524
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,440
Look closely, I'm the owner of this house

525
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
I'm officially ordering you

526
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,940
to move out of my house right away!

527
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,540
- Why?
- Why?

528
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,420
Because you didn't pay rent for three months!

529
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,800
What do you mean, I didn't pay rent?

530
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,800
I did, I just paid for six months upfront

531
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,240
See, here's the transaction record

532
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,180
I just paid rent
for the next six months last week

533
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,800
Miss, I believe that you're not a con-artist

534
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,720
But you didn't pay me

535
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,360
I didn't see a single cent of money
for the past three months

536
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,900
Now, my son is waiting for the money
to pay his house loan

537
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,720
It's been delayed for over a month

538
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,360
Today, if you don't pay the rent

539
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,620
we're going to move all your things out

540
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,400
Sir, calm down
I think there's some misunderstanding

541
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,840
I paid the rent to the agency

542
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Ask the agency what happened
Did you not receive the money?

543
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,840
- Miss
- Ask the agency, will you?

544
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
I'd like to ask you instead

545
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,719
I went there just now
and there's no one there

546
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,100
Agency? More like trickery!

547
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,540
Let me make a call

548
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,120
Stop moving!

549
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,000
Mr. Liu, I'm Qiao Xi Chen

550
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,120
Didn't you ask me last month

551
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,120
to pay you the rent for the next six months?

552
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,000
The landlord is here
and he said he didn't receive the money

553
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,560
What's going on?

554
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,159
(You have been blocked by this user)

555
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,080
Well? Any news?

556
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,920
Why wouldn't you listen?

557
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,980
I told you, that place was empty

558
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,640
Not a single soul there

559
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,000
What happened?

560
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,320
Jing Jing, I think I was conned by the agency

561
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,860
I just paid six months' rent to the agency
because they said the landlord needed it

562
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,200
Now, the landlord said
he didn't receive the money

563
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,720
I tried to call the agency
but the call didn't go through

564
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,580
It's okay, let's find that agency

565
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,560
No, it's empty, they've all left

566
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,000
They left like that? This is absurd!

567
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
Absurd?

568
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,560
My rent is all gone. Isn't this absurd?

569
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,160
I'm begging you

570
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,800
Please move out now

571
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,800
If I don't rent this place out
I'd need to rent a house myself!

572
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,480
We've packed everything in
the living room, what else?

573
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,480
That room

574
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,160
Wait

575
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,680
My personal belongings are in this room
You have no right to move them

576
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,640
We'll stay out of this room
You can pack them up yourself

577
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,000
Sir, this is too sudden

578
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,520
Give us some time

579
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,580
We'll see what we can do
once we get everything straight

580
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,900
I can't wait anymore

581
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,700
It's only natural to
pay rent if you're renting

582
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,900
If you've been conned
that's your own business

583
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,740
Either you pay up or move out

584
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,640
Someone is coming this
afternoon to view the unit

585
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,180
I don't have any money!

586
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,860
I gave all my money to the agency!

587
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,360
Sir, I'm not going to mooch off you

588
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,340
Please give me a few days, will you?

589
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,460
Lady, if I help you, who would help me?

590
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,100
The bank is going to blacklist my son

591
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,000
You're broke? Ask your parents for money

592
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,940
Borrow from your colleagues and friends

593
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,940
Youngsters like you can even

594
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,220
borrow money online!

595
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,560
Do you have money? Lend her some

596
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,140
I'm not going to waste
my breath on you anymore

597
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,140
If you're not moving
your stuff, I'll help you

598
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Get going! I hired you guys for half a day!

599
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,560
I'm not paying more for overtime!
Move all of them!

600
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,780
What are you doing?

601
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,320
Don't come here! I'm calling the police!

602
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,560
What are you doing?

603
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,100
- Go in!
- I'm calling the police!

604
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,680
Hey, Miss!

605
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,220
Miss, what's with you?

606
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,100
Step aside. I don't want to fight a lady

607
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,800
- Hey, I'll show you! Move!
- Don't come here!

608
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,160
- I'm calling the police!
- Move!

609
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,360
Even the police wouldn't side with you!

610
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,020
Move!

611
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,660
- Move!
- Who dares to touch her?

612
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,660
Who dares to touch her? Come on!

613
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,840
You scared me just now

614
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,160
We've known each other for so long

615
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,600
I've never seen you like this

616
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,820
What? I was scaring them, not you

617
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,680
You call that scaring?

618
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,380
You looked like you were for real,
holding that cleaver

619
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,640
- "Die!"
- Not so loud

620
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,280
When did you become so bold?

621
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,720
I just talked to the landlord
He's not pursuing this further

622
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
- Sign here, you can go back afterwards
- Okay

623
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,580
So, Officer Tan...

624
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,580
My rent...

625
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,720
The agency's actions
can be construed as fraud

626
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,220
We will contact other victims
to lodge an investigation

627
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,820
We will need you to tell us about
details of your renting experience

628
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,500
- and provide relevant evidence
- No problem

629
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,360
Still, the landlord is
a victim in this case too

630
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,720
I talked to him, and he's willing
to give you three days to move out

631
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,460
Three days?

632
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,280
Sure, no problem

633
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,140
- Thank you
- No problem

634
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,620
- Come on, we need to take your statement
- Okay

635
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,840
- I'll wait for you here
- Oh, right

636
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,020
When I checked your ID
I noticed that it's your birthday today

637
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't be so rash in the future
What if you hurt yourself?

638
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,840
- Happy birthday
- Thank you

639
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
Let's go

640
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,220
- Happy birthday
- Thank you

641
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,100
Wait for me

642
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,240
(Reception)

643
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,640
Feeling better?

644
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,940
Are you still going to my home?

645
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,200
- Yeah
- Let's go

646
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,240
Okay, no problem, I...

647
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,840
Later, I'm outside

648
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,400
I'll send you when I'm
in front of my computer, okay?

649
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,280
I have an incoming call, excuse me

650
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Okay, I'll tell you when I send it

651
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,360
- Qiao Qiao
- Hello?

652
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,920
Hey, what's wrong?

653
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I've already fixed the document

654
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,920
You want it today?
I still need to add a watermark

655
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,000
Hello, Miao, the signal here is bad
I can't hear what you say

656
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,520
I can't go back now

657
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,880
Go back, I'll handle things here
I'm free this afternoon

658
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,100
I'm hanging up. Okay

659
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,820
Don't worry

660
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,640
Hey, Jing

661
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,260
Just leave them here

662
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,160
I have three days
I'll pack up slowly afterwards

663
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,080
Sister, you have three days
and you're not worried?

664
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,820
Why are you so optimistic?

665
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,160
There's nothing I can do
even if I worry about it

666
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,820
It's okay, I've thought about it

667
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,760
There's no way I can
find a place in three days

668
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,440
If worst comes to worst
I'll just ask my parents for help

669
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Put it down

670
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Let's go

671
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,540
- Go back to work
- It's okay

672
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,540
Listen, today...

673
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,760
Go back to work

674
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
I've taken the day off. It's my birthday

675
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,280
I come and go as I like

676
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,240
- Really?
- Yeah

677
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,960
Seriously, on your birthday,

678
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,860
I actually got you to work as a laborer

679
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,920
I'm inhumane

680
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,280
Qiao, how pitiful you are

681
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,820
You just lost your home

682
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,720
If you don't get back to work
you're going to lose your job

683
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,520
Why are you cursing me? Touchwood!

684
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
- Touch it!
- Quickly, go!

685
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,080
Hey, are you really wearing this for tonight?

686
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,760
Of course I'm going back
to change into a dress

687
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,940
- Put your lipstick on
- Got it

688
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,980
- See you later
- Go, see you later!

689
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
- Stop packing up
- Okay

690
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,820
(Sweaters)

691
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,600
- Done
- Qiao Xi Chen

692
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,160
Can't you spend like 200 yuan
to hire some movers?

693
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,960
Must you torture us both?

694
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,060
Thank you

695
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,900
Hey, don't stop, why are you sitting down?

696
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,920
Help her open the boxes

697
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,380
- Otherwise, she can't sleep tonight
- I'm pooped!

698
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,780
It's okay, don't worry. Thanks, Jing Jing

699
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,600
You've tidied everything up so nicely

700
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,780
I'm going to sleep on the mattress tonight

701
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,680
As for the rest
I'll pack them up during the day

702
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,720
Look how smart she is

703
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,440
She's just so clever

704
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,920
Now, I have something important to announce

705
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,240
To thank you for your kind help today

706
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,540
I'm going to treat you both to hotpot!

707
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,400
- Hotpot!
- There's only one kind lady here

708
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,120
There's another one

709
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,440
Who knows why she wore
this miniskirt here today?

710
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,840
Also, you're not treating us today

711
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,180
My cousin is going to treat you
to congratulate you for the move

712
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,920
You girls don't need to argue
Anyone can treat

713
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,460
Can I bring Shen Zi Chang too?

714
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,860
He's been craving for hotpot
I have to bring him out too

715
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,260
Then, I'd like to know why
you didn't ask him to come

716
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,680
when we were moving
the heaviest box here just now?

717
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,740
Well, he is too dumb

718
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,480
Enough, that's okay

719
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,560
It's my treat tonight
and it's just one more mouth to feed

720
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,920
Can't I even afford that?

721
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,860
- See?
- No wonder you wore like that

722
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,440
Xu Yan

723
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,900
Let's start from you
What do you want to order?

724
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,940
I want pig's brain

725
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,060
I think you're the pig brain here

726
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,920
It's pork brain, not pig's brain

727
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,440
Mind your tongue

728
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,880
The pig brain is on a killing spree!

729
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,080
Why aren't you helping me?

730
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,540
(Nan Jia, remember to go for
your checkup at 4 pm later)

731
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,220
(Don't worry, I remember)

732
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,640
Excuse me, can you repeat that?

733
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,280
- Thank you for calling, I hope...
- Hello, Mr. Zhang

734
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Xu Yan, help

735
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,840
- I don't understand this Hainanese guy
- Hainanese?

736
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
- Transfer the call to me
- I'll transfer the call

737
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,400
Hello, I'm No. 116 from
the after-sales service team

738
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,700
I will serve you now
Is there any help you need?

739
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,000
Go ahead

740
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,480
I'm sorry, sir

741
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,620
I apologize for the unpleasant
shopping experience you've had

742
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,420
Can you provide your
phone number or order number?

743
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,280
I'll check it up for you

744
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,540
138...

745
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,540
Hold on, sir

746
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,420
I have your record here

747
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,960
It shows that your request for
repair service is being processed

748
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,520
The repairman will contact you tomorrow

749
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,200
to set a time at your convenience
for him to visit your place

750
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,080
Is there anything else I can help?

751
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,980
Okay, thank you for calling

752
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,780
Please leave...

753
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,360
Air-conditioning?

754
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,560
- Hi
- Hi

755
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,640
Oh dear

756
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,480
You're drinking coffee now?
You're not sleeping tonight?

757
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,080
I'm preparing for working all night

758
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,640
You, working all night?

759
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,000
We've known each other for so long
I've never heard you pulling one

760
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,800
It's all because of that work report

761
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,160
I might not even finish it
by tomorrow morning

762
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,800
Come on, have you done so much
to include in your report?

763
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,360
Mr. Jian said he wants more details

764
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,240
This is going to decide
whether we can keep our jobs

765
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,320
Be serious
Don't blame me for not reminding you

766
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,400
I am serious. It's just that
there's something good about me

767
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,460
Whenever I finish a project
I do a write-up immediately

768
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,460
So, I'll just need to copy and paste

769
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,440
This is pure boasting

770
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,560
Come on, don't think so much

771
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,140
He's going to look at
our individual capabilities,

772
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,520
not choosing the best report

773
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,560
This is not an essay competition, right?

774
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:09,380
Do you think Mr. Jian
is replacing Yi Ning temporarily, or...

775
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,540
- Are you dumb?
- What?

776
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,180
If it's just temporary

777
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,700
why would he be involved in something
as troublesome as retrenching?

778
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,300
Yeah

779
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,720
You think Yi Ning knows about this?

780
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,960
Of course not

781
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,560
She's still assigning tasks and
thinking about work on the ambulance

782
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,120
Do you think she'd know?

783
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,120
That's terrible

784
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,680
Terrible as they may be
Let's focus on ourselves

785
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,240
I told you

786
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,080
It was Old President Han
who sent Mr. Jian here

787
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,640
Mr. Jiang and President Han Jr.
are getting a divorce

788
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,500
If they're really going to split their assets

789
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,720
we're going to be sacrificed first

790
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,480
I don't get it

791
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,500
How is their divorce related to our work?

792
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,080
Of course they're related

793
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,820
This is a family business

794
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,060
A family is built before
they establish a business

795
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,000
Even if Yi Ning isn't having a baby

796
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,280
she's still Mr. Jiang's protege

797
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,960
Would Old President Han still want her here?

798
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,220
I heard that Mr. Jian
was vacationing in some village

799
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,220
when the old president went
there personally to beg him

800
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,280
to take over as the marketing director

801
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,960
He didn't even go through Sai Wen

802
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,800
Say, your analysis sounds logical

803
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,420
- Right?
- I listened

804
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,760
Okay, I think we should
just do a good job at work

805
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,000
Then, no one can pick on us, right?

806
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,900
You...

807
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,640
You're just too naive

808
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,960
I'm going to write my report

809
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,800
(Who's going to foot the bill tonight?)

810
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,480
(Come on, no matter whose
birthday it is, I will treat you)

811
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,060
Go ahead

812
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,560
I've arranged for your checkup

813
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,480
The nurse will bring you
clothes for you to change into

814
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,360
I know, I'm an old-timer
I know all the procedures

815
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,040
I hope this is the last time

816
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,760
I hope so too

817
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,640
It will be

818
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,320
(Mother)

819
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,400
Hello

820
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,640
Didn't I tell you not
to call me when I'm working?

821
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,800
It's already six
Haven't you gotten off work yet?

822
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,680
Besides, what's wrong with
answering a call during work?

823
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,040
Forget it, you just came back? Why so late?

824
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,360
The gathering ended a long time ago

825
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,440
Your aunts insisted that
I go shopping with them

826
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,520
I just came back from the mall

827
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,300
You went shopping? What did you buy?

828
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,060
Nothing

829
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,400
Just buy whatever you like. I'll pay

830
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,200
Enough, stop wasting money

831
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,400
Besides, I'm old now
All those clothes look the same on me

832
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,520
What do you mean, you're old?

833
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,960
Seeing how pretty you are

834
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,240
you're going to steal
the spotlight wherever you go

835
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,840
Just doll yourself up

836
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,420
Even if I'm broke
there's still Shen Zi Chang

837
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,240
- You dote on him so much, after all
- No, no

838
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,400
Don't make him buy stuff for me

839
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,680
I don't need anything

840
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,080
I just want the both of you to enjoy life

841
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,160
I'm already satisfied with that

842
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,380
By the way, I brought out the bag
you gave me last time

843
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,020
Your aunts praised me

844
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,840
How did they praise you?

845
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,320
They said it's nice

846
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,880
How is it nice?

847
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,880
Your eldest aunt didn't say anything

848
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,580
But her daughter, Yan Ping, was so rude

849
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,040
She said that the bag isn't
from an international brand

850
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,140
and that she just bought a bag for your aunt

851
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,640
which costs thrice the amount of my bag

852
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,060
What does she know? Why is she so annoying?

853
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,320
What's her bag?

854
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,720
I don't know

855
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,560
She said it's... I don't know

856
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,960
I think it was Lou or something

857
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,720
Is there such a brand?

858
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,760
Yan Yan, the bag you bought
for me is pretty expensive too

859
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,960
It doesn't suit me and I don't really need it

860
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,600
I'll send it back to you, okay?
You can have it

861
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,820
I have lots of bags
Shen Zi Chang keeps buying for me

862
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,320
Don't worry about me

863
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,420
I'll buy another bag just like hers for you

864
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,080
Gosh, why do I need to compare with her?

865
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,520
No need. Don't buy me anything

866
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,200
Why? Every bag looks the same on me

867
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,560
Don't waste money
We don't need such vanity, you hear me?

868
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,920
Save up. You haven't even gotten married yet

869
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,220
Stop worrying about me

870
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,220
- That's all for now. I love you
- Okay

871
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,740
Qiao, what are you doing?

872
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,640
Hey, what are you doing?

873
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,760
I've already sent my work report
I'm getting off work now

874
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,320
- He hasn't left yet
- Who?

875
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,500
Sit down. Work a little longer

876
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,520
(Dear friends, do you know
any houses I can rent?)

877
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,360
Dad, what is it?

878
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,800
My daughter, how's it going?

879
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,920
Pretty good. I'm getting off work soon

880
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,960
Today is Jing Jing's birthday

881
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,320
Xu Yan, Nan Jia and I
are going to have dinner with her

882
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,020
Dinner? That's nice

883
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,760
Listen, don't let Nan Jia
foot the bill every time

884
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,520
She's Jing Jing's cousin, not yours

885
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,280
Don't mooch her off all the time
It's inappropriate

886
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,220
It's my treat tonight, don't worry

887
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,740
I'm ending this call. I need to go now

888
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,760
Hey, wait!

889
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,700
Did you just publish a post online
looking for a house to rent?

890
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,200
Why? Are you moving out?

891
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,140
I'm asking on behalf of my colleague

892
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,840
Why would I want to move?
I'm happy in my house

893
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,060
Exactly

894
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,960
I saw on the news that
Beijing has been tackling

895
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,360
the problem of cramped rented properties

896
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,000
I was worried that you might get involved

897
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,480
Me, get involved? Don't worry

898
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,660
Okay

899
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,640
Hey, what's wrong with your voice?
Are you down with a cold?

900
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,760
A little. I've taken some pills

901
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,240
Don't worry, I'm okay

902
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,960
Don't give me that "I'm okay" talk

903
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,360
Take your medicine if you're sick

904
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,180
Did you drink flu tea?

905
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,600
Check the dates before you drink

906
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,920
Don't drink it if it's expired, okay?

907
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,200
Dad, I have to go now

908
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,080
It's going to be peak hour soon. Bye

909
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,960
Okay, that's all for now
You'd better get going

910
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,380
Don't eat spicy food if you're having a cold

911
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,440
Dad, well...

912
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,220
What are you and Mom having for dinner?

913
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,380
Your mother is making dumplings

914
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,420
We've got dandelions from last spring

915
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,420
She's wrapping dumplings now

916
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,800
If you're keeping the
dumplings in the fridge later

917
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,300
don't keep them in there for days

918
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,320
Leftover food is bad for health

919
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,880
You have a weak stomach

920
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,360
Just throw them away if you can't finish them

921
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,800
Okay, got it

922
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,140
- Bye
- Bye

923
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,500
Qiao

924
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,960
Mr. Jian, were you looking for me?

925
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,940
Sit down

926
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,720
(Hotpot restaurant)

927
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,380
You're early. Your friends aren't here yet

928
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,480
These flowers were just delivered

929
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,140
Yes, I came early

930
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,440
Do you want to order now
or do you want to wait for your friends?

931
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,660
It's okay, I have something to do
I might leave and come back later

932
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,000
- Okay, ring the bell if you need us
- Thank you

933
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,480
I'm already here!

934
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,760
I've ruined the surprise
you've prepared for me!

935
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:54,540
There are 26 flowers
each as beautiful as each of you

936
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,820
As beautiful as me

937
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,960
When you arrive, you will see
a pretty me waiting for you!

938
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,200
Sorry, darling. I didn't know
you wanted to spend that money

939
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,700
Had I known earlier
I wouldn't have touched it

940
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,280
You weren't planning to let me
use the money in the account at all

941
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,320
I swear to God, I opened
that joint account for you

942
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,500
I noticed that you weren't
planning to spend the money

943
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,920
and those shoes just came out

944
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,000
so I wanted to buy them this month

945
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,840
We've been dating for so long

946
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,120
It's always been
Hu Jing Jing's birthday today

947
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,120
I've always needed money on this day

948
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,400
I was too careless

949
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,880
I remembered you saying last month
that it's time to be frugal

950
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,720
I thought you're saving up
to buy Jing Jing a present

951
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,240
It's my mother's birthday last month
and Jing Jing's birthday this month

952
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,280
Do you know how embarrassed I was today?

953
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,020
What's so embarrassing?

954
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,240
Just buy it if you have the money
and walk away if you don't

955
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,680
They can't force you to buy it

956
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,280
I've already told Jing Jing
what I wanted to buy for her

957
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,520
Besides, where were you
when I was quarantined?

958
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,720
It was Jing Jing who delivered
meals to me every day

959
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,460
When I told you about the present
you praised me for being a good friend

960
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,900
How could you forget?

961
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,640
No, my mom wouldn't let me go out back then

962
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,280
You're a good friend
and I'm a petty boyfriend

963
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,680
Sorry, Xu Yan, don't be mad

964
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,100
Hey, you girls are going to drink, right?

965
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,960
I'll sit there and wait for you girls

966
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,920
I'll send each of you back home

967
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,160
If you're still ignoring me
think about Qiao Xi Chen

968
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,160
Given how miserly she is
would she even get a taxi?

969
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,460
No need, we're having dinner
right below her apartment

970
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,600
She can walk back

971
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,680
What about Jing Jing?
She's been so nice to us

972
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,880
You want her to take the subway back alone?

973
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,640
I'm the only one insensible here, aren't I?

974
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,600
That's not what I mean

975
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,720
Come on, Xu Yan. We should cut our
coat according to our cloth, right?

976
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,640
I know you want to buy presents
for Jing Jing and your mother

977
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,760
Even a spendthrift can stretch
their money until the end of the month

978
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,680
But you've barely...

979
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,920
Shen Zi Chang

980
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,400
I get what you're saying

981
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,760
You mean I'm spending your money, right?

982
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,060
I've always bought you something
when you give me presents

983
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,660
Besides, did I use your money when I
bought presents for my mother and Jing Jing?

984
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,440
Yeah, but when you're broke
I helped you pay your rent

985
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,760
Feeling upset now?

986
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,800
You're my boyfriend
What's wrong with spending money on me?

987
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,480
If you don't like it
you don't have to be my boyfriend

988
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,680
- No, where are you going?
- Hey, is this your car?

989
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,360
I'm taking the subway. Don't pull me

990
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,000
- I'm driving
- Move your car!

991
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,260
Wait! Xu Yan!

992
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,260
- Wait!
- I'm calling the police!

993
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,640
Hurry up, move your car!

994
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,500
Move your car now!

995
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,660
Don't you know you can't park here?

996
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,180
- Stop shouting, I got it
- Faster!

997
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,100
I'm so sorry

998
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,300
I'm really sorry. Here, I have some wet wipes

999
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,300
Please help yourself

1000
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,300
- Hello, Chen Chen
- Hi, Mom

1001
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,420
I'm fine

1002
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,860
I'm on the subway, I'm going somewhere

1003
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,480
Don't believe what Dad said

1004
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,220
Tell my dad to cut back on alcohol

1005
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,700
Hello?

1006
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,640
Someone, help!
