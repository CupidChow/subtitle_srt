(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Excuse me

3
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,780
Seriously? I left a note
saying I went to the washroom

4
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,480
Why did you clear my table?

5
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,380
Are solo diners not welcomed?
You cleared my table last time too

6
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,220
(I haven't finished my meal
I just want to enjoy a quiet meal)

7
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,260
(We shouldn't waste food
Please be kind to me! Thank you)

8
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,900
Hello, Miss. This is our mascot

9
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,079
Leave it on the seat
when you come here next time

10
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,600
Then we won't clear your table
I'm really sorry

11
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
- Thank you
- No problem

(Episode 4: A Place to Settle Down)

13
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,700
(Hu Jing Jing
please call us or settle your debt)

14
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,380
(within 24 hours of receiving this message)

15
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,440
- Get me one too
- How do you know what I'm getting?

16
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,519
What else? It must be booze

17
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,740
Here you go

18
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,300
I've heard of two of those platforms

19
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,040
But I've never heard of the rest
Here, drink mine

20
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,100
They are all third party debt collectors

21
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,280
See how it's worded. "We have called
many times to notify you, however"

22
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,900
"our messages remained unheeded
We will be submitting a report soon"

23
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,060
Pretty mean of them to lodge a police report
"Stop rejecting my company's calls"

24
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,860
So she really had debt

25
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,580
How did she end up with such a huge debt?

26
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,860
- Hey!
- You're here

27
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,960
What's going on?
Did Jing Jing really had debt?

28
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,420
I sent it to our group chat room
Didn't you look?

29
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,200
Miss Hu, looks like you're not serious
about paying your debt

30
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,820
I only made exceptions a few times for your
overdue debt because you had a good record

31
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,360
You can't give me excuses
saying you don't have the money

32
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,340
Please tell me exactly when
you can pay your debt

33
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,100
How could he say that?

34
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,180
During the first half of the year, I asked
if she had enough to spend, she said yes

35
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,380
The thing is, she was really in debt

36
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,460
Why would she need money?
She said nothing about it

37
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,020
Besides, she could have come to me
Why did she get a loan?

38
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,880
I'm just putting this out there

39
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,300
Do you think the reason for Jing Jing's
suicide was really because of her debt?

40
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,140
In my opinion, I'd be the only one
killing myself because of money. Not her

41
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,100
How much do you think she owed them
based on these messages?

42
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,040
- I don't think it's over 200,000 yuan
- That's even more unlikely

43
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,620
I'd say two million sounds more likely

44
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Yes, it's only over 100,000 yuan

45
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,300
What else do you think she has kept from us?

46
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,400
Which means, that guy we met the other day

47
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,640
- What was his name? Right, Gao Yang
- Gao Yang

48
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,040
I think what he said is probably true

49
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,380
The calls that Jing Jing avoided in front
of him were probably from the debt collectors

50
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,220
- You're right
- That's why she was so secretive

51
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,940
I think her debt payment isn't due yet. Why?

52
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,620
If debt collectors can't reach you
they will contact your parents

53
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm sure her parents haven't received
their call, otherwise they would've told me

54
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,120
I will talk to my aunt
to write a letter of authorization

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,180
So that we can check
her bank account transaction records

56
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,060
and find out who she sent the money to

57
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,980
We'll know once we see the records

58
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,020
Huh?

59
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,660
It's not her phone. It's mine. Calm down

60
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Hello?

61
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,960
Yes, I know Hu Jing Jing

62
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,500
Who is this speaking?

63
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,600
This is Jing Jing's cat?

64
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,400
She's never said she wanted a cat

65
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,400
Don't look at me
I found out when you found out

66
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,520
You must be Gou Dan's parents

67
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,500
- Whose parents?
- The cat

68
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,940
That's great. Gou Dan can finally go home

69
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,680
Gou Dan was brought here two months ago

70
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,920
It was a stray cat at a parking lot

71
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,840
It wasn't doing so well
when it was brought here

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Then its owner, Hu Jing Jing
said she would come get it once it recovers

73
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,500
But then she suddenly said she couldn't come
and left me a number

74
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,260
We've encountered many cases like that
with abandoned cats

75
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,820
She's not someone like that

76
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,580
I thought so too. That's why I called you

77
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,260
I didn't expect three people to show up

78
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,180
She probably gave your number
since I'm allergic to cats

79
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,780
- I can take care of it if you trust me
- We don't

80
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,540
I'll take care of it
but I have to talk to my roommate first

81
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
We rent the place together
So that's a bit tricky

82
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,700
Why don't you let her
talk to her roommate first?

83
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,059
- In the mean time, Gou...
- Dan

84
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,380
- It can stay here. I'll pay for it
- Yes

85
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,100
Once the problem is settled
we'll surely come back for it

86
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,140
My business card. Don't worry

87
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,020
- We won't abandon it
- Okay

88
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't worry
Jing Jing is a dear friend of ours

89
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,700
We won't abandon what she left behind

90
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,980
Okay

91
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,400
Why are you looking at pet products?
You haven't brought the cat home

92
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,420
If your roommate doesn't allow it
I'd be taking it home anyway

93
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,460
Dream on. My roommate even brings home a man
I'm just bringing home a cat

94
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,340
It's Saturday. What are your plans?

95
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,080
I have a date

96
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,380
I'm going home to get some sleep

97
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,540
Why don't you have any social life?
At least Xu Yan has a date

98
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,780
Then what are your plans?

99
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,340
Going home to sleep

100
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,740
- How eventful!
- That's so exciting!

101
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,780
Knock before coming in
How could you barge in like that?

102
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,820
This is my home. Why do I have to knock?

103
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,720
- Why is he here again?
- Yes

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,500
How many times have I told you?
It's stated clearly in the contract

105
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,980
Only one person...

106
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,220
Only one person can stay in one room
Men aren't allowed

107
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
He's not staying here

108
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,200
- Can't he just visit me once in a while?
- No

109
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,500
Besides, the living room is a public space

110
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,020
Since it's a public space, who are you
to restrict me from doing what I want?

111
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,720
Unbelievable

112
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,060
How can I bring Gou Dan home?

113
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,420
Li Na, you're so skinny
Why are you still eating salad?

114
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,480
I put on 150 g
when I weighed myself yesterday

115
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,120
I indulged in hotpot over the weekend

116
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,380
The calories of a piece of meat
is extremely high

117
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm too afraid to eat

118
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,740
Just eat it. As long as you're happy

119
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,420
It's okay
You look adorable when you're chubby

120
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,220
- You two are working early shift today?
- Yes

121
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,300
Want to go get an injection with me
after work?

122
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,780
- What kind of injection?
- Beauty injection

123
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,160
A clinic I've been following closely
is having a promotion

124
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,820
Bring a friend and get 20 percent off
Bring two, one person gets it for free

125
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,220
Isn't it too soon for us to get these jabs?

126
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,220
Not at all. We have to start
preventing aging after 25

127
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,460
If you start at 26, you can only maintain
your beauty at the age of 26

128
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,580
But if you start at 40, the best condition
you can maintain will only be 40

129
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,180
That is why we must think long-term

130
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,060
Who told you all these?

131
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,820
Everyone's saying it

132
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,460
Does that clinic provide slimming treatment?

133
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,840
- Yes
- Really?

134
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,500
There are many slimming treatments
these days. Want to go have a look?

135
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,380
Come on, girls

136
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,180
Just go have a look
You don't have to get the injection

137
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,080
It's not like they will force you to get it

138
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,060
Right. I'm curious about it. Count me in

139
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,820
I'll come along too

140
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,560
Sure

141
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,180
Hi, the tenant downstairs
said their bathroom is leaking

142
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,580
We checked and found out
the unit above had a water leakage

143
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,460
Your house must be affected
since it's in between

144
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,340
- So I quickly came to tell you
- I'll go have a look

145
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,620
Please, no!

146
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,200
Goodness gracious

147
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,720
Mr. Zheng, have you checked
the video I sent you?

148
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,680
I have a small suggestion

149
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,560
I've stayed in this unit for quite long

150
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,380
It's been quite a number of years
since it's been renovated

151
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,340
I wish to renovate the bathroom
if it's possible

152
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,700
Since some of the fixtures have gotten old

153
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,280
Don't worry about the money

154
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,220
The tenant upstairs said
they will compensate. I can pay for the rest

155
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,780
Qiao, any updates
on the agent who scammed you?

156
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,300
Good news. Officer Tan said many people
became victims of this scam group

157
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,260
They are trying to track my money now
I'll be notified once they have news

158
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,860
That's good news

159
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,100
You're bullying us

160
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,200
He's the eighth one

161
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,700
Four men, four women

162
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,620
If he's really dismissing one third
of the staff, then there's one more left

163
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,160
Help. I'm really nervous

164
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,420
Calm down. Just do your job well

165
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,340
You better watch out

166
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,260
The sales for your new fall products
aren't doing well, right?

167
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,300
It's gone downhill

168
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,500
But you can't blame it on me

169
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,100
Yi Ning planned everything
when she was around

170
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,720
From early stage R&D
to marketing and promotion

171
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,700
she never allowed us to take part

172
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,900
I only did an event
I can't be taking all the blame

173
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,180
But Yi Ning is on leave now

174
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,060
Do you think Yi Ning will take the blame
or the new director would?

175
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,100
Whoever it is. It just can't be me

176
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,240
- Qiao Xi Chen
- Mr. Jian

177
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,780
Prepare a summarized presentation
for the new fall products

178
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,180
From R&D to sales. Be as detailed as possible

179
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,700
It's only been launched for a month
Isn't it too soon for a summary?

180
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,700
This presentation will determine
if it's good enough to stay

181
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,740
Good luck

182
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,180
Good luck

183
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,020
Was he referring to the new products or me?

184
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,020
I'm sorry I jinxed it

185
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,620
It's alright. What must be, must be

186
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,180
Why are you still here?

187
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,100
Where else should I be?

188
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,780
How do I know?
Shouldn't you be following Mr. Jian?

189
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,860
You're right

190
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,980
I hope I'll get to see you again. Good luck

191
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,580
- Good luck
- Thank you

192
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,900
Good luck

193
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,380
I have a rough idea
of all three of your conditions

194
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,980
Let's start with you, Wei Wei

195
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,460
I suggest you do a full-body liposuction

196
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,420
You can choose specific areas as well

197
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,380
Then you can do a full-face Lipo 360

198
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,540
- Lipo 360?
- It will give you a drastic change

199
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,620
Will it be very painful?

200
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,060
- It's worth it, though
- Women have to be meaner to themselves

201
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,620
Miss Xu, right?

202
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,540
You have the looks, the figure
and the elegance. It's just that...

203
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,020
You can do a minor adjustment

204
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,380
Your face is a little round here

205
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,540
Right? If you do a bone contouring

206
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,420
- your face will look sharp
- Bone contouring?

207
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,140
- That's right
- That's too much

208
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,620
- I don't dare to do it
- I'll be honest with you girls

209
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,980
We do more than ten minor surgeries
like that each day

210
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,740
Is my face that round?

211
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,880
Take a look for yourself

212
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,360
It is rounder compared to yours

213
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,620
So you're saying that I can't do anything
unless the landlord comes here personally?

214
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,700
That's right. Look

215
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I personally came to talk to you about it

216
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,880
We have our rules as well. Never mind

217
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,360
Bring the property ownership certificate
and the house owner's original ID

218
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,300
Then ask the house owner
to record a video as proof of authorization

219
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,099
I've told you. The house owner is overseas

220
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Besides, I've shown you the chat records
I've been given the green light

221
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,500
How can you prove that
it's really the house owner?

222
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,060
For crying out loud!

223
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,859
You see. We're seriously not trying
to make things hard for you

224
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,020
This house doesn't belong to you
Now you want to renovate it

225
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,380
If the house owner comes back
denies giving you permission

226
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,180
and blames us for failing our job
we'll end up in hot water

227
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
I really have nothing against you

228
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,440
I've been living here for six years

229
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,060
I just want to renovate the washroom

230
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,080
Even if you've lived here for ten years

231
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
your name isn't on the property
ownership certificate. Am I right?

232
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,540
Cool!

233
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,320
(Mrs. Lin)

234
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,560
There's a leakage in the washroom at home

235
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,940
So I'm staying at a hotel for two days

236
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,480
What luck you have there

237
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,920
Who knew there would be a leakage?

238
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,040
Did the tenant upstairs agree to compensate?

239
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,400
By the way
have you mentioned this to your landlord?

240
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,400
Otherwise, he'll ask you to pay for it

241
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll be compensated

242
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,060
Good, then. Quickly get someone to fix it

243
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,060
I want to renovate the washroom

244
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,860
It's too old now

245
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,680
Your landlord is paying for it?

246
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,340
I am, obviously. I'm the one living there

247
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,300
Why must you pay for it?
The house doesn't belong to you

248
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,920
I'm living there
I should at least pay for some of the cost

249
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,900
Jia Jia, are you not right in the head?

250
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,760
You think you'll be living in
that house forever?

251
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,500
Can you bring the renovation with you
when you move out?

252
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,620
- The house owner gets to keep it
- What's with the fuss?

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,980
But I've got to use it already

254
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,500
Believe it or not. If you renovate it now
you'll be asked to move out next year

255
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,300
I've seen a lot of these cases online

256
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,480
Stop surfing the internet

257
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,720
Disconnect the cable
You're reading useless news

258
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,760
I can't talk now. You and Dad
should go to bed soon. I'm hanging up

259
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,940
Xiao Yi, the contract...

260
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,780
Forget it. I saw it

261
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,860
- Hello
- What are you up to?

262
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,960
Nothing much

263
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,260
I'm so envious of you

264
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,680
Xu Yan, don't you think
I'm paying rent for nothing?

265
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,580
I spend more time at the office
than I do at home

266
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,900
Move out of the house
and stay at the office then

267
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,160
I think that could work

268
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,460
Qiao Xi Chen, let me put it this way
There's no end to earning money

269
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,300
Besides, do you get paid
for working overtime?

270
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,440
I don't get paid for working overtime

271
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,060
But if I don't work overtime
I might lose my job

272
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,980
Are you seriously going to get fired?

273
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,940
Is it because of that director
who came out of nowhere?

274
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,580
I'm telling you

275
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm seriously unlucky

276
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,420
I went for an interview
at a new company last week, right?

277
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,240
Of all people, I ran into him

278
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,700
And the new product I was in charged for R&D
isn't selling well

279
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,300
I keep getting on his bad side

280
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,160
What's worse is

281
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,260
I didn't get a reply after the interview

282
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,060
I'm thinking he must be behind it

283
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,200
He's so petty

284
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,780
He's not even leaving you a way out
when he's going to fire you

285
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,780
The new director is petty

286
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,220
Always idling away, not contributing anything

287
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,780
- Good description
- Hold it. Don't you laugh!

288
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,500
Okay, I've got to hang up
I need to finish working on

289
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,460
the presentation that holds my fate

290
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
- Qiao Qiao
- What?

291
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,580
If you really become jobless
don't worry. I'll take care of you

292
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,500
Thanks

293
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,260
I've got to go

294
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,640
Silly

295
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,040
Mr. Jian

296
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,380
Mr. Jian

297
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,900
Mr. Jian

298
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,060
I don't need the presentation done by today
You should go home

299
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,780
- You heard everything?
- I can say no if that's what you wish

300
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,420
So it's a yes

301
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,980
Mr. Jian

302
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,980
Just lay it on me

303
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,380
- What?
- Am I the last one?

304
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Am I the last one on the list
to be dismissed?

305
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,240
- Why would you think I'd dismiss you?
- Damei

306
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,120
You caught me

307
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,560
There's nothing wrong with
looking for a new job

308
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,580
What's wrong is that you picked Damei

309
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,940
There's also the poor sales
for the new fall products

310
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,520
- You think it's your fault?
- Of course not

311
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,660
I wasn't the main person in charge

312
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,500
Then why would I want to dismiss you?

313
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,240
Someone has to be held responsible for it
It can't be Yi Ning

314
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,020
So you think I'm putting the blame on you

315
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,060
I feel that you're not fond of me

316
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,620
Do you think I should pursue you then?

317
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,980
No, that's not what I meant

318
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,840
What I meant was...

319
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,900
Like the incident with the quotation list

320
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,580
It wasn't my fault
but you urged me to take leave

321
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,320
And the 818 promotion. It was my project

322
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,740
But you gave it to Brother Qiang. And then...

323
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,060
I got drunk

324
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,100
So I thought, perhaps...

325
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,360
You have a problem with me

326
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
(Daily Morning News)

327
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,480
I don't have to explain this, right?

328
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,280
I was in the car that day

329
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
That's my car

330
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,820
I saw you at the hospital

331
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,220
You were devastated

332
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,660
I could tell that you two were close

333
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,420
She's my best friend

334
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,460
No one can feel the pain
you suffered from that

335
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,020
The only thing I can do
is giving you a few days off

336
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,260
so that you won't feel stressed

337
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,900
However

338
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,180
I'm very pleased with the way you handled
the Chinese Valentine's Day event

339
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,340
But as the current person in charge
of the new fall products

340
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,140
don't you think you should consider
if there's room for salvation?

341
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,700
So the presentation wasn't
to find fault with me, but to...

342
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,460
When something goes wrong with a product

343
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,700
I must find out the problem
so that I can tackle it

344
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,820
- If you don't want to be in charge of...
- I want to

345
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Jian

346
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll give you
the presentation file by tonight

347
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,280
Thank you, Mr. Jian

348
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,660
It's pretty late. You should eat something

349
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,620
My goodness

350
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,100
How did she become so fat? Look

351
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,140
How is that fat?

352
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,340
She is fat. Her face is so round. My goodness

353
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,720
I thought you said my round face was cute

354
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,660
Yes, you're cute.
But I'm not saying you're fat

355
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,260
Liar! She's not fat. It's just the angle

356
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,920
How is this because of the angle?

357
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,460
Shen Zi Chang, if I become old
fat and ugly one day

358
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,180
- will you still love me?
- I will

359
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,660
Even if you become old and haggard
one day, you'll still be the cutest old lady

360
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,900
You don't sound sincere at all

361
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,180
Go home

362
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,380
- What?
- Quick. Go home

363
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,740
- I said go home
- Did I say something wrong again?

364
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,520
No, everything's fine. Just go

365
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,860
My gosh. Why waste your energy
getting mad at him when you're so pretty?

366
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,420
Of course I'm angry
What they say on the internet is true

367
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,980
Men are all visual animals

368
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,500
What was that phrase in
Empresses in the Palace?

369
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,660
Losing affection
when a woman loses her beauty?

370
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,040
Such wise words

371
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,580
Read more books

372
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,820
You're learning all that from TV

373
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,100
But they've got a point, right?

374
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,420
Everyone likes eye candies

375
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,100
I would take a second look
if I see a pretty girl too

376
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,340
Xu Yan, I'll talk to you later

377
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,340
I have to deal with something
I'll call you back later

378
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,740
- Bye bye
- Okay

379
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,400
(Beauty Metamorphosis, Current offer price)

380
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,800
Why is there no hot water again?

381
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,940
I need to take a leak. It can't wait

382
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,540
Hey, I'm still in there!

383
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,580
Don't you know how to close the door?

384
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,140
Close it for me then

385
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,860
Firstly, clean up your own mess
in the public area. Don't leave it overnight

386
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,140
Please clean up after using the kitchen

387
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,280
Don't leave the pots and pans
piling up in the sink

388
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,220
We'll take turns cleaning the living room
and washroom every week

389
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,660
What do you mean?

390
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,440
I didn't ask you to clear my trash
You offered to do it

391
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,820
Yes, I'm nuts
for cleaning your trash every day

392
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,100
I'm really curious

393
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,620
All these rubbish you left laying around

394
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,740
It's been here for days and starting to rot
Can't you smell it?

395
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,960
On top of that, you have your stuff
scattered all over the living room

396
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,860
You've taken up all the space
There's no space left for me

397
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,420
You can pile your stuff too. I won't stop you

398
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,020
Besides, shouldn't roommates
learn to give and take?

399
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,340
You can't force me to live by your standards

400
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,580
If you can't stand it, you can
tidy up the place. I don't mind it though

401
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,500
Fine

402
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,400
You're really something

403
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,380
Alright. I'll set that aside for now

404
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,420
Secondly, don't use my stuff again

405
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,560
I had no idea you were so petty

406
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,660
I just used a bit of your shampoo
It doesn't cost that much anyway

407
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,780
- It's not like I can't afford it
- Then buy your own. Why use mine?

408
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,700
You're a real piece of work

409
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm fine if you only used it once or twice

410
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,200
But not every day!
I have short hair. You have long hair

411
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,460
You even let your boyfriend use it

412
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,480
I bought a new bottle last week
but it's empty now

413
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,020
How much is a single takeout?

414
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,500
Can't you save that money
to buy shampoo for yourself?

415
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,140
Yes. Takeout, you say?

416
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,940
Didn't we get your portion too
when we ordered food?

417
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,920
If I knew you were this petty
I wouldn't have used it even if you let me

418
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, please, thank you!

419
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,300
Don't bring back your leftover food
for me next time. It'll go to waste

420
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,460
And the most important thing
he isn't allowed to stay the night anymore

421
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,460
You two can do whatever you want as a couple

422
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,260
But why must you bring him home?

423
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,020
Isn't it better outside? A night
at a budget hotel isn't that expensive

424
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,300
You two act as if I'm not in this house

425
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,860
Even if you're not embarrassed
I feel embarrassed for you

426
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,540
And it's clearly stated in the contract

427
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,700
Only one person is allowed
to stay in one room, and men aren't allowed

428
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,420
- Qiao Chen Xi!
- Qiao Xi Chen

429
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,560
Qiao Xi Chen!

430
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,220
Why are you making so much fuss?

431
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,820
What now?
You have a problem with my boyfriend?

432
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,300
We all came here to work
Why don't you have any empathy?

433
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,040
And you do? Are you sure?

434
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,460
Your boyfriend walks around the house
shirtless all the time and never knocks

435
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,880
Not only did he not knock today
he even left the door open

436
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,620
I had to close it for him

437
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,100
I've got to give it to you. You are right

438
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,140
Roommates should give and take

439
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,340
But it's always I give, you take

440
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,680
Stop speaking as if you're so great

441
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,020
I let you ogle at my boyfriend for free

442
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,780
Bring home your boyfriend if you can
I can't be bothered

443
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,880
But who are you to blame if you can't?

444
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,220
You're just jealous of me

445
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,140
If you feel uncomfortable about it
then move out

446
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,260
I've never met such a fussy roommate like you

447
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,560
I'm staying! You can move out if you want

448
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,900
Co-renting is like buying lottery tickets

449
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,040
You need a stroke of luck to find
a trustworthy landlord and a nice roommate

450
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,780
It's much relaxing living alone

451
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,380
Living alone is nice, but so is the price
Look how much it costs

452
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,360
That's half my monthly salary
How can I afford it?

453
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,980
- I guess you're right
- I've been looking at this

454
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,660
- Look
- It does look pretty neat

455
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,980
- The flooring is new
- Yes

456
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,460
It's fully furnished

457
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,820
But the price does seem a little steep

458
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,040
It's at a good location too

459
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,580
These things belong to the landlord

460
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,980
But you'll be living here alone anyway

461
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,180
I'll look around some more

462
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,700
Sure, you can

463
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,260
What do you think about this?

464
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,980
It has lesser furniture
There's more than enough space

465
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,600
It's pretty nice and tidy

466
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,240
- Right?
- Even the walls are clean

467
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,860
I just tidied it up

468
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,860
Where is this room facing?
How come there's no sunlight?

469
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,820
It's probably facing the south

470
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,100
This blackout curtain is really good

471
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,179
This...

472
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,860
There's one more unit over there
and another over here

473
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,020
Wait, sir. Slow down

474
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,440
It's been years
since I've climbed so many flights of stairs

475
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,540
This is nothing. Just six floors

476
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,020
You'll get to save on gym membership
going up and down every day

477
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,400
- Am I right?
- Thank you

478
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,780
But I would still prefer
finding a place with an elevator

479
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,300
You can only get units in these
small old neighborhoods with that budget

480
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,699
I'll be frank with you
The landlord is often away from Beijing

481
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,420
The rent has stayed the same for three years

482
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,100
Otherwise, you won't find a place here
with that budget

483
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,340
The home appliances are almost as old as I am

484
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,140
That's true, but they last long

485
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,900
These big brand appliances
are still working after 20 over years

486
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,540
I still wish to find a place with elevator
Why don't we keep looking?

487
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,460
Alright, then. Let's go

488
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,140
It's hard to find a place here
with that budget

489
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,540
There is one that's a little far though

490
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,760
The tenant just moved out recently
after renting this place for over three years

491
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,020
He stopped renting
because he bought himself a house

492
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,620
The landlord even had the walls repainted

493
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,260
The television and fridge are new

494
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,940
It also has a squarish layout

495
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,260
What do you think?

496
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,860
Well...

497
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,000
To be honest, I like it
especially the bedroom. It's just that...

498
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,300
It's too far from my workplace

499
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,940
Not at all. Don't you work in Wangjing?

500
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,980
You can get straight to work
by taking the subway Line 15 here

501
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,680
So? What do you say?

502
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,120
Okay. I'll rent this place

503
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,940
Good. I'll go check on the home utilities

504
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,420
- Okay. Thank you
- Don't mention it

505
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,140
Thank you, sir

506
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,800
Thank you

507
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,820
- This is the last box
- Okay. Thanks for helping, Chang

508
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,220
I'm finally leaving

509
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,340
Thanks for taking care of me for so long

510
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,760
So long!

511
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,620
Are you tired?

512
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,820
Miss

513
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,340
You lead the way later

514
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,840
- We'll follow behind. Okay?
- Sure

515
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,980
- We'll lead the way
- Sure, I'll drive

516
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,140
- Thank you, sir
- Let's go

517
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,320
Watch your step
Sir, watch out for the threshold

518
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,020
- That's the last of it
- Thank you, Chang

519
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,780
Thanks for the help. Here's some water

520
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,900
Thank you. By the way, Miss

521
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,740
The wheel on this doesn't work, right?

522
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,020
It was already broken. It's not your fault

523
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,580
That's not what I meant

524
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,340
I had nothing much to do in the truck earlier
so I fixed it. Try it out

525
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,860
Yes, it wasn't working previously

526
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,360
Thank you, sir
I'll pay you back for fixing it

527
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,720
Don't worry about it. It's nothing

528
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,820
I just thought it'd be a waste
if you threw it away

529
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,460
If that's all, then I'll get going

530
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,940
- Okay. Thank you
- Bye bye

531
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,540
- I'll call you if I need help next time
- Sure

532
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,900
He's so kind. There's still a lot of
good people in this world

533
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,860
But isn't this place a little too far?

534
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,140
You think everyone lives
right across their workplace like you?

535
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,060
It is quite far
but I've done some calculations

536
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,340
I'll have plenty of time to watch dramas
and read books while I travel to and fro

537
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,100
So it's not a waste of time, right?

538
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,100
Didn't you guys notice on the way here?

539
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,660
There's a mall, cinema, gym
and such places nearby

540
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,660
The area here is so much better
than my previous place

541
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,060
Even if I stay at home during the weekends
next time, it's still good

542
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,100
Yes, but we're living so far away
from each other. It'll be hard to meet

543
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,340
- Move in with me then
- I think...

544
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,160
No way. What about me?

545
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,540
I had a feeling

546
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,420
- What kind of feeling?
- Well

547
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,380
The moment I stepped into this house
I suddenly had this feeling

548
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,540
I, Qiao Xi Chen
am about to start my new chapter in life

549
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,920
(Alarm)

550
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,020
- I'm really sorry
- It's fine

551
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
Good morning

552
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,980
- You're finally here
- What's the matter?

553
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,460
Mr. Jian was looking for you all morning
to talk about the venue

554
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,860
- Quickly go
- You're lying

555
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,940
What for? He's been waiting

556
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,380
This isn't my day
The one time I'm late in a thousand years

557
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,260
- and he caught me
- I mean...

558
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,740
Did you go fight for
Spring Festival train tickets or what?

559
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,980
Are you kidding me? I left my house
40 minutes earlier and I'm still late

560
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,340
It took me almost an hour just to get into
the station. It was insanely crowded

561
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,860
I've never ran like that
since my college entrance exam

562
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,380
- Hurry
- I'm a bit nervous

563
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,060
He was looking for you all morning. Quick

564
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,820
You can do this. Hurry

565
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,260
(Miss Ji, it's your birthday soon)

566
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,160
(Fully-furnished house
Massive year-end promo)

567
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,640
- See you, Qiao Qiao
- Bye bye

568
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,080
Qiao, we're going for supper later. Join us

569
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,540
I don't think I'll go

570
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,980
It'll be too late for me
to catch the last train

571
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,080
You can hail a car

572
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,020
Don't be ridiculous. Even ride-sharing
is expensive for me, let alone hailing

573
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,040
Fine. We won't invite you
for supper from now on

574
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,860
Come on! I'm not saying that
I'll never join you at all

575
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,440
- At least invite me out of courtesy
- Got it

576
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,340
- We'll get going then
- I'll leave in ten minutes

577
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,540
- Bye bye
- Go on. Bye bye

578
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,720
Gou Dan! Look!

579
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,220
The three of us are here
to take you home, Gou Dan

580
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,600
You've gone mad

581
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
Giving a cat a dog's name

582
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,520
What if it doesn't like it?

583
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,700
Isn't that her style, though?

584
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,780
By the way

585
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,740
We can get Jing Jing's
bank account transaction records now

586
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,860
Her parents have sent me
the letter of authorization

587
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,680
Okay

588
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,480
The paperwork is done

589
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,820
Here's the cat food you wanted

590
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,860
This toy is a gift from me to Gou Dan

591
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,820
I also wrote you a list of things
to take note since you've never had a cat

592
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,540
Send me a message anytime
if you have any questions

593
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,380
- Thank you
- Don't mention it

594
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,500
Bye, Gou Dan. I'll leave you to it

595
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,780
- Thank you
- Thanks

596
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,060
Show it some love
since it's in the carrier now

597
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,460
I will. I'll carry it. Like this, right?

598
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,020
- Let's go
- Relax

599
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,460
- Come on
- I'm relaxed

600
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,780
- Let's go, Gou Dan
- It's basically taking a chopper now

601
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,460
- Come on in
- My, my, Qiao!

602
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,060
- Not bad
- Slippers

603
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,500
It's so much better than your old place

604
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,960
This is really neat

605
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,620
It's so bright and spacious
You should hold a housewarming party

606
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,480
I don't have time for a housewarming

607
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,100
Come here, Gou Dan. Look

608
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,060
Our new home. Do you like it?

609
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,580
Nice. This is really nice

610
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,800
When I came here
I thought this place was nice

611
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,600
That's why I decided to move in

612
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,500
But it was all wishful thinking

613
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,420
I leave the house at seven in the morning
and rush to work

614
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,780
Even if I don't work overtime
I reach home after nine

615
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,500
I can't even be bothered to remove my makeup
I just want to lay down when I get home

616
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,620
At first, I thought it wasn't so bad

617
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:04,660
It is quite far, but I can play with my phone
or read books on the subway

618
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,240
But do you know how crowded it is
during the peak hours?

619
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,740
I couldn't even reach for my phone

620
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,280
I was the same when I just started working

621
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,980
I was staying in Yanjiao
Our office was in Guomao at that time

622
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,980
I'd have to travel
two to three hours to work every day

623
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,060
Sometimes when there's an event in Beijing
they'll have roadblocks in Yanjiao, right?

624
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,620
I'd always be stuck there forever

625
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,860
One day, I left for work at 7 am
and reached the office at 4 pm

626
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,300
People were about to go home
when I got there. My manager was furious

627
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,580
and said, "Why didn't you
get a place near the office?"

628
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,740
I felt so wronged

629
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,460
That's so mean
Did you fire back at your manager?

630
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,700
Of course not. My manager wasn't wrong

631
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,960
I just feel that...

632
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,740
Sometimes, you can't expect people
to understand your situation

633
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,640
Empathy doesn't exist in this world

634
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,060
Everyone who works here
is doing their best to charge forward

635
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,480
Doing your part
is the kindest act you can do for others

636
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,260
Why are you pitying me?

637
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,260
I'm doing great now. Look at me

638
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,220
I have a big house
and I don't have to take the crowded subway

639
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,180
What? Are you rubbing it in my face now?

640
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,220
You'll succeed too

641
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,740
I know I will
Not only that, I'm also not allergic to cats

642
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,260
I can have a cat. Plus...

643
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,460
- Bye. I'm leaving
- Okay. I'm sorry

644
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,140
- Are you free tomorrow?
- No

645
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,760
I mean after work

646
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,380
I have to go home

647
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,940
- Don't be silly
- I...

648
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,180
I'm treating everyone to dinner. Tomorrow's
the last day before the festive season

649
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,580
Give me a minute
You came back at the right time

650
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,580
Guys, since tomorrow's the last day of work
before the festive season

651
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,440
and as a new member of the team
I'd like to treat everyone to dinner

652
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,660
Please do come. Thank you!

653
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,060
- Sure!
- Thank you.

654
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,260
You know

655
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,500
I think you're really something

656
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,740
You've turned your onboarding
into a huge sensation

657
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,100
That's a must

658
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,580
- I'm not going. I live really far away
- Qiao

659
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,620
- It'll be really late by the time I get home
- Come on. Everyone's going

660
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,460
- Please. I'm begging you
- I'm so easy to convince

661
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,820
Fine. I'll go

662
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,180
Eat all you want. It's on me

663
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,860
- That's all I need now. Bye
- See you tomorrow

664
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,260
- See you guys tomorrow night!
- Okay

665
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,700
- Keep it up
- Thank you

666
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,780
- I'm telling you
- What is it?

667
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,540
Do you know how crowded the station is
nearing the festive season?

668
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,620
Don't worry

669
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,440
Gou Dan, what are you up to?

670
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,800
Gou Dan

671
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,780
Playing with your toy?

672
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,060
Gou Dan, were you playing by yourself?

673
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,460
Seriously, your name

674
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,740
I was out earning money to feed you
Am I great?

675
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,320
I brought you home
but I can't spend time with you

676
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,900
You must be really bored being at home alone

677
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,460
Do you want a Mid-Autumn present?

678
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,660
Gou Dan

679
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,460
Such a good kitty. You were waiting for me

680
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,560
Come on

681
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,200
Look!

682
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,260
What's this?

683
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,440
This is your playground from now on

684
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,180
Isn't it nice?
I even made you a little flower. Look

685
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,220
It looks amazing

686
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,780
My owner made this for me
even though she's tired

687
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,460
I love you so much

688
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,180
I love you too

689
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,440
Alright

690
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,560
Quiet, everybody. We just received a notice
from the headquarters

691
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,440
Our company will be updating our CI system

692
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,020
They want someone from customer service
to shoot the promotional video

693
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,900
Whoever is interested
can come find me after the holidays

694
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,860
Okay, that's all. Get back to work

695
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,840
Hello

696
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,720
Have you signed up for the promotional video?

697
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,260
I'm still undecided. You?

698
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,220
Of course I have. It's a great opportunity

699
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,820
Do you remember Wendy?

700
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,380
She grabbed her chance at the company's
Top 10 Prettiest Smiles contest

701
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,540
Now she's an executive secretary
with a bright future

702
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,740
Wendy is competent

703
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,740
Still, you need opportunities
to show your capabilities

704
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,360
I'll just watch on the sidelines

705
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,300
- Xu Yan, you can win this. Good luck
- Thank you

706
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,980
Fatty, you think only Xu Yan can win?

707
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,980
I think you can win too. Good luck

708
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,420
I must give my face a full treatment
during this holiday

709
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,700
So? Are you coming?

710
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,980
I'm...

711
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,060
- I'm coming
- Then...

712
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,780
- I'm coming too
- That's more like it

713
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,300
Hey, listen

714
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,700
I know an interesting psychological test
Want to try?

715
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,020
- What is it?
- Let's do it

716
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,500
First, think of an object

717
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,740
Let's start with you. Everyone, try it

718
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,580
- Basketball
- Okay, basketball. You?

719
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,980
- A ring
- Okay

720
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,580
- A cup
- Okay. And you?

721
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,300
Qiao, what are you doing?

722
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,240
- Connecting to the Wi-Fi
- Qiao. Try this psychological test

723
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,980
I don't play these stuff

724
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,740
- Afraid that I'll see through you?
- Yes, I'm really afraid

725
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,300
- Guys, I'm...
- Mr. Jian

726
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,060
Mr. Jian

727
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,940
Sit down

728
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,780
You see. I'm Mr. Jian's assistant, right?

729
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,300
So Mr. Jian should be here
for my onboarding dinner

730
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,060
- Let's welcome Mr. Jian
- Welcome, Mr. Jian

731
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,940
Alright. Sit down

732
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,820
Mr. Jian, what booze do you want?

733
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,180
I don't drink. But I brought you guys
two bottles of good wine

734
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,340
Drink this

735
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,980
- Thank you, Mr. Jian
- Quick. Open it

736
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,300
This is good stuff

737
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,060
Thank you, Mr. Jian
How about we drink to Mr. Jian?

738
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,020
- Thank you, Mr. Jian
- Thank you, everyone

739
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,020
- Thank you, Mr. Jian
- Cheers

740
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,740
- Happy holidays
- Thank you, Mr. Jian

741
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,100
Help yourselves to the food

742
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,700
- Eat
- Dig in

743
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,380
Guys, this is their signature dish

744
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,140
Try the fish. It tastes amazing. Try it

745
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,020
Mr. Jian, have you looked at
my presentation file?

746
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,700
If there's any problem with it
you can tell me

747
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,560
It's no longer working hours
and it's the festive season tomorrow

748
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,940
Whatever we discuss now can't be completed
before the holiday ends

749
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,860
So just focus on the dinner, okay?

750
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,660
It can be completed
I can work over the holidays

751
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,020
Qiao Xi Chen, why are you
going against your boss' orders?

752
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,620
He already said we've clocked out

753
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,540
- But you're talking about work over dinner
- I...

754
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,260
My bad. As punishment, I'll down a glass

755
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,540
- I'm sorry
- Let's all drink

756
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,460
Happy holidays!

757
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,680
Be careful on your way home

758
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,380
Don't drive if you've drunk. Hail a car

759
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,660
- Go on then
- Bye bye

760
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,920
Happy holidays

761
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,300
- Enjoy your holiday
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival

762
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,540
- Where is Qiao Xi Chen?
- Washroom

763
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,780
Everybody left

764
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,500
- How are you going home?
- I'm taking the subway

765
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,260
It's the holidays. Treat yourself better

766
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,900
It's too expensive to hail a car back home

767
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,240
I can give you a lift home

768
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,700
No, it's fine, Mr. Jian
It's convenient taking the subway

769
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,260
- What about you?
- My boyfriend

770
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,060
Bye bye

771
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,660
- Be careful
- Be careful

772
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,780
Go spend time with your boyfriend

773
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,740
No, I want to bring you with me

774
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,060
- It's so slippery
- Slow down

775
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,840
I wonder which one of them
will get down first

776
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,420
I hope it's the guy

777
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,860
Sir, it's my stop

778
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,600
This is bad

779
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,380
If he gets down first
then I'll be left alone with the driver

780
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,860
It's so late at night

781
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,620
Both your destinations are in different
directions. Which one should I go first?

782
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,320
Ladies first

783
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,960
Thank you

784
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,520
Miao, I haven't arrived

785
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,960
I'm sharing a ride to the subway station
I'm almost there. You don't have to worry

786
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,920
(Construction Notice)

787
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,540
They're fixing the road so it's blocked
Why don't you get down here?

788
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,060
- The station is just right across
- Okay, thank you

789
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,320
- Hello?
- Hello

790
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,100
Why do you sound like that? Are you home yet?

791
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,380
I think I'm being followed

792
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,860
- Where are you?
- Near the subway station

793
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,100
Don't panic, Qiao Xi Chen. Listen to me

794
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,740
Find nearby stores that are open
and wait in there

795
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,340
There's a convenience store

796
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,020
Good. Wait inside and send me your location

797
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,580
- Don't come out until I've arrived. Got it?
- Okay

798
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,800
Welcome

799
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,500
What are you looking for?

800
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,060
I'm still looking

801
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,200
Hurry up. We're closing soon

802
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,660
I need to lodge a report

803
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,060
It's 26.80 yuan

804
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,620
I took this by mistake

805
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,540
- I'll put it back
- It's fine. Just leave it

806
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,860
- Okay. Thanks
- Just these two, then?

807
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,300
- It's six yuan
- I've already paid

808
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,140
Mr. Jian, I think the person
isn't following me anymore

809
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,800
Maybe I was just being paranoid

810
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,260
It's quite far here. You don't have to come

811
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,460
I'll just dash to the station
and I'll be home soon

812
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,380
Who are you?

813
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,740
Stop screaming

814
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,500
Who the heck are you?

815
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,220
Stop!

816
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,060
What's going on? Who called the police?

817
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,580
Let go of him

818
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,180
It was me

819
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,980
Officer Tan

820
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,780
It's you two. What a coincidence

821
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,300
My wife is pregnant so I came out to smoke
and get some milk for her

822
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,180
Then I saw them and suddenly got attacked
I don't even know them

823
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,620
He suddenly came at me

824
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,740
- Where do you live?
- Here. Room 901, Unit 3, Building 12

825
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,100
Okay. Be more cautious
during the night next time

826
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,300
- Alright
- Go home

827
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,820
Here's your ID. Please sign here

828
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,340
It's just a misunderstanding
Go comfort the young lady

829
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,540
We'll get going

830
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,620
Sorry for troubling you

831
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,220
Don't give yourself a fright next time

832
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,300
Sorry about that

833
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,300
I made you come all the way here for nothing

834
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,940
Whenever you're with me from now on

835
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,620
I'll take you home no matter how late it is

836
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,440
Your legs

(Happy Mid-Autumn Festival)
(The Strongest Women On Earth)

839
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,300
- Somebody said this was lame
- Now she's wearing this

840
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,740
- What about your outfit? Is this it?
- This is it. Can't you tell?

841
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,580
Let me guess. Are you Cheon Song Yi?

842
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,980
You are a Minion?

843
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,380
Minions wear overalls

844
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,980
- Where's your overall?
- A Minion

845
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,620
- Hey, you two
- A banana?

846
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,580
- This is heavy
- You should be able to tell right away

847
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:52,300
I was scouted to appear in a film
when I was in college

848
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,620
You two even said
you'd go to the cinemas to support me

849
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,140
- You didn't watch it?
- We did

850
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,300
I'm that...

851
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,940
- Sailor Moon?
- Who?

852
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,820
- She's a Minion
- No. Stand up

853
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,100
- I know what is that
- I even had a line

854
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,540
Stand here. You're the queen
and I'm the one who said

855
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,500
"My queen, no"

856
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,900
- I think you acted really well
- Yes, you're right. She was great

857
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,060
- You two didn't watch it
- We did. You were amazing

858
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,980
I played the role of Baba Fairy
Didn't you watch it?

859
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,940
- We did
- Baba Fairy! That's right!

860
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,860
- I remember it now
- You acted so well as Baba Fairy

861
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,140
If it weren't because I was worried that...

862
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,940
- Baba Fairy? Bala Bala?
- No, Baba Fairy

863
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,980
- It's called Baba Fairy
- Bala Bala

864
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,140
I shouldn't have given up acting
because of you two

865
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,860
- Who are you, Nan Jia?
- Isn't it obvious?

866
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:40,980
Nanny Rong

867
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,080
It's probably not a hopping vampire

868
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,060
Look at the hat. Nanny doesn't wear this

869
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,180
No, it's an important figure

870
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,280
Look closely

871
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,160
I know. It's a prince

872
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,420
- Which prince was it?
- It's Prince 14th

873
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,340
Let's quickly take a picture
The hat is heavy as heck

874
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,600
The prince is annoyed

875
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,660
- You don't want to be prince?
- Let's take a picture

876
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,660
- Do I have to pay?
- Yes

877
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:04,980
How much for a picture?

878
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,780
- Fifty yuan
- I'm famous

879
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,460
- Pay five yuan for touching
- Three, two, one

880
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,300
Hey!

881
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:16,340
- You two
- Get rid of the banner that says "36"

882
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,060
- Thirty-six
- What's wrong? Everyone reaches that age

883
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,940
- You just got there first
- We're 36 too with our ages combined

884
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,980
Grab her

885
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,640
We're following you

886
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,480
I really look like a guy in this

887
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,660
- Rock star
- This looks nice

888
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,300
- Who can tell it's a woman?
- Only you can be seen

889
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,740
- I look nice in this too
- I went all out

890
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,980
Thank you for today, girls

891
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:55,660
But this moon cake...
Don't these candles come with the cake?

892
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,420
If there's a candle, there's a cake, right?

893
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,820
- Didn't you get the cake?
- I thought you were getting it

894
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,340
I don't have the money

895
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,740
You said you'd get it

896
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,260
- Why didn't you get it?
- I don't have the time

897
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,340
It's fine. It's the same
I like moon cakes too

898
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:16,260
Who knew she'd make
unreasonable requests at this age?

899
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,900
Why do you still want a cake?

900
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,500
- I'm flipping this table
- She still wants a cake

901
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:23,740
- A cake
- She wants a cake!

902
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:29,660
Happy birthday to you

903
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,980
Happy birthday to you

904
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,900
Happy birthday to you

905
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:45,420
Happy birthday to...

906
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,980
You!

907
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,420
- Lovely!
- Make a wish

908
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,140
- Quickly make a wish
- See the sign?

909
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,340
Read it out loud

910
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,900
"Love my Jia"

911
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:05,260
I hope this year, you'll find a good man
to stay by your side

912
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,420
To bicker with you and be really sweet

913
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,980
- Shut it
- Hurry up. Your turn

914
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,260
My turn. Nan Jia

915
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:18,180
Since you like making a fuss, I hope...

916
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:24,020
I hope this year, you'll find someone
who will bicker with you until you grow old

917
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,060
I'm stuffed. No more after this
I have to go on a diet

918
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,660
You're always going on about stuff like that

919
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,740
- You're not even fat
- What do you know?

920
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,020
I'm not just going on a diet
I'm getting Botox injection too

921
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:44,300
If that's not enough
I'll also get liposuction

922
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,100
- What has gotten into you?
- Don't be mean

923
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,660
If you live like me

924
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:52,819
I leave the house early
and get home late every day

925
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:56,420
I don't even join my colleagues for dinner
so that I can catch the last train

926
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,020
I walk into my neighborhood looking like this

927
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,560
I'm worried someone is following me
like a detective

928
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,300
I pretend to be a man when I order food
I'm not exaggerating

929
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,540
I answer the phone in a deep voice

930
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:12,540
If you lived like me
you wouldn't be thinking of those

931
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,580
You have persecutory delusions

932
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,979
Nan Jia lives alone too
Why isn't she afraid?

933
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,939
How can you compare our neighborhood?
Hers is great

934
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,060
I won't be staying there for long

935
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,779
Are you going bankrupt?

936
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:29,420
I'm planning to buy a house

937
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,180
- I shouldn't have asked
- You're buying a house?

938
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:36,500
Jing Jing used to convince me
but I thought it wasn't necessary

939
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,560
But I've changed my mind lately

940
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,180
The water leakage at my house
caused me so much trouble previously

941
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,180
So I thought, I should just buy it

942
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,899
Don't I always have a luggage packed at home?

943
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:50,979
I used to leave it there
when I had business trips

944
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,200
so that I didn't have to pack all the time

945
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,480
Now it's been there for ages

946
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,420
One day, I looked at it and thought

947
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,860
Is this really my home?

948
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,500
Hear that? What a sweet trouble

949
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,540
She's talking about buying a house
as if she's buying food

950
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,020
It burns a hole in my pocket too

951
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,660
I have things I want too
I'm just reluctant to spend the money

952
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,980
I'll just have more things to pack
when I move houses

953
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,940
You've bought enough stuff

954
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,780
If you buy some more
Shen Zi Chang will be crying

955
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,580
He should cry more
so that he gets a clear head

956
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,900
It's funny. Each of us
has our own problems to fret

957
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,700
I'm envious of you, you're envious of her
and she's envious of me

958
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,360
There's a saying by Haruki Murakami

959
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,500
"There's a kind of sadness in this world
that cannot be expressed in tears"

960
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,820
"You can't explain it to anyone"

961
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,000
"It remains the same forever"

962
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:00,000
"It settles quietly at the bottom of
your heart like snow in a windless night"

963
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:07,800
While you may disagree
you have no choice but to accept it

964
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,880
When you're unhappy with where you are
but can't find a way out

965
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,920
Anyone there? Your food is here

966
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,820
- Hello? Anyone there?
- Leave it at the door

967
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,940
Okay, I'll leave it here

968
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:33,400
When you're filled with worries
but unable to make changes

969
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:38,600
When anxiety becomes a norm
for every outlander

970
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,380
how are we supposed to complete
this mandatory lesson in life?

971
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,060
Is it mine? I wonder who it is

972
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,940
I'm talking to Gou Dan
I'm not listening to you

973
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:50,860
I'm talking to this person, not you

974
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,140
- Who's talking to you?
- I don't want to talk to you

975
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,540
I was talking to Gou Dan

976
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,540
Nan Jia, I've gotten the
bank transaction records you wanted

977
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,620
-We've got the transaction records?
- Yes

978
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,900
What are these for?

979
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,600
That's a lot

980
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,180
I think I know why Jing Jing was in debt
