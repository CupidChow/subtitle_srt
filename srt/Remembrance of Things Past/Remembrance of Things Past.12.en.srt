(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
- Wait a minute, sir!
- Sorry, I'm in a rush

3
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,720
Come on!

4
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,420
Girl, it's scorching hot
Why don't you take an umbrella?

5
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,579
Thanks, granny

6
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,579
No big deal

7
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,140
It's turned green
Let's go, I'll walk with you

8
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,220
(Episode 12: Meet Again)

9
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,620
Bundle yourself up

10
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,360
You've been keeping the leftovers

11
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,920
I've cleaned the fridge for you

12
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,300
- Stop eating leftovers
- Fasten the buttons

13
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,140
Also, don't feed the dog human foods

14
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,460
Look at its body size

15
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,780
Bye, Mo Mo

16
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,500
Say goodbye

17
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,240
What's up?

18
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
What's wrong?

19
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,740
Mr. San Jiang, Madam Dong Xue

20
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,700
I have an announcement to make

21
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,300
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

22
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,860
Say it, what is the issue?

23
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,100
I have a boyfriend

24
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,260
Really? You have a boyfriend?

25
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,460
-Why didn't you let us know earlier?
- Are you kidding us? Who is the guy?

26
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,420
It's Jian Yi Fan
the one who came to our house before

27
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,500
Jian Yi Fan?

28
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,200
Yes, when we went to Beijing

29
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,500
It's the director

30
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,820
Is that him? You should have told us

31
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,620
We just started dating back then. Also...

32
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,700
Many things were going on at home
so I planned to tell you later

33
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,560
Now, we've gone steady
That's why I am telling you

34
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,560
If you're okay with it
I'll bring him home this Spring Festival

35
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,480
- Sure
- Great

36
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,840
- That's great
- Mo Mo, you have a brother-in-law now

37
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,100
Come on, shake hands

38
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,140
Good girl

39
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,380
- I'm leaving then
- Mind how you go

40
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,060
Okay, I am leaving, be good

41
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Yan Yan

42
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,720
You have to control your temper
Don't pick fights for no reason

43
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,320
This is how a relationship is ruined
Don't follow my footsteps

44
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,180
Mom, I'm leaving, stop nagging at me

45
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,440
It's for the sake of you

46
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,480
After all, you're going to live
with Shen Zi Chang, not with me

47
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,260
Can't you say something good?
New Year's Day has just passed

48
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,460
Alright, I got it

49
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,620
How dare you call me naggy

50
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,780
Hello

51
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,900
It's me

52
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,800
Yes, I'm ready

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
Okay, goodbye

54
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,200
- Who was that?
- Nothing

55
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,540
- So, who was that?
- My colleague asked for my help

56
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,060
Is it your boyfriend?

57
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,540
Mom, come on. I've grown up
Why don't you get a partner?

58
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,740
I can be your advisor

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,180
Mind your own business

60
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,400
Have a safe trip. Why aren't they here yet?

61
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,680
- Here they are
- Here comes their car

62
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,760
- Aunt
- Hello, Aunt

63
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,720
- Hi
- Have you had your meal?

64
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,100
- Yes
- Hi, Aunt

65
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,140
- Can you do it, Yan?
- I can manage

66
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,380
- Aunt, you've lost weight
- Have I?

67
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,600
- You've lost some weight
- Lost some weight?

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,260
Both of you have to gain some weight too

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,900
- Don't worry
- I'm leaving, Mom

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,700
I'm leaving

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,060
- Give me a call when you reach home
- Got it, go home

72
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,340
- It's freezing outside
- I know

73
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,220
- Aunt, go up
- Bye

74
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,820
- I'm leaving, Mom
- Okay

75
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
Have a safe journey!

76
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,620
- Go up now
- Bye

77
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,120
Absolutely, it's for sure a yes!

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
Okay, it's a deal

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,480
I want to celebrate Spring Festival
in the northeast

80
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,240
After all, I am the son-in-law
of a northeastern family

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
When are you coming back?

82
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
In a few days

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,940
If that place is as fun as you described

84
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,460
and you really enjoy it, don't come back then

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,840
It's true. I must bring you here
when you're on leave next time

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,000
You wouldn't want to leave

87
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,640
Okay, let's make a trip there
when we're on leave

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,200
- Okay
- I have to hang up

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,960
I'll take a shower and then go to bed
I'm going to work tomorrow morning

90
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,840
- Bye
- Bye

91
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,060
Have you finished
showing off your relationship?

92
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Have a taste

93
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,500
Is this the bean you're bringing to COE?

94
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,100
Yes

95
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,260
- It's great
- It is, right?

96
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,960
Who would have thought
that you could really make it?

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
Do you regret it?

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,600
I asked you to come with me but you refused

99
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,740
Now, you're being a freeloader here

100
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,919
Isn't it time to consider
my suggestion just now?

101
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,560
Send the Spring Festival family banquet menu

102
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,680
to each of our important customers

103
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,340
Don't miss any of them

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,400
The ingredients like abalone, Hainanese capon

105
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,280
sea cucumber and yellow croaker
have to be ordered in advance

106
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,080
Ask the purchasing department
to update me every day

107
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,140
- You may get back to work
- Alright

108
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,740
(Ou Yang)

109
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,460
- What's up?
- Why don't you reply to my WeChat message?

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
Am I obliged to do so? Where are you?

111
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,760
I am at the airport

112
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
- What are you doing there?
- Well

113
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,340
Since you've been ignoring me
I might as well leave

114
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,880
- Are you fooling me?
- What?

115
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,180
You don't believe me?
Let me make a video call to you

116
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,420
Look, I'm already at the airport now

117
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,660
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking my luggage in a while

118
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,740
I'll hang up now, bye

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What does he mean?

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,340
Don't move, don't go anywhere
I'll be right there

121
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
What's up?

122
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,700
I was wrong, don't leave

123
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,580
- What's your fault?
- I was too full of myself

124
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm no longer young
but I pretended to be proud

125
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,620
You've done so many things for me
but I have been undecided

126
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,660
I've made up my mind, I won't do that anymore

127
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,520
I was wrong, I've made up my mind

128
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,940
Don't go, please

129
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,240
It's late, I just checked my luggage

130
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
Can you talk to the officer and get it back?

131
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,660
- I can't get it back
- Go and get it back

132
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,660
- Hold on
- Hurry up

133
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,320
I didn't check my luggage

134
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,580
I was kidding

135
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,380
Is something wrong with you?

136
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,940
Do you know how many traffic lights I ran?
Is there something wrong with you?

137
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,940
-Don't be mad
- Is it fun to fool me?

138
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,380
I didn't fool you, it was a joke
You've ignored me for a few days

139
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,860
- Are you sick?
- Wait

140
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,180
- Get off
- Wait

141
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,420
- Is it fun to fool me?
- I didn't fool you

142
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,220
I really have business here
I am picking up my mom, she's coming back

143
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,420
She's not going to a quarantine hotel
but waiting for you to pick her up?

144
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,540
Are you here for nothing?

145
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,440
You're right on the money
I'm here for nothing

146
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,520
But my mom said I have to
bring flowers here, no matter what

147
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,580
This is the sense of occasion
It is what my family has been doing

148
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,380
My dad has been doing this. He'll arrive
at the airport early with a bouquet

149
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,080
My dad spoiled my mom, I can't help it
He pampers her

150
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,980
But I can guarantee that
I'll pamper you more if you accept me

151
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,300
You win. What was I doing?

152
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,300
I have no more dignity

153
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,200
Listen to me, Ji Nan Jia

154
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,360
What I told you before

155
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,960
are the words of my heart

156
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
It's true

157
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,840
Look, you came all the way here

158
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
You were afraid that I'd leave

159
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,880
Weren't you afraid

160
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,060
that our relationship
would come to an end if I left?

161
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,700
So you have feelings for me

162
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,620
Right?

163
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,460
What do you think?

164
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,500
Yes, yes!

165
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,380
What's wrong with you?

166
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
I really am...

167
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,700
Come on!

168
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
Have you resigned?

169
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,860
I am asking you!

170
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,900
I've talked to Sai Wen
I won't leave before I hand over my duties

171
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,100
- Maybe...
- Why?

172
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,940
I want a new working environment

173
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,960
Why didn't you tell me?

174
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,860
We had a talk before you got
on the plane. Everything was fine

175
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,260
You had plenty of time to tell me
Why didn't you tell me?

176
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,220
I looked for you
as soon as I got to the office

177
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,320
I even went to the rooftop for you
The dumplings I made have turned soggy!

178
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,640
- Qiao Qiao, calm down
- Questions were thrown at me when I arrived

179
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,780
They asked if I knew about your resignation
and I didn't know what to answer

180
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,040
I planned to tell you after the handovers

181
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,740
What else do you want to tell me?

182
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,700
Why do you have so many things to tell?

183
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,680
Would you like to go to Yunnan with me?

184
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,120
Mu Mu told me about
his coffee plantation before

185
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,420
I didn't take it to heart

186
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,580
But after my visit to Yunnan
I think there are bright prospects

187
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,560
Most importantly, there's no plots
and time cost as in those big companies

188
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,340
I'll have more room to play to my strengths

189
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,820
Must it be Yunnan?

190
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,960
In fact, I'll have to travel around
to open up the market for half of the time

191
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,500
For the rest of the time, I'll stay
in Yunnan and conduct R&D with Mu Mu

192
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,580
I get it

193
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,220
In other words, except for
your occasional business trips to Beijing

194
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,260
we'll rarely meet each other, right?

195
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,160
- That's why I asked you...
- No

196
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,780
Jian Yi Fan

197
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,599
When you made these decisions
you didn't even think about me

198
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,839
If you discussed with me
before making the decision

199
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,170
I might've given it a thought

200
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,780
A relationship involves two people

201
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,339
You didn't give me a choice at all

202
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,160
You are just informing me

203
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Qiao Qiao

204
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
One dot

205
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Five characters

206
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Five dots, she threw out five dots

207
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Two characters

208
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,340
Are you throwing it?

209
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,340
Yes. Why have you been
in a sulk after the breakup?

210
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,020
- Four bamboos
- I won, I got seven pairs

211
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,700
Double reach, full flush, straight

212
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,020
- Come on
- Wait a minute

213
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,860
What's up?

214
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,820
You

215
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,760
What's going on
between you and Shen Zi Chang?

216
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,380
What's going on? That's what it's all about

217
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,460
He didn't call me since I was back
He probably wants to break up with me

218
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,740
Don't worry, you will get a better one

219
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,940
Shut up if you don't know what to say

220
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,460
You, the one chanting with Buddha beads

221
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,820
What's the matter with you?

222
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,840
This helps to calm my mind

223
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,580
- Are you feeling calm now?
- Quite good

224
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,940
Are you really going to have
a long-distance relationship? It's dangerous

225
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
Let it be

226
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,220
It doesn't matter. Just leave it to fate

227
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,840
Do you really want a breakup?

228
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
What is the big deal?

229
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,740
Go to him and talk things out
Everything can be settled

230
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,380
What should I talk to him?

231
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,660
He doesn't respect me
It's such an important decision

232
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
He didn't even discuss with me

233
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,940
Would I stop him from leaving?
Am I that kind of person?

234
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,620
And now, he just gave me a notice

235
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,900
I was unhappy and he asked me to go with him

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,300
I don't know anyone there, what for?
What if I miss you?

237
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,100
- Well, I do have a few buddies in Yunnan...
- Perhaps you should keep quiet

238
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,420
No, I just don't understand

239
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,180
What's bad about Beijing?
Why can't he settle down here?

240
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,980
- Exactly
- Nothing is good

241
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,660
Whether Beijing is good or bad
just don't regret your decisions

242
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,500
- Can you give it to me?
- Wishful thinking

243
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,620
What are you doing here?
Why are you still here?

244
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,580
- No, why can't I...
- Yes, the mahjong game is over

245
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,940
Why are you still here
the mahjong backup man?

246
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
Who is the backup man?

247
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,220
Listen, I am the protagonist today
I am the superstar

248
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,180
- What?
- Superstar

249
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,260
- Well...
- Next

250
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Here's the thing

251
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,380
I actually wanted to make
a small private announcement today

252
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,220
But it looks like you're not in a good mood

253
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,380
- I think I can tell you some other day
- Tell them today

254
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,540
- They are your friends, you should tell them
- I'll put it simple

255
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,380
I know, you're in a relationship

256
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,380
Do you have to be so modest in this?

257
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,340
He's been courting you for so long

258
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,980
Do you think we're as blind as you?

259
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,860
No, aren't you surprised?

260
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
- She wants us to be surprised
- Be surprised

261
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,940
Serves you right for having breakups!

262
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,100
I dare you to say that again!

263
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,260
No. I mean
I cared about your feelings, okay?

264
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,300
I didn't tell it because you're unhappy

265
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,540
- Hey!
- Show her that we're surprised

266
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,420
What attitude is this?
Come on, I've got a boyfriend

267
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,940
- You're dating! Oh my goodness!
- The two of them!

268
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,540
- Did you know about this?
- No, I didn't know! They're dating?

269
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,340
- My goodness!
- The two of them!

270
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,460
When was it?

271
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,420
-I failed to realize it
- It wasn't obvious to me either

272
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,180
Did you just add each other on WeChat?

273
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,500
What kind of friends are these?

274
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,940
We? Oh, my!

275
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,860
Grow old together!

276
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,860
- Happiness forever! Get a child soon!
- Get a bun in the oven soon!

277
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,460
We almost burst into tears
and you forced us to congratulate you

278
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,900
- That's a late-life love
- She said she didn't want to tell

279
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,780
A late-life love!

280
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,060
Get out!

281
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
(Remembrance of Things Past)

282
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,820
What are you laughing at?

283
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Are you nervous?

284
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,460
Who is nervous? What for?
I'm not an ignorant girl

285
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,500
- I have to go back to the company
- Wait, don't!

286
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,020
What's up? Are you scared?

287
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,860
Come here, listen

288
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,740
I've shown my mom all your photos
Don't worry, she knows you inside out

289
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,980
Why did you show her my photos?
I'll be doomed

290
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,620
I don't look good in photos!

291
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,700
Sounds like you have a point

292
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,260
No, I've told my mom everything about us

293
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,900
She knows you well, don't be nervous

294
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,180
Did your mom have any comments about me?

295
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,580
Sure

296
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,730
She said I've gained fluency
in the northeastern dialect

297
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,700
and I'm good at using
northwestern slangs after being with you

298
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,900
Alright, don't be nervous

299
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,540
- Mom!
- Son!

300
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,540
Here, Dad specially
asked me to bring it to you

301
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,660
Well, at least you didn't forget about me

302
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,220
My husband always treats me well

303
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,820
Does your son ill-treat you?

304
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,340
Let's go

305
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,980
Mom, be careful

306
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,020
Mom, let me introduce her
She's my girlfriend, Ji Nan Jia

307
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,500
Hi, Aunt...

308
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,020
Call me Ada

309
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,660
- Everyone calls me that
- Welcome back, Ada

310
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,940
- Thank you
- Well, let's not stand here! Mom

311
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,340
Nan Jia booked a restaurant
to welcome you, let's go now

312
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,420
Let's go

313
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,100
Let's eat at home

314
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,420
- This...
- I've been having hotel food for so long

315
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,180
How about going to your house?

316
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,060
You don't mind it, do you?

317
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,620
- No problem
- Sure, let's go

318
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,140
- Okay
- Get in the car

319
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,180
Alright

320
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,940
Let's go, dear!

321
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,900
Mom, you finally answered my call

322
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,660
What have you been doing?
You didn't pick my calls

323
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,300
My phone is sometimes not with me
and I didn't hear it

324
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,940
- What's the matter?
- I have a good news to share with you

325
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,480
My supervisor has recently been transferred

326
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,780
He nominated me. I may get a promotion!

327
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Really?

328
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,760
You have to work hard then

329
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,800
But will your workload increase
after the promotion?

330
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,260
That's no big deal
My salary will increase as well

331
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,300
Alright

332
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
Where are you?

333
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm outside

334
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,020
Where?

335
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,540
- Are you in the hospital?
- Well...

336
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,340
A colleague of mine is hospitalized
I'm here to pay him a visit

337
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,440
- Who is it?
- You don't know the person

338
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Move your phone and show me

339
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,080
- What's up?
- I want to see who is it

340
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,780
Bed Six, where are you?

341
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,420
- Yes
- It's time to take medicine

342
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,900
Okay, I'll be right back

343
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,980
Mom

344
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,340
You are in the hospital. What's the matter?

345
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,820
- What happened?
- It's nothing serious

346
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,300
What do you mean by nothing serious? Tell me!

347
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,260
Well

348
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Something grew on my liver
and I had a minor operation

349
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,800
You had an operation
and you said it's nothing serious?

350
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,680
What's the matter with you?
Why did you hide it from me?

351
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,280
It was before New Year's Day

352
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,420
I wanted to have the operation done
but you were coming back

353
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,620
So I did it after you left

354
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,660
Fine, stop talking

355
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm going to book a ticket now

356
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,540
No, what for? It's done

357
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,120
It's a cyst, not a tumor

358
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,520
Don't come back, why do you
have to make yourself exhausted?

359
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,980
Don't miss your work

360
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,840
How could you hide
such a serious matter from me?

361
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,700
I didn't want to worry you

362
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,280
Also, what's the point of telling you?
You are not a doctor

363
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
Who has been taking care of you
after your operation?

364
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,180
Your aunt is here

365
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,620
Our colleagues are also here

366
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,860
I'll be discharged in two days

367
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,040
I'm feeling good. I look spirited, right?

368
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Mom

369
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,460
Sorry

370
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,760
Stop crying

371
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,300
Okay, get back to your work
Work hard and that will ease my mind

372
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,420
- Nan Jia, thank you
- You're welcome

373
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,860
You should stay a few more days
We'll show you around

374
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,540
I won't say I know Beijing well
but I do know some nice restaurants here

375
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,280
I heard from Ou Yang
that you often travel for business

376
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,840
Do you usually go on
domestic or overseas business trips?

377
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I used to run an import-export business
so I traveled abroad often

378
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,080
Then, I switched to event planning

379
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,200
I had to go abroad to source ingredients
in the beginning

380
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,860
But I've reduced the business trip volume
in the past few years

381
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
First, the supply chain has stabilized
so I don't have to be there personally

382
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,880
Besides, there are now local alternatives
of those high-end ingredients

383
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,240
- So I don't have to travel
- That's great

384
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,920
Mom, how long are you
going to stay this time?

385
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,760
I plan to stay longer this time

386
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
I want to sell your grandparent's house

387
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,180
- Their house?
- Yes

388
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,580
I didn't hear it from them. What do you mean?

389
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,600
I discussed with your dad
Your grandparents are aging now

390
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,240
- Yeah
- We decided to bring them abroad

391
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,740
- so that we can look after them
- Are you kidding?

392
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,960
They would have been abroad
if they were willing to

393
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,440
- They definitely won't agree
- That's why

394
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,560
this is the mission of my return this time

395
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,120
I'll do everything I can to convince them

396
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,600
They are still in the pink of health now

397
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,720
Besides, I'm here
if they need care and support

398
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,560
Do you think you will still stay in Beijing
if I bring your grandparents abroad?

399
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,420
Wait

400
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,340
What do you mean?

401
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,960
Didn't we agree that I am my own man?

402
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,680
How many years have you been
making your own decisions?

403
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,320
What is your achievement so far?
You are just an assistant

404
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,940
You might as well go abroad with me

405
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,780
My answer is no!

406
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,880
Nan Jia, please don't get me wrong

407
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,760
- I didn't mean to separate you
- I know

408
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,760
If you are okay with it, I hope you
and Ou Yang will go abroad with us

409
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,320
I have considered it before

410
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,640
In fact, your industry

411
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,480
has bright prospects in overseas

412
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,000
You are now
selling foreign products to the Chinese

413
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,360
You can also sell Chinese ingredients
to the foreigners when you are there

414
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,720
It's the same

415
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,820
It's kind of out of the blue
I haven't thought about that

416
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,380
I understand
You can take your time to think about it

417
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,960
Anyway, I have lots of things
to be dealt with

418
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Okay

419
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,460
Son

420
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,520
You were playful and that was fine

421
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,520
Now, you have a girlfriend

422
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,600
You have to plan for your future

423
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,660
(Jian)

424
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,100
Yes, Mr. Jian

425
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,380
Okay

426
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,020
Xi Chen!

427
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,500
Mr. Jian asked you to go to the rooftop
to discuss the Spring Festival event

428
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,820
I...

429
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,060
I'll be there in a minute. Thank you

430
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,260
Yes, Mr. Jian
She said she'll be there in a minute

431
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,260
Xi Chen!

432
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,420
Why are you still here?

433
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,180
I was getting the documents ready
I'm going now

434
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,360
What is he up to?
He asked me to come here but he is not here

435
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Jian Yi Fan

436
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Jian Yi Fan!

437
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,040
I don't have time to play with you!

438
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm leaving if you don't show up!

439
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,900
(To Qiao Qiao)

440
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,680
Listen, I don't have time to play with you

441
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,420
I'm leaving if you don't show up! Goodbye!

442
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,520
I brought you a gift from Yunnan

443
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,020
That's it?

444
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,200
I picked them on my own
There's a message that I want to tell you

445
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,820
- You can just tell me now
- Go back and open it

446
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,900
I don't have time to open it
You're going to Yunnan anyway

447
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,420
You can grow as many
beans as you want every day

448
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,480
I know you are mad, but can you listen to me?

449
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,800
What else do you want to say?
You have resigned and you're going to Yunnan

450
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,640
Growing up, my parents trained me
to be independent

451
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,840
Whether it's going to school
or choosing a job

452
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,720
I'd only tell them after making the decisions

453
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,840
- They never interfere
- So, you think I'm interfering?

454
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Of course not

455
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,960
I mean I was wrong

456
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
I should have discussed with you
before I resigned

457
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,280
But there is one thing
you have really got me wrong

458
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
I haven't decided to go to Yunnan yet

459
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,420
I must have your consent
before I make such a decision

460
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,440
You have resigned and you're telling me
it isn't because you want to go to Yunnan?

461
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,980
- That's not the reason I resigned
- Then, what's the reason?

462
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,200
It's because if I don't resign
you would have to leave

463
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,940
What do you mean?

464
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Let me tell you the truth

465
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,639
It's from Old President Han, not from me

466
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,000
After what Jiang Hao did

467
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,000
Old President Han is very sensitive about

468
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,560
these relationships in the company

469
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,960
Both of you are in the marketing
department and you're her boss

470
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,139
And she is the second group's leader now

471
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,440
Old President Han wants
to avoid even the slightest risk

472
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,820
After all, he doesn't trust me

473
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,800
and thinks I'll groom my own people
in the department like Jiang Hao

474
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,400
I don't think so

475
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,960
Instead, it may not be bad news
for you and Qiao Xi Chen

476
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,440
There are many good companies out there

477
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,420
I can write a recommendation letter for her

478
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,020
Besides, I know a lot of headhunters

479
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,060
- With Qiao Xi Chen's abilities...
- I got it

480
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,720
I understand President Han's concerns

481
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,920
and also respect the decision of the company

482
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,520
- That's right!
- Qiao Xi Chen will stay and I'll leave

483
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,120
I had a talk with Old President Han
before I went to Yunnan

484
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,160
I started the resignation process
after coming back

485
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Are you out of your mind?
Your position is higher than mine

486
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,740
I should be the one who leaves

487
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,580
You could have discussed with me

488
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,320
I wanted to leave after Lu Yi Ning's incident

489
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,940
But if I left like that
I'd carry the bad name forever

490
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,140
That's why I stayed

491
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,780
When Sai Wen told me

492
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,120
that one of us must leave Yann Coffee

493
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,180
I was convinced that it was God's will

494
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,900
God's will? Why don't you say
God sends you a message in your dream?

495
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,180
You're teasing me now
It means you aren't angry anymore

496
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm still angry

497
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,240
Well, I wronged you about the resignation

498
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,020
But I don't want any of us to
sacrifice ourselves in this relationship

499
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,460
Everything can be discussed
What about going to Yunnan?

500
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,540
I haven't decided to go to Yunnan yet

501
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,800
If you don't believe me, I can call Mu Mu
and you may ask him

502
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,840
I don't want to ask him
I just want to get the answer from you

503
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,880
Jian Yi Fan

504
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,400
You really want to go to Yunnan, don't you?

505
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I've thought a lot during this trip to Yunnan

506
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,640
I realized that
the life there suits me better

507
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,420
There's no long working hours
no haze and no traffic jam

508
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,340
Besides, I can do the thing I enjoy

509
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,260
There are no people
like Lu Yi Ning and Jiang Hao

510
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,980
I think we will enjoy our life in Yunnan

511
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,540
But I haven't thought about leaving Beijing

512
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,380
Yunnan is so far away

513
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,840
You can think about it

514
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,120
But I hope you will take this as an option

515
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Alright?

516
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,740
Xiao Yi, help me order some food delivery

517
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,260
Hi, Madam Ji. Your food is here

518
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,380
It's okay

519
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,980
Why are you so free?

520
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,800
It's almost the Spring Festival
There's nothing much to do at our company

521
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,140
What's more, Mr. Jian is leaving
What do you think I can do as his assistant?

522
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,220
You should spend more time
with your mom. She's finally back

523
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,320
Don't take my mom's words to heart

524
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,960
I'll never leave with her

525
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,800
Let alone my grandparents
She was just talking nonsense

526
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
What if your mom insists?

527
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,740
- That's why I come to you
- Why do you come to me?

528
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,900
Madam Ji Nan Jia, this is a serious question

529
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,480
Would you like to go abroad with me?

530
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,980
It's such a difficult question

531
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,760
No. I can't go with you

532
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,060
My career is here

533
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,000
My family and friends are all here
I can't just leave them behind

534
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Yes

535
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,140
I expected this answer
but it still breaks my heart to hear it

536
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,040
That's because I don't give you a fake hope

537
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,180
That's why I like you

538
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,500
Let me tell you seriously

539
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,740
Even if I have to go

540
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,090
I won't have the heart to part with you

541
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,780
Don't worry. I fell in love with Beijing
since my parents brought me back

542
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,680
to visit my grandparents when I was 14

543
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,200
It's been my home over the years

544
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,520
Beijing is my home. I will never leave

545
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,040
However, my mom is quite a difficult person

546
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,180
So, you have to help me

547
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,020
Let me think about it

548
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,100
We are in the company

549
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,380
Eat it, it's becoming soggy

550
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Dear

551
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,860
I want to ask you a question

552
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,500
Do you feel

553
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,480
lack of sense of security
when you're with me?

554
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,040
What are you laughing at?

555
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,060
Let me guess

556
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,420
- What did your mom say to you again?
- No

557
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,880
She didn't. I'm just thinking about it

558
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,360
If I were a girl and found a young man

559
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,820
who is just a small assistant

560
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,040
I can't even see my own future yet
let alone our future

561
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,180
What do you think our future will be?

562
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,580
To be honest

563
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,580
I haven't thought about that

564
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,300
Well, listen carefully

565
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,460
I don't need you
to give me a sense of security

566
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,080
I can give it to myself if I need it

567
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
So you just have to be relaxed
and be yourself when you're with me

568
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,980
- You deserve another kiss
- Why do you kiss me every day?

569
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,180
I'm leaving! I'll get a tape!

570
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,260
Stop eating. Let's go to hospital

571
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,100
(Remembrance of Things Past)

572
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,680
Why did you ask me to come here?

573
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,200
That's what I said when I first came here
This way

574
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,740
Uncle Wei!

575
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,060
- I don't have any persimmons today
- I'm not buying persimmons

576
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,680
Can you pick some roseheart radishes for us?

577
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,020
You'll never learn anything good from him
Both of you always want the best

578
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Thank you

579
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,220
Can you peel them for us?
We are going to eat in the car

580
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,680
- Why are you so troublesome?
- Am I more troublesome than him?

581
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,060
Try it

582
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,820
Ou Yang said this has been
his favorite since childhood

583
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,820
It was given by his grandma
so I guess you like it too

584
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
I really miss the taste

585
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,200
When I was a child, during winter

586
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,900
my mom would peel its skin
to make cold dishes

587
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,240
Then, we'd have the radish as fruit

588
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,020
The standard of living has become better now
All sorts of fruits are available

589
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,340
No one even thinks of eating this

590
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,040
It still tastes the same

591
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,600
You didn't ask me out
just to let me taste this, right?

592
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,020
Enjoy it. Let me show you another place

593
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,820
I'm looking forward to it

594
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,600
We reminisced my childhood just now

595
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,160
Now, you're showing me the city

596
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,620
Let me guess

597
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
You are trying to persuade me
not to take Ou Yang away

598
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,120
No wonder Ou Yang is smart
It's in your genes

599
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,520
Buttering me up won't do the trick

600
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,320
I won't change my mind

601
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,380
I'm not trying to budge you

602
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,940
However, I'm pretty sure
that even though you want him to leave

603
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,400
as long as he refuses to go

604
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,720
you have no way to force him

605
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,200
That's a harsh truth

606
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,720
Do you want to know
why I chose to stay in Beijing?

607
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,060
Of course I do

608
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,280
For outlanders like myself

609
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,080
when we first came to Beijing

610
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,000
we probably share the same
thought when you went abroad

611
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,160
I studied and graduated here

612
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,680
I worked, got promotions and increments
And eventually started my own business

613
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,360
This place has given me the opportunity
to pursue my dream

614
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,160
and broaden my horizons

615
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,220
It has convinced me that

616
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,360
as long as you are capable
and hardworking, you will live a good life

617
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,800
Of course I used to be anxious

618
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,720
There are too many competitors
and the pressure is huge

619
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,600
However, the best thing in my life
over the past 36 years is

620
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,900
I didn't run away

621
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,160
not even in the most difficult times

622
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,600
This city is so tolerant that

623
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,740
it helps me to find the courage
to believe in myself

624
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,000
The best has come to me

625
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,480
whether in my career or relationship

626
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,420
How can I possibly leave such a place?

627
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,360
I understand what you said

628
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,600
But Ou Yang is different from you

629
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,080
His dad and I brought him back
to visit our relatives

630
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,080
Who knew he'll refuse to leave after that

631
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,420
We had no choice
but to let him study in Beijing

632
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,960
He was young
so it's fine to be a little playful

633
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,640
However, he's a grown-up now
He can't be playful for life

634
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,480
To be honest, we are not a rich family

635
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,840
He has to work hard for his future

636
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,400
What opportunity will he get
if he stays in Beijing?

637
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,880
How could you be sure that he can
get an opportunity if he goes abroad?

638
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,760
Or what do you think an opportunity is?

639
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,440
Ou Yang took me to the store we went just now

640
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,360
I was in dire need of persimmons

641
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
But I couldn't find any
and I was so distressed

642
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,700
In the end, he helped me
get the persimmons effortlessly

643
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,790
I've been in this industry
for more than a decade

644
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,160
I believe I am an expert
in sourcing ingredients

645
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,680
Who knows he was the one who found it

646
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,560
I realized that he knows
this city in a very different way

647
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,640
He doesn't get to know the city
for any motives. He just likes it

648
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,300
I told you

649
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,200
he won't leave with you
not because I have faith in myself

650
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,280
but in him

651
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,000
I have faith in his love for this place

652
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,240
In fact

653
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,040
Ou Yang is more mature than you think

654
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,240
He knows what he wants

655
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,220
Look at Beijing now

656
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,460
It's surely different from
the way it was when you left

657
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,860
Beijing is quite a good place

658
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,280
There are traditional Hutongs

659
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,460
as well as high-rise
commercial areas and CBDs

660
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,820
There's everything here
that you can find in overseas

661
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,440
However, what do we have here

662
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,540
you may not find them abroad

663
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,440
including job opportunities

664
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,820
If you really care about Ou Yang

665
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,320
you should have faith in him and let him try

666
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,400
Maybe he is still a playful kid in your heart

667
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,160
But he is a reliable man to me

668
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,900
I think I know

669
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,740
the reason Ou Yang fell for you

670
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,100
Shen Zi Chang

671
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,560
I know you don't want to see me

672
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,180
But I promise
this is the last time I disturb you

673
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,920
I'll wait for you
at the basketball court at 3 pm

674
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,900
What kind of look is this?

675
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,780
- Are you a rich young master?
- How do I look?

676
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,180
From where did you get the car?

677
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,580
This was my friend's car
The price was affordable, so I bought it

678
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,380
What makes you think of buying a car?

679
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,260
So I can pick you up even during winter

680
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,340
I want to give you a warm harbor

681
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,060
I have to thank you this time

682
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,580
My mom said she respects my decision

683
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,140
I know you'll never fail

684
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,420
At least you're grateful

685
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,420
Please get in the car

686
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,300
Excuse me!

687
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,480
Can you tell me where the field is?

688
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,700
- You're not a student here, right?
- I'm not

689
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,120
But my buddy is
We're going to play football together

690
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,860
Follow me then

691
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,220
- I'm on the way there
- Follow you? Okay

692
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,340
Baby, sorry! I didn't expect
we would play extra time

693
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,060
I have been waiting
for more than half an hour!

694
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,600
My poor baby

695
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,620
Are you hungry? Come on
Let me give you a kiss

696
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,820
Go away!

697
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,060
Just one kiss

698
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,660
- You'll be happy after a kiss
- No

699
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,980
- Don't follow me!
- Don't run. Come on!

700
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,160
♫ You are my little star ♫

701
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,520
♫ Shining bright in the sky ♫

702
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,240
♫ I have decided to love you ♫

703
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,100
♫ I won't give up easily ♫

704
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,360
♫ Bottle containing my wishes
drifting on the sea ♫

705
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,600
♫ Every wish made is for you ♫

706
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,360
♫ Even if we can't be together ♫

707
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,760
♫ I still care about you ♫

708
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,120
♫ The weather outside the window ♫

709
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,680
♫ Is changing like your mind ♫

710
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:55,200
♫ If this is the end
I hope you are satisfied ♫

711
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,360
♫ You are my little star ♫

712
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,860
♫ Shining bright in the sky ♫

713
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,940
Sorry

714
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,940
I'm sorry

715
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,500
I'm sorry

716
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,940
Do you still remember this outfit?

717
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,760
You worn it when
you confessed your feelings to me

718
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,080
You danced The Little Stars in public

719
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,300
And you would wear it

720
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,590
every time when you
apologize to me after our fights

721
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,440
I was thinking that
I'd be the happiest person

722
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,060
if this man could love me like this

723
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,080
for the rest of my life

724
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,020
- Xu Yan, I...
- Shh

725
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,580
Shh

726
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:54,400
I'm afraid I will regret if you interrupt me

727
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Shen Zi Chang

728
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,720
Let's...

729
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,520
Let's...

730
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,740
Let's break up

731
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,920
I know you already have this in mind
even if I don't bring it up

732
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,480
So don't flatter yourself that I'm here today

733
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:25,100
I'm not pestering you or not letting you go

734
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,420
I just want to tell you that

735
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,220
falling for you

736
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,020
is something

737
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,740
that I will never regret in my life

738
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,180
Thank you for treating me so well

739
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,220
Thank you for loving me

740
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,220
Thank you

741
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,820
for always staying by my side

742
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,260
Even after breaking up
I want to leave us a wonderful memory

743
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,400
I know you will fall in love
with someone else

744
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,860
But can you not

745
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,020
forget me so soon?

746
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,680
That's it

747
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,420
Xu Yan

748
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,880
I'm sorry

749
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,520
I don't know how things
have come to this stage

750
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,500
I like you

751
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,940
But I don't know why we can't be together

752
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,360
You don't have to say sorry

753
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,300
We...

754
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,620
We...

755
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,900
We...

756
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,340
We have tried very hard, haven't we?

757
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,500
Although we're meeting for the last time

758
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,540
I'll stop crying

759
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,140
We will never see each other again

760
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,500
I hope that both of us will cheer up

761
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,980
It's quite heavy

762
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,180
I'm leaving

763
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,340
(I don't want to part with you)

764
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,860
Are you okay? Don't act tough

765
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,300
I don't want to carry you home again

766
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,820
You're heavy

767
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,940
You won't get to do that often anymore

768
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:56,140
Are you going to give me an answer today?

769
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,500
Alright!

770
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,240
I'm listening

771
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,580
Jian Yi Fan, I like you

772
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,780
I know

773
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,400
But I can't leave with you

774
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,940
I've guessed it

775
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,880
I've visited many places the past few days

776
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,780
I didn't realize
that I have a lot of memories in Beijing

777
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,460
Sometimes, I find that Beijing
is too big that it feels creepy

778
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,920
But lately, I find that it's small

779
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,600
At least I can hold it in my heart

780
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,400
I feel quite at ease here

781
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,880
and it's comfortable

782
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,560
I have my career and friends here
so I don't want to leave

783
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,560
It doesn't matter. I can stay
if you don't want to leave

784
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,080
Let me ask you a question

785
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,360
Why do you want to go to Yunnan so badly?

786
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,960
There are a lot of things
I want to do in Yunnan

787
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,520
Whether it's Yann Coffee or anywhere else

788
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,520
I'm helping others build their brands

789
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,660
I want to have my own coffee brand
It sounds cool, doesn't it?

790
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:39,900
Yes

791
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,700
I've never seen your eyes
sparkling with excitement like now

792
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,380
when you talk about
the projects in Yann Coffee

793
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,060
You should go

794
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,300
I know I should

795
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,820
- But we...
- It doesn't matter

796
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,060
It's true

797
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,840
Think about it. You want to go to Yunnan
just like I want to stay in Beijing

798
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,300
I don't want to make you choose
between me and your dream

799
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,460
I don't want any compromise and grievance
in our relationship

800
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,220
It's not cool at all, right?

801
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,340
Also, I have never been
in a long-distance relationship before

802
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,900
Maybe you'll come back after a few days
if you find it boring

803
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,620
Or maybe I will change my mind and go to you

804
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,940
Everything is possible

805
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,660
We are still young

806
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,660
The world is your oyster

807
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:41,260
We can give everything a try, right?

808
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:42,940
Right

809
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,420
Qiao Xi Chen is always right

810
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,360
I told you before that
I couldn't imagine what a home is

811
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,660
But after meeting you, I wish to have a home

812
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,580
I will miss you

813
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,860
Me too

814
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,200
Have a pleasant journey

815
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,620
Here we are!

816
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,220
- It looks good
- Just come with me

817
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,920
What's going on?

818
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,140
The business of the best cafe in Beijing
isn't well. There's no one here. Boss!

819
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,260
- Nobody is here. Let's go
- Wait!

820
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,380
I promised to serve you the best coffee today

821
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,500
But there's no one here

822
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,820
Here. Have a taste

823
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,140
See if it is okay

824
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,660
How is it?

825
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,860
You're really something

826
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,420
I can do many things
This has been my favorite thing to do

827
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,500
Even Jian Yi Fan said that
I'm talented to be a barista

828
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,500
Go and learn it if you really like it
Get a certificate

829
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,240
I have already registered for it

830
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,020
- Looks like you're serious about it
- Also...

831
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,940
This shop belonged to my friend

832
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,660
Now, it's mine, just like the car

833
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,300
I still remember

834
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,860
you told me that

835
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,140
you don't need me
to give you a sense of security

836
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,300
But I want to give it to you

837
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,260
My mom got a point

838
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,720
I just want to tell you

839
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,740
no matter what I used to be

840
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,700
from now on

841
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,120
I have a plan for our future

842
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,540
Yes. It's a second-hand car

843
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,620
and I just took over the shop

844
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,420
But this is not only the career I dream of

845
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,100
It is also my promise to you

846
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,300
Are you really leaving?

847
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,460
Yes

848
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,620
It's time to leave

849
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:16,060
I didn't expect that
you'd be the first one going back

850
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:22,420
I often said that I wanted to go back
but I'm still here

851
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,300
I always thought that leaving here

852
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,140
means that I've lost
But thinking of it again

853
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,380
who says that?

854
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:32,900
It's pretty good

855
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,620
You are really brave

856
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,660
Look, it's Beijing

857
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,680
How I wish to stay here

858
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,860
The buildings are tall and big
There is everything inside

859
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,620
I was desperate to stay here

860
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,460
But then

861
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,900
when the person that I've been relying on

862
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,640
is gone, I feel...

863
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,340
Oh, right!

864
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:03,980
When I was back in Bai Shan
I could get everything I wanted

865
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,060
And my mom is there
No one cares about the bag that I carry

866
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,100
I feel at ease and happy

867
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,480
Everyone is trying so hard to work
in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou

868
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,860
Why do they want to come here?
Don't they want to succeed?

869
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,100
What is success?

870
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:26,100
Everyone yearns for a stable and warm life

871
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,900
This is success

872
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,680
You have your loved ones

873
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,500
your family, relatives, friends

874
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,660
and the things you want to do
All of these will make a warm life

875
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,520
Although I never think about leaving Beijing

876
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,380
I support your decision

877
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,100
You have all my support

878
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,660
Me too

879
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,140
But...

880
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
I will miss you

881
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,700
All good things must come to an end

882
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:25,020
But our friendship will last
as long as you want it

883
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,340
No matter how far we are from each other

884
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,240
both of you will always be my little sisters

885
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:34,940
You are wrong

886
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,900
It's three of us

887
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,820
That's right

888
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,820
Three of us

889
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,740
- What's wrong with you?
- The three of you

890
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,220
Come on, cheers

891
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,860
(One year later)

892
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,980
I never visited the Great Wall
when I was in Beijing

893
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,620
But I came here after leaving Beijing instead

894
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,780
Aren't we all like this?
We are pushed to move forward

895
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,260
We always think that we still have time

896
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,820
and we can make up for the regrets

897
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,180
But sometimes, it's gone when we missed it

898
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,020
- Most importantly, I have you
- From whom did you learn this?

899
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,140
Hey! The two at the back
Can't you walk any faster?

900
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,420
We're giving you room for a private chat

901
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,880
Go ahead

902
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,420
I'm coming!

903
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,060
- How is it, Jian? When are you leaving?
- Brother Jian

904
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,460
I have to leave the day after tomorrow
A client wants to inspect the plantation

905
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,980
Let me ask you this
Did you tell Chang that you came back?

906
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,420
What for? We have broken up

907
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,180
I've made up my mind. I'll not rely on anyone

908
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,380
I'll rely on myself
to buy a big house and a big car

909
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,660
Good for you. I'll rely on you
when I go back to hometown

910
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,660
You should have done so

911
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,220
Stop talking nonsense

912
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,939
Run slowly!

913
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,460
It's magnificent

914
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,779
It's all covered with fog

915
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:33,100
Jing Jing used to say that she wanted to
visit the Great Wall, but she never made it

916
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,420
We've accomplished her dream

917
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:40,120
Say it here if you have anything to tell her

918
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,700
I'll go first

919
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,220
Jing Jing, how are you?

920
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,779
It's been a year since you left us

921
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:54,620
Everyone has changed a lot after a year

922
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,620
I'm doing well, so are Xu Yan and Nan Jia

923
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,220
It'd be better if you were here

924
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,540
Jing Jing, I miss you

925
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,460
I miss you so much!

926
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,140
My turn

927
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,140
Hu Jing Jing!

928
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,779
I'm working in hometown now

929
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,819
I am relying on myself!

930
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:32,080
And I won the title
of "The Most Outstanding Employee!"

931
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,020
Do you know what is an outstanding employee?
It means that I am excellent!

932
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,340
I miss you too. I love you!

933
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,140
My sister!

934
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,060
I will live a good life!

935
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,900
I will miss you very much!

936
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,300
Jing Jing! We love you!

937
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:20,480
I wanted to gain a foothold in this city
relying on my own efforts

938
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,400
I was also hesitant
between staying or leaving

939
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,480
Now, I finally understand that

940
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,880
wherever a person goes
the place where they feel at ease

941
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,680
is their home

942
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,340
I was fascinated
by the hustle and bustle of this city

943
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,020
but I can't let go
of the warmth and family in my hometown

944
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,340
After going through
the ups and downs, I finally realized that

945
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,740
home is a place with love and family

946
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,700
This city once hurt me

947
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,080
but it has also given me the life I wanted

948
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,360
There are many choices to be made in life

949
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,560
I hope that everyone will never regret

950
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,320
every choice they make

951
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,460
My dearest friends

952
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,060
Forgive me for not being able
to say goodbye in person

953
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,500
There may be some difficult moments
in everyone's long path of life

954
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,280
But please have faith that

955
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,980
the longest night will give way to dawn

956
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,980
and the longest road has an end

957
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,900
because you

958
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,920
are never alone
