00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,259
Look, she wired money to this person again

3
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,050
- Is it Bai Fan?
- Bai Fan

4
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,940
Bai Fan

5
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,460
It's strange. I just read that

6
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,420
This name gives me a sense of familiarity

7
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,180
His name rings a bell. Bai Fan?

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,520
Let me check it out

9
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,900
- I'll check this
- I haven't heard of it

10
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,980
- Did you find it?
- The name is in the call logs

11
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,720
- Look, there are a few calls
- Check the WeChat chat history

12
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,200
There surely is a record on WeChat

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
Here

14
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,000
The chat history has been cleared

15
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,860
Just make a call to him

16
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,780
It's on speaker

17
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,180
Sorry, the number you dialed
is out of service

18
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,980
Send him a WeChat message
and see if he will reply

19
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,520
Send an audio message

20
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,440
I'll tell him I'm a friend of Hu Jing Jing's

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,740
Hello, are you Bai Fan?
I'm Hu Jing Jing's friend

22
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,060
Please contact me when you see
this message, thank you

23
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,980
Well, let's see if he replies

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,380
We're just done dealing with Gao Yang
and now comes Bai Fan

25
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,860
We can't bracket them together

26
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,500
Gao Yang is at best an ex-boyfriend

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm afraid this is a scammer

28
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,900
Well, if he's a scammer
will he reply to your message?

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,020
It's hard to gauge. If he were a scammer

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,900
I don't think the message can reach him

31
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,780
He should have blocked Jing Jing

32
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,500
- That's true
- Right?

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,300
Leave this phone to me, I can surely find him

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
We must tease the truth out

Xiao Wu, I have time for that today
Send me the address

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,459
This level of difficulty is high, gosh

41
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,200
Luck is going against me
Can you choose one for me?

42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,420
Just click this

43
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,380
What's next? Is this great?

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,840
Come on, it's weaker than mine

46
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,140
Aunt, leave it, I'll serve the food

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,540
- Xu Yan, just sit down. I'll get the rice
- No, I'll do it

48
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,140
Uncle, easy

49
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,740
- Alright
- Hurry up

50
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,380
- Come on
- Son

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,620
Stop looking at your phone
Soup's on. Come here

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,540
Shen Zi Chang, your mom
is calling you, be quick!

53
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,420
I'll help you later
I'm having a lucky streak lately

54
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,820
Alright

55
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,120
Look, only Xu Yan can control him. Come on

56
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,220
- Come on
- How do you like the dishes?

57
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,400
Wow, Mom, all these are your signature dishes

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,460
Xu Yan, you are lucky

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,980
Thank you, Aunt

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
It's nothing special

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,180
- Have more if you like it
- Sure

62
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,580
Why don't you have rice?

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,660
I'm cutting back on staple food
to lose weight

64
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,340
Yes, she's not taking staple food

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,060
- Have the dishes
- Okay

66
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,900
Try her signature braised fish

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,140
Have some fish

68
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,580
Have fish, come on

69
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,940
Thanks, Uncle

70
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,020
Thanks

71
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,900
But I'll just take a little

72
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,700
Actually, the braised dishes are fattening

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,820
You should cut down on it
It's high in calories

74
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,340
Yes

75
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,940
Shen Zi Chang
you don't have weight issue, eat it

76
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,600
Braised fish is my favorite

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,520
Eat it

78
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,580
Xu Yan

79
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,580
You are skinny

80
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,260
Are you still trying to lose weight?

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,660
I watched a TV show last time

82
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,320
It's said that excessive weight loss
is a mental illness

83
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
Aunt, don't worry. I'm not
obsessed with weight loss

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,020
I'm having an interview soon

85
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,980
I'll stop dieting after the interview

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,420
I'll eat as much as I can
after I've passed it

87
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,340
- Yes, eat as much as you can
- Yes

88
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,060
Eat it

89
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,560
Eat it

90
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,620
Baby, eat some and spare my mom's feelings

91
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,540
I'm eating, leave me be

92
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,620
- I'll have the cucumber
- Don't just eat that

93
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,300
- I'll eat the meat
- Yes, I like meat, I'll have some

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,900
Eat more

95
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,580
I can have tofu, Aunt

96
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,659
Have the dishes

97
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,540
- Sister, have some water
- Thank you

98
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,040
Sister, are there any suites to your liking?

99
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,740
The last one is good

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,820
But the price is quite high

101
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,780
It exceeded my budget

102
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,020
- To be honest, that truly is a good one
- Yes

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,540
In terms of geographical location
the environment

104
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,300
- and the layout, it's perfect
- Indeed

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,060
For this unit type, there are only two
or three units on the market each year

106
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,980
I know this neighborhood, I'm living nearby

107
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,940
- Fate brings it to you
- Yes

108
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,540
But it's a little too much. It's acceptable
if it's tens of thousands higher

109
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,300
But this is hundreds of thousands

110
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,060
Can we negotiate with the owner?

111
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,820
Sister, we should get the one to our liking
when it comes to buying a house, right?

112
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,920
Yes, it's quite a large sum

113
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,540
But if you say no because of the difference

114
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,680
you may regret it

115
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Well

116
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,120
Please think it over

117
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,540
- I'll talk to the owner
- Yes, please

118
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,260
- I'll tell them you're a serious buyer
- Yes

119
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,300
- Every cent reduced counts
- Sure

120
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,800
Well, I'll contact them now

121
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
Come in

122
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,580
Mr. Jiang, what's the matter?

123
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,360
You're here for more than two months, right?

124
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,039
We haven't had time to chat yet

125
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
- You've been tied up
- Have a seat

126
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,260
I am busy but the marketing department
is the core department of Yann Coffee

127
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,020
Therefore, timely communication is important

128
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
I hope you understand it

129
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,920
I am new and don't know much
about the work environment here

130
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,320
Please tell me directly
if my work isn't satisfying

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,180
Well, how do you feel after joining here?

132
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,560
Very good

133
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,560
I think the marketing department
is a place full of energy and drive

134
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,860
The colleagues work together in harmony

135
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,460
Everyone is doing their duty
and they are capable and efficient

136
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,140
Really?

137
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,140
If this is the case

138
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,820
do you think it is necessary
for Old President Han to poach you?

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,160
Or you can't play it straight

140
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,120
- because Lu Yi Ning was groomed by me?
- Not at all

141
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,920
Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses

142
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,460
It cannot be denied that Lu Yi Ning
is a marketing talent

143
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,160
But I have to say that she is over-mighty

144
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,340
Her subordinates are groomed into followers
They can never be leaders

145
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,080
In other words, she's the only
go-to person in marketing department

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,960
She can't handle everything
even if she is a genius

147
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,340
You know what?

148
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,420
I promoted Lu Yi Ning to be
the director of the marketing department

149
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,540
because of her aggressiveness

150
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,680
Of course, the problems
you mentioned do exist

151
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,380
So I agree with Old President Han
on poaching you

152
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,300
Well, I hope I won't let you down

153
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,000
By the way, there's something
I need to consult you

154
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,440
The marketing department has been
laying off staff to increase the efficiency

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
But I think

156
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,760
we should also get some new blood

157
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,340
The workload of
the marketing department is enormous

158
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,720
I don't want any staff member
to be overwhelmed

159
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,480
I've read the resumes
you asked Sai Wen to show me

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,260
The one named Lin Rui isn't bad

161
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
He studied and worked abroad

162
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,040
Lin Rui? I know him

163
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,780
But he has high requirements for the position

164
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,300
All we can offer him is
the position of marketing specialist

165
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,400
Sai Wen will talk to him about that

166
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,080
It depends on his ability

167
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,660
Actually, I have seen a lot of returnees

168
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,700
Many of them are prideful
but their skills don't match their goals

169
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,840
Okay, I'll talk to Sai Wen again

170
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
- You may get back to your work
- Okay, see you

171
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,980
Yi Fan, remember

172
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,620
We can have a talk
before making any decisions

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,860
Okay

174
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,620
Yun Yun, I'm Nan Jia

175
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,700
Can you pay me back the 200,000 yuan
you borrowed in December last year?

176
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
I have an emergency

177
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,860
Xiao An, do you have enough cash now?

178
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,660
Can you give me the 100,000 yuan?
I need money

179
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,340
Forty-seven. Jeez

180
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,940
(Bai Fan)

181
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,140
Here is our resistance machines area

182
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,220
All the machines are
newly imported from the US

183
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,200
It is an ellipsometer, this is cardio zone

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,780
Over there are treadmills

185
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,540
- Okay
- Look around and call me if you need help

186
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,180
Okay, thank you

187
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,340
Is it him? Should we go over now?

188
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,620
He doesn't look like his picture

189
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,260
He's a catfish
Will he look like the picture?

190
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,740
It's just a picture

191
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,620
Nan Jia, didn't you add him on WeChat?

192
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,820
He didn't accept my friend request

193
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,500
Hurry up, if you use my picture
he will accept your request

194
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,100
- Want a bunch of five?
- That's right

195
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,660
- How do you like our gym?
- Quite good

196
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,920
Do you want to have Mr. Bai
as your personal trainer?

197
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,140
- Is he a fitness trainer?
- Yes

198
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,740
Mr. Bai is our personal trainer

199
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,720
He's new but many female members
have signed up for his sessions

200
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,640
Sure, no problem

201
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
Thank you so much
I'll be there in the afternoon

202
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,900
See you later

203
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,600
Nan Jia, isn't it weekend?

204
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,880
Why is someone so busy?

205
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,060
Drop that

206
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,220
- That guy, he...
- Don't point at him

207
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,700
If he really is a personal trainer

208
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,340
why do you think Jing Jing gave him money?

209
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,300
It's surely more than training
There must be something else

210
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,860
He's leaving

211
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,300
What are you doing?

212
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,580
- Do you know Hu Jing Jing?
- Do you know her?

213
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,060
- Why did you con her?
- How much was it?

214
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,420
- I didn't con her
- You can't remember, right?

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,180
- Come on
- Come on

216
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,140
No, I didn't con her, I am not lying

217
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,300
My stock tumbled and I lost my money too

218
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,380
I was fired because of her suicide

219
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,860
- Did you help her buy stocks?
- I...

220
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm her financial adviser

221
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,260
I helped her invest in stocks

222
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,140
Come on, will a finance adviser
accept private transfers from clients?

223
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,380
- You must be a conman
- You are!

224
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,180
Don't take me as a conman
just because I have a handsome face

225
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,740
I'm really her financial adviser

226
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,980
We signed the contract in private
That's why I was fired

227
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,020
Let go, ladies!

228
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,860
- Keep your voice down
- Let go

229
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,160
Thank you for your hard work all this time

230
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,100
It's our duty

231
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,360
Your quarantine period is over
Just sign your name here

232
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,680
- Thanks
- Goodbye

233
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,740
Hello, Sai Wen, you really cut it fine

234
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,220
I just walked out of the quarantine hotel

235
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,340
Frankly speaking, Sai Wen

236
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,100
the position and salary
don't align with my expectations

237
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,980
How about this?

238
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,560
I just reached here. Let me
settle down and think about it

239
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,780
No problem, I'll make an appointment
with you after this

240
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Come in

241
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,099
Mr. Jian, this is something
in return for your heroic help, thank you

242
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,780
Did you made it yourself?

243
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,400
I don't have that skill

244
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,140
But this cake shop is quite famous

245
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,940
And this is their best-seller

246
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,620
It goes perfect with your coffee

247
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,460
- Thank you
- No problem

248
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,500
Mr. Jian, can I ask you a question?

249
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,740
Will you keep quiet if I say no?

250
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,880
Well

251
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,180
Didn't you call the police that day?

252
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
Why must you still...

253
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,460
I think nothing is more important than a life

254
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,320
even if it were a stranger

255
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
not to mention you are not

256
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,060
Thank you

257
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,500
I remember someone wanted
to give me a treat in return

258
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,580
Are you going to brush me off with a cake?

259
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,260
I do want to do that
but I'm afraid you don't have time

260
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,940
Anytime, what do you want to have?

261
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,240
Let's go to the one downstairs

262
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,840
The roast duck restaurant?

263
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,720
You have to make a reservation
several days in advance, right?

264
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,700
I was kidding

265
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,420
You'll meet a client with me tonight

266
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,980
to talk about
the new fall product collaborations

267
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,360
No problem, let me sort out the documents

268
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,660
Mr. Jian, if you really crave for it

269
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,100
I'll treat you to roast duck
after receiving my pay

270
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
The brand collaboration is in fashion

271
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
Let me be frank, Mr. Jian

272
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,640
We are now negotiating a collaboration
with a major international brand

273
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,600
I chose Yann Coffee

274
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,220
because you are
the best coffee company in China

275
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,340
Come on, cheers!

276
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,060
- Wish us a happy cooperation
- Wish us a happy cooperation

277
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,580
Wait

278
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,620
Mr. Jian

279
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,420
We toasted to you with wine
and you're taking tea?

280
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,740
Mr. Jia, I can't drink
because of health issue

281
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,820
Mr. Jiang also knows about this

282
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm really sorry
Let me toast to you with tea

283
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,400
The negotiation can't move on then

284
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,020
Mr. Jian, Miss Qiao

285
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,220
Feel free to come to me
when you have any problems

286
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Let me toast to you
Thank you for your hard work

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,380
Mr. Jian can't take alcohol

288
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,100
Miss Qiao, can't you drink too?

289
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,940
I'm so sorry. I'm not good at that

290
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,260
When a girl says so
it means she can hold her drink

291
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,380
- Let me fill your glass
- Thanks

292
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,940
I'll help myself, thank you

293
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,340
Mr. Jia, don't make it difficult for a girl

294
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,740
She's just a marketing specialist

295
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,340
She's not commissioned here
for drinking, right?

296
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,900
Mr. Jian, that sounds really harsh

297
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,540
Can anyone avoid drinking

298
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
at a business dinner?

299
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,940
We could have had the negotiation
in a meeting room then

300
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,180
Since you've said that, I will meet you
in the meeting room next time

301
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,620
Mr. Jian

302
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,860
With your attitude like this
it doesn't matter if we'll talk next time

303
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,580
563412, my door lock password

304
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,140
Mr. Jia, that being said

305
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,500
I still expect an in-depth cooperation

306
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,540
between our companies

307
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,260
That's right, young man. I like you

308
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,520
Look

309
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,900
Isn't this good?

310
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,160
We'll loosen up after some drink

311
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Let's drink to Mr. Jian, okay?

312
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,620
Let's liven up the atmosphere

313
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
Drinking booze is different
from drinking tea, right?

314
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,220
Well, I look out of place if I don't drink

315
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,420
- You agree now?
- Mr. Jia, you got the point

316
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,900
There's no reason
to not drink at the table, right?

317
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
I introspected myself

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,820
I must make you happy today

319
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,740
What are you doing?

320
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,020
Three glasses of wine to good friends

321
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,220
I'll finish this pot as my apology

322
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,460
Are we going to drink like this?

323
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,100
Xiao Jian, you came here prepared!

324
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,860
Come on, let me drink to you

325
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,980
She's admirable

326
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,600
Hey baby, where did you get all these pills?

327
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,300
Western drugs again

328
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,260
These are few compared to others

329
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,960
You can't just take drugs instead of food

330
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,520
No. They are not just for weight loss
This is for whitening

331
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,420
And this one is to replenish collagen

332
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,820
And this...

333
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,940
I don't understand this. Anyway, I forgot

334
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,100
Each bottle has its own function

335
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,940
My interview is around the corner
I must be skinny

336
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,460
Else, I have to spend money
to get liposuction, that hurts

337
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,080
Baby, you're beautiful and slim enough

338
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,920
These medicines won't help

339
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,560
Sounds like you don't care at all

340
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,640
If I start to maintain my beauty now

341
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,000
I can stay young forever

342
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,020
- Come on
- Bring it on!

343
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,780
Your bottle is empty, what are you drinking?

344
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,620
- Come on, Mr. Jia
- Come on, Mr. Jian

345
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,220
- Let's drink!
- Why have you stopped?

346
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,580
- Come on
- President Qiao...

347
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm not a president
Mr. Jia, you are the president

348
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,580
To me, you're President Qiao

349
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,000
- Mr. Jia, we're leaving
- Bye!

350
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,000
Slow down, don't knock your head

351
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,900
My goodness!

352
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,560
Walk slowly

353
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,140
We're just a short distance to the car

354
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,740
Look at you

355
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,500
The steps, one, two, three, well done

356
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,220
Why are you so heavy?

357
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,580
I am 60 kg and 182 cm tall, am I heavy?

358
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,020
You're still clear with figures

359
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,680
Are you vomiting?

360
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,780
- I feel like vomiting
- Go ahead then

361
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,140
Can you vomit? Let's go, we're close

362
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,000
Put your arm over my shoulders

363
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,400
- Two more steps
- I want to sleep

364
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,300
You can sleep soon

365
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,820
Victory is ahead of us. Alright, lean on it

366
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,460
Let's take a break

367
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,940
I'll open the door for you
Don't get your head knocked, lean on it

368
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,440
Can you go in by yourself?

369
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,140
Where?

370
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,620
Look at those little feet

371
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,180
He's cute after getting drunk

372
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,480
I'll blackmail you with this
if you want to fire me

373
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,580
Ou Yang, what's going on?

374
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,580
I called you 45 minutes ago, where are you?

375
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
Are you walking here or what?

376
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,480
Where are you? Hurry up

377
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,040
What's up?

378
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
If you don't want to drink

379
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,960
no one can force you

380
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,780
- I can drink
- Thank you

381
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,280
Thank you

382
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,560
I'm coming!

383
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,940
Oh no, I didn't see anything

384
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,420
You saw it, hurry up and help him in

385
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,800
Hurry up, what are you doing?

386
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,280
- I'm going to...
- Boss

387
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,020
- No
- Sit down

388
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,740
Go in

389
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,660
It's been 40 minutes

390
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,110
- No...
- My shoulders almost broke

391
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,220
I've tried my best

392
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,540
This is the north and I came from the south

393
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,900
Weren't you meeting the client?

394
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,340
How much did he drink?

395
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,940
Make a guess

396
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,420
How much?

397
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
Three bottles? 750 g liquor?

398
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,300
Three little cups of this size
and he got drunk

399
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,220
Three cups like this?

400
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,340
Well, I'm being a busybody

401
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,980
But please build your alcohol tolerance

402
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,300
Do I still need to build that?

403
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,060
- Do you know how much I can drink?
- Can you outdrink me?

404
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,060
- You see, I'm fine
- Let's have a competition one day

405
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,900
- Go now
- Come on

406
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,260
Fine, I have to send him back

407
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,840
You are so unreliable!

408
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,540
Got it!

409
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,460
- Bye, be careful
- Bye

410
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,520
Hi

411
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,860
Boss, take a sip of honey water

412
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,900
Did you throw up yesterday?

413
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,620
Who invented booze? It makes me so sick

414
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,620
Boss

415
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,520
How much did you drink yesterday?

416
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,500
What does it matter to you?

417
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,220
Fine

418
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,060
I didn't do anything wrong yesterday, right?

419
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,000
What do you say?

420
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,620
Since you asked me, come here

421
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,020
Let me show you

422
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,820
I didn't see anything

423
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,320
Is this considered as something wrong?

424
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,680
I was drunk

425
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,220
Okay, as the best assistant of all times

426
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,620
- I will be discreet in speech
- Good that you know

427
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,320
But plainly speaking
Qiao Xi Chen can really drink

428
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,020
She was fine when we left

429
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,840
I heard that she drank
the client under the table

430
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,580
- Bring it on!
- Your bottle is empty!

431
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,060
What are you drinking? Come on

432
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,100
Boss!

433
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,460
Boss!

434
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Are you so free every day?

435
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,580
No, I am going to tell you this

436
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,980
Sai Wen has made an appointment with Lin Rui
but it depends on your availability

437
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,620
What were you thinking?

438
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
I was thinking

439
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,140
you should print me
another copy of Lin Rui's resume

440
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,100
- Lose no time
- Alright

441
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,460
Boss, call me next time when you drink

442
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,940
You should drink less, bye

443
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,800
Have I slimmed down? Is my face still chubby?

444
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,680
It is chubby compared to Li Na's
But compared to mine, it isn't

445
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,000
My body is already skinny
but I have chubby cheeks

446
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,260
Also, I've tried all types of jabs
to slim and reshape my face

447
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,740
Why can't I see the effect at all?
Can you see any effect?

448
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,780
Why don't you go for facial liposuction
with me? I've made an appointment

449
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,340
Liposuction sounds painful

450
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,340
Li Na said, you can't make
an omelet without breaking eggs

451
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,420
You can't lose weight
if you're not determined

452
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,380
- Okay, book a slot for me
- Okay

453
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,740
- I'm afraid too
- Right?

454
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,140
Will it leave scars?

455
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,620
Is the fat girl from the
customer service department fond of you?

456
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,260
Don't mention her

457
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,460
- What's wrong?
- Well, I deserved it

458
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,160
During our team building event last time

459
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,340
I pitied her for having no partner

460
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,300
So I just partnered up with her

461
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,020
Read the WeChat message she sent me

462
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,560
Isn't it like a confession?

463
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,380
Brother, don't you think
something is wrong with her?

464
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,660
Doesn't she know how she looks like?

465
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,340
She even confessed to me, isn't she funny?

466
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,220
You can't say that, she's just chubby

467
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,940
Chubby?

468
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,820
Her arm is as thick as my leg

469
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,900
Come on, shut up

470
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,140
Aren't you ashamed of badmouthing a girl?

471
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,860
Does her size have anything to do with you?

472
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,300
Did she eat your food or use your money?

473
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,780
- You...
- What?

474
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,060
Do you know why you fancy skinny girls?
Because you're like a dog

475
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,260
that likes to chew bones!

476
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,220
-Xu Yan, you are too much
- Am I? You're such a carper!

477
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,540
Yes, I'm fat. So what?

478
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,600
Do fat people not deserve a relationship?

479
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,660
At least I remember others' favors and help

480
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,540
But you trample over others' kindness!

481
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,260
Also, I have my own name

482
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,360
I am not called "the fat girl"
I am Qin Wei Wei

483
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,580
- Wait
- Wait what?

484
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,100
Wei Wei, those men are carpers

485
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,620
If you're not appeased
I'll scold them every time I see them

486
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,800
I really don't understand why they do this

487
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,300
Maybe I'm different from you and Li Na

488
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,000
But I also worked hard

489
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,620
I've tried all the weight loss methods
available online

490
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,659
I was on a diet. I skipped dinner

491
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,520
I even went for a full-body acupuncture

492
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,940
I've lost some weight, it's just that
I haven't reached the figure they like

493
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,360
Am I considered bad just because of this?

494
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,340
It's not that you are bad

495
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,739
You have to understand
that it's their problem

496
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,820
Everyone has a different definition of beauty

497
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,179
Wei Wei, you have to be confident

498
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,179
A person's beauty or character

499
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,840
isn't defined by anyone else
You must first approve of yourself

500
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,620
I think you are pretty good

501
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,020
Also, if you are in a western country

502
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,739
there will be countless men going after you

503
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,880
- Really?
- Of course, will I lie to you?

504
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,940
To me, you're adorable
kind, active in work, and hard-working

505
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,699
What's bad about you? If you don't
want to lose weight, leave it then

506
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,220
Do whatever floats your boat

507
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,920
Don't listen to the rubbish

508
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,800
Got it, thank you

509
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,640
You're welcome

510
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,940
Mr. Jian

511
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,780
You are here too

512
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm just here getting some sun

513
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,220
I'm done with it

514
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,820
- Have a seat. You can get the most sun here
- It's okay

515
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,040
Thank you for yesterday

516
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
Why do you thank me?

517
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,420
It's Ou Yang. He helped me

518
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
send you home yesterday

519
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,800
He was so drunk

520
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,860
He was supposed to have a blackout

521
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,160
It'd be the best
if he doesn't remember anything

522
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,040
Well, if she knows that I remember everything

523
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,940
she'll feel embarrassed

524
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,580
Oh, really?

525
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,980
I don't remember anything

526
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,740
Really?

527
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,660
Did you black out?

528
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,700
Well, Mr. Jian. Let me be honest

529
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,040
Avoid getting drunk when you're outside
Your drunk personality...

530
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,260
What's wrong with my drunk personality?

531
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,180
It's pretty good

532
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,540
It's true. Unlike me, I become
an embarrassment after getting drunk

533
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,620
I'll talk nonsense and swagger around

534
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,540
You were well-behaved
when you were drunk. It's good

535
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,460
You kept sleeping...

536
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,580
I mean, you slept soundly and quietly

537
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,000
Quoting my dad as saying

538
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,740
those who behave well after drinking

539
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,380
are those who have inner peace. That's good

540
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,800
Mr. Jian, why don't you sit in the sun?

541
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,080
I seem to have a lot of unfinished work
Have a seat

542
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,120
Don't just sit here, you can have this

543
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,420
Hi, Brother Wu. Here

544
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,680
Sorry for being late
The traffic was terrible

545
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,580
Let's place some order

546
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,800
President Ji, I know you are here

547
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,140
for the outstanding payment
of the event some time ago

548
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,320
However, it is in the reimbursement procedure

549
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,120
Brother Wu, it was an event
on the New Year's Day and it's now October

550
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,180
You are about to have
your annual dinner this year. You have to

551
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,900
pay the outstanding payment
of last year's annual dinner

552
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,260
Can you tell me at where it is stuck?
I'll do my best to cooperate

553
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,800
President Ji, I'm happy
with the event, really

554
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,300
But you know some people got drunk
and made a scene during the dinner

555
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,860
It affected us badly

556
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,140
So we decided to assess the impact

557
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,820
before we pay you. Is that okay?

558
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,660
Look, you are talking like a bureaucrat

559
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,560
Let's bring out the facts and reasons

560
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,360
Your employees got drunk
and fought during the dinner

561
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,340
But we only planned the event, right?

562
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,160
What do we have to do with that?
I didn't ask them to fight

563
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,820
Isn't this the truth?

564
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,420
It's clearly stated in the contract

565
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,020
We won't be responsible
for something outside our province

566
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,860
It really has nothing to do with us

567
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,500
The event was organized by you after all

568
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,760
Indeed. But we are not held liable
for that, do you agree?

569
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,900
It's not our responsibility
but we didn't just look on

570
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,780
From sending the injured to medical treatment

571
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,300
to paying the compensation
for damage to the venue

572
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,540
everything was paid by us

573
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,000
We paid the advances
These weren't small amounts

574
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,020
Brother Wu, I am calling you brother

575
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,100
I don't want to bring it to arbitration
I don't think I have to do that

576
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,500
Our company is also having a hard time

577
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,640
Nan Jia

578
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,520
You want to bring me to an arbitrator

579
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,740
No. I...

580
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,120
Let me tell you the truth today

581
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,200
Even if you bring me to court

582
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,160
our company is unable to pay you

583
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,440
let alone if you're taking me to arbitration

584
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,740
Nan Jia, we have been
working together for years

585
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,340
Do you think I am a deadbeat?

586
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,240
Do you know how difficult I am this year?

587
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,880
- I know...
- Our company...

588
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,960
Let me be frank
The annual dinner that you organized

589
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,640
might be our last annual dinner

590
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,640
Nan Jia

591
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,920
My mother is old

592
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,220
and I have two children

593
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,740
All my employees are counting on me

594
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,180
They don't even have money for food now!
They are having a harder time!

595
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,540
But I have to grit my teeth and keep going!

596
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,400
Nan Jia, I'm not complaining how hard up I am

597
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,580
But I can't hold on anymore

598
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,780
Brother Wu

599
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,640
Give me a time limit. When can you make it?

600
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,180
Nan Jia, can you give me another two months?

601
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,580
I'll definitely pay you up
before the end of this year

602
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,560
Sorry, I am not being myself

603
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,400
I am useless

604
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,140
Allow me to get back on my feet
You're the first one I'll pay you up

605
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,500
- Okay?
- This date in December, okay?

606
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,560
I always think that
our cooperation all these years

607
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,400
has been happy, so...

608
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,760
- Yes, it is!
- We won't go to that extend, right?

609
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,830
- Yes, we won't. This date in December, okay?
- Okay

610
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,240
Leave now

611
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,440
I should get going

612
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,480
Bill, please

613
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,840
Ma'am, it is 3,680 yuan in total

614
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,140
- How much?
- It is 3,680 yuan

615
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
Why?

616
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,920
Your friend hasn't paid
for this bottle of wine

617
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,400
Do you want us to keep it
or you'd like to take it home?

618
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,600
I'll finish it here

619
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,160
♫ Hey ♫

620
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,500
♫ Hey ♫

621
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,240
♫ Many wine glasses floating in the air ♫

622
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,280
♫ Your face is as red as a strawberry ♫

623
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,640
♫ Another ♫

624
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,020
♫ Shot ♫

625
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,460
Let me see

626
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,100
That's right. Let me book a driver

627
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,280
Don't be a stranger

628
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,480
Wait

629
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,100
We met in the bar two days ago

630
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,460
- Sir
- Sir?

631
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,820
Sir, I just booked your service
You're really quick

632
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,460
You're really quick. I just booked it

633
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,620
- Jinquan, uptown. Room 1207, Building 4
- No

634
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,400
I am not a designated driver. It's me.

635
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,940
Are you refusing to take me?

636
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,860
I'll report you if you are
and you'll be a goner

637
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,700
- No. Okay...
- You'll be a goner

638
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,580
- Slowly
- Are you going or not? Hurry up!

639
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,220
Hurry up!

640
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,860
- You...
- Where is your bike?

641
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,340
Where is your folding bike?
Put it in the trunk

642
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,420
- Sir
- No

643
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,460
No. I'm not a designated driver

644
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,940
- Look at me
- Here is the car key

645
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,680
What is this?

646
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,600
No

647
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,820
Baba, change!

648
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,820
Am I awesome? Here, this way

649
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,600
Slowly

650
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,700
- ♫ Another shot ♫
- Be careful

651
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,580
- Sir, we are going to Jinquan, uptown
- Jinquan, uptown

652
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,440
That's right

653
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,900
- Building 4, right?
- Room 1207, go

654
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,420
Lao Wu really pissed me off

655
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,860
Lao Wu owed me money

656
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,020
Hold on

657
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,520
How old are you?

658
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,300
- I'm in my twenties.
- In your twenties?

659
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,100
I was in my twenties too

660
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,820
Everyone was

661
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,800
Lao Wu was in his twenties too

662
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,260
He is now in his fifties

663
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,680
You're having tough times
in business, aren't I?

664
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,140
His company wants to survive, so does mine!

665
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,740
Why can he not pay me back?

666
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,060
Someone is calling me

667
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,780
I'll make arrangement for Xiao Yi

668
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,640
Xiao Yi is having a hard time

669
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,180
She is having a hard time

670
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,900
Her mom suffers from cancer

671
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,480
I can't fire Xiao Yi. Why?

672
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,860
Xiao Yi is the last person I can fire

673
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,260
Xiao Yi needs this job

674
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,820
I didn't know you're the best boss in China
You're generous

675
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,040
Am I a good boss?

676
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,420
If I am, I should sponsor
her mother's treatment

677
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,820
It's midnight, why is the traffic still busy?

678
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,660
What's wrong with the traffic in Beijing?

679
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,740
This is Beijing
What's wrong with a mild congestion?

680
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,900
Yes. But you know what?

681
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,740
When I was abroad
there was no car on the road

682
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,100
You were abroad?

683
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,820
- What did you do abroad?
- I used to be a designated driver abroad

684
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,700
A foreign designated driver? What's you name?

685
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,940
- Do you mean...
- Have you been abroad?

686
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,380
- What's your name?
- Oh, what's your name?

687
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,120
- My name is Ou Yang.
- Ou Yang!

688
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,920
Ou Yang

689
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,100
Sir

690
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,180
Nothing

691
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,400
Traffic jams are all over Beijing

692
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,940
- There is nothing else
- Do other places have no traffic jams?

693
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,540
Why don't you work there then?

694
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,500
Beijing is good, right?
Why do we have to go other places?

695
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,900
Why did you complain about traffic jams then?

696
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,560
Listen, Beijing is the best place

697
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,300
Of all the designated drivers
I am the one who loves Beijing the most

698
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,460
Really?

699
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,200
- Is that true?
- Yes

700
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,620
- Beijing is a nice place
- That's right

701
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,120
Sir, I'm an outlander

702
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,060
Where are you from?

703
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,840
I won't tell you

704
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,860
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead

705
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,620
I have a friend

706
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,200
He's in the same situation as mine
He grew up in Beijing

707
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,100
He likes Beijing but his parents are abroad

708
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,460
So he had to follow them abroad

709
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,680
He's in the same situation as mine

710
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,320
I think

711
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,280
you should follow your heart

712
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,380
You came to the world alone

713
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,240
You will leave alone as well

714
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,400
No matter how many years you will live

715
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,560
you will still be alone

716
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,420
You can pay your parents a visit

717
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,800
but what's the point if you are not staying

718
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,520
in the place you like?

719
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,200
I miss my home so much

720
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,300
Isn't this a red light?

721
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,300
- Yes
- You know what?

722
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
It will turn green later

723
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,780
- You got it
- If you don't believe me, look

724
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,500
- It turns green
- See!

725
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,780
♫ Many wine glasses floating in the air ♫

726
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,740
♫ Your face is as red as a strawberry ♫

727
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,740
- Now, reverse
- Yes, reverse

728
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,560
I take a step back and I'll see the blue sky

729
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,020
Reverse

730
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,700
- My purse
- Here, your purse

731
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,380
- I have to carry the purse
- I'll help you

732
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,880
Look, doesn't it work?
Aren't we inside the house now?

733
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,960
I'll put your bag here

734
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,460
- Am I home now?
- Yes, you are

735
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,220
- Where is my bag?
- I've put it there

736
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,680
- Okay
- Please sit down

737
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,400
Who are you?

738
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,140
I'm the driver who sent you home

739
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,500
You are Kido Ma, right?

740
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,060
- Who is Kido Ma?
- Wow! Kido Ma is in my house!

741
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,620
What would you like to have?
Let me cook you noodles

742
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,460
- I'm good
- Let me cook noodles for you

743
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,740
Let me get you some...

744
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,460
I think...

745
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,180
No, don't refuse me as if I am drunk

746
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,580
That's not much to me. You're right

747
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,920
What are you doing?

748
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,180
Well, I don't care
whom we discussed in the car just now

749
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,840
What I mean is...

750
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,740
He is right. He shouldn't stay
in the place he doesn't like

751
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,780
You know what?
People should stay in the place they like

752
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,020
People should stay where they like

753
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,820
If people stay in the place
they don't like...

754
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,960
Where do you think

755
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,860
is the right place to stay?

756
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,560
I think...

757
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,940
What the heck?

758
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,980
Forget it

759
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,560
You scared me!

760
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,800
Did you forget your keys
or are you sending keys for someone?

761
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,940
- You can stay in the management office
- I can't see from there

762
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,660
Go on with your work, leave me alone

763
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,180
This girl...

764
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,340
Are they different? What's the difference?

765
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,520
- What's this for?
- It looks like shoe polish

766
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,980
Don't simply touch it
It can cause eye irritation

767
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,820
Take it easy

768
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,600
Do you know what these are?

769
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,820
There are all kinds of flavors
like peppers and chili

770
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,780
And this one in my hand

771
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,060
- Spicy gluten
- An indescribable flavor

772
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,340
You'll never forget it, try it

773
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,000
What is this?

774
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,580
Isn't it obvious? It's a camera

775
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,140
But it's fake. The real one
is too expensive for me

776
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,860
- What's the point?
- Have you heard of this?

777
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,400
Guilty consciences make men cowards

778
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,220
If I hang it outside

779
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,660
the thief will feel guilty
and run away upon seeing it

780
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,340
Have you also heard of this?
Burying your head in the sand

781
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,900
- Screw you
- Bury your head in the sand

782
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,340
then you won't see and hear anything

783
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,700
Just tell me if I am smart

784
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,960
There's something greater
Do you want to see?

785
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,260
Let me introduce my new housemate to you

786
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,100
His name is Wang Zi Chao

787
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,120
- Chao!
- He is behind the curtain

788
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,660
Chao! Let me introduce you to my two buddies

789
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,460
What is that?

790
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,740
Stop laughing, listen

791
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,260
You can barely see it during the day
But after turning off the lights at night

792
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,080
it looks exactly
like there's a man in the house

793
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,670
Will you stand there
all night long on the phone?

794
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,020
He is drinking coffee

795
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,940
Fine! Chao, forget about them. Let's go home

796
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,300
- He's back
- His phone call is over

797
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,100
- He goes back once you ask him to
- His mission is complete

798
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,260
- Have you done laughing?
- You are crazy

799
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,940
No, what do I have here?

800
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,200
You have Shen Zi Chang

801
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,540
You have security guards
to protect you 24 hours

802
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,900
What about me?

803
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,460
I can only rely on these to ensure my safety

804
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,700
Otherwise, I can't even sleep well at night

805
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,280
These are all I have

806
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,800
Having 24-hour security guards doesn't
always give you a sense of security

807
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,960
I viewed a house two days ago, and I'm going
to pay the down payment in two days

808
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,860
Well, you're keeping us hanging

809
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,300
- That's right
- No

810
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,340
The down payment is not a small amount

811
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,680
I transferred all my money to one account

812
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,220
Once I pay it, I'll only have
500 yuan left in my account

813
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,780
I'm bankrupt and back in my poor old days

814
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,260
Then, you can have your own house
and get a good sleep, right?

815
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,020
I don't know if I can have
a good sleep in the future

816
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,780
- The point is, I can't sleep well lately
- Wait

817
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,220
You can't have that in mind. Be positive

818
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,260
Although you don't have much money
in your account, you have a house

819
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,180
- You have a home
- The thing is, I have no cash now

820
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,860
I don't even have the money for emergencies

821
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,100
I am risk intolerant now

822
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,500
Nan Jia, I really have to say it

823
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,340
You didn't have a sense of security
without a house

824
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,740
and you wanted a house

825
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,220
Now you have it, but you still feel insecure

826
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,840
Can you just tell us what you actually want?

827
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,040
That's right. What do I want?

828
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,480
(Bank Card)

829
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,580
Sister, don't forget that we're
signing the contract tomorrow at 2 pm

830
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,140
Okay

831
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,600
All my money is here

832
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,680
It will be someone else's tomorrow

833
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,320
(Balance)

834
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,260
Wei Wei, where are you now?

835
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,980
I didn't see you. Are you coming?

836
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,380
I'm not going.

837
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,060
I wanted to lose weight for that person

838
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,880
But I've got my head straight
I don't think there's anything bad about me

839
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,940
I don't want to change myself for others

840
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,840
After all, this is my life

841
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,860
Why should I care about how others see me?

842
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,860
Why should I live
by others' standards, right?

843
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm so happy that you've got
your head straight. I have your back

844
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,980
You too. I really think
you are beautiful enough

845
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,220
You don't have to torment yourself

846
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,740
Alright, I got it. Thank you, Wei Wei

847
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,400
- Bye bye
- Bye bye

848
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,040
I finally made it

849
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,740
I didn't mean to be late
The traffic was really terrible

850
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,380
I got it. Why are you so nervous?

851
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,180
I don't want you to think
that I did it on purpose to avoid this

852
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,960
Miss Xu

853
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,080
The procedure is done

854
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,940
Let's settle the payment and we can start it

855
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,560
I'm sorry

856
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,020
I...

857
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,020
I have thought about it

858
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,720
I'm not going to proceed with it

859
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,180
Baby, don't just eat the chips
Have some tofu

860
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,560
I'll eat it later. I haven't had chips
for a long while. It's so delicious

861
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,820
Baby, were you mad at me just now?

862
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,960
Not you, I was just mad at myself

863
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,320
Shen Zi Chang

864
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,740
- Do you think I am a fussy person?
- Not at all

865
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,680
Be honest

866
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,480
Just a little

867
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,200
You asked me to say it

868
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,760
I just don't get it

869
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,160
During our college time
when we were still acquaintances

870
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,260
you could leave home
right after washing your face

871
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,580
You didn't know any branded handbags
not even the brands

872
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,740
But now, you want branded bags and clothes

873
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,120
and even cosmetic surgery

874
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,620
I don't understand
why you have to torment yourself

875
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,860
You don't understand?

876
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,180
Neither do I. I don't want these either

877
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,880
But the people in my company

878
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,920
judge everyone
by their appearances and accessories

879
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:22,040
As if a good-looking person
could have an easy ride in the company

880
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,960
For example, my colleague, Wei Wei

881
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,080
I'm considered her only friend in the company

882
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,280
She is diligent and hard working

883
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,640
But why does everyone call her Fatty?

884
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,680
They don't respect her at all. She is a girl

885
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,500
That's what this company is

886
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,320
- Baby
- It's okay, I've got my head screwed on

887
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,800
Even if I carry

888
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,460
different branded bags every day

889
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,620
I still have to take public transport

890
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,660
And my colleagues will doubt
if my bags are authentic

891
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,060
Even if I slim down my face today

892
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,820
what if people like round faces tomorrow?

893
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,620
Do I have to get my face round again?

894
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,180
Why should I follow others' preferences?

895
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,720
I won't continue doing that

896
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,440
There is no standard of beauty

897
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,640
Everyone has their own characteristics

898
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,680
- What do you think?
- I agree

899
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,760
To me, you are always the prettiest one

900
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,500
I won't care about what others say again

901
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,120
I only care

902
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,920
what my loved ones think about me

903
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,260
- Do you think I'm good?
- Yes

904
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,240
Well, list down ten of my strengths

905
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,500
First, your character

906
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,720
- Don't I look good?
- You do

907
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,180
Which parts?

908
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,680
- Your eyes
- Where else?

909
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,620
Gou Dan

910
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,020
Gou Dan

911
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,160
Is anyone inside? I'm a police officer
Could you please open the door?

912
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,280
Could you...

913
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,460
Hi, don't be afraid

914
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,300
I'm from Guang Ming Police Station
This is my ID

915
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,800
Well...

916
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,990
A thief broke in
He just left a few minutes ago

917
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,320
We know that. We've been tracking him
After your neighbor called us just now

918
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,960
we pinned him down downstairs

919
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,540
- Thank you
- Is this your belonging?

920
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,420
Sorry

921
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,960
Are you okay?

922
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,500
I was on the night shift today
and came back a bit late

923
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,860
Your door wasn't closed properly
So I wanted to remind you

924
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,460
Then, I saw that person
rummaging around your living room

925
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,380
We have brought him to the police station

926
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:08,180
So, please come by
and make a statement tomorrow

927
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,700
Sure

928
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,680
- Thank you
- You should thank your neighbor

929
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,240
Lock the door after I've left

930
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,400
- Thank you
- Thank you

931
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,600
Your shoes and cameras serve no purpose

932
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,820
Feel free to knock on my door
if you need help. You can call me Le

933
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,760
- I am Qiao Xi Chen
- Good night

934
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,520
Thanks

935
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,980
Alright, you're safe now

936
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,500
It's okay, your aunts are here

937
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,140
Your godfather is here too, you're safe

938
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,600
Qiao Xi Chen

939
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,140
I think you need to go
to the temple for a certain ritual

940
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,860
What's the matter with you?
You have been running into such incidents

941
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Maybe I'm down on my luck

942
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,940
Pack your things and go to my place
Then take your time looking for a new place

943
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,260
No, Nan Jia

944
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:08,740
I was pretty scared
but that person has been arrested

945
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,660
Also, I don't plan to move

946
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,360
Fine then

947
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,260
Chang

948
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,540
- Thank you for your help
- Thank you

949
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,220
You may need to rough it tonight

950
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,160
I'll get you a new lock tomorrow

951
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,540
Sorry for putting you through this at night

952
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,020
Why are you apologizing to him?
I'll stay with you tonight

953
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,020
Me too

954
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,100
The three of you will sleep in the bedroom
I'll be the doorkeeper

955
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,500
To be honest, I was really scared at first

956
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,080
But I am relieved

957
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,680
since the three of you came

958
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,820
Thank you

959
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,100
- Are you saying thank you?
- Nan Jia, she said thank you

960
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,860
She wants a bunch of five

961
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,940
You are so stupid

962
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,360
That's great

963
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,720
When was the last time
we slept together in a huddle?

964
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,300
I remember it was in Yunnan, remember that?

965
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,860
I'll never forget it

966
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:22,300
Nan Jia wanted to book a hotel
but Jing Jing said it was pricey

967
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,580
- In the end, we huddled together in a room
- We were packed like sardines

968
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,340
At first I thought
she didn't want me to waste money

969
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,320
Little did I know she
wanted to sleep in a huddle

970
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,780
Gosh, I really like this feeling

971
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,380
I don't know if you feel it, but to me

972
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,520
I'm back to my college time

973
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,860
There were many people around

974
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,140
and my mind was at ease

975
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,720
Jing Jing said the three of us would
live together in a big house like a family

976
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,220
if she were working nearby

977
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,300
Yes, she said we would live together

978
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,080
The three of you? Without me?

979
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,460
With you, of course!

980
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:19,140
Jing Jing even said this,
"Nan Jia is a neat freak"

981
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,620
"So we'll keep a room for her
It's up to her if she wants to stay"

982
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,060
"But there would always be a spot for her!"

983
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,819
Stop making up for it

984
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,580
I am not

985
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,260
We really love you

986
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:33,660
I like hugs

987
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,180
What is the sense of security?

988
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,260
Is it the high wall you worked hard
to build for yourself?

989
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,359
Is it the light that's lit for you
no matter how late you go home?

990
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,200
Or is it the string of slowly
increasing numbers on your account?

991
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,380
I think

992
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,700
neither of these is

993
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,160
That feeling should be a kind of faith

994
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,859
Have faith even in
the kindness from a stranger

995
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:31,580
(Thank you, Le)

996
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,660
Have faith that you are irreplaceable
in that person's heart

997
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,100
Have faith that you have the ability
to withstand any storms

998
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,380
All in all, have faith that

999
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,180
only you can give yourself
the so-called sense of security

1000
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,780
How annoying

1001
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,920
I'm sorry, I think I'll give up the house

1002
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,720
Sister, what's the problem?

1003
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,600
I thought buying this house
would make me feel secure

1004
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:44,060
When I was about to sign the contract
I felt even more anxious

1005
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,380
I don't think it is necessary

1006
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,820
Yes, it's not necessary, that's it

1007
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,320
Don't worry, I will pay your commission

1008
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,520
Okay

1009
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,160
Hello, Mr. Zheng

1010
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,320
This is Nan Jia. Are your resting?

1011
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,240
I want to discuss

1012
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,600
with you the same problem about the washroom

1013
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,720
I decided to renovate it

1014
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,040
Yes, I need

1015
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,980
the original copy
and the photocopy of your ID

1016
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,880
as well as those
of your property ownership certificate

1017
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:33,540
Yes, I have to trouble you with that
if it's convenient. Yes...

1018
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:40,340
By the way, can you help me
make a video about...
