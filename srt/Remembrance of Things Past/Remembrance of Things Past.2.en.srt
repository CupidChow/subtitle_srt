00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:34,080
(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,759
- Is this her family?
- Yes

3
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,479
Where is she?

4
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
Do you want to call a guy over instead?

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
- Usually...
- I'm her cousin

6
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,759
Let me see her

7
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,640
(Mortuary)

8
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
I...

9
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,600
Wait. Excuse me

10
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Qiao

11
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
Nan Jia

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
- Are you ready?
- Yes

13
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,280
I'm already here!

14
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,760
I've seen the surprise you
prepared for me, spoilers!

15
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,380
Thank you

16
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,080
When you arrive

17
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
you will see me and these
beautiful flowers waiting for you!

18
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,540
See you later!

19
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,400
(Episode 2: Why)

20
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
We understand the situation now

21
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,240
Later, we need you at the police
station to take your statement

22
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,240
No problem

23
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,040
Can I take a breather outside?

24
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,820
Of course

25
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,540
Thank you

26
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,940
You're the deceased's cousin, right?

27
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,420
Yes

28
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,980
Please follow us to complete some
procedures and take your statement

29
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,460
Okay

30
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,660
Let's go

31
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,580
We'd like to ask you something too
Please follow me

32
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,420
Okay

33
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
Based on the CCTV footage
and the witness's account

34
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,440
Hu Jing Jing jumped down from
the overhead bridge herself

35
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,720
We're establishing this case as suicide

36
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
She listed you as her emergency contact
so we called you

37
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,620
Can you recall

38
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,540
the last time you saw or contacted her?

39
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
When was it?

40
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,840
Any records?

41
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,840
Also, did she show any
unusual emotional behavior?

42
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
She...

43
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Her emotions...

44
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,200
Pretty normal

45
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,880
This morning

46
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,780
she was still joking around in our group chat

47
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,760
She even made us laugh

48
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Then, this afternoon
something happened to my house

49
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
and she even helped me move out

50
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,080
She was cheery when she left

51
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,880
Tonight

52
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,680
we were planning to celebrate her
birthday in a hotpot restaurant

53
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
We waited and she didn't show up

54
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,240
Who'd commit suicide on their birthday?

55
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,320
I don't get it

56
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,600
So, can I have some time alone?

57
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay

58
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
Thank you

59
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,280
- Qiao Qiao
- Hello?

60
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,440
Hey, what's wrong?

61
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,560
Your friend just fainted
Come and check on her

62
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,720
Wait for me outside

63
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,440
Aunt, I'm going out for a while

64
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,540
Thank you for coming

65
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540
Dig in

66
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,040
- You're all here
- Mom

67
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
We have a free-flow buffet

68
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Eat all you want. Grab a seat

69
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,980
Run along

70
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,240
She left just like that

71
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,120
She didn't even leave a message

72
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,560
Don't touch it!

73
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,720
Mommy's here

74
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,920
Mommy's here

75
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,560
Big Aunt!

76
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,520
- What is it?
- Little Aunt has fainted from crying!

77
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,360
Let me check on her

78
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,680
Sorry, Aunt

79
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,920
Jia Jia

80
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
Do you think

81
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,840
I can still live?

82
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,160
Up until now
in the 26 years of my short life

83
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,760
Hu Jing Jing was with me half of the time

84
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,360
The Hu Jing Jing I knew
always had a smile on her face

85
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,160
It was beaming like a brilliant summer's day

86
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
and the warmth of the winter sun

87
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
I have never felt like now

88
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,320
I wish time machines really exist

89
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,560
How I wish I could hold her back

90
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,600
I guess the bus is coming
in another five minutes

91
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,680
You're already leaving when you've
just been back for a few days

92
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,680
I've packed lots of buns for you

93
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,800
Just reheat and eat when you reach home

94
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,760
Make sure you eat them
They won't taste good overnight

95
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,920
Cut down on takeaways, okay?

96
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,200
Don't worry

97
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,080
Don't look at it. It's not heavy at all

98
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,860
Your mother and I didn't
put anything heavy inside

99
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,140
You probably can't carry it

100
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,540
Otherwise, we wanted to pack
half a carton of pears

101
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,960
Chen Chen

102
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,880
You're all alone out there

103
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,160
If something upsetting happens

104
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,840
or if you feel unhappy

105
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,640
just tell us

106
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,020
Don't keep it all to yourself, got it?

107
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,620
Anyway, just take care of yourself

108
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
Don't worry about us

109
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,080
Come on, don't look so gloomy. Smile

110
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,360
It's getting cold

111
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,620
Bundle up

112
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,340
- Hi, Auntie, Uncle
- Hi, Xu Yan

113
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,320
- Isn't your mother coming?
- No

114
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,280
I didn't want her to come. She keeps crying

115
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,800
My mother packed
some buns for you for the trip

116
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,960
- Really? Thank you
- Try them

117
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,500
- Stay healthy
- Sure. Here's the bus

118
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,720
- Hold this
- Thank you

119
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,480
Enough. Get on the bus

120
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,600
- Bye
- Bye, Uncle, Auntie

121
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,840
Bundle up if it gets cold
Don't freeze yourself

122
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,020
Yes, Yu, but I don't agree with
the profit share ratio

123
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,640
We're not earning profit

124
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,640
When I go back next week
I'll confirm with him

125
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,080
What are you doing?

126
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm going to scare you all!

127
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,840
Go play somewhere else!

128
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Ji Zi Xuan!

129
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,680
So, moving on...

130
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,480
Moving on...

131
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,740
I'll continue later

132
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,960
Get down! What are you doing?

133
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,540
What are you holding?

134
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,740
Your lipstick

135
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,680
Give it back!

136
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
Give it back to me!

137
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,980
You have a death wish, Ji Zi Xuan?

138
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,060
Mom, look at him!

139
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,320
You little brat, look at you
looking like an imp now

140
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,600
Why do you keep spoiling him?

141
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,440
Didn't I tell you not to touch
your aunt's belongings?

142
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,760
Go, say sorry

143
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,160
Didn't your parents teach you
not to touch someone else's things?

144
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,840
Mom said all your things
will be mine when you die!

145
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,320
Don't talk rubbish!

146
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,000
Hubby!

147
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,800
Stop practicing your calligraphy!

148
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,040
- I'm...
- Quick.

149
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,980
Go to your grandpa, go

150
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,720
You little brat, why did you paint your face?

151
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,220
Come on, Grandpa will help you wash up

152
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,780
These things are pretty expensive, right?

153
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,600
I'll tell your sister-in-law
to give you her cosmetics later

154
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,700
No need. I'm not used to her cosmetics

155
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,780
Just ask her to pay me 5,000 yuan

156
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,840
5,000 yuan?

157
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,020
Anyway, you're just back for a few days

158
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,620
Why must you get angry over a child?

159
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,100
Mom, are you really ignorant
or are you just acting?

160
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,600
You think I'm angry with him?
Don't you know whom I'm angry with?

161
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,700
Look at you, getting upset already

162
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,040
Still, your sister-in-law has a point

163
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,320
You're in your thirties and almost 40

164
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,600
And you don't even have a boyfriend yet

165
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,080
What's the point of
earning more money like that?

166
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
In the end, it's all going to be Xuan Xuan's

167
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,860
I don't like to keep arguing over this
I'm sick of it

168
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,540
Did I say I'm not finding a boyfriend?

169
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,340
I didn't. I'm going to try
I haven't found one

170
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,560
You didn't say you're not going to try

171
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
But you didn't take any action

172
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,520
I know it's hopeless
if I leave this in your hands

173
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,820
But I've found one for you

174
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,540
It's your third aunt's relative

175
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,740
He's a handsome chap

176
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,200
He's over 1.8 meters tall

177
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,360
How old is he?

178
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,660
Divorced or widowed?

179
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,600
Listen to yourself
Why would I find a guy who'd remarry?

180
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,040
Most importantly
he doesn't gamble, drink or smoke

181
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,460
Why is he still single, then?

182
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,360
Listen to yourself

183
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,840
Even an eligible woman
like you is still single

184
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,740
There must be something
wrong or off about him

185
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
Just tell me if there's
something wrong about him

186
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
He just lost his job. Laid off

187
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,600
But he made it clear

188
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
As long as there's chemistry between you two

189
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,600
he'd follow you to Beijing

190
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,900
You're not planning to come back, anyway

191
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,000
Why would he follow me to Beijing?
To find a job?

192
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,280
Yeah. You're there, anyway

193
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
Just help him find one

194
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,160
Why should I?

195
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,780
Jeez, why must you keep going against me?

196
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,780
Jia Jia, listen

197
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
No matter how rich you are

198
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,080
your life would still be meaningless
if you don't get married and have kids!

199
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,320
When you're old
let's see who'd take care of you!

200
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,140
Some day, when your dad and I leave
let's see who'd care for you!

201
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
A big girl like you still doesn't
understand what we want for you

202
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,740
Where are you going?

203
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,880
I'm packing up
I'm going back to Beijing tomorrow

204
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,880
I don't want this anymore

205
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
You're already leaving?

206
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,880
Didn't you say that
you're staying for a few...

207
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,360
Stubborn wench!

208
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,320
How annoying

209
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,080
(Time to take your medicine)

210
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,600
(Methotrexate)

211
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,000
(Diagnosis: Cervical cancer stage II)

212
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
We have confirmed the diagnosis

213
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,920
Cervical cancer, stage II

214
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,280
You have two options now

215
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,820
Do you want to discuss with your family?

216
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,300
No need, I can decide my own matters

217
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,540
Okay, I've just reached home

218
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Thank goodness Nan Jia
lent me three months worth of rent

219
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
or else I'd be sleeping on the streets

220
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,180
I told you, you're just stubborn

221
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
You should've just listened to
Nan Jia from the beginning

222
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Her money didn't fall
from the sky too, right?

223
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,940
I didn't want to ask her

224
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
I wanted to ask from my parents

225
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,400
but they might panic and
ask me to go back home instead

226
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,320
Okay, that's enough
Let's not talk about this now

227
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,100
Just go back home and sleep
Don't think of anything else

228
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Call me if there's anything. I'm here for you

229
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
You too, call me if you can't sleep
I'm home now

230
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
Bye

231
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,600
Qiao Qiao, what is it?

232
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm not Qiao Qiao. I'm Chang Chang

233
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,120
Baby, I was wrong. I'm sorry

234
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,740
Listen, Shen Zi Chang, I'm really tired now

235
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,740
Also, I'm not back at Beijing yet

236
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,680
- Hey, listen
- What?

237
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,080
Don't you feel that the audio call
quality from Beijing to Baishan

238
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,280
is like speaking to
each other through a door?

239
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,580
Why did you come back?

240
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,040
You left so quickly that day
not even looking back

241
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,360
I couldn't help it
They asked me to move my car

242
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
Also, I called you so many times

243
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,960
Had you answered one of them
things wouldn't be in this state

244
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,440
- So, you're blaming me?
- I'm not blaming you

245
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
How can my baby be wrong? I don't blame you

246
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,660
Baby

247
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,920
I came here sincerely to apologize

248
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,380
If I knew something like that
would happen to Jing Jing

249
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,680
I'd let you buy whatever you want for her!

250
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,820
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that

251
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,040
I know you're upset now

252
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
I feel like slapping myself now!

253
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,720
Still, I shouldn't have
left you alone on the streets

254
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
I should have followed you
back to your hometown

255
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,340
Next time, even if you beat me
into a pig brain in public

256
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,880
I'd just stand there and not touch you at all

257
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
Silly

258
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,760
I don't even need to beat you up
You're already a pig brain

259
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,720
You haven't eaten since
you got off the plane, right?

260
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,680
Here, my mom just steamed these buns

261
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,020
They're still warm. Want one?

262
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
It's okay. You still have me

263
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,640
Don't be sad anymore, okay?

264
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,760
Say, why did Jing Jing do that?

265
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,000
I reckon only Jing Jing can answer you that

266
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,500
Hey, have you watched Out of the Dark before?

267
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,440
Maybe Jing Jing would show up
in your dreams these days

268
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,160
It's not funny?

269
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,780
Baby, I haven't seen you smile for days

270
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
I miss your smile

271
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,660
I can't smile, but I've been
crying until my eyes are sore

272
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,200
Look

273
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,680
Look at this

274
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,680
Jing Jing would have
looked good carrying this

275
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,460
It's red

276
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,240
Sigh, what a pity
we can only burn it for her now

277
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,240
What are you saying?
You know how much money you'd burn?

278
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,720
Yes, yes, it is expensive

279
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,920
Then, let's return it to the store

280
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
You can use it, then

281
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,780
No, it's supposed to be a present

282
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,040
- It's not for me to use
- Yeah

283
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,640
Then, let's just keep it
at home as remembrance

284
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,700
- Sure
- Okay

285
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,400
Hey, baby

286
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,280
I've been thinking

287
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,080
Our third anniversary is
coming in a few days' time

288
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,980
I want to give you a huge
present to make you happy

289
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,580
You can have anything you want

290
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,800
Forget it, I'm tired. I don't want anything

291
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,960
No, how about this?

292
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,400
The bag that you wanted to buy for Jing Jing

293
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,320
I'll give you one

294
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,600
No, I picked it just for Jing Jing

295
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,580
Can I have another one instead?

296
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,940
Of course you can

297
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,480
Really?

298
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
There's something I really want
Let me show you

299
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
We'll take this, then

300
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,760
Really?

301
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,860
You're so nice!
Look, there's this too, isn't it pretty?

302
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,220
Your phone is totally wrecked

303
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,760
Just increase your budget
and you can get a new one

304
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,600
Boss, please see if you can fix it

305
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,840
What's inside there
is really important to me

306
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,620
What's inside?

307
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,280
You can just download your photos
and messages from the cloud storage

308
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,760
I don't have the password

309
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,880
No, boss, don't get me wrong

310
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,520
This isn't my phone. It's my friend's

311
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
She's passed away

312
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,880
I'm sorry. I'll try to fix it

313
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,360
But, I might need more time. Can you wait?

314
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,720
No problem, take your time

315
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll add your contact

316
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,400
Message me when you're done

317
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,200
Hey, Miao Miao

318
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Qiao, where are you? Come back now

319
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
What's wrong?

320
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,040
You're still on leave, even now? Hurry up!

321
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,480
Miao

322
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
What's wrong?

323
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,760
Ye Zi just got laid off
They just informed her this morning

324
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,160
Why?

325
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,300
They said her ROA is the lowest

326
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,040
They didn't even give her one month's notice

327
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,760
Honestly, that's because
she used to be Yi Ning's protege

328
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,480
We've got your follow-up
report for quite some time

329
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,100
Why didn't you come to take it?

330
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,760
I was busy

331
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
You're scared, aren't you?

332
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,960
I understand

333
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
Congratulations

334
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,080
This time, the results remain good

335
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,000
There are no signs of your tumor relapsing

336
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,680
It's been five years, hasn't it?

337
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
It won't relapse anymore?

338
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,180
There's nothing absolute in medicine

339
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,280
However, judging from clinical experience

340
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,880
if there are no signs of relapse
five years after operating

341
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,120
it's considered a clinical tumor recovery

342
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,900
But, you still need to take
your medicine for quite some time

343
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,940
Okay

344
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
So, I'm normal now, right?

345
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,080
You've always been

346
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,700
Oh, gosh

347
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,020
Why isn't your cousin with you today?

348
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,440
During your last checkup, she even said that

349
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,720
she's going to celebrate
if your results are good this time

350
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,740
My cousin...

351
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,740
She's gone

352
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,080
She almost could have seen this

353
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,320
You just wouldn't choose hysterectomy

354
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,440
You just had to choose cone biopsy

355
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,600
- What if...
- What if my bladder fails?

356
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,880
I'd have to carry a urine bag
for the rest of my life

357
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,280
I know

358
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
The doctor said it's 50/50

359
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,200
I want to try

360
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,720
The operation was a success

361
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,160
You've overcome this hurdle

362
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,160
Nan Jia, I won't tell anyone, don't worry

363
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,520
But, you have to promise me this

364
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,000
Call me if something happens to you, okay?

365
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,000
Let me keep you company, okay?

366
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,580
Alright

367
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,220
Okay

368
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,240
(Nan Jia, remember to go for
your checkup at 4 pm later)

369
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,240
(Don't worry, I remember)

370
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,120
She almost could have seen this

371
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,040
Miss, your cake is ready
Do you want it served now?

372
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,340
Yes, please

373
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,060
Enjoy

374
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,400
(Live well)

375
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,420
Qiao Qiao

376
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,440
Come, sit with me

377
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
- What is it?
- I...

378
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,220
I ordered too much food
I can't finish everything

379
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,720
Let's eat together

380
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,440
Did you order too much
or did you get the wrong order?

381
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,040
This is a feast

382
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,200
I ordered too much

383
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,680
Save yours for tonight

384
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
Help me. I can't let all these go to waste

385
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,320
I don't accept favors for nothing
Tell me, is there anything you need?

386
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,200
Nothing, I just ordered too much

387
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
Okay, I'm digging in

388
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,640
Once I'm done eating, I'm done
No strings attached

389
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,600
Don't ask me for any favors after this

390
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,180
So...

391
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,320
Your 818 project...

392
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,840
You know

393
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,040
what's going on in the new
marketing department now

394
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,080
I'm still new here
I haven't joined any projects

395
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,520
If Jian Yi Fan is going to
attack Yi Ning's subordinates

396
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,520
I'm his easiest target

397
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,080
unlike you, who's handling the 818 project

398
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
He won't target you easily

399
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,820
I don't want to be laid off

400
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm almost 30 years old

401
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,680
I don't want to go back home

402
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,840
I can't go back anymore

403
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,980
Why does this taste so good?

404
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,400
Is it expensive?

405
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,560
I can literally taste money inside

406
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,920
It's not that expensive. Eat more

407
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,640
Money does bring you happiness
You should eat too

408
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,540
- I'll guide you in the 818 project
- Really?

409
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,840
You're treating me, after all

410
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,560
Since Mr. Jian is new, he doesn't
really know who's handling this project

411
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,360
But, let me make this clear first

412
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,400
You must complete the remaining work with me

413
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,520
Don't worry, I'll do everything as you say

414
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,840
- You should eat too
- Let's eat

415
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,880
I've been eyeing on this for a long time

416
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,920
I know we're the ones who
proposed using gold leaves

417
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,280
and not the client

418
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,960
But the client chose us because
our proposal is different, right?

419
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
There are so many swanky
Japanese restaurants in Beijing

420
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,500
If it weren't for getting something
custom-made from Kanazawa

421
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,200
they might as well dine at the restaurants

422
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,360
Why must they hire a private chef
and ask us to purchase ingredients?

423
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,680
But now, both air and sea freight
won't deliver the goods in time

424
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,400
Also, there are strict regulations
in importing foodstuff

425
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,860
Gold leaf is still a kind of metal, after all

426
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,960
Isn't Mr. Zhang a man of culture?
Why is he obsessed with gold?

427
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,200
You know he's a man of culture too?

428
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
Remember his portfolio?

429
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,320
I remember he came back from Japan, right?

430
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,440
He graduated from Kyoto University

431
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,240
and worked at Kanazawa's 21st Century
Museum of Contemporary Art for three years

432
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,000
He even married a Japanese wife, right?

433
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,840
To them, gold leaf from Kanazawa
isn't just any simple gold

434
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,320
But, I think it's just gold in the end

435
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,840
Go back

436
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Go back. There's nothing you can do here
Let me think about it

437
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,240
Got it, Sister Jia

438
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,660
You should rest early too
You've been working overtime

439
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
Sure

440
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,360
Why aren't you leaving yet?

441
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,020
Haven't you noticed that no one else has?

442
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,880
Who'd leave if he's still here?

443
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,240
Maybe he's not doing anything
serious too, just like you

444
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,300
He might as well enjoy at home

445
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
We don't even dare to get off work now

446
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,240
He didn't stop you from leaving

447
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Just go if you want. I'm about to go, bye

448
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,800
Didn't you watch the news?

449
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,340
There's some employee who was sacked
because he didn't work for eight hours full

450
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,920
I'm scared that he'd fire me tomorrow
for not working overtime

451
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,800
Whatever. I'm going

452
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,580
(Who's in charge of the 818 project?
Get ready and meet me in ten minutes)

453
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,160
818...

454
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,740
(Noted)

455
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,840
Here, I'll help you divide

456
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
Thanks

457
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,760
Mr. Jian

458
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,980
Are you okay?

459
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,160
I'm fine

460
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,520
Okay, have a seat

461
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,840
It's getting late. Let's get this
done quickly, so we can go back

462
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,020
Hold on, I need to take this call

463
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,920
Hello?

464
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,960
What's going on between you two?

465
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,840
Nothing

466
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,800
I don't know, he's been acting strange
towards me since I came back from leave

467
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,480
Don't tell me...

468
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,480
- He's going to fire you?
- He's wooing me?

469
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
Let's start

470
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,320
Mr. Jian

471
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,860
Here are the proposals for 818's
online and offline promotions

472
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,080
And the product lists, too

473
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,460
I have no problem with the offline promotions

474
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,460
I'm concerned about online promotions

475
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,080
Have you confirmed the live stream platform?

476
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,700
We're already discussing with Mai Zhuo Zhuo

477
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,700
The basic terms have been set

478
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,280
After we finalize the details with
her tomorrow, we can sign the contract

479
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,000
Mai Zhuo Zhuo?

480
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,600
Why do I hear that Wake Coffee
is also approaching them?

481
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,800
It's said that they're
likely to sign her on too

482
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,780
That's because Mai Zhuo Zhuo
has been promoting herself

483
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,640
as the cheapest live streamer online

484
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,520
All her products are the cheapest

485
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,640
So now, she's actually comparing
our rates against Wake Coffee's

486
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,400
Mai Zhuo Zhuo will be the key for us
to make this promotion a success

487
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,640
Still, I know Wake Coffee's tricks

488
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,720
Just this

489
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,900
probably won't work

490
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,280
Reduce the profit margin further by 5%

491
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,160
If we keep reducing
what are we going to earn?

492
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,920
Popularity

493
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,880
We may earn less profits

494
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,080
but if we can sell more

495
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,360
(Ha ha)
we can still hit the target

496
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,900
Set your vision further

497
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,880
Don't just look at the
profit in front of you, okay?

498
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,780
You have a point, Mr. Jian

499
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,520
(Smart aleck)

500
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,780
Okay, that's all for now. I'll follow
you tomorrow to meet Mai Zhuo Zhuo

501
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,880
Okay

502
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,620
Thank you

503
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,960
He actually had the cheek to say that

504
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,020
He just assigned us work
and he's telling us to go back home now

505
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,020
How can we go back?

506
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,620
Do you need any help?

507
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,780
No, you don't know how
to calculate the costs, anyway

508
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,140
I'll handle it

509
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,400
Thanks, then

510
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,940
She really has so much
free time, doesn't she?

511
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,000
So, you're replacing gold leaf from
Kanazawa with those from Nanjing?

512
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,440
That's right

513
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,380
You've also replaced the souvenir's
wagashi with Chinese desserts

514
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,760
With Suzhou-style desserts

515
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,520
Mr. Zhang, you're from Gaoyou

516
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,020
We replaced Japanese wagashi
with Suzhou-style desserts

517
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,880
so that your guests who cannot
attend your wedding

518
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,480
can receive a deluxe dessert
souvenir set from you and your wife

519
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,080
Also, we have three packaging options

520
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,560
All of them feature gold leaf from Nanjing

521
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,000
Then, what about the home wedding?

522
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,400
About that, I think we should
consider your wife's opinions

523
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,040
We'll serve Japanese food
complemented by Western

524
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,280
Also, after we replaced imported
ingredients with locally-sourced ones

525
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,160
your budget has gone down by 30%
which is a huge reduction

526
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,280
Okay, thank you, President Ji

527
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,760
Thank you

528
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,000
You're welcome. I'll compile all of
these into a PPT file and send to you

529
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,280
Since your wife reads Japanese
I've made two versions

530
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,320
- Thank you so much
- You're welcome

531
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,840
Usher Mr. Zhang

532
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,120
Contact us if you have any problems

533
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,680
Goodbye

534
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,480
See you, Mr. Zhang

535
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,160
This is for you

536
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,040
What's this?

537
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
- Oh my
- It's gold. Lavish it on yourself

538
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,860
Didn't you go to Nanjing?

539
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,000
You could have bought me some salted duck
What is this?

540
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:05,680
See, that's what you
ignorant office ladies think of Nanjing

541
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,120
You sound just like them!

542
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,680
I bet you didn't know
I only knew about it after I went there

543
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,640
You know, Nanjing is famous
for making gold leaf

544
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,300
They've been producing that for a long time

545
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,260
We went to that Japanese restaurant last time

546
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,880
and they sprinkled some
gold on our food, right?

547
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,600
We thought it's only from Japan
but Nanjing has been producing it

548
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,560
Authentic traditional craft

549
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,840
Oh, it's a mirror

550
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,740
Is this a fun house mirror?

551
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,160
No, that's how I look like

552
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,640
Stop looking! Get back to work!

553
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,640
- I'm checking the back
- Come on

554
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,500
What's wrong?

555
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,160
Nothing

556
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,280
Not next morning. Get me a ticket for tonight

557
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,720
8 pm

558
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,640
It's okay

559
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,300
8 pm, then I'll spend
the night at the airport

560
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,300
I'll go straight to Longtan next morning

561
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,720
I can sleep anywhere
I'll sleep during the flight

562
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,640
I'm okay. That's all

563
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,640
(Emergency contact: Jing Jing)

564
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,960
Hello?

565
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,520
Jinquan, uptown

566
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,600
My stomach hurts. I don't know why

567
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,360
Yes, please come quickly. Thank you

568
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,200
This tastes nice. Ask them
where they sourced their coffee beans

569
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,520
Come on, the meeting's over
It's time to relax

570
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,520
Relax, will you?

571
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,600
Mr. Jian, I really don't understand

572
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,120
Are we going to wait here and do nothing?

573
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,700
Yeah

574
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,700
I should've stopped
those guys from Wake Coffee

575
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,940
so they can't proceed with the meeting

576
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,700
It's Wake Coffee's tradition to be practical

577
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,040
They can give in to anything
except price and profit

578
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,080
If everything goes as planned
they will quote a higher price than ours

579
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,820
That means they're not crazy

580
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,240
No, I mean to say that
an outstanding person like you

581
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,020
is usually not understood so easily

582
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,080
How did you manage to praise
someone in such an awkward way?

583
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,280
Sorry about that, Mr. Jian

584
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,480
Hello, Miss Mai

585
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,240
So...

586
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,440
Can I know why?

587
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,460
Okay, I understand. Thank you, Miss Mai

588
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,560
Mai Zhuo Zhuo said
she's not collaborating with us

589
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,760
because Wake Coffee is quoting
exactly one yuan less

590
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,860
for each of their similar products

591
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,600
Thank you

592
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,640
- Is this a relapse?
- It's not

593
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,280
It's just acute stomach flu

594
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
It really hurts

595
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,440
No matter how busy you are
you can't ruin your health

596
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,400
Otherwise, your efforts for the past
five years would be wasted, got it?

597
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,460
I was wrong. Sorry, Dr Zhao

598
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,240
I'll get the nurse to
deliver your medicine here

599
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,440
Tonight, just stay here

600
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,300
Get back to work

601
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,960
Okay, thanks, Lina

602
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,840
Thank you for helping. I'll treat you someday

603
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,640
I've asked around, and I finally know why

604
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,960
Wake Coffee's representatives
found our quotation

605
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,960
in the ladies' washroom
at Mai Zhuo Zhuo's office

606
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,920
So, they changed their quotation last minute

607
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,400
Why are her employees so careless?
Can we lodge a complaint?

608
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,780
It's not her employees

609
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Our logo is on the quotation

610
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:17,160
That means one of us left
the quotation at the washroom

611
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,280
I remember I didn't

612
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,720
Let me check

613
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,560
I didn't go to the washroom

614
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,960
Mine is right here

615
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,800
Mr. Jian, I really didn't go to the washroom

616
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,360
I don't even know how the
washroom's door looks like

617
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,920
Besides, I took it out during the meeting

618
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,120
But it's a confidential document

619
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,080
Also, we only printed two copies

620
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,840
Even Mr. Jian doesn't have one

621
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,080
I really didn't go to the washroom
It wasn't me who left the quotation there

622
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,400
I was even holding it during the meeting

623
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,660
Back then, Mai Zhuo Zhuo was here
and you were here

624
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,780
then I took out the quotation
and put it right in front of you

625
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,560
I really didn't go to the washroom, Mr. Jian

626
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:48,640
I even took it out during
the meeting, I really didn't...

627
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,900
Both of you should go back now
It's getting late

628
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,580
I'll get to the bottom of this

629
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,160
Then, I'm going

630
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,840
Su Qing

631
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,400
Su Qing

632
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,600
Hello?

633
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,840
I don't have money!

634
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,160
No thanks

635
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,960
Come on, are you done yet?

636
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,960
The food is already getting cold

637
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,900
It'd be a joke if you fall sick
on a wonderful day like this

638
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,760
Why are you so anxious?
Look around, who's here to eat?

639
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,020
They're all taking photos

640
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,200
- Hey, push that closer to me
- This?

641
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,160
Closer

642
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,400
Sit back

643
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,960
Hands off

644
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,960
Go back a little

645
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,760
I didn't ask you to come closer

646
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,080
Look, is this the model you want?

647
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,240
Let me see

648
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,400
This is it!

649
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,860
- You're awesome
- You like it?

650
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,200
I like it

651
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,440
Listen

652
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,760
I tried so hard to get this bag for you

653
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,560
I asked my friends from
primary school, high school and college

654
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,160
They all said that this model
is the latest and the best

655
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,120
It's flawless

656
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,260
Also, when you carry it while shopping

657
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,380
you'd be the center of attention

658
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,700
If they tricked me into
buying some inferior bag

659
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,820
I'm going to sever ties with them, you know?

660
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,520
I didn't get to board

661
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,320
Book the earliest ticket for me tomorrow

662
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,240
Afternoon, then. Not morning

663
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,320
Change it to afternoon, after lunch

664
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,880
Nurse?

665
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,400
Where can I buy drinks?

666
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,680
Mom, Dad bought your favorite dumplings!

667
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,000
Gentler. Your mom is ill

668
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,660
Mom, does it hurt? Let me blow on it

669
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,360
It's okay, my baby

670
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,600
Must you order dumplings
in the middle of the night?

671
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,600
If we hadn't walked faster

672
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,680
the store would've closed in five minutes

673
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,280
- I'm just craving for it
- Slowly

674
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,760
How is it?

675
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,760
Yum! Thank you, hubby!

676
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,780
Don't get fat
or you'll have to slim down later

677
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,680
Another one

678
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,320
Does it hurt?

679
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,300
Eat some candy

680
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,300
It won't hurt anymore then

681
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,900
Come here

682
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,360
I have cancer

683
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,320
I...

684
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,440
Is it confirmed?

685
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,480
I don't know who else to find now

686
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,840
That's why I dragged you here

687
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,280
What are you saying?

688
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,540
- It's okay
- How will my mother take this?

689
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,160
Don't be scared

690
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,800
I'm already an adult. What's with me?

691
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,100
It's okay. Here

692
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,620
It's alright

693
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,900
I'm scared

694
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,680
Why haven't you gotten off work yet?

695
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,240
Mr. Jian

696
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,280
I've already gotten off work
I'm drinking here

697
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,140
Seriously?

698
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,920
Is it against the company's rules
to drink and relax after work?

699
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,460
Would I get fired?

700
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,680
I didn't offend you

701
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,200
Why are you lashing out on me?

702
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,800
Everyone makes mistakes
Don't take it to heart

703
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,080
If you really feel tired

704
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,180
just take a break

705
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,100
Take a break?

706
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,720
You're telling me to take a break?

707
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,040
Listen

708
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,080
I joined Yann Coffee even before
I graduated from college

709
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,300
Back then, I earned about 3,000 yuan a month
and I continued working here till now

710
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,520
I work during work hours
non-work hours and overtime

711
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,980
I've been working every day

712
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,340
I don't need that!

713
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,760
Ask those around my age in the company

714
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,260
Who doesn't literally run to success?

715
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,720
Just running two steps slower
may put you in a disadvantage

716
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,520
Who'd dare to take a break?

717
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,560
I dare. I dare to take breaks

718
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,960
See, I'm taking a break now. I'm not working

719
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,260
I'm not working on proposals anymore today!

720
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,760
I'm not going home and work!
I'm just going to drink here!

721
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,160
Look what I'm drinking today

722
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,260
Whiskey

723
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,920
Listen

724
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,660
Xu Yan would never believe it if she knew

725
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,160
that I, Qiao Xi Chen
am drinking whiskey today

726
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
Do you know how much it is?

727
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,360
800 yuan

728
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,320
800 yuan

729
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,760
After buying this bottle of whiskey
I only have 200 yuan left

730
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,180
You know what?

731
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,340
This is the first branded handbag
I've ever had in my life

732
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,760
That's why I'm delighted, really!

733
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,060
That's because I've been conned

734
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,520
The rental agency
conned me out of six months' rent

735
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,680
I'm broke

736
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,880
Do you know how I see Beijing?

737
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,240
She's big and tolerant enough

738
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,720
Here, talented people can make the grade

739
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,480
while ordinary yet diligent people
can still make a decent living

740
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,960
Qiao Xi Chen

741
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,520
You don't have to walk so fast

742
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,440
(Voucher: 5 yuan)

743
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,640
(Loyal customer card)

744
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,660
Shen Zi Chang

745
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:48,920
Do premium outlets now offer vouchers
for posting photos online?

746
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,000
Where did you buy this?

747
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,660
Online

748
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,960
No, baby, listen to me

749
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,480
This is exactly the same as a branded bag

750
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,760
Listen to me

751
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,760
I went to the retail store that day

752
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,200
I saw this bag and I wanted to buy it for you

753
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,320
But, they said it's over 20,000 yuan
and I thought, "That's expensive!"

754
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,120
So, I called my friend, Hua Zi

755
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,600
He was like, "Dude, why buy
such an expensive bag?"

756
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,780
"You can go to Taobao and buy those bags

757
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,600
made by OEMs who cater for big brands"

758
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,520
"The quality, the fabric, the threads
they're all the same"

759
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,640
Before you saw the voucher

760
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,680
even you couldn't tell the difference too

761
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,480
Jing Jing

762
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,560
I miss you

763
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,440
What?

764
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,600
Hu Jing Jing!

765
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,960
Does it hurt?

766
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,160
You know Hu Jing Jing?

767
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,740
Of course you don't

768
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,680
Let me introduce her

769
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,920
Hu Jing Jing was my close friend

770
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,520
She also asked me this before

771
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,600
She said, "Qiao Xi Chen
what's so good about Beijing?"

772
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,200
"Why must you stay at Beijing?"

773
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,680
I said

774
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,200
What I said was about the same as yours

775
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,920
Xu Yan, wait for me!

776
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,560
Baby, why are you mad again?

777
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,180
Shen Zi Chang, what's wrong with you?

778
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,540
You might as well not buy
Why did you get me a fake bag?

779
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,760
How is this fake?
Those OEMs cater to those big brands

780
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,040
- Look at this
- That means it's fake!

781
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,100
I've already posted online and told
everyone I bought a branded bag!

782
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,620
What's wrong with you?

783
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,440
You're right

784
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,760
Beijing is too big

785
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,400
It makes us look so...

786
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,680
So insignificant

787
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,140
A few days ago, there's...

788
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,960
There's a girl who stood
at an overhead bridge

789
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,520
and jumped down

790
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,120
You probably read about the news

791
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,640
But, you'd forget about it in a few seconds

792
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,140
That girl was my friend

793
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,340
Her name was Hu Jing Jing

794
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,860
I'll never forget

795
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,680
On her birthday, she...

796
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,680
It wasn't me who lost the document

797
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,640
I said, I didn't lose the document

798
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,000
That means I didn't lose it!

799
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,880
You can take the whiskey

800
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,200
(I had a terrible day)

801
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,200
(I had a terrible day)

802
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:05,319
Ding dong

803
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,560
Here's your fried chicken!

804
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,979
Here's your beer too!

805
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:14,600
I'm here too, I'm here too

806
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,960
- Hugs!
- Hugs!

807
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,840
(I had a terrible day)
(Delete)

808
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:44,000
(Jing Jing, I miss you so much)

809
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,100
Jing Jing always looked so cheerful

810
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,000
Why did she choose this path?

811
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,640
I'm going, then

812
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,640
You should go too when you're done packing up

813
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,920
Remember to lock the door

814
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,760
Nan Jia

815
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,200
It's a razor

816
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,820
There are also two movie tickets here

817
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,120
What's this, a glass shard?

818
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,040
Is this blood, or...

819
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,520
It's a man's shirt
