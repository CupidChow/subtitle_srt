(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
Qiao Qiao, are you free this weekend?

3
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,920
- I guess
- Can you cover for me?

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,160
I want to go out with my boyfriend

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,880
- No, I...
- We're colleagues and you're free

6
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,840
- Do me a favor
- Okay

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,320
Qiao Qiao, you're right on time

8
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
This coffee machine is out of powder
Can you help me?

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,400
I just got my nails done
It's difficult for me

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,440
We're colleagues, please do me the favor

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
These are wrong, I told you this is
not the way to do cost accounting

12
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,440
I can't do it, it's beyond my abilities

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,680
Get up, let me do it

14
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,060
Here and here, everything has to be changed

15
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are there so many meat dishes?

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,800
I am on diet, and this
is spicy, it will cause acne breakout

17
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,200
They are so oily

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,060
Xiao Ke

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,760
You didn't want to place the order
and asked me to help you

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,880
When I asked you, you told me
you were okay with anything

21
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,640
You should ask me again

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,820
How do I eat these?

23
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,480
I am your colleague, not your nanny

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,300
I am not obliged to serve you

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,160
I don't mind ordering food for you
while I am at it

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,920
But you should accept whatever ordered
This is the basic etiquette, understand?

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,520
Also, I don't mind helping you in your work

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,700
But please pay me half of your salary

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
I don't know how much your manicure costs

30
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,640
But I'm sure it's not
as high as my hourly pay

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,680
Weigh it up before you want me
to grind the coffee for you

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
whether you can afford to pay me

33
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,100
It doesn't concern you if I waste my time

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,700
lying at home from morning till night
on the weekend

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,820
We're in a company, not a kindergarten

36
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,680
No one has the obligation to pamper you
and please don't take others as fools

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,620
Last but not least

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,160
I'm a few years older than you
and my position is higher than you

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,500
I've been in Yann Coffee longer than you do

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Next time when you call my name
please add "Sister"

41
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,920
(Episode 9: Finding Shortcuts)

42
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,160
- Hello
- Tell me!

43
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
Why would you be deep in debt?

44
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
What can I say now?

45
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,220
You live with your cousin in Beijing

46
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,820
You're earning a good salary
for your own spending

47
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,600
Why did you borrow so much money?

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,300
Why did you spend so much money?

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,020
What are you doing? Are you scammed?

50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,360
If so, let's go to the police now!

51
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,160
Why can't you stop making me worried?

52
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,380
If I knew you would end up like this

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
I wouldn't have let you go to Beijing!

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,440
Jing Jing was sick, Aunt

55
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
Everyone gets sick

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,540
It's not your fault

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
Jing Jing actually

58
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,840
had a hard time in Beijing

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
She was headstrong
and didn't want to tell you

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,760
I didn't know it until that happened

61
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,120
The doctor said

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,080
depression is a complex disease
with many contributing factors

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
Jing Jing loved you very much

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,660
She won't blame you

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,480
Aunt

66
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,020
You didn't do anything wrong

67
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,480
Li Fang, I know

68
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,040
You don't mean to have another baby

69
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,080
You just can't stop thinking about Jing Jing

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,920
Aunt, look

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,360
Look, you have me

72
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
I am with you

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,580
Mr. Jian

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
Can I have a few minutes with you?

75
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,260
Sure

76
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,300
What's up?

77
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,000
I negotiated with my former colleague again

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
He still expects
a cooperation with Yann Coffee

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,960
So he can give us another 15% discount

80
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,120
Although it's still a little higher
than the price of Yunnan beans

81
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,680
in terms of cost performance
it's a good choice

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
I was just about to tell you this

83
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
I have decided to use Qiao Xi Chen's beans

84
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
Convey my thank to your former colleague

85
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,720
- Thanks for your hard work too
- Mr. Jian

86
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,480
Can I know the reason?

87
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,860
Yunnan beans look good
and the price is favorable

88
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,160
But the beans from my friend
are of better grade

89
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,080
If the price goes down another 15%
it's within our cost range

90
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,200
Mr. Jian, I know that cost is important

91
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,040
But isn't quality supposed
to be more important?

92
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,420
That's right

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Quality is always Yann Coffee's concern

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,640
If your friend is really selling
AA grade Kenya coffee beans

95
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,260
at this price

96
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
I will not refuse

97
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,940
Mr. Jian

98
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,159
What do you mean?

99
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
The report
from the R&D department is released

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Your friend isn't selling
AA grade Kenya coffee beans

101
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
They were actually sourced from Yunnan

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,180
It's absolutely impossible

103
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
He has been doing business with Kenya

104
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
He'll never purchase domestic coffee beans

105
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
There must be some misunderstanding

106
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,560
I'm not sure about this

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,640
But as far as I can tell
R&D department seldom makes mistakes

108
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,200
So you should ask your friend this question

109
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,060
Mr. Jian

110
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,020
Give me some time to figure it out, okay?

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,720
It's okay, this has been decided

112
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,720
All the best for next time

113
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,000
Mr. Jian, you're surprisingly on time

114
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
Stop calling me that

115
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,280
What do I call you then? Xiao Jian?

116
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,420
How about having northeastern cuisine?

117
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,860
I know there is
an authentic restaurant nearby

118
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,020
Also, it's cheap

119
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:04,940
Let's go

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,140
Why are you holding my hand?

121
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,360
No. What's wrong with me
holding my girlfriend's hand?

122
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,840
Don't worry
I'll get on the elevator right away

123
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,780
I am already here, bye

124
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
Hello

125
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,340
Xiao Jian

126
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,580
Keep it on the down-low
Look, that was so close

127
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, but I think
only holding hands is discreet enough

128
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,000
Discreet my foot! Listen

129
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,100
How is this considered low-key?
Stop doing all these

130
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm going out now

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,540
In a minute, you'll...

132
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,540
Listen

133
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,780
Three minutes

134
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,880
This place looks good
the food looks appetizing

135
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,240
Of course, the owner is
originally from northeast China

136
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
Come on

137
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,280
Dumplings with Chinese sauerkraut!

138
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,020
- Feel free to order if you want more
- Thank you, brother!

139
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
No problem, sister!

140
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,240
Do all northerners
have dumplings on all festivals?

141
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,160
Of course, the only day we don't have it
is Valentine's Day

142
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,400
- Aren't Beijingers the same?
- I'm not a Beijinger

143
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,800
Talking about festivals, this came to me

144
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,660
On the 15th day of the first lunar month

145
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,900
my neighbor took pity on me
for staying home alone

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,720
So he brought me
a bowl of glutinous rice dumplings

147
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,220
What I'd have on the Spring Festival
is a bowl of glutinous rice dumplings

148
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,980
What are you doing?

149
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,420
I'm checking how to make
delicious glutinous rice dumplings for you

150
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,060
What's up?

151
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,760
Do you think you're blessed
to have a girlfriend like me?

152
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,320
Well, stop checking it
Eat now and we'll talk about it later

153
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,900
Sure, let's eat

154
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
Here

155
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
- Eat it raw?
- Yes

156
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,520
It's really unique

157
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,300
Not bad!

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,440
(Remembrance of Things Past)

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,420
Son, lunchs ready!

160
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,160
Today, your mother has a lunch engagement

161
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,280
I made the noodles
with soy bean paste for you

162
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
Shen Zi Chang!

163
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Have noodles!

164
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,120
The noodles are going to be soggy!

165
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,560
I'm going in!

166
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,600
Zi Chang

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Have lunch!

168
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
Come on, why are you being downcast?

169
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,080
It's just a quarrel between couples

170
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
You're not going to work because of this

171
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
No wonder your mom is angry with you

172
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,640
What does this have to do with me?

173
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,080
- Are you giving me your attitude?
- I wouldn't dare

174
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,120
Anyway, I'm not getting married

175
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,800
I'll just stay at home from now on
Don't disapprove of me

176
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,080
Are you blaming me and your mom for this?

177
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,900
I know you and Mom never approve of her

178
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,420
I have been with her for so many years

179
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
Mom has never showed the slightest kindness
when she came over

180
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,840
Hasn't Xu Yan been swallowing it?

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,440
Who is actually the one going to marry her?

182
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,960
Does Mom want to screw up our relationship?

183
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Says who?

184
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,440
All she did was asking us
not to buy a house, doesn't she mean that?

185
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Can your mom separate you
from Xu Yan with just that few words?

186
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, let me tell you why your mom opposes it

187
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,920
I'm done. I can't eat anymore

188
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,180
Well, Mr. Jian
It'll do as long as you're satisfied

189
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,760
Have you told Lin Rui about the beans?

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,760
- Yes
- He must be depressed now

191
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,800
Look, he was very competitive
when he was still a student

192
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,880
I guess he had an easy ride abroad, too

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,720
But in Yann Coffee, he's encountered
several setbacks one after another

194
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
Are you jealous?

195
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,500
Are you?

196
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
Do you think that I care about him?

197
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,580
Why are you so cute?

198
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Whoops, let's put it a stop

199
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,560
You are so cute
that I almost forgot the matter

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,620
Mr. Jian, here's the thing
I would like to have your permission on this

201
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
Can I have Miao Miao in my project?

202
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
Do you think you can't handle it on your own?

203
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, the time is tight
and the task is urgent

204
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,440
We have to use the new beans
I really can't handle it alone

205
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,340
Miao Miao has a particular advantage

206
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,480
She's got a way with people

207
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,400
She's on good terms
with everyone in the company

208
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,400
regardless of their departments

209
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,600
If I have her in my project

210
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,600
to communicate with others
it can make things a lot easier

211
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,260
I do have some selfish motive

212
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Miao Miao entered Yann Coffee
almost the same time with me

213
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
She's still a third-level employee
after so long

214
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,880
She can have more year-end bonuses
if she joins more projects

215
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,240
It's good, isn't it?

216
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,880
- Have you forgotten about Su Qing?
- Su Qing...

217
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,480
How is this the same? Miao Miao is my friend

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,720
Do you think there are
pure friendships in the workplace?

219
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,340
Are you affected by TV series?

220
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,220
Why can't there be pure friendships
in the workplace?

221
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,480
In principle, there can be

222
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,100
Okay, thank you, Mr. Jian

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,990
So this is actually a treat with an agenda

224
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,820
Come on, how can I do this to my boyfriend?
Cheers

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,020
This is our savings all these years

226
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,640
There are 200,000 yuan in this account
and 250,000 yuan in this

227
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,060
In these cards are your mom's and my salaries

228
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,240
Deducting daily expenses
we don't have much left every month

229
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,880
Wait, Dad

230
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,620
This is the amount we have
after saving for so many years?

231
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,840
Your mom and I wanted to buy you a new house

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Whenever there is a new property
we'll check it out immediately

233
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,200
But you know the housing price in Beijing

234
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,740
We wanted to buy one

235
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,000
but we really can't afford it

236
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,600
- How about selling this one?
- No way!

237
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,340
Well

238
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,080
I've discussed with your mom
We're going to sell this apartment

239
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
Together with our savings

240
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,700
we can surely pay the down payment

241
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,180
The thing is, you refused to live with us
as soon as we mentioned it

242
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,420
So, are you going to live in the new house

243
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,940
while your mother and I
live in a rented place?

244
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,300
Dad, we didn't mean that

245
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,160
I wasn't aware of our family's condition

246
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,220
Silly boy

247
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,680
Your mother is just an ordinary
elementary school teacher

248
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,880
Your dad, I, am just a logistics worker

249
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,460
How much money can we earn?

250
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,180
What's more

251
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,080
your grandparents are aged

252
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,300
We need to support them, right?

253
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
It's a huge monthly expenditure

254
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,000
It's not easy that we managed
to save so much money

255
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,040
I never heard it from you and Mom

256
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,000
Your mom hates being look down on

257
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,940
Will she tell you with Xu Yan around?
If she does

258
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,839
you'll always feel inferior

259
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,619
before your in-laws after you've got married

260
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,800
We might not be able to get married

261
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,040
Well, we'll sell this place

262
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,000
With this money, we'll buy two apartments
with smaller areas

263
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,680
You and Xu Yan will live in the city
while your mom and I

264
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
will buy a house in Yanjiao

265
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,640
Yanjiao housing prices are low

266
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,080
No way

267
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,880
Mom and you have never lived
in the area outside the Third Ring Road

268
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,640
How can you sell the house
and live in Yanjiao just for our sake?

269
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,120
Well, you didn't forget about us
You're indeed my son

270
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,840
Dad, leave it

271
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,100
I'll find a way out

272
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,060
Have your lunch now, try my sauce

273
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,800
What are you doing?

274
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,880
Aunt, are you going home
during the Spring Festival?

275
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,780
Yes, if I'm not busy

276
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,860
Will Aunt Jing Jing come back with you?

277
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,120
She promised to buy me Orb

278
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
What is that?

279
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,520
It's Ultraman Orb

280
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,220
Don't you know this?

281
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,200
I miss Aunt Jing Jing

282
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,140
I'll buy you one

283
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,640
What's the name?

284
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
- Orb
- Orb

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,260
Jia Jia, take this with you

286
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,860
- Dad, I don't want money. I have it
- It's not money

287
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
What's that?

288
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,780
Zhong Kui, I drew it for you

289
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,880
It can keep you safe from disasters and evils

290
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,600
Put it in a frame after you're home

291
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,460
Then, hang it on the wall

292
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,920
This is superstitious
Forget about these useless things

293
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
How is this superstitious?

294
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,240
Does it work?

295
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
You girl

296
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,160
You didn't even bring a down jacket, take it

297
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,420
If you don't like it
throw it away when you reach Beijing

298
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,940
Stop doing these
are you trying to make me cry?

299
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,800
Sorry

300
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,720
Well, it looks festive

301
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,120
But to be honest

302
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,440
If you didn't come back, I wouldn't
be able to change your aunt's mind

303
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,540
She is just

304
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,960
unable to get over it

305
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
No one can get over this easily

306
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,500
Yes

307
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,460
Go to her when you're free

308
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,460
Just listen to her, whether she
wants to bang on about it or cry

309
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,820
Listening to her will do the trick

310
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,320
I know, don't worry

311
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,380
Actually...

312
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,440
What's lacking?

313
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,560
No, everything is here

314
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,800
Mom, Dad, come here

315
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,860
Sorry, I was wrong

316
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
Get off!

317
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,120
That's all you can say, that's annoying!

318
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
Then what do you want to hear?

319
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,760
I want you to disappear

320
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,660
Invisibility

321
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,400
What are you doing? Are you sick?

322
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,600
You can still see me?

323
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,280
I am using my invisibility technique

324
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,800
Childish

325
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Freeze!

326
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,200
Shen Zi Chang

327
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,720
See a doctor if something is wrong with you
Don't pester me!

328
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,540
Thinking about you is driving me crazy

329
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,920
Xu Yan, I was wrong

330
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,200
But you misunderstood my mom
Can you let me explain it?

331
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,880
I've made a reservation
in your favorite Japanese restaurant

332
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,540
I've booked a table

333
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,160
Please?

334
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,160
Unfreeze me then

335
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,180
Okay

336
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,620
Let's go

337
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,380
What a lunatic

338
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
Dad, Mom, here's the list

339
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,360
of my bank card numbers

340
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,800
These three

341
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,700
The three passwords
correspond to the three bank cards above

342
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,840
Next are the two insurances I bought

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,960
There are two contacts at the back
Call the numbers if you have questions

344
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,520
In addition, I have three funds

345
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,120
- They are these three
- Hold on

346
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,120
What are you up to?

347
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,560
You're arranging things
as if you were about to leave us

348
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,760
Did something happen?

349
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,520
Whatever it is, you have to tell us

350
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,240
Don't follow Jing Jing's footsteps
We can't stand it

351
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,520
Be relieved, I'm fine

352
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,180
I just want to take this opportunity
to let you know these

353
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,220
It doesn't hurt, does it?

354
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,580
- What if...
- What if?

355
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,780
Mind what you're saying!

356
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,760
Touch wood, say again!

357
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,800
Dad, we never know what will happen tomorrow

358
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,620
Things are out of our control

359
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,420
I'm at ease after telling you these

360
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,600
Just bear these in mind

361
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,640
-Jia Jia, this...
- Enough said

362
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,720
I got it

363
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,640
Say it, I'll remember it

364
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,600
The following are
the payment passwords of my Alipay

365
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,320
and my WeChat Pay accounts

366
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,560
You can read these two with glasses

367
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,560
Anyway, just don't lose this paper

368
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,520
Xu Yan, my mom didn't mean to piss you off

369
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,020
She doesn't despise you

370
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,680
My family really can't
afford another property

371
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,680
We can't move in
and get my parents to live elsewhere

372
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,460
We won't be at ease, right?

373
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,600
I know you don't want to live with my parents

374
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,020
So I've come out with a solution

375
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,410
We'll rent a big apartment, okay?

376
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,400
As the saying goes, renting a house
doesn't mean renting the life

377
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,080
Shen Zi Chang, are you trying to deceive me?

378
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,560
Beijingers have so many properties

379
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,740
Why don't you even have one?

380
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,040
You have to ask my parents

381
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,520
What's more

382
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,520
being a Beijinger doesn't
mean one is earning more

383
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,480
That's really an accusation

384
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
You are so annoying!
How do I tell my mom about this?

385
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,620
You don't have to tell her
Ask her to come to me, I'll tell her

386
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,540
Come on. What's the point?

387
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,860
Let's forget about getting married for now

388
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,060
Why?

389
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
This is the outcome of our talk?

390
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,800
I mean "for now"

391
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,760
Since we can't depend on our parents
let's depend on ourselves

392
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,140
How?

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,640
I made a calculation few days ago

394
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,200
If we buy a property
outside the Fourth Ring Road

395
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
the down payment will be two million yuan

396
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,040
Together with the savings from our moms

397
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,660
we'll spend as little money as possible
and work hard

398
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,400
Then, we'll be able to pay
the down payment in five years

399
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,640
What?

400
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Hey, you only need to save 6,000 yuan a month

401
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,780
I'm earning only 8,000 yuan a month

402
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,020
You commute to work on public transport
and live with your parents

403
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,080
You don't have other expenditures
Two thousand yuan a month is enough, right?

404
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,340
I have to save 5,000 yuan a month

405
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,460
I save less because my salary is lower

406
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,280
That way, we're saving
more than 10,000 yuan every month

407
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
I've made up my mind

408
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
I'll work hard

409
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,840
Someday, we will be able
to buy our property without anyone's help

410
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,220
You are great

411
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,880
Don't be so sentimental
Let's have our lunch!

412
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,080
No! We have to be pinch pennies, right?

413
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,800
We'll have instant noodles at home

414
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,400
- Do we have to start now?
- Who is the boss?

415
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,440
Alright. Let's have instant noodles

416
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,980
Why is it...

417
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,840
- Who is it?
- Hi!

418
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,220
- Are you drinking?
- Go over

419
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,260
Here! I am already here

420
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,800
Why are you drinking alone?

421
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,540
- Mind your own business
- When did you reach home?

422
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,260
Just now

423
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,140
Why are you here?

424
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,280
Nothing. I was just jogging downstairs
and saw your light on

425
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,820
So I came up for a break

426
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,180
- You were jogging?
- Yes

427
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,340
You're tired and come here for a break

428
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,260
Is my house a stadium?

429
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,500
What are you doing here?

430
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,760
Well

431
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,840
There is a new escape room
Fancy going with me?

432
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,380
Dear me!

433
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,680
- I don't have time, leave now
- Wait

434
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,820
What about a murder mystery game?
My friend just opened one. You'll like that

435
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,660
Hey! Are you going with me?

436
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,060
We'll see

437
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,880
It's a deal! I'll let you know
after making the reservation. Goodbye

438
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,540
Wait

439
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,740
"We'll see" means I may not go

440
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,360
Are you smoke?

441
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,140
- Hi, Madam Lu
- Hi

442
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,820
- Hi, Madam Lu!
- Hi

443
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,180
- Hi, Madam Lu
- Hi

444
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,520
Hi, everyone!

445
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,600
- Hi, Madam Lu!
- It's been a long time

446
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,480
Please sit down, don't delay your work

447
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,700
- Just sit down
- Sister Ning

448
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,960
- Hey, you are getting prettier
- Thank you

449
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
I ordered some drinks
for our department staff

450
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,120
and I left your phone number as the contact

451
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,640
- Can you pick it up later and distribute it?
- No problem

452
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,480
Hi, Yi Ning

453
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Why is Yi Ning back suddenly?

454
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,480
Beats me

455
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
I guess she just swings by

456
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,460
Will it...

457
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,280
The delivery is probably here

458
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,380
I need to collect it

459
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Hello

460
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,940
Brother Qiang

461
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Who is this woman?

462
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,640
She is the former director
of the marketing department, Lu Yi Ning

463
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
It'll be interesting

464
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
What do you think they are talking about?

465
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,080
Anyway, they are surely
not discussing her child

466
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,900
She's cute

467
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,120
but it is never easy to raise a child

468
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,920
I don't even dare to delay coming back
in order to bring home the bacon

469
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,800
Yi Ning, you don't have to rush it

470
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,640
We're not a brutal company

471
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,040
Of course I know this

472
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,780
However, I was born to be a busy bee

473
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,680
Besides, I don't feel at ease resting at home

474
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,700
In fact, Mr. Jiang has
briefed me his arrangement for you

475
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
We are currently the co-directors
of the marketing department

476
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,720
I have divided the department into two groups

477
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,360
The first group is in charge of the marketing
and promotion of existing products

478
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,260
The second group is in charge of the
promotion and development of new products

479
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,480
You're a veteran here
and know the products better

480
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,560
So please take care of Wu Tian Qiang's group

481
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,980
You're taking me as a stranger

482
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,600
Yann Coffee is just like my child

483
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,880
I watch it growing step by step

484
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,920
Besides, I'm also the director
of the marketing department

485
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,240
This is part of my job

486
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Mr. Jian, you're new here

487
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,040
Feel free to come to me
if you need any clarification

488
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,500
I'll surely tell you everything I know

489
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,120
Although it's just a few months
since I joined Yann Coffee

490
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,400
I've dealt with Yann Coffee
when I was at Wake Coffee

491
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,240
As the saying goes

492
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,100
the person who knows you the best
may not be yourself but your opponent

493
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,980
I'm sure I have a sound understanding
about Yann Coffee

494
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,960
Well, Sai Wen
Mr. Jian will continue using this office room

495
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,560
Take it as my courtesy as the host

496
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Could you please get me another room?

497
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
Yi Ning, I thought you were dropping by

498
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,960
- So I didn't have time to...
- It's fine

499
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,060
- Is the small conference room empty?
- Yes

500
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,980
- I'll use it for the time being
- Sure

501
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
I'll go say hello to the rest

502
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
- Take your time
- Sure

503
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,200
I thought you had reached an agreement
with Lu Yi Ning before I came

504
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,420
This was what Old President Han meant

505
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,860
She was pregnant

506
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,380
We were worried it'd affect her child
if she got agitated when we told her directly

507
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,120
So, we told her
that you would be the acting director

508
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
and we'd discuss it again
after her maternity leave

509
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,980
I got it

510
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
If I were her
I wouldn't relinquish it willingly, too

511
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,180
She is really desperate

512
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,280
She gave birth to a child
and we extended her maternity leave

513
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,680
But she didn't even take an extra day off

514
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,560
I don't know what she wants

515
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,880
How long do you think
this situation will last?

516
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Old President Han definitely
wants it to end as soon as possible

517
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
However, it still depends on Lu Yi Ning

518
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,940
Anyway

519
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
we don't want to fall out with her

520
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,520
In fact, she is taking
the rough with the smooth

521
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,600
Can you bring my message to President Han?

522
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,120
Tell him not to worry
I'll handle this matter

523
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,560
Don't worry

524
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,000
If Lu Yi Ning really wants to go against you

525
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,420
Old President Han and I
are definitely on your side

526
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,719
- But Mr. Jiang...
- Don't worry, I won't push her too hard

527
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,440
It really surprises me
that you're in great condition, that's great

528
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm coming back for the war. I have to

529
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,239
Honestly speaking
this is the current situation in the company

530
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,440
I've told you
and you should know about it by now

531
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,980
If we want to turn the tables
we have to join hands

532
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,780
Mr. Jiang, thank you for your trust

533
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,699
In fact, this is

534
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,000
also my last chance

535
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,360
I won't let you down

536
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,100
That's great

537
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,040
You know what? I promoted you
to be the marketing director

538
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,440
because of your unwillingness to admit defeat

539
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,120
Of course
your professional abilities as well

540
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,219
In fact, there are rumors out there

541
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,800
that as the son-in-law of the Han family

542
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,720
I am sitting on this position today
all because of Han Yi Ting

543
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,280
We are old friends

544
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,600
I don't have to hide it

545
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,310
That's true

546
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,840
But since I have come this far today

547
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,400
it won't be so easy to pull me down

548
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,880
I agree with you on this

549
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,400
Since Old President Han
values Jian Yi Fan so much

550
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,700
we have to let him know

551
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
that he bet on the wrong horse

552
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,080
My old friend, happy cooperation

553
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,320
- The issue is over
- You know what?

554
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
It's really scary

555
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,390
That's right. You have to thank me!

556
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,060
- Sure!
- Thank you, leader

557
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,900
Then again...

558
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,500
Lu Yi Ning is back

559
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,380
Make a guess

560
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,280
Since Lu Yi Ning is back

561
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,360
is it the time for Jian Yi Fan to leave?

562
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,120
It's hard to gauge

563
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Mr. Jian was personally
recruited by Old President Han

564
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,440
while Yi Ning is a veteran at Yann Coffee

565
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,920
and she has the support of Mr. Jiang

566
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,300
It's hard to tell

567
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,580
- who will be the winner
- If you ask me

568
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Lu Yi Ning has a better chance of winning

569
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,740
Think about this

570
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,520
Without absolute confidence
would she dare to come back?

571
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,880
She won't take action without a clear target

572
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,740
- Right?
- That's right

573
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,400
Let me help you

574
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,700
- This way
- Thanks

575
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
- Put it here
- Okay

576
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,580
- Feel free to call me if you need anything
- Okay

577
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,080
- May I know who you are?
- I forgot to introduce myself

578
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,440
I am the new marketing specialist, Lin Rui

579
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,860
You are a newcomer

580
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,240
Were you recruited by Jian Yi Fan?

581
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,180
Not really

582
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,160
I submitted the application
for the manager position

583
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,240
However, Mr. Jian thought I'd been abroad

584
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,040
and didn't have a sound understanding
of the domestic situation

585
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,600
So, he let me start from a specialist

586
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,440
You studied abroad?

587
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,720
Yes. I worked in a foreign coffee company
for two years

588
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,620
Nice!

589
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,960
Yann Coffee values talents. Do you best

590
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,520
That's right

591
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,660
Of course, a discerning leader
like you is also important

592
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,080
I have a package in the utility room

593
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,200
Okay, I'll help you carry it

594
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,040
Feel free to let me know if you need anything

595
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
(Remembrance of Things Past)

596
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,920
The domestic sperm banks?

597
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,300
There are

598
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,320
But currently
the domestic artificial insemination

599
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,020
is only accessible to infertile couples

600
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,760
Artificial insemination out of wedlock

601
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,280
doesn't meet the legal requirements now

602
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,240
Do you mean I have to get married
if I want artificial insemination?

603
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,760
Theoretically, yes

604
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,320
And in principle, unless your legal spouse
is absolute infertile

605
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,920
or has a serious mental or genetic disorder

606
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,640
you can only use his sperms

607
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,820
Well

608
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,120
How about the situation abroad?
Do you know it?

609
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,500
If you're in another country

610
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,300
the restrictions might be relatively looser

611
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,700
However, I don't recommend
you doing it abroad

612
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,820
unless you plan to migrate

613
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,080
I know you are asking this
because of the issue I told you last time

614
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,680
But I'd recommend you
to try natural conception first

615
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,780
It would be better
either for your health or for your baby

616
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,640
That's right. Okay, I should leave now

617
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,100
I got it, thank you

618
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,480
I'll send you a message if I have any issues

619
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,020
Goodbye

620
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,360
(Ou Yang)

621
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,120
- What's up?
- Can you tell me

622
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,640
if you prefer the mystery or martial arts?

623
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,240
Didn't I tell you I'm busy? I'm not going

624
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,920
You agreed to play the murder mystery game
with me. I'm choosing the theme

625
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,780
My goodness

626
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,160
Trust me once, you'll like it

627
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm not going! I don't have time

628
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,020
How about this? We'll go there directly

629
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,140
We'll just leave, if you don't like it, okay?

630
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,840
Why are you so cheerful every day?
What makes you so happy?

631
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,120
You answered my call, that's why I'm happy

632
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,480
- Martial arts
- Okay. No problem

633
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,060
Wait

634
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,960
What look is this? You have to put the wig on

635
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,200
Look, just like me

636
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,860
It's uncomfortable. You can just look at this

637
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,780
No. It's called immersive murder mystery game

638
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,240
You have to put it on
to get into the character

639
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
- I can get into it. Hurry up
- Look here

640
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,080
Listen. We might not
be in the same team later

641
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,860
In that case, I'm unable to help you

642
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,360
Do you know everyone here?

643
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,840
Yes. They are my friends

644
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,160
friends of my friends

645
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,860
and friends of my friend's friends

646
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,800
Guys, let's go in

647
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,200
- Let's go
- Okay

648
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,040
From now on, I'll immerse myself in the role

649
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,360
I can be the eagle

650
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,680
How was that? Am I good?

651
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,160
Yes, you are. You are sweaty

652
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,340
Put your clothes on. Don't catch a cold

653
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,500
- Put it on
- My dear loves me the most

654
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
I don't love you, I love money

655
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,020
We have to go hospital if you fall sick
That costs money

656
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,440
Have some water

657
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,000
Okay!

658
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,720
Shen Zi Chang, what is this?

659
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,560
I was thirsty and it looked so tempting
So, I bought a can

660
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,240
Why did you choose coke over water?

661
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,360
This doesn't cost much

662
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,040
It doesn't cost much? It's still money!

663
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,880
I get off the subway one stop earlier

664
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,760
to save on the ticket fare
After buying this, the saved money is gone

665
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,120
Well, since this coke is hateful
I'll take it as my deadly enemy, okay?

666
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,720
From now on, it is my sworn enemy

667
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
If I drink it again
I will be choked to death, okay?

668
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,040
Touch wood!

669
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
Just bear it in mind

670
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,880
- Why are we suffering now?
- It is for the happiness in the future

671
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,620
These words are engraved in my mind

672
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,280
That's more like it

673
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,740
Xu Yan, you are here

674
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,200
We just finished a game and we are going
for hot pot. Fancy joining us?

675
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,260
Okay

676
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,040
Looks like we can't make it

677
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,000
You look more like a couple of lovebirds
than me who just got married

678
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,580
I give up. Alright

679
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,880
Brothers, let's go. They are not going
Let's have hot pot

680
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,240
- Let's go!
- Let's go

681
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,340
Goodbye

682
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,100
- Enjoy your meal
- Okay

683
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,900
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

684
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,220
Get off!
You disregard everything I say, right?

685
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,140
- Hum
- Hum what?

686
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,160
Cut down on all social engagements, got it?

687
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,640
If you really crave for it, go to your mom

688
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,240
I can cook for you too

689
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,520
No. What's wrong with me
hanging out with my friends?

690
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,740
- We just want to have a chat
- What's wrong?

691
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,120
Is it a must to have a meal while chatting?

692
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,340
Qiao Xi Chen and I can sit there and chat
all afternoon with just a cup of milk tea

693
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,520
Alright. You and Qiao Xi Chen
are great, okay?

694
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,220
From now on, I'll stop taking cokes

695
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,280
and avoid all these
expensive engagements. Okay?

696
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,300
Let's go home

697
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,440
- Let's go. Hurry up
- Let's go

698
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,560
Everyone, our second round
of discussion has begun

699
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,020
Let's start with the Little Dragon Maiden

700
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,920
Little Dragon Maiden, it's your time to speak

701
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm sorry

702
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,140
Let me read it. I have to tell
whether I am the killer, right?

703
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,620
I am not the killer
Look, Little Dragon Maiden

704
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,100
was cooking sticky dumplings
yesterday midnight

705
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,380
Why was I cooking sticky dumplings
in the middle of night?

706
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,640
It is not Little Dragon Maiden, right?

707
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,520
Alright, next

708
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,000
Alright, next

709
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,540
Why do you laugh?

710
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,220
The vehicles are making a right turn
Please pay attention

711
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,700
Baby, why don't we take a taxi?
It's been 20 minutes

712
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,400
It's peak hour, there are traffic jams

713
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,260
Taking a taxi costs 50 yuan

714
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,880
It's not worth it. The bus will be here soon

715
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,400
It's worth it, it's cold

716
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,840
I just finished playing basketball
and the wind blows through my clothes

717
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,380
I told you not to play basketball
during the cold weather

718
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,620
What if you get injured?

719
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,540
Stop, I can still stand the cold

720
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,820
I'll cook isatidis for you when we are home

721
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,140
Okay

722
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,200
But baby, there isn't much money
we're able to save in a year

723
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,220
You don't have to
put so much pressure on yourself

724
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,860
We should live in the moment

725
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,200
Shen Zi Chang, stop saying this

726
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,860
- Are you reluctant to marry me?
- No. Of course I want to marry you

727
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,960
- Fine. I'll just shut up
- You'd better do so

728
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,340
Look. I told you it was coming

729
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,060
I told you
Luckily, we didn't take a taxi. Let's go

730
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,380
Hey, here

731
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,800
- Hi, Mr. Jian
- Hi, Madam Lu

732
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,460
I hope you can pass the project

733
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,760
of Pink Ribbon Care Fund to me

734
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Why?

735
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,880
Does the sun rise in the east?

736
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,640
Looks like I am more influential
in the breast cancer campaign

737
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,490
As far as I know
breast cancer is not only found in women

738
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,080
Men can get breast cancer too

739
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,720
I have been following up
this project for two years

740
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,340
But I nailed it down

741
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,300
Madam Lu

742
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,740
I know this kind of charity collaboration

743
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,120
is the great opportunity
to improve the brand reputation

744
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,440
I do agree with your previous strategies

745
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,960
However, there seemed
to be communication issues

746
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,600
that you weren't able
to settle it in two years

747
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,920
For the sake of the company's interest

748
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,380
I think I am the better
person in-charge for this project

749
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,880
Well, Mr. Jian, since you said so

750
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,940
then I wish you good luck

751
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,100
Madam Lu

752
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Do you think the world is fair?

753
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,080
Are you interested in the position
of marketing manager?

754
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,340
You may also know

755
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,280
that there is no retreat for me this time

756
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,400
Either Jian Yi Fan

757
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
or I have to leave

758
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,880
The lactation period can only
protect me for seven months at most

759
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,980
I don't have much time

760
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,340
Don't worry about me, just enjoy yourself

761
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,300
You are not there
Why should I play with them?

762
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,480
I'm sorry, I'm not good at this

763
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,140
It's fine

764
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,140
We can try escape room next time
You will definitely like it

765
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,860
Forget it. I don't like answering questions
It is the side effect of taking exams

766
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
What about exercise?
What exercise are you good at?

767
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,520
Jogging, swimming, badminton

768
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,140
yoga, mountain climbing and triathlon
Choose one and I'll join you

769
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,620
Let me ask you a question

770
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,660
Are you hell-bent on courting me?

771
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,600
Of course not. I'm already doing it

772
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,820
We are not a good match

773
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,840
- In what area?
- What do you think?

774
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,760
Don't mention our ages to me

775
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,920
It doesn't work for me at all

776
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,840
We have to be our own people
when it comes to relationship

777
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,960
- Okay. I'll mention something else
- Shoot

778
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,540
We have different hobbies
I am not good at what you like

779
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,220
Listen, it's impossible

780
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,760
I have a wide range of hobbies

781
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,520
Just tell me what you like
I'll definitely like it too

782
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,000
That's not the way!

783
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,740
This is me all over. Let's go

784
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,380
What's going on? Are you hungry?

785
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,200
- No
- Do you want an egg pancake?

786
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,140
There was a stall selling this in front
of my former place, it was delicious

787
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,200
Let's go find it

788
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,760
Forget it. It's been more than a decade
It's surely closed

789
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,700
We won't know until we're there

790
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,580
Let's go. Where is the car key?

791
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,600
Read this!

792
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,040
An employee reported sexual harassment
by a male supervisor in real name

793
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,700
A real-name whistle-blower? That's insane!

794
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,420
Yann Coffee?

795
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,800
- Isn't it above our company?
- Yes, that's the one

796
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,800
I heard it's a person named Jian something

797
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,200
I don't know in which department he is

798
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,240
- This issue...
- Thank you and take care. It's hot

799
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,640
He works at Yann Coffee

800
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,960
(Yann Coffee's female employee
reported sexual harassment)

801
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,880
What's up?

802
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,620
Jian Yi Fan was summoned
by Mr. Jiang early this morning

803
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,600
You have nothing to do with this
Are you being stupid?

804
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,540
Mind your own business

805
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,080
I know your relationship with Jian Yi Fan

806
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,800
But you have to stay out of it
since it's come to this stage

807
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,820
- This is for your own good
- Thank you

808
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,440
- But I don't need it
- Qiao Qiao!

809
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,700
They asked you to go to the meeting room

810
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,500
Have you read the hot searched news
in the morning?

811
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,260
- Yes
- Okay

812
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,040
Then, I won't beat around the bush

813
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,320
Do you have much contact with Jian Yi Fan

814
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,560
- since he joined Yann Coffee?
- Yes, we've been in contact

815
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,200
Did he... Let me be straight forward

816
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,280
Has he ever done something
that made you feel uncomfortable?

817
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,080
Are you asking if he harassed me?

818
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
You can say that

819
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,780
You don't need to have any worries

820
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,400
As the standard procedure, we're asking
all females in the marketing department

821
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
If he truly did so

822
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,940
- from the view of the company, we will...
- No, absolutely not

823
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,160
Although Mr. Jian likes to joke with us

824
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,640
he has never done
anything disrespectful to females

825
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,460
Besides, I don't think he is someone
who will harass his subordinates

826
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,200
Okay. I got it

827
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,420
May I know

828
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,720
who is the whistle-blower?

829
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,260
It's not for us to say

830
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,780
Okay

831
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,700
This gives me a headache too

832
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,360
Personally, I'm willing to trust you

833
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,280
But the word has been spread
I can't just stand aloof

834
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,120
- I hope you can understand
- I understand

835
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,280
I'm not bothered by something I've never done

836
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,940
It's the best if you think so

837
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,580
After thinking about it
I think you'd better take a break

838
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,420
and wait until the truth is uncovered

839
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,840
Is this a punishment?

840
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,500
Of course not

841
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,800
Do you think this is a punishment?

842
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,580
If it is, you're not just taking a break

843
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,280
This issue has gone viral online

844
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,880
It's bad for the company's reputation

845
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,300
I'm asking you to do so
to protect the company

846
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,480
but also to protect you

847
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,800
You don't want the staff to fling
all sorts of accusations at you, right?

848
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,920
Mr. Jiang, thank you for thinking about me

849
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,180
Also

850
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,240
hand over the Pink Ribbon project
to Lu Yi Ning for the time being

851
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,940
This is sensitive

852
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,040
It is under the Women Rights
Protection Organization

853
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,940
No problem

854
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,720
I'll hand it over. Don't worry, Mr. Jiang

855
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,060
Don't feel stressed. I promise you

856
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,000
the company will clear your name
after the truth is discovered

857
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,300
- But if...
- I won't bother the company

858
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,120
Give me a week to prove my innocence

859
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,440
If I fail

860
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,120
I'll resign

861
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,600
- Alright. You have a week's time
- Thank you

862
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,060
Ou Yang

863
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,660
Where is Jian Yi Fan?

864
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,300
Beats me

865
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,260
I don't know. Why?

866
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,260
What are you doing?

867
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,220
Mr. Jian asked me to pack his stuff
because he is going on leave

868
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,460
Going on leave?

869
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,060
Where are you going to meet?

870
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,960
He said we'll meet in the parking area

871
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,780
Hey! Wait for me!

872
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,840
What are you doing?

873
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,560
When are you going to tell me
if I didn't come to you?

874
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,920
I just talked to Mr. Jiang
and was about to go to you

875
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,180
- Qiao Qiao, I...
- I trust you

876
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,820
They talked to everyone

877
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,400
I know you were framed

878
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,760
And I believe other staff members
have the same thoughts like me

879
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,420
Don't worry

880
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,340
I am not worried

881
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,040
Why should I be worried
about something I didn't do?

882
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,900
I still want to thank you

883
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,460
You don't know
how important your words are to me

884
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,580
I didn't see anything

885
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,300
Even if you see it, so what?

886
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm not afraid even if the whole company
learns of our relationship now

887
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,700
What's on your mind now?

888
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,020
Who do you think is the one who set you up?

889
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,500
Will it be someone
from the marketing department?

890
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,980
I'm serious. What are you laughing at?

891
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,180
Crying can't solve the problem

892
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,700
Don't worry, I will find a way

893
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,200
Mr. Jiang gave me one week's time
to prove my innocence

894
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,800
How are you going to prove that?
How can I help you?

895
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,720
All you need to do is
continue with your own work

896
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,600
Don't get into a fight
with anyone because of me

897
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,160
Remember, Lu Yi Ning is now
in charge of the marketing department

898
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,440
I'm afraid she will target you
if she knows our relationship

899
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,040
- I'm not afraid of that
- But I am

900
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,420
It's more scary than seeing myself
on the hot search

901
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,680
There are only few gossips
circulating in the company

902
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,100
If someone dares to gossip about you
I'll go and...

903
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,360
Promise me

904
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,920
Don't be impulsive, okay?

905
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,220
I give you my promise
but you'll give me yours too

906
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,240
No matter what happens, you must let me know

907
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,000
I may not be able to help you
but I can stay with you, right?

908
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,720
I promise

909
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,360
You have to give me your promise, got it?

910
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,020
- I promise you
- I was so worried

911
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,100
Okay, I still have a lot on my plate

912
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,960
Work hard. Don't worry about me, got it?

913
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,340
Go

914
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,720
Handsome, want a ride?

915
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,200
Do you still insist that

916
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,560
there are pure friendships in the workplace?

917
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,500
Let's go

918
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,020
What's the big deal?

919
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,780
Let me know if you need my help

920
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,320
I don't know anything
about photo or audio editing

921
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,720
but I have buddies who are good at these

922
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,720
If you want to crack passwords
or something, I can help, too

923
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,960
That's illegal

924
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,240
A false accusation is also illegal

925
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,120
You trust me?

926
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,040
Why?

927
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,020
Why? You're so funny

928
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,940
Those netizens don't know you but I do

929
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,760
Are they staying with you all the time? No

930
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,300
But I do, so I think I have more say

931
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,600
As if we're in an illicit relationship

932
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,940
Do you know what my grandpa often tells me?

933
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,760
Evil never wins

934
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,180
Thank your grandpa for me

935
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,400
Do you really have a friend
doing audio analysis?

936
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,900
You can count on me

937
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,420
Just wait and see

938
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,780
Do you still insist that

939
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,460
there are pure friendships in the workplace?

940
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,520
(Miao Miao)
(I didn't see you in the office)

941
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,000
(Are you not feeling well? Sick?)

942
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,520
(Miao Miao)

943
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,940
- Just this?
- Just what? Cut to the chase

944
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,020
This audio clip is obviously edited

945
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,860
The editing points aren't smooth

946
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,480
You want to present it as evidence?

947
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,360
Alright, stop being complacent

948
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,920
I guessed this

949
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,780
Can you revert them to the original?

950
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,800
Do you mean

951
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,280
trimming them into different clips?

952
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,700
It can be done, but what can it help?

953
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,580
I want to check the source of these audios

954
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,340
Do you mean these audio clips
may not be from the informant?

955
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,260
I have no idea
That's why I want to find it out

956
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,140
- Got it? Work now
- Sure

957
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,500
You owe me a hot pot

958
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,340
You look like hot pot

959
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,600
I just arrived at the company

960
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,200
Okay, I'll send you the email
when I reach the office

961
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,040
- I already sent it
- Sorry for troubling you on the weekend

962
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,140
It's nothing

963
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,820
Enough crying

964
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,180
Don't worry, we will see to it

965
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,360
Take it easy, we're on your side

966
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,880
I will talk to Mr. Jiang and President Han

967
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,140
Alas

968
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,080
Compared to you, Shen Zi Chang
and the house are more important

969
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,040
Bye

970
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,920
- Hi, may I help you?
- Hi

971
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,820
I want to sell my bag

972
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,980
- This
- Okay, I'll take it for the appraisal

973
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,300
Okay

974
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,060
- Be gentle
- Sure

975
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,720
Shen Zi Chang

976
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,180
What are you doing?

977
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,720
Can you spend some time with me
if you're free?

978
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,920
I am sad

979
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,480
Baby, I can't go to you today
Something came up on short notice

980
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,400
I'll go to you tomorrow, okay?

981
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,100
Why would you be in the office?

982
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,480
Why didn't you
reply to my messages and calls?

983
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:26,580
I...

984
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,720
I caught a cold and wasn't feeling well

985
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,680
What did you talk to Sai Wen?
You had a long talk

986
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,560
Why must you meet on the weekend
when there's no one around?

987
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,740
It's nothing important, I should get going

988
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,620
Isn't it just a cold?

989
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,980
Why couldn't you answer my calls
or reply to my messages?

990
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,520
You look in the pink now

991
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,000
I should go

992
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,620
Are you the whistle-blower?

993
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,300
Miao Miao

994
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:07,820
Miao Miao!

995
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,920
(What are you doing? Are you done with it?)

996
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,340
Shen Zi Chang, what are you up to lately?

997
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,020
You have been turning down
our invitations to hang out

998
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:19,740
(I'm still busy)

999
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,560
- I'm busy with the school affairs
- Come on

1000
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,120
Were you banned from going out by Xu Yan?

1001
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,020
You're still like a couple of lovebirds
after being together for years, come on

1002
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,680
Why do you bring this up? Let's drink!

1003
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,780
Miao Miao

1004
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,860
Miao Miao, listen to me

1005
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,200
I just want an answer from you

1006
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,320
Is that really so difficult?

1007
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,860
Did you do it?

1008
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,100
It's me

1009
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,620
I passed the recordings
and chat records to the HR department

1010
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,040
What else do you want to know?

1011
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,480
- Why?
- Why?

1012
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,660
- Jian Yi Fan harassed me
- That's impossible

1013
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,500
How is it impossible?

1014
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,520
How long have you known him?

1015
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,540
Miao Miao

1016
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,540
We entered Yann Coffee together

1017
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,860
We have been sitting next to each other

1018
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,360
I always believe that you are my best friend

1019
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,760
at Yann Coffee

1020
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,300
Qiao Xi Chen

1021
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,780
Stop asking, it has nothing to do with you

1022
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,840
Why would it have nothing to do with me?

1023
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,580
Jian Yi Fan is my boyfriend

1024
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,360
Even if he were not my boyfriend

1025
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,380
I still want to know
if my best friend lied to me

1026
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,940
Continue, let's eat

1027
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,360
This tastes good

1028
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,100
This is not bad

1029
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,640
(Noisy boss)

1030
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,760
- Hello, baby
- What are you doing?

1031
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,600
I'm still at school

1032
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,640
I see

1033
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,440
We haven't had a good meal
for quite some days

1034
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,080
How about having something nice?

1035
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,420
Let's take a rain check

1036
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,360
I may not be back early

1037
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
When will you and Hua Zi finish eating?

1038
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,880
I'm not with Hua Zi

1039
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,400
You haven't...

1040
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,400
Yi Ning made me do this

1041
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,280
She said she'll promote me to project manager

1042
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,520
as long as Jian Yi Fan leaves

1043
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,939
Don't give me that kind of look!

1044
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,060
We're different

1045
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,220
With my abilities
I can never get a promotion

1046
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,920
Yes, I usually look carefree

1047
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,020
as if I don't care
about the promotion and bonuses

1048
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,160
But it doesn't mean I don't long for these

1049
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,439
Do you know what is
the cruelest thing in this world?

1050
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,800
It's not that you can't get it

1051
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,960
It's when you realize you can get
what you want by only stretching out your arm

1052
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,500
- Will you stretch your arm?
- I will

1053
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:52,560
Of course I will

1054
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,040
But I will rely on my own

1055
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,580
- I will not step on others
- What is the difference?

1056
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,540
This is how the company works
This is the workplace

1057
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,380
Isn't making more money our purpose?

1058
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,819
As for the rest, it's not my concern

1059
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:12,340
Listen to me

1060
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,680
Don't get involved, this is my advice to you

1061
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,540
Xu Yan!

1062
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,140
Xu Yan, sorry

1063
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,160
Sorry? You're not in the wrong!

1064
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:40,319
Why do you need to say sorry?

1065
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,439
- I didn't mean to lie to you
- You didn't mean to lie to me?

1066
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,680
Are you making a fool of me?

1067
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,830
I've been pinching and scraping
selling my bags and accessories

1068
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,319
And you're enjoying yourself
with your friends?

1069
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,279
If you had thought of me
you wouldn't even have done that!

1070
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,780
I hang out with them only once a month

1071
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,200
Also, it's their treat!

1072
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,360
Do you mean it's my fault that I ran into it?

1073
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,140
Yes, I'm to blame
for running into you enjoying yourselves!

1074
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,100
- No, I'm sorry, Xu Yan, don't go
- Get off

1075
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,780
- I'm sorry
- Let go of me!

1076
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,680
Some people say life is just a game
of constantly making choices

1077
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,360
Some people exchange health for money

1078
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,880
Some people exchange money for health

1079
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,280
(Reproductive Endocrinologist)

1080
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,800
Someone sacrifices the
happiness of the moment

1081
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,460
for the stability of the future

1082
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,440
Someone give up their relationships

1083
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,360
(Ou Yang)
and go for what they can rely on

1084
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,980
There are people who choose to trample
on the efforts of others to gain success

1085
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,020
We always think
this is the best path to happiness

1086
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,840
But we may miss the once-in-a-lifetime
scenery along the way

1087
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,620
Don't forget your original intention

1088
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,400
just because you've moved far

1089
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,140
Don't get lost at the junctions

1090
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,440
just because you're running too fast

1091
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,280
Why did you turn off your phone?

1092
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,320
I've been looking for you
I couldn't reach you

1093
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,560
I have something very important to tell you

1094
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,000
Come in, I have
something important to tell you too
