00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:34,080
(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,580
- Excuse me, this pair...
- I'm sorry

3
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,800
We only have size 36 for this
It can't fit you

4
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
- You are fair. Red enhances your skin tone
- Not bad

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,460
- This pair looks good too
- I will try on this also

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,780
These two arrived this morning
They suit you. Try them on

7
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,500
- I never wear heels lower than...
- Do you have size 38.5?

8
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,660
I have to check if it is available
Are you sure you want it?

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,140
- How can I be sure if I don't try them on?
- No

10
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,620
If you say no after I've spent time searching
for it, it would be a waste of my time

11
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,920
Isn't this your job?

12
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,960
Xiao Liu, come here

13
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,980
- Sorry, a second, please
- This one looks pretty

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,340
- Help her find the shoes
- Okay

15
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,380
Excuse me, which pair do you want?

16
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,940
(Intern)
I can give you some recommendation

17
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,780
- Do you have size 38.5 for this?
- Yes, wait a minute, I'll get it

18
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,540
Excuse me, we've run out
of black color for that size

19
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,380
So I brought you the white ones

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,780
Here. Also, I noticed
you viewed the other two pairs

21
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,500
I brought them for you too
You can try them on

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,420
You have to try on the shoes

23
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,300
to know if they are comfortable
and if you like them

24
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,380
Are you new here?

25
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,600
This is my second day here

26
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,780
That's okay

27
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,660
You don't like them?

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,620
- I'll get you...
- I'll buy them all

29
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,620
Sure!

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,140
I'm sorry, I'm new and not familiar with this

31
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,300
Take your time

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,100
Hi, let me help you with that

33
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,020
She's an intern
and not familiar with the system

34
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,980
I want her to help me, I have plenty of time

35
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,920
Take your time, I can wait

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,079
(Episode 6: Ex-boyfriends)

37
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,300
There are a lot of places
to walk dogs in our neighborhood

38
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,380
- Yes
- I've come back here twice

39
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,700
and you're still here

40
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,540
You don't know my dog
It only loves this area

41
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,660
- It can't go far
- It's not good for the dog

42
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,820
Just care about your own dog

43
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,300
My dog needs a long walk

44
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,420
- Go on, then
- Wait

45
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,020
- Dogs need to socialize
- My dog is cold by nature

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,540
No, wait

47
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,020
What a coincidence. We are neighbors

48
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,500
If you have time... Wait! If you...

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,500
- Here's your dessert
- Thank you

50
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,380
I just moved in and I'm not familiar here

51
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,900
- I think you are familiar...
- Neither am I

52
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,940
Neither are you?

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,200
It's okay, I'll show you around after I've
familiarized myself with this place

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,140
- There are quite a few...
- Let me cut to the chase

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,820
I was drunk that night

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,220
Come on, everyone knows that

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,340
- Do you remember what happened?
- I don't

58
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,700
- No. You must remember it
- I...

59
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,780
I've forgotten everything happened that night

60
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,220
I suggest you forget it also

61
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,220
How do I call you?

62
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,140
- My name is Ou Yang
- Ou Yang and what?

63
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,060
My last name is Ou, so my name is Ou Yang

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,740
If you like to call me Ou Yang What
I have no issue

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,300
-I just want to tell you...
- It sounds nice

66
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,780
You can call me Ou Yang What

67
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,700
I've forgotten everything happened that day
I suggest you forget it too

68
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
What if I can't?

69
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,220
I lack a girlfriend. I want a girlfriend

70
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,380
How about you and I be a couple?

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,980
You can stop here

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,220
Let me be frank, I'm here
to reach an agreement with you

73
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,380
What happened that night
is not worth mentioning

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,660
I hope you will forget them all

75
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,900
If we run into each other
just ignore me, okay?

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,820
- No
- Pay the bill

77
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,720
Wait, tell me your name!

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,660
- Do you want to know some gossip?
- No

79
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,580
-There will be a personnel adjustment
- Will there be a layoff again?

80
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,100
No, it's a managerial adjustment

81
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,440
He thinks that Yi Ning has been too powerful

82
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,460
Now, he wants to flatten the hierarchy
and adjust the structure

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,980
Get down to the point

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,900
The point is that there will be
two project groups in our department

85
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,740
Each project group will have a leader

86
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,380
All the best

87
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,620
I'm not the only one
who stands a chance. That's fair

88
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,980
Don't all of you stand a chance?

89
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,740
Considering the seniority and achievements
you're on the top of the list

90
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,060
You have to work harder
I'm waiting to ride on your coattails

91
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,620
Can't you work harder
and let me ride on yours?

92
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,700
- Get back to your work
- I won't make it difficult for myself

93
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,380
My dear colleagues, you've worked hard

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,460
Mr. Jian is going to have
a small meeting with you

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,340
Leave your work aside

96
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,980
- Where is the meeting?
- Right here

97
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,460
Let's gather together, okay?
Come here, everyone

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,340
Let me introduce you a new colleague, Lin Rui

99
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:37,220
He'll officially be part of Yann Coffee's
marketing department today onwards

100
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,500
Let's welcome him

101
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,700
Hi, everyone. My name is Lin Rui
I've just returned to China

102
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,520
I need your help and guidance in the future

103
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,740
In addition to this, some of you
might have heard of it

104
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,220
There will be some adjustments
to the organization structure

105
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,380
According to the nature of our business

106
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,960
I intend to temporarily divide you
into two project groups

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,360
The first group focuses on the marketing
and planning of existing products

108
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,020
The second group will work
with the R&D and the sales departments

109
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,200
in new product development and planning

110
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,700
Wu Tian Qiang will
be the acting leader of the first group

111
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,500
Thank you, Mr. Jian. Thank you

112
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,980
As for the second group's leader

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
there is no confirmed candidate yet

114
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,020
But the R&D of new products has to carry on

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,840
Well, show your hand if you're interested

116
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,860
in joining the R&D of new winter products

117
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,780
Qiao

118
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,260
Is there anyone else?

119
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,260
Okay, I'll give you two-week time

120
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,300
Then, all departments will decide together
who delivers the best proposal

121
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,940
- Is there any problem?
- No problem

122
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,900
Get back to your work

123
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,780
He's so handsome

124
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,900
Look, he is not only handsome

125
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,460
but has a refined sense
in his outfit and belongings

126
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,780
Look!

127
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,460
The mug was brought back
from a foreign business school

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
He's just showing off

129
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,100
I can buy you one if you like it

130
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,340
Mugs from different schools
are available online now

131
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,580
Do you want the one from Gryffindor?

132
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,220
No, Qiao Xi Chen

133
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,220
Keep my advice in mind

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,840
Lin Rui is a tough guy

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,240
You have to try your hardest

136
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,220
Thanks for cheering for me

137
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,380
- I thought you've become a turncoat
- What?

138
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,140
They are two different things

139
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,700
Do you have time?
Let's have a coffee and chat

140
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,920
I'm sorry, I'm really busy

141
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,820
That's scary

142
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,820
After giving me a cup of yogurt

143
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,820
you make me sit here with you

144
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,900
for almost half an hour without a word

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,940
That's eerie

146
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,780
- Why don't you ask something?
- Sure

147
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,360
Excuse me, Miss Qiao Xi Chen

148
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,500
How do you feel when you see Lin Rui again?

149
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,500
- No feeling
- No way

150
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,660
I don't feel anything

151
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,680
- Nan Jia, look at her
- I'm serious

152
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,140
Nan Jia, let me ask you

153
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,580
If you ran into your ex on the road
will you have any feeling?

154
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,500
We're talking about you
Why do you involve me?

155
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,020
- Yes, we're asking you
- Well

156
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,380
It varies from person to person
My feelings for him...

157
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,940
Yes, it just came to me

158
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,860
Someone neither ate nor slept
after falling out of love

159
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,060
Then, she lost 5 kg in a month
She's really something

160
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,660
I have a little doubt

161
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,460
Why would it be so coincidental
that he joined your company?

162
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,540
- What is he up to?
- What is he up to?

163
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,020
No matter what his reason is
it has nothing to do with me

164
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,940
Well, I have only one target

165
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,420
I won't allow my exes to do better than me

166
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,340
I agree with this, it's worth a toast

167
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,780
Say it, is there anything we can help you?

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,740
Well, there is something

169
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,620
Our company is going to
hold a reception for our clients

170
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,500
It's less than two weeks to the date

171
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,220
I'm busy with the R&D of my new project
I really am...

172
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,300
- You got it?
-Yes, you can talk further about it

173
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,760
- Really?
- Yes

174
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,220
I will refer my director to you

175
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,300
Mr. Jian, you played well
You must have had a systematic training

176
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,300
I learned it when I was young
but I'm not a persistent person

177
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,620
So I stopped later. You are not bad too

178
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,560
Roger Federer was my childhood idol

179
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
But my parents think
academics is better than sports

180
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,280
Anyway, thanks to them
or I wouldn't know where I would end up now

181
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,300
- Where is your hometown?
- I'm from the northeast

182
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,460
But I came to Beijing in my freshman year
and went abroad in my junior year

183
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,480
I haven't been home for many years
Mr. Jian, what about you?

184
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,420
I am a Beijinger who grew up in Shenzhen

185
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,300
So I can't tell if you ask me
where my hometown is

186
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,220
Understood

187
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,620
Actually, people who left home early like us

188
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,080
and live in different cities
don't really care about that

189
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,780
Mr. Jian

190
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,380
Regarding the new product development

191
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,360
I have communicated
with colleagues in the R&D department

192
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,380
I've already have some ideas

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,600
- Can I report to you now?
- Well, it's not necessary

194
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,140
It's after work now
Let's talk about it in the company

195
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,940
Okay, sorry

196
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,920
I can't keep track of time when I'm working

197
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll improve on that

198
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,540
Lin Rui

199
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,500
I like to deal with smart people

200
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,120
Because smart people take shortcuts

201
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,160
but shortcuts may get you lost

202
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,440
- One more game
- No problem

203
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,540
Why are you having your lunch so late too?

204
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,220
Well, listen to my voice

205
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,020
I received a complaint

206
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,420
He said he quarreled with his wife
after buying our air conditioner

207
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,240
So he blamed our air conditioner
for affecting their relationship

208
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,740
He refused to hang up the phone
until half an hour later

209
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,660
I think we are not so much
customer service officers

210
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,460
as relationship mediators

211
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,420
What is the place you posted on Moments?

212
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,620
- Did you go abroad?
- I didn't

213
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,200
That's a homestay
on the outskirts of Beijing

214
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,340
-It's beautiful. Let me show you
- That's Beijing?

215
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,060
- Show me the pictures
- Yes

216
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,700
They all commented
and thought I was on vacation abroad

217
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,740
Yes, I thought it was a foreign country
at the first sight

218
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,980
Make a trip there quickly

219
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,940
Is it expensive?

220
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,700
Actually, it's affordable

221
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,500
Nan Jia, sorry

222
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,300
I have a new product meeting
with the R&D department on short notice

223
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,140
- I can't make it
- It's okay

224
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,140
- Go on with your work
- I believe you can manage it

225
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,420
It goes without saying!

226
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
Get back to it, your superior is here

227
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,180
Bye, talk to you later

228
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,940
- President Ji
- Hi

229
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,350
- Hi
- Hi

230
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,940
I'm Jian Yi Fan
the marketing director of Yann Coffee

231
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,720
I am Ji Nan Jia from Si Nan
This is my assistant, Xiao Yi

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,500
You're close to Qiao Xi Chen, right?

233
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,580
- We're friends for more than a decade
- That's even better

234
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,700
She sent me some documents
about your company last time

235
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,020
We have two proposals
for your coming reception

236
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,020
You can make a choice today

237
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,720
- We'll proceed if it's suitable
- Okay

238
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,500
- President Ji, you efficiency is admirable
- It's my job

239
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
Okay, the car key

240
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,140
President Ji

241
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,980
Let me introduce him
This is my assistant, Ou Yang

242
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,900
President Ji, nice to meet you

243
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,900
Nice to meet you

244
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,500
Miao

245
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,660
Turn on your little radar
and find out how far he has progressed

246
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,200
- Are you anxious now?
- Do you want to rely on me?

247
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,020
I've asked about it

248
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,860
Lin Rui is really something else

249
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,340
He knows he has just returned
and isn't up on the trends

250
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,340
Whenever there's an opportunity
he'll talk to R&D colleagues

251
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,579
and then do the market research

252
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,619
From there, he can exploit the connection

253
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,540
He was in the student union
He's so familiar with that

254
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,560
How do you know that?

255
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,859
How do I know that?

256
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,339
Yeah, how do I know that?

257
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,500
I read his resume

258
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,760
No wonder

259
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,380
Is there any other information?

260
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
There is also an off-site message

261
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,900
He invited Mr. Jian
to play tennis last weekend

262
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,360
- Try your best
- If there's any update, you know what to do

263
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,540
Play tennis?

264
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,660
- What are you looking at?
- You scared me

265
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,620
How was Mr. Jian's meeting with Si Nan?

266
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,700
I was about to talk to you about this

267
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,940
Looks like you have been busy lately

268
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,700
Would you like me to help with the reception?

269
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,220
Do you have no faith in me?
Listen, I am a college graduate too

270
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,900
Running errands is my hobby, you know?
That's not the only thing I am capable of

271
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,180
Look, you're being touchy

272
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,180
I don't mean that

273
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,600
I mean I'm not the one who has the final say

274
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,860
Mr. Jian said all I need is your consent.
Is it okay?

275
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
There is something wrong with you

276
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,500
Ou Yang, I have never seen you
being so zealous about something

277
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,860
There is something, right?

278
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,100
Nothing

279
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,260
Well, take it over if you want

280
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,860
Since Mr. Jian has told you so, go ahead

281
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,420
I'll sort out the documents and send to you
Feel free to come to me when you need help

282
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,860
Sure, thank you

283
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,420
Ou Yang

284
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,020
Thank you, you know I'm exhausted lately

285
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,460
Yes

286
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,100
You're a nice guy

287
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,740
- I... Okay
- You're more handsome, go!

288
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,100
Sir

289
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,560
Have a cup of coffee after lunch
to help your digestion

290
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,600
You're being kind suddenly

291
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,780
Do you want to ask me
about the second group's leader?

292
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,580
You're indeed my superior

293
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,780
You guessed my thoughts
before I opened my mouth

294
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,780
Sir, tell me

295
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,060
Between me and Lin Rui, the position goes
to the one who presents a better proposal

296
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,900
Right?

297
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,700
Huh?

298
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,580
Qiao Xi Chen

299
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,820
You keep calling me sir

300
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,080
Is this the way you talk to your director?

301
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,140
No one is around here, right?

302
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,500
It's just the two of us
Let's loosen up a little

303
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,800
Lin Rui asked me before you came to me

304
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,960
I do have this in mind

305
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,560
I guessed it

306
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,560
Lin Rui has a great resume

307
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,900
He's well-qualified to be the leader

308
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
So do you think you are incapable?

309
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,420
No, I have confidence in myself

310
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,440
Frankly speaking
Lin Rui does have a great resume

311
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,780
But here in my department
I value capability instead of resume

312
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,620
Whether it's you, Lin Rui
or anyone in the department

313
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,420
if you want to get a promotion and increment
convince me with your performance

314
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,980
Got it, thank you, director!

315
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,580
I will do my best and not let you down

316
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,620
- Look at this
- It's great

317
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,580
You said that even without looking at it

318
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,380
- Take a look
- I'm helping the team

319
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,300
- Take a look
- Wait a minute

320
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,140
-Take a look, it's hard to find
- I am overtaken

321
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,560
Let me have a look

322
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,160
Do you want to go on a trip?

323
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,280
Not bad

324
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,260
Not bad? It's really nice. You know what?

325
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
This is my pick
after laboriously comparing all of them

326
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,220
It's 800 yuan with two breakfasts included

327
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
What are you doing, Shen Zi Chang?

328
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,640
We've agreed on this

329
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,940
I'd work overtime on National Day
to earn some overtime pay

330
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,580
Then you'd make time
to go on the trip with me

331
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,100
Yes, but our overtime pays

332
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,400
are not even enough to pay last month's bills

333
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,100
Besides, we've agreed to
save money in these two months

334
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,700
I know, that's why I didn't
choose any other places

335
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,560
It's on the outskirts of Beijing

336
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,460
Well, a buddy of mine
just opened a strawberry picking farm

337
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,300
Let's stay there for few days, okay?

338
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,780
Are you stupid?
Picking strawberries in this season?

339
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,260
People are going to beaches
grasslands and forests

340
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,260
- But I'm picking strawberries. Am I stupid?
- No

341
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,540
What? Fine, let's not go anywhere
Just stay at home

342
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,000
Baby

343
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,960
Turn around and let's talk

344
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,100
I didn't say we aren't going for the trip

345
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,580
Every time when I ask you for a trip
it's like killing you

346
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,880
I just think that we are
seeing each other daily

347
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,420
When we go on a trip, we're just
playing with cell phones somewhere else

348
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,660
Shen Zi Chang, you only play with cell phone
when you're with me, right?

349
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,540
Even if I'm just playing with cell phone

350
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,900
I want to do it in
a comfortable and scenic place, I enjoy it!

351
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,020
Except for going to work
I only stay home every day

352
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
I want to have some fun
Why is it so difficult?

353
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,460
I just want you to go with me!

354
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,380
Alright

355
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,160
Show me the places you just picked

356
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,980
Let's pick a nice one
and we'll go on a trip, okay?

357
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,940
Well, you should have said so
You were wasting my time

358
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,460
I'll continue looking for one
and you will see it together

359
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,620
The menu for the reception has been sent

360
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,060
I've checked the list of guests
and excluded the foods they avoid

361
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,100
It's already in your inbox, take a look

362
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,140
Regarding the venue
Si Nan gave us two choices

363
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,900
I'll inspect them this afternoon

364
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,420
I'll check the traffic situation
in addition to the space

365
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,220
What's wrong?

366
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,400
Don't you think it's worthwhile
having me as your assistant?

367
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,380
Do you think the only skill needed
for being my assistant is making coffee?

368
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,100
To be honest, making a good coffee
isn't a skill everyone has

369
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,140
Double mocha with a little surprise

370
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,180
- What did you add?
- I replaced the syrup with condensed milk

371
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,860
This is the first time I tried this

372
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,020
Are you taking me as a guinea pig? Ou Yang

373
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,420
Aren't you an expert?

374
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,900
I am leaving

375
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,700
Ask Qiao Xi Chen to see me when you leave

376
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,340
She went out early in the morning

377
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,940
saying that she was
going for in-store research

378
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,480
Good for her, she has gone to
almost all the stores in the city this week

379
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,580
- Should I give her a call?
- Fine, let her be

380
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,300
Okay, I'm leaving

381
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,620
Hi, what do you need?

382
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,020
- A medium hot latte
- A medium hot latte

383
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,060
We have a free coffee upgrade today

384
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,700
It's okay, thank you
I don't like flashy things

385
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Okay, I won't upgrade it for you
What's your last name?

386
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,980
- Zhang
- Alright, Miss Zhang

387
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,780
Is the free upgrade
you mentioned only limited to latte?

388
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,300
It's applicable to mocha
americano and flat white

389
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,860
Then, you can choose from oat milk
flavored syrup or whipping cream

390
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,220
- I want an americano with cream
- Sure

391
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,580
- An americano with cream, medium or large?
- Large

392
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,500
-Hi, two iced americanos
- Iced americanos

393
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,940
We have a free coffee upgrade service today
Do you need it?

394
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,400
- I want syrup
- Syrup?

395
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,820
- Syrup
- Same for you?

396
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,960
Sister Jia, I'll check with the manager
about the on-site decoration

397
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,020
- Are you leaving, Xiao Yi?
- Yes, bye

398
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,980
Bye

399
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,360
What are you up to?

400
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,380
What am I up to?

401
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,500
President Ji
is this how you deal with your client?

402
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,540
Brother, we spent three hours
on inspecting two venues

403
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,220
With the three hours, I would've
finished inspecting ten venues

404
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,980
This is my first time
handling an important task

405
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,860
I have to be cautious

406
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,980
I wonder if Yann Coffee
really takes this reception serious

407
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,460
- Is there nobody else to handle this?
- Of course we do

408
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,460
We do have other colleagues

409
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,960
But I love this task

410
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,600
So I specially got my superior's
permission for this

411
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,140
Are you satisfied then?

412
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,940
I think the place is okay

413
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,300
- Alright. That's good
- However

414
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,860
there is some problem with the proposal

415
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,220
This proposal has been
approved by your superior

416
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,620
What I give you now is the details

417
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,020
- Can you tell me what's the problem?
- Yes

418
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,300
In general, there's no problem
But it's a bit boring

419
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,340
Let me tell you this

420
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,180
The guests of this reception are all VIPs

421
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,860
These people attend such receptions
countless times a year

422
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,740
Without something new, how do we make
them think we're different from others?

423
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,620
But these receptions are much of a muchness

424
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,100
Our company's strengths lies
in the dishes and wine, you know it, right?

425
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,580
Of course I do
The choice of ingredients is your strength

426
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,460
But to be honest
not many of these clients can tell

427
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,460
the difference between the Australian
and domestic farmed lobsters

428
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,300
We need something exotic

429
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,300
Let me put it this way

430
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,820
We need more on-site decorations

431
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,380
For example, grassland is our theme, right?

432
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,580
So you have to get lots of plants and flowers

433
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,780
And give the clients the feeling

434
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,780
of being in Hulunbeir Grassland
once they enter the hall

435
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,580
When they look up
there will be a clear blue sky above them

436
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,940
- The clear lake...
- I get it. Let me think about it

437
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,480
No, wait

438
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,980
Aren't we in a discussion?

439
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,920
Hi, what would you like to order?

440
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,500
- Two cups of iced cold brew
- Iced cold brew

441
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,900
Today, we have...

442
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,860
We have a free coffee upgrade
There are oat milk

443
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,800
syrup and whipped cream

444
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,020
You have been busy since morning

445
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,180
Do you want to rest and have a chat?

446
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,180
Scan here, please

447
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,820
Xiao Xi, since I joined Yann Coffee
we haven't had a chance to talk

448
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,100
It has been so many years
Can't we just sit down and catch up a little?

449
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,380
No matter how, we'll still meet in the office

450
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,860
You can't keep ignoring me, right?

451
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,260
I'm working now
There are other customers behind you

452
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,260
Coco, I'm sorry

453
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,060
We need more on-site decorations

454
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,500
Wow! This is gorgeous!

455
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,540
I must go to Antarctica once in my lifetime

456
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,660
You can see stars everywhere
even at our balcony

457
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,100
Why must you go to that freezing place?

458
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,700
Watching the stars on our balcony?
Tell me then

459
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,380
Is there any difference between swimming
in the pool downstairs and in Bali?

460
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,660
Of course. Except for the maintenance fee
going the swimming pool downstairs

461
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,100
doesn't take time
while going to Bali takes a lot of work

462
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,900
Xiao Jia, I must talk some sense into you

463
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,260
Do you know there is something

464
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,480
called the sense of ceremony?
This is my advice to you

465
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,740
Put down your work
and find some sense of ceremony

466
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,660
Give it back, it's not saved yet
Keep your hands away

467
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,020
- Come on
- Well, work hard

468
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,760
I must be there once in my life!

469
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,020
It's pretty nice

470
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,860
By looking at it
I feel like I were personally there

471
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,820
I'm right there. What about celebrating
our Spring Festival there this year?

472
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,140
Don't get mad. I'm just discussing with you

473
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,740
- I have an idea
- Ah?

474
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,340
Night Sky in the Pole

475
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,040
Night Sky in the Pole?

476
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,700
In short, we'll make the hall
look like the polar night in Antarctica

477
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,180
The polar night in Antarctica is our theme

478
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,320
And the element will be found
in the garnish of every dish

479
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,060
Most importantly, the guests will
have the feeling of being in the Antarctica

480
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,500
and they are tasting the deep-sea delicacies

481
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,060
Of course, your coffee
is still the protagonist

482
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,180
How about this?
When the brightest light is turned on

483
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,780
they will see our coffee beans
just like MM beans. What do you think?

484
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,660
Let me think about this

485
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,100
I like this idea

486
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,060
Can you give me the details
as soon as possible?

487
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,380
Sure. But I need to change the menu first

488
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,780
Perfect!

489
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,660
Well, I have to say that we somehow
understand each other's minds

490
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,980
Cheers!

491
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,260
Thank you. Xiao Chen
the research today is completed. Thanks

492
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,740
Thanks

493
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,980
I remember ice cream is your favorite

494
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,660
And I always had to buy you an extra cup

495
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,860
I am no longer young and my stomach
can't take it, so I have cut down on it

496
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,620
Miao Miao said you were doing
a market research here, so I just stopped by

497
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,500
In fact, our department publishes
the market research data every quarter

498
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,900
You don't have to come here...

499
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,420
If you like to read the data, go ahead

500
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,900
I have my own way of working
I don't need you to teach me

501
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,060
Okay, let's not talk about work

502
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,380
I wanted to contact you
before returning to China

503
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,580
But I didn't know you had
changed your contact number

504
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,140
And I couldn't get it from anyone

505
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,500
Lin Rui

506
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,540
It's now 2020. If you want to reach someone
you can surely make it

507
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,260
But it doesn't matter, right?

508
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,740
It doesn't matter whether we keep in touch

509
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,540
Xiao Xi

510
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,500
In the past, I was...

511
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,900
- I should...
- The past is in the past

512
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,860
Can you not bring it up?

513
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,500
It's best if you think so

514
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,060
After all, we are now colleagues

515
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,500
You and I will feel awkward
if we don't get over it

516
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,760
Is this the main reason you are here today?

517
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,540
Actually, you don't have to come here

518
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
Lin Rui

519
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,380
I don't think we'd want to work together
if there were options

520
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,860
Especially we have to compete
for the position of the leader now

521
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,720
It's awkward, who should be the leader?

522
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,500
But since it's come to this stage
let's just focus on work

523
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,020
Don't give much thoughts about it
and just accept it

524
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,260
I will do my best for the new product

525
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
I hope you will also do so

526
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,700
Well, can we greet each other in the office

527
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,600
have a meal together occasionally
have a chit-chat or talk about work?

528
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,020
Mr. Jian?

529
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,380
Mr. Jian

530
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,219
- What a coincidence
- I was nearby, so I just drop in

531
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,500
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing

532
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,739
Well, you're here in the right time
I need to talk to you

533
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,659
It's about the VIP reception

534
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,699
- The reception?
- Yes. Do you have time?

535
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,980
Well, I do have some time

536
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,840
Okay, let's go

537
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,880
- Are you following?
- He has other fish to fry

538
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,179
Let's go first
We'll make a move, Lin Rui. Bye

539
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,340
Thanks for this

540
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,699
Anyhow, I'm your superior

541
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,860
It is not appropriate to use me
as an excuse so blatantly, right?

542
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,420
No. I really want to talk with you

543
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Come on

544
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,340
Ou Yang reported the progress
of the reception to me this morning

545
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,860
Sorry, sir. I won't do it anymore

546
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,380
Do you and Lin Rui know each other?

547
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,740
- Yes
- You met each other before?

548
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,340
- Yes
- Is he your ex-boyfriend?

549
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,380
Oh, well, sir...

550
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,020
Are you used to be a detective?

551
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,980
You got the answer from the one-word replies

552
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,580
It's all written on your face

553
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,860
Let me remind you
No matter what your relationship was

554
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,140
don't let it affect your work

555
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,540
Don't worry. We are at most acquaintances

556
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,780
- Acquaintances?
- Yes, we will still meet in the office

557
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,660
I heard you visited all the stores
in the city this week

558
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,580
Don't push yourself too hard. Take care

559
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,440
Don't worry, I'm still young for the work

560
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,860
Data is just numbers
I prefer to go to the stores myself

561
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,140
This way, I can know
the customers' preferences directly

562
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,180
But the time is a bit tight

563
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,020
I have to visit more than three stores a day
to reach the target

564
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,740
Do you want to be the leader so badly?

565
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,780
Of course I do

566
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,000
No one says no to the promotion
and increment, right?

567
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,300
Besides, I want to know if I am capable

568
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,300
to be the leader
after working four years in Yann Coffee

569
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,200
I thought you were going to say
that you don't want to lose to your ex

570
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,780
It is one of the reasons

571
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,940
You are quite honest

572
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,880
It's not shameful
to not want to lose to the ex

573
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,260
Sir, I need to go to
the reserve store in West City

574
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,020
It's now their peak hours

575
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,040
You don't have to send me there

576
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,100
Did I offer you a ride?

577
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Oh

578
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,120
The reserve store in West City?

579
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
I haven't been there for a long time

580
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,780
What a coincidence!

581
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,140
If it came to you some other day
and there's a traffic jam

582
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,540
it would take you an hour

583
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,220
But now, you can have
someone chatting with you, right?

584
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,160
Just say that you want to hitch a ride

585
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,820
I don't. Taking subway is actually faster

586
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,660
- It's mine
- Why are you so petty?

587
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,500
You already had one, your stomach will suffer

588
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm not afraid

589
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,740
You don't eat it and it's melting
What a waste

590
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,020
I don't like sweet stuffs

591
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,980
Why did you buy two then?

592
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,840
Because you won't settle for one

593
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,480
Here!

594
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,380
- No, keep it for yourself
- Take a bite

595
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,940
- It's okay
- Just take one bite

596
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,460
- No
- Just a bite, please!

597
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,700
Isn't it delicious?

598
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,620
Xiao Xi!

599
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,360
Can you listen to me?
I wanted to tell you about it

600
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,500
but the faculty asked us to not leak it

601
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,500
I've planned it
I'll go there and wait for you

602
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,020
You can fly over after you've graduated

603
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,580
We can be together again by then

604
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,100
You'll take the one-year time to improve
your English and take the IELTS exam

605
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,420
When the time comes, you can take
a master's degree there. Isn't it good?

606
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,980
Can you help me unfasten it?

607
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,660
- Help me unfasten it!
- Xiao Xi, it's my fault. Don't be angry

608
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,740
This won't happen again

609
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,020
Indeed, this won't happen again

610
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,760
Xiao Xi, I'm leaving next week

611
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,500
(Beijing Yann Coffee Co. Ltd.)

612
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,460
(Friday, 2:01 am)

613
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,560
Son

614
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,500
Son! Look!

615
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,780
- Mom
- Look at this!

616
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
Stop looking at your phone

617
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,540
Stop looking at your phone
It does you no good

618
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,980
What are you doing? I finally have time
to play with my phone. You're annoying!

619
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,580
- Look at this
- What?

620
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,860
Look at this

621
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,660
- What is this?
- Look

622
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,980
- A financial insurance?
- Listen

623
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,780
This is recommended by a teacher in my school

624
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,860
I already studied it

625
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,260
Of all insurances
this has the highest rebate rate

626
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,700
If you consistently
pay 3,000 yuan every month

627
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,740
you will get the rebate of 195,000 yuan
after five years

628
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,360
But if you pull in your belt a little
and pay 5,000 yuan a month...

629
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,280
Hold on, Mom

630
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,960
5,000 yuan a month?

631
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,800
I'll be living upon nothing
if I pay 5,000 yuan a month

632
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,180
You are living with us

633
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,780
Isn't 3,000 or 4,000 yuan a month
enough for your spending?

634
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,980
No, I...

635
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,640
I understand it

636
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,060
Young people need money
to go on dates, right?

637
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,220
But I am asking you to buy this
for your sake, right?

638
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,020
You need money for your wedding, right?

639
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,200
This is to help you save money

640
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,660
I know I can't expect you
to save money on your own

641
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,180
Alright. I'll buy

642
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,980
I'll buy it next month, okay?

643
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,440
How can you wait until next month?
Buy it this month!

644
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,780
We can get an air fryer
if you buy it this month

645
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,780
Come on, Mom

646
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,140
Isn't there an air fryer?
You still want a new one?

647
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,620
This is ours.
Why should we say no to the gift?

648
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,180
No. The rub is I am broke now

649
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,660
How can you be out of money? You...

650
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,670
Hey, you just got your pay
How can you be broke?

651
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,220
Where did you spend it?

652
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,540
I got it

653
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,680
You spent it on Xu Yan, right?

654
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,940
Son!

655
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,300
I don't object spending money on her

656
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,820
But we are not a rich family

657
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,540
You have to make ends meet, right?

658
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,540
Forget it, you won't understand

659
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,900
Get Xu Yan here one day

660
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,780
- I'll talk to her
- No. Why do you want to talk to her?

661
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,420
I spent my own money, not yours

662
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,140
- Can you get out of this?
- How could you talk to me like this?

663
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,100
It's so annoying! I'll go to class now

664
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,420
- You have no class today, don't you?
- I have one now!

665
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,220
(I have booked the homestay
It's this weekend)

666
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,860
(I haggled with the owner and finally
got 200 yuan cheaper. Praise me!)

667
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,420
Xiao Yu, a little more on the left

668
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,740
A little more. I can't see it now

669
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,740
- Which one?
- This

670
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,160
This is okay, this position is good

671
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,860
The problem now is the position of this tree

672
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,580
Xiao Yu, hurry up! We're running out of time!

673
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,780
The venue is well set up

674
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,780
You don't need to come and supervise
Everything will be in place tomorrow

675
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,660
No, Mr. and Mrs. Jiang are here

676
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,060
- The decoration is very innovative
- Ou Yang

677
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,500
Since we decided to break up

678
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,280
we shouldn't keep in touch

679
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,340
Forget that you ever met me

680
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,380
If...

681
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,020
Sorry

682
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,380
Take care

683
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,460
Let me introduce her

684
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,980
This is Ji Nan Jia
the general manager of Si Nan Planning

685
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,980
They are our event planner this time

686
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,900
- Hi
- Hi

687
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,760
Hi

688
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,940
We were meeting a friend nearby
so we just stopped by here

689
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,820
Okay

690
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,020
The decoration looks fine

691
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,260
That's good

692
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,580
But is it the problem of the lighting?

693
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,120
It looks a bit cool

694
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,900
Well, Mrs. Jiang

695
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,820
Our theme is called Night Sky in the Pole

696
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,860
There will be some light and shadow effects

697
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,740
to give the guests a feeling
of being in the Antarctica

698
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,220
That's why we use the cool colors

699
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,540
I don't think you understand
the purpose of our reception

700
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,020
This is a reception for old clients

701
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,700
So it must be lively

702
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,860
- But we are following...
- What do you think?

703
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,560
Jian Yi Fan showed me the proposal
and I approved it

704
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,700
Of course, the guests are your dad's friends

705
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,900
You know their preferences better, so we'll
change it according to your suggestion

706
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,300
Well, President Ji, please change it

707
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,900
How about this?

708
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,700
I'll add some flowers and plants...

709
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,500
I mean, forget about Night Sky in the Pole

710
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,140
If it's a theme about nature
Tropical Rainforest is good

711
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,900
After all, Antarctica doesn't produce coffee

712
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,960
But, Mrs. Jiang

713
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,140
I'm afraid we don't have enough time

714
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,620
Is one-day time not enough
for a professional company?

715
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,160
It's enough. We can make it. No problem

716
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,360
- Alright. Thank you
- Okay

717
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,840
Let me take you to another place, come on

718
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,900
- See you
- Mr. Jiang, Mrs. Jiang

719
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,020
Hello, yes

720
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,260
Yes, try to get a large plant. Because I...

721
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,900
I know it has to be booked in advance

722
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,700
I understand it's hard to get tropical plants

723
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,900
Okay. Thank you so much

724
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,020
I'll wait for your message

725
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,700
Okay

726
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,500
Here, get some food. Xiao Yi
said you didn't have your lunch

727
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,620
It's fine. I'm not hungry

728
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,180
Come on. Pick up the phone

729
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,480
I'll put it here

730
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,820
I'm really sorry

731
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,300
Mr. Jiang approved the proposal
Who knows Mrs. Jiang suddenly interfered

732
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,480
It's not your fault. It's my problem

733
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,060
- No
- Previously...

734
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,060
Forget it, you won't understand
You're the client after all

735
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,600
Don't just stand here
If you really want to help, go to Xiao Yi

736
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,860
I asked her to make a new backdrop
You go take a photo of it

737
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,700
and confirm with Mr. and Mrs. Jiang

738
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,540
Okay, no problem

739
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,320
Remember to have your lunch

740
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,220
Hello

741
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,900
Mr. Liu

742
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,220
I want some large tropical plants

743
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,040
- Why are you still here?
- You scared me

744
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,400
- Aren't you still here too?
- Will you be able to catch the subway?

745
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,260
It's okay. I've set the alarm
It'll ring in another 20 minutes

746
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,340
It takes less than ten minutes
to reach the subway station if I run

747
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,980
How is it? The presentation is tomorrow

748
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,620
It's almost done
I just want to make some improvements

749
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,300
You should have done
a lot of new product developments

750
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,100
Isn't this the daily routine
of the marketing department?

751
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,080
You're too nervous this time, aren't you?

752
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,920
Are you afraid to lose to Lin Rui?

753
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,960
If I were you

754
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,440
I wouldn't push myself so hard

755
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,480
Take it easy. It's just a job

756
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,080
Easier said than done, you're the director

757
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,160
Does your stomach hurt?

758
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:25,580
It's fine

759
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,940
Perhaps because I didn't have my dinner

760
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,140
Well. I have that, excuse me

761
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,620
Antacid

762
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,700
You are really well-prepared

763
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,700
Sure. The food and fodder
come first during the war

764
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,260
You know what? I have also
isatidis, effervescent and painkillers

765
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,260
Alright. It's almost done

766
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,060
Mr. Jian, do you have anything to say?

767
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,380
- If you don't, I'm going to...
- Just sit down

768
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,660
I'll help you

769
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,520
(Sleeping Pills)

770
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,160
(Warm reminder)
(How to handle psychological problems?)

771
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,620
I can't sleep, I don't have mental issue

772
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,500
I can't sleep

773
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,620
Qiao

774
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,520
This is your second cup this morning, right?

775
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,460
- You didn't sleep again last night?
- I couldn't sleep

776
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,460
Here

777
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,340
I'll do it

778
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,520
Are you okay? You look pale

779
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,460
I'm fine

780
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,080
I did a calculation. I only sleep
four hours a day in average this week

781
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,420
It's okay. I'll get it through today

782
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,540
Qiao, you must hang in there

783
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,420
Today is the decisive battle

784
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,940
You're overly anxious

785
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,340
I'll go through my slides again

786
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,900
I don't know why
I can't keep anything in mind

787
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,540
as if there's an eraser in my brain
Do you get me?

788
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,700
Go through it again

789
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,540
You can do it, Qiao!

790
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,860
Enough. You're making me anxious

791
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,180
- I have faith in you, go!
- Let's do it!

792
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,700
Are you okay?

793
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,740
I'm fine

794
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,660
I'm okay, Mr. Jian
I guess my blood sugar is a little low

795
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,980
You look pale. Do you want to go hospital?

796
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,380
No! It is this afternoon

797
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,020
It's very important

798
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,140
I'm fine, I'm just a little nervous

799
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,300
I'm fine. Thank you, Mr. Jian

800
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,100
Lin Rui is eloquent, really

801
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,780
- This is the last trip
- Okay

802
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,100
Luckily they have been delivered in time

803
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,540
Have you confirmed
the menu adjustment with the chef?

804
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,220
Yes. Fortunately, we are well-prepared

805
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,220
Else, we wouldn't be able to make any changes

806
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,920
I'll make a move first
after everything has been set up

807
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,900
- Can't I?
- No

808
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,960
The reception of this size
isn't something new to us

809
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,340
But you rarely leave before
the event is over. What's going on?

810
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,780
- Are you not feeling well?
- No

811
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,500
I am just a little tired

812
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,460
I figure so. You surely
didn't sleep well last night

813
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,760
Go back and get some rest
I'll take care of things here

814
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,520
Thanks

815
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,440
Today, the leaders of the sales
and R&D departments are here

816
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,980
Let's make it short
and show them what you got

817
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,620
Let's start now. Which of you will go first?

818
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,860
- Ladies first. You'll make the decision
- Well, how about you go first?

819
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,580
Okay

820
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,540
Next, it is my proposal
for the new winter products

821
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,000
First of all, I would like to introduce

822
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,840
my views and suggestions on the R&D direction

823
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,940
of the upcoming
winter products of Yann Coffee

824
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,940
First, we'll look at some current analysis
on the domestic coffee market

825
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,420
As the standard of living and
the consumption of coffee have risen in China

826
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,140
our domestic coffee consumption

827
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,220
has grown at an average rate of 15%
over the past five years

828
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,140
It's much higher than
the world's growth rate of 2%

829
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:59,740
Besides, our coffee production
is 128,000 tonnes this year

830
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,200
The year-over-year growth is 5.3%

831
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,060
Brands have become an important factor
that influences consumer's decisions

832
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,020
It mainly reflected in the pricing
Around 65% consumers...

833
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,660
I'm sorry

834
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,260
Good afternoon, everyone

835
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,900
Sorry

836
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,180
Good afternoon. Well, regarding...

837
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,580
The new winter products...

838
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,020
And...

839
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,760
Don't be nervous. Take your time

840
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,420
In the past five years...
In the past three years

841
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,140
Yann Coffee has accomplished...

842
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,640
In 2018, we launched a total of four products

843
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,980
I'm sorry

844
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,260
Please read her proposal

845
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,160
Are you alright?

846
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,840
I told you not to push yourself so hard

847
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,480
It's just a job
It's not a big deal if you lose

848
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,220
Of course you don't think it's a big deal

849
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,060
You are the director

850
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,620
We're different

851
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,420
I joined Yann Coffee since I graduated

852
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,180
The opportunity finally came

853
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,380
but I screwed it up

854
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,400
And I think I've reached my limits

855
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,460
Maybe I am really incapable of it

856
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,340
Says who?

857
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,340
I've read your proposal

858
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,500
I can see that you put in efforts

859
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,540
- Really?
- Yes

860
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,720
I might not be able
to write a proposal like that

861
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,880
I also think I did it well

862
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,300
But it's meaningless

863
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,460
- I screwed up the presentation
- How could it be meaningless?

864
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,680
At least it proves your abilities

865
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,860
You are anxious
just because you care too much about it

866
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,400
But it doesn't mean
you don't hold a candle to Lin Rui

867
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,780
I never think I'm not as good as him

868
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,400
I feel you

869
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,620
You put in a great deal of efforts
but something went wrong in the end

870
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,100
That is completely fine to be sad

871
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,660
But as a friend, I want to tell you this

872
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,380
If you take me as your friend

873
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,740
Don't deny all your efforts
because of a small issue

874
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,520
or feel worthless because of a little setback

875
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,120
Although it sounds like chicken soup
for the soul, it has its point

876
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,620
Do you get it?

877
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,960
You are smart, surely you can understand it

878
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,360
Isn't there a saying in your hometown?

879
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,120
Booze is the cure to everything

880
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,300
I'll give you a bottle of wine

881
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,540
I thought you don't drink

882
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,400
It's one of my collections

883
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,100
Okay

884
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,220
- Thank you
- You're welcome

885
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,860
It's working hours
I'll put it on your table later

886
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,420
Okay then. Thank you

887
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,680
Anyway, if you have any problem in the future

888
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,520
or you feel like pouring out to someone

889
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,360
I'm always available

890
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,500
Let her stay alone

891
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,780
Yes, Li Na

892
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,900
Yes, your purchasing agent is reliable

893
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,300
I will still go to him in the future

894
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:08,460
Tell him it is urgent
and ask if he can send it early. Okay

895
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,500
Let's go

896
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,700
What have you bought again?

897
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,860
Nothing. I'm not telling you

898
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,180
Xu Yan, we can't go on like this

899
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,020
How?

900
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,380
I just think

901
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,260
that you should keep an eye on your spending

902
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,020
No wonder my mother is unhappy with you

903
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,620
- What did your mother say?
- Nothing

904
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,660
I know it even if you don't tell me

905
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,100
Your mother doesn't approve of me. She thinks

906
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,940
I'm spending your money
and showing you a bad example

907
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,140
Shen Zi Chang

908
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,300
If you think your mom is right
let's break up

909
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,680
I didn't force you. Be your mom's good boy

910
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,940
Come on, I didn't mean it

911
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:55,860
I am just asking you to think

912
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,700
about our spending power
before buying anything

913
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,700
Money doesn't grow on trees

914
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,780
If you really think it's not enough
work harder and earn more

915
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,540
Fine!

916
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,940
Shen Zi Chang

917
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,640
Have something sweet

918
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,680
Your mood will get better

919
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,800
Thank you

920
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,360
Did it really spread so fast?

921
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,300
Everyone is busy
It will be forgotten very soon

922
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,980
Are you okay?

923
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,780
- I'm fine
- That's good

924
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,820
Congratulations

925
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,600
I am not being myself today

926
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,620
Xiao Jia, are you okay?

927
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,620
Xiao Jia!

928
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:56,860
Xiao Jia?

929
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,820
Xiao Jia, are you okay?

930
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:03,260
Xiao Jia!

931
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Xiao Jia! Wake up!

932
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,620
Xiao Jia!

933
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,600
Keep the air circulating. Spread out!

934
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,060
- Have you called the ambulance?
- Call the ambulance!

935
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,560
It's on the 27th floor

936
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,660
Xiao Jia!

937
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,860
They will be here in ten minutes

938
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,560
How's it going?

939
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,780
Thank you

940
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,720
The doctor said Xiao Jia had
an acute myocardial infarction

941
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,000
But the rescue was timely, so he is safe now

942
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
It's good

943
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,840
Are you okay?

944
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,420
I'm pretty good

945
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,180
Fine. Let me be honest

946
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,940
I am not that okay

947
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,800
Let me tell you a secret

948
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,120
I...

949
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,020
Right at the spot we're standing

950
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,180
I lost one of my best friends

951
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,040
You know what? Growing up

952
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,180
the only word that has been
instilled in me is "victory"

953
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,640
I'll be a goner
and have nothing left if I lose

954
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,540
But today

955
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,400
Xiao Jia's heart attack

956
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,920
and being here right now

957
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,360
reminded me of that friend

958
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,080
It dawned on me

959
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,280
that being defeated is not a big deal

960
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,280
So what if I'm defeated?

961
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,460
Right?

962
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,360
Let me tell you a secret too

963
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,640
Well, it can't really be called a secret

964
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,880
In fact, I wasn't born to be a director

965
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,819
My parents sold
computer accessories in Hua Qiang North

966
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,500
When I was child, they were busy with work
and had no time for me

967
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,960
After school, I went to the market for them

968
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,560
I'd do my homework
and be their shopkeeper at the same time

969
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,800
I'm telling you this to let you know

970
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:53,000
that I'm just like you

971
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,979
We are all ordinary people

972
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:00,600
I was defeated before

973
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,640
But so what?

974
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,560
My world didn't fall apart

975
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,180
I can make a comeback

976
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,240
Thank you

977
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,540
When I was young, Mom used to tell me
I should see a doctor when I'm sick

978
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,180
But she didn't tell me

979
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,800
there are some illnesses
that doctors can't help

980
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,400
Those sleepless nights spent in anxiety

981
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,780
The regrets and remorse of failed pursuits

982
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,840
The unutterable regrets and sorrows

983
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,520
Sometimes, I wonder

984
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,420
if those who sacrifice
their time, health and happiness

985
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,280
really get what they want?

986
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,160
I have no idea. But if we don't

987
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,140
why don't we try
to love ourselves a little more?

988
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,140
Even just a little more
