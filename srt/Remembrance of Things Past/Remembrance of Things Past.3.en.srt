1
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:34,080
(Remembrance of Things Past)

2
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,800
It's 15.80 yuan

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,280
Madam, I don't have change
Who pays with cash these days?

4
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,160
I don't know how to use mobile payment

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,979
I'll check out the next customer's...

6
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,539
What are you doing?

7
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,700
It's against the law to refuse accepting cash

8
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,480
Do you expect this old lady
to use mobile payment?

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,660
I'll report you if you keep troubling her

10
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,419
Ma'am, I wish to let her check out
but I don't have cash here

11
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,540
I don't even have 50 yuan

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,060
Why don't you add on another item
so that it totals up to 60 yuan?

13
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,540
I just want these two cartons of milk

14
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,560
I'll pay for the old lady

15
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,340
It's fine. Scan mine

16
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,120
Such a sweet young lady

17
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,460
She's so kind

18
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,820
You're still here

19
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,620
I was waiting for you

20
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,520
You don't have to pay me back

21
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,740
No, I must. I shouldn't owe you

22
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,060
My house is nearby. Just over there

23
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll be right back. Wait for me here

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,640
- It's fine, Madam. Really
- Wait right here

25
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,420
- Wait here
- Okay, I'll wait. Take your time

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
- Watch your step
- Wait here

27
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,320
- Yes, I will
- Don't go anywhere

28
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,020
Okay, I won't. I'll wait for you

29
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,920
Why would she lie to me?

30
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,640
I even told her not to worry about it

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,860
Why would she lie and make me wait?

32
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,140
What if I leave and she comes back?

33
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,820
Then I'd be making that old lady
come back for nothing

34
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,660
She won't be coming back. Just go home

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,500
Okay, okay. I'll go in a bit

36
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,020
Don't just say you will

37
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,680
Got it. I'm really going to leave
You should go to sleep

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,060
Good night

39
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,880
I'll wait for ten more minutes

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,399
- Madam, you're back
- Thank goodness you're still here

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,899
- Thank goodness
- Don't worry. I waited for you

42
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,180
I forgot to turn off the tap
before coming out to get milk

43
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,780
Look at me

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,540
- Here's the money
- Thank you

45
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,340
This, too

46
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,659
- What's this?
- Red bean cake

47
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
I made the paste myself

48
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,820
It smells really sweet

49
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,020
You're right. It does!

50
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,640
I won't keep you then

51
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,540
I still have to clean up my place

52
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,380
- Go on. Watch your step
- Thank you

53
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,140
Be careful. Don't mention it

54
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,659
I'll make sure to eat this

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,380
Bye bye!

56
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,400
(Episode 3: Autism)

57
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,420
This is yours, isn't it?
It was found at Jing Jing's place

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,700
What's your relationship with her?

59
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,100
Are you the person in Jing Jing's Moments?

60
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,500
Did you two get into a fight?

61
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,940
- Did you hit her?
- Did you?

62
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,440
- You did?
- I don't hit women, let alone Jing Jing

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm her cousin. They are her best friends

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,060
We want to know your relationship with her

65
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,940
Hu Jing Jing was my girlfriend

66
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,240
Ex-girlfriend

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,240
To be honest, I felt that
my relationship with Jing Jing was bizarre

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,200
We dated for about three months

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
When I found out she...

70
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,920
I was shocked

71
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Hold on
When exactly were those three months?

72
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,340
From late March till July

73
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,580
The day before she passed

74
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,680
The day before? Were you cheating on her?

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,860
That's ridiculous! I only agreed to meet you
since you're her friends
The day before? Were you cheating on her?

76
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,120
That's ridiculous! I only agreed to meet you
since you're her friends

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,340
I have many questions too
I have no idea who to ask

78
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,180
Wait a minute
What were you two fighting about?

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,220
She suddenly wanted to break up

80
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,400
I thought she was cheating on me

81
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,160
Things got heated up and we fought

82
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,720
Then I broke a coffee mug

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
How did you two meet?

84
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,880
We were both in the
"Love Countryside" group on Douban

85
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,400
We chatted privately...

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,340
Get to the point

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
Then we added each other on WeChat

88
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,120
She was even the one who confessed
and wanted to be with me

89
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,020
Obviously, I liked her too
because she had a sweet smile

90
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,360
Did I ask? Her smile is none of your business

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Let him continue

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,640
We were good at first
but then it got strange

93
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,760
I felt that her mind was somewhere else
whenever we were on a date

94
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,120
She often looked upset

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,480
Her phone was always ringing
but she never answered it in front of me

96
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,200
At the cinemas
she often sneaked out to answer the call

97
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,920
and wouldn't return
even after the movie was over

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,820
Whenever I've found her
she'd be sobbing and saying, "I'm fine"

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,120
I told her that she could tell me anything
but she was never willing to open up

100
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,000
If you were in my shoes
wouldn't you think you're a rebound?

101
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,480
So, to sum it up, you two met online

102
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,840
Jing Jing made the first move
and you two dated for three months

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,680
On the day before her birthday
she told you she wanted to break up

104
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,440
- Yes
- You two fought, but you didn't hit her?

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,320
That's right. I didn't hit her

106
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Did you say something
that could have triggered her?

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,480
- Did you say such things?
- Did you?

108
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,680
Ladies, are you seriously thinking
I'm linked to her suicide?

109
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Firstly, we liked each other

110
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,680
Secondly, we only dated for three months

111
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,200
If you were me, would you curse her out
and even hit her because of that?

112
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
What about you?

113
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,400
Would you kill yourself for a guy
you only dated for three months? No way

114
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
- Then what...
- Never mind. We got it

115
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,800
Thanks for meeting us. You may leave

116
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,280
We still have a lot of questions

117
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,720
Did you know that Jing Jing had a boyfriend?

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,760
- Xu Yan, did you?
- No

119
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,880
But I guess I get it

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
What do you know?

121
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,000
You rambled all night to me and Jing Jing
on the first day

122
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,320
you got together with Shen Zi Chang

123
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,039
Well, we're different

124
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,799
Besides, we know everything
about Shen Zi Chang

125
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,240
There's nothing I can't share

126
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,040
As for Jing Jing, she has always kept quiet
about her relationships

127
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
- Always?
- Always?

128
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,560
- What do you mean by that?
- Exactly. What do you mean?

129
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,280
I mean...

130
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,560
Did I say "always"?

131
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,920
I didn't say "always"
I said she's bubbly around us

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,540
But when it comes to relationships
she's pretty shy about it

133
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,400
Do you think we can trust Gao Yang?

134
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,800
I don't know, but I don't think
he has a reason to lie

135
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,420
What's bothering me instead, is that

136
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,160
the Jing Jing he was talking about
feels like a completely different person

137
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
I felt the same

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,160
Lately, I've been wondering
if we didn't know her well enough

139
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,080
So do you think the breakup
on the night before and her losing her job

140
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,640
could have led to her...

141
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,260
No idea

142
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,720
We only have his side of the story

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,080
Jing Jing can't confront him now either

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,280
But her phone will be fixed in two days
We'll probably find a lead there

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,420
I'm heading back to the office. Want a lift?

146
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,760
- No need
- Alright, then

147
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,120
- You're really not giving us a lift?
- Take the subway

148
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
- You're so petty!
- Let me know when the phone is fixed

149
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,240
Okay. Go on

150
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
Don't you think he's unbelievable?

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,240
It's our third anniversary
yet I don't even amount to a handbag

152
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Just leave it here

153
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,120
- Yes, you're right
- Put down your phone!

154
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,280
Fine. I'll put it away

155
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,600
I also found out that the bag
comes in two grades

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,440
One is 288 yuan, the other is 688 yuan

157
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,240
Shen Zi Chang immediately picked the former

158
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,520
Xu Yan, now I'm angry

159
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
- Exactly
- You're a princess to us

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
How could you compare yourself to a handbag?

161
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,760
Are you happy hearing
that you're worthy of a branded bag?

162
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,120
Of course. It's better than
that 288 yuan worth handbag

163
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,520
Whose side are you on?

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,980
I'm no doubt on your side

165
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,560
- Shen Zi Chang acted out of line
- Exactly

166
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
He shouldn't get a fake one

167
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,520
You can easily get
two nice bags online with 288 yuan

168
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm sorry

169
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,400
I shouldn't have said that
But think of it this way

170
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,000
He earns about
seven to eight thousand per month

171
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
He spends half of it on you

172
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,520
Asking for such an expensive handbag
does seem a little too demanding

173
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,520
No, you're wrong

174
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,600
Shen Zi Chang is from Beijing
He lives with his family

175
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,720
His salary is basically his net earnings
unlike us

176
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,500
Most of our salary would be gone
after paying for expenses

177
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
He's just stingy

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,200
He doesn't care about me

179
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,400
So getting you a 20,000 yuan worth handbag
means caring about you?

180
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,520
Qiao Xi Chen, it's not like
you can weigh someone's sincerity

181
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,360
I just want him to show that he cares

182
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,600
You're absolutely right
How long should we stay mad at him this time?

183
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,920
I've thought about it

184
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,200
I can't forgive him easily

185
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,540
Not until he apologizes a dozen times

186
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,160
Good. Give him the cold shoulder

187
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,040
How's it going with Su Qing's matter?

188
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,960
I visited the security room today
hoping to check the security footage

189
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Sir

190
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Young lady
No matter what you tell me today, it's no use

191
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,340
I'm not the boss

192
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,880
There's no way you'd get to see the footage
without the manager's permission

193
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,560
Sir, I know what you mean

194
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,700
I know you're in a tight spot
but this footage is really important to me

195
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,440
If I don't get to see it today, I'll probably

196
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,240
- get fired tomorrow
- Hold it right there

197
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,040
If I let you look at it today
I'll be fired tomorrow for sure

198
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,520
Sir, how about just a glimpse?

199
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,720
I promise I won't tell anyone
Just a glimpse will do

200
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
Please, sir

201
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
- Just a glimpse?
- Yes

202
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,520
- Hurry up, then
- Thank you, sir

203
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,120
Watch closely

204
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,580
That's it. Just a glimpse

205
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,000
You have quite a sense of humor, sir

206
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,160
My hands are tied

207
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,040
But you know
that's not where the problem lies

208
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,680
My colleagues said that Jian Yi Fan
was recruited by Old President Han

209
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,520
in order to get rid of Mr. Jiang's people

210
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Yi Ning works under Mr. Jiang

211
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,480
I work under Yi Ning
Therefore, I'm one of Mr. Jiang's

212
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,960
So they'll be getting rid of me eventually

213
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm probably going to lose my job

214
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,320
Does Mr. Jiang know that you're one of his?

215
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,480
No, I don't think so

216
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,400
Sorry for the trouble

217
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Don't mention it. Miss Mai told us
to help you as much as we can

218
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,960
Pause that

219
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,320
Can you find out where she came from?

220
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,280
- No, I...
- Do you think an explanation would suffice?

221
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,500
Or...

222
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,400
Are you planning on making up another lie?

223
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,360
Mr. Jian, I'm sorry. I freaked out
On the spur of the moment, I...

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,320
You realized you lost your list of quotations

225
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,120
So you stole Qiao Xi Chen's
and blamed it on her

226
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,320
I was even holding it during the meeting

227
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,680
I don't think you did it
on the spur of the moment

228
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
You were way too calm

229
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Jian

230
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,400
I know I've made a mistake

231
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,480
Can you give me another chance?

232
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,440
I'll apologize to Qiao Xi Chen
Just please let me stay

233
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
If an apology is enough, what am I here for?

234
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,280
You made a mistake and framed a colleague

235
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,160
Not only does it show
that you're careless at work

236
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,400
It even shows that you're cruel and vile
when your personal interest is at stake

237
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm vile?

238
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,160
That's because you're dismissing employees

239
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,440
Do you think you're the only one on the list?

240
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,860
You're not

241
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,880
But I can tell you one thing

242
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,080
None of them are malicious
and deceitful like you

243
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,320
You know how I used to be

244
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,120
But I've really changed lately

245
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,680
I kind of pity her

246
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,960
Have you lost your mind?

247
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,720
Why would you pity her? She framed you

248
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,600
I keep thinking of Jing Jing
I just feel that...

249
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Jing Jing worked so hard

250
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,440
But they fired her just like that

251
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,760
I just feel that...

252
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,400
We're all outlanders here in Beijing
making a living

253
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,280
It isn't easy keeping a job

254
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,960
That's why I somewhat pity and understand her

255
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,840
I really don't want the people around me
to end up like Jing Jing

256
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
Are you happy now?

257
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,680
I've been dismissed

258
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,200
Your grievances have been redressed

259
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,320
Yes, I'm quite pleased

260
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,440
But you've worded it wrongly

261
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,200
It's not that my grievances were redressed
but that God is watching

262
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,680
Su Qing

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,040
You were afraid of being dismissed, so you
wanted to join the 818 promotion project

264
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,680
Fine. I brought you into the team

265
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,680
You liked showing off to the director
Fine. I let you

266
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm fine with all that

267
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,680
But don't you think
you've crossed the line this time?

268
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,240
You refused to admit your faults
and you even framed me

269
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,640
You think I wanted to shift the blame?

270
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,720
I just can't afford to take it

271
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,480
No one in the department likes me anyway

272
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I was never going to get a raise
nor get promoted

273
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,720
I can accept all that

274
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,440
But making me lose my job when I'm 30?

275
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,200
I know

276
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,820
I know what I did was wrong

277
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,520
But I really didn't have a choice

278
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,000
You're 30

279
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,540
Have you wondered
why none of your colleagues like you?

280
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,040
In order to perfect our plan
we worked hard and we worked overtime

281
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,440
But what were you doing?

282
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,080
Who are you to lecture me?

283
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
- Am I wrong for wanting an easier life?
- No

284
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,760
Everybody wants an easy life

285
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,120
But since you've made your bed
you should lie in it

286
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,640
I hope you live a good life

287
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,820
- Mr. Jian
- Just a minute

288
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,760
You have quite a sense of humor, sir

289
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
Where are you from?

290
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,720
You can't tell?

291
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm from the Fort of Tianjin

292
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,440
I'm from the northeast

293
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,320
How about this?

294
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,160
Let me have a look

295
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,120
I can tell you this

296
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,440
Someone took a copy of the security footage
that you want yesterday

297
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,680
- Speak
- Mr. Jian

298
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,680
I...

299
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,860
Thank you

300
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
For dealing with Su Qing, and...

301
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,720
I actually tried to get a copy
of the security footage

302
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,480
The security guard refused to give it to me
but he said someone took it

303
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,400
I figured it was most probably you

304
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,700
I guess you got along well with the guard

305
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,040
He's from Tianjin

306
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,960
Sorry, that wasn't the point

307
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,260
What I wanted to say was...

308
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,000
I'd like to make a proper apology

309
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,280
You just thanked me
Why are you apologizing now?

310
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,240
Because of what you told me
at the office previously

311
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,840
I thought you were wrong
I thought you still wanted to get rid of me

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,440
But, as it turns out, I was wrong

313
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,060
I misunderstood you. I feel bad

314
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,480
Remember what I said to you the other day?

315
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:04,680
You said a few other colleagues and I
were in HR's initial layoff list

316
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,880
But you said you'd only look at
how good we can do our jobs

317
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,480
As long as I'm competent
I don't have to be afraid

318
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,600
So do you still think that you're incompetent
and I would dismiss you?

319
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,040
That's actually not that I think
It's just...

320
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,120
You know how it is at a workplace

321
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,280
Managers tend to say things
that they don't mean. So I...

322
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,200
I didn't expect you to be a man of your words

323
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,440
Thank you
for noticing that I'm a man of my words

324
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,080
Mr. Jian, that's all I have to say

325
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,800
Sorry for taking up your time
I'll take my leave

326
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,320
Wait

327
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,440
Do I look busy
hanging out at the rooftop alone?

328
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
Do you think I'd start drinking
once you leave?

329
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,080
There aren't any empty bottles
on the floor today

330
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,240
I was a little emotional that day
so I drank a little

331
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,800
Did you fail to learn the units of measure?

332
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,160
You call that "a little"?

333
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
No

334
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,080
I drank quite a lot and I was quite emotional

335
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
Actually, I...

336
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,720
First of all
I didn't drink during working hours

337
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,040
I only started drinking two minutes later

338
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,240
Furthermore, I have nothing against you

339
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
I was really dejected that day
I needed an outlet or I would have exploded

340
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
That day...

341
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,400
Even if it wasn't you
but a utility pole instead...

342
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm not saying you're a utility pole
I mean, it doesn't matter who you are

343
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,900
No, that's not what I meant. I meant...

344
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
Well, it doesn't matter what...

345
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,220
I mean, who...

346
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,120
- I would take it out on anyone regardless
- Okay

347
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,160
Besides, this rooftop
doesn't just belong to Yann Coffee

348
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
It's for every employee in this building

349
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,000
To put it simply
it's no different from a road

350
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,880
Let's say I happen to be drunk
and acting crazily on the streets one day

351
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,920
- You would just turn a blind eye
- I wouldn't

352
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,240
If I see you acting irrationally
while you're drunk on the streets one day

353
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,560
I wouldn't leave you alone

354
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,000
Everyone faces a time
when they can't get hold of themselves

355
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,480
Just let it out

356
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,880
Just cry it out if you have to

357
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,120
Or laugh out loud if you have to
There's nothing wrong with that

358
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,120
If you feel overwhelmed lately
take a few days off

359
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,680
Mr. Jian, I'm seriously alright

360
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,040
Why are you urging me to go on a leave?

361
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,640
If I, as a boss
keep telling you to go on leave

362
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,040
won't you think
that I'm planning to fire you?

363
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,640
Not only are you bad at measurements
you can't even tell when someone's being nice

364
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,680
I want you to take leave

365
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm worried that
you're exhausted and stressed

366
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,080
Mr. Zhang is very pleased

367
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,000
with the home wedding

368
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
Well done, everyone

369
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,800
It's passed eight now

370
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,080
Book a table. I'll treat everyone to dinner

371
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,040
Sister Jia, don't you know what day it is?

372
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,760
I know. It's Wednesday

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Sister Jia, I've got a girlfriend recently

374
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,560
Sister Jia, it's Chinese Valentine's Day

375
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,040
Go on. You're dismissed. Go on your dates

376
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,280
Make sure you receive
the red packet I've sent

377
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,440
- Thank you, Sister Jia
- Love you, Sister Jia!

378
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,280
Thank you, Sister Jia

379
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
If I were single, I would go after Sister Jia

380
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,660
I can hear you. Say that when you're outside

381
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,260
You sound so fake

382
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,840
Nan Jia, what do you want to do
once you've recovered?

383
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,200
What else? Open a branch office

384
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,620
You're always thinking about making money
Think of something nicer

385
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,720
I have to think of that
You never know until you fall sick

386
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,920
You become weak. You might just go like that

387
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,040
I should earn more money for my parents
while I still can

388
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,400
At least they wouldn't be left with nothing
if you drop dead one day

389
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,240
How about this?

390
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,640
Once you've recovered, let's go and

391
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,000
find men

392
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,060
I think we'll need to up our game
in order to look for a man

393
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,540
Aren't we taking notes now? Come on!

394
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,500
Why do I have to watch this movie? Why?

395
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm so jealous

396
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Switch it to "Focus Report"

397
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,380
There's a steamier scene later on

398
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,060
Just wait. It's coming up soon

399
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,300
No, I can't stand this

400
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,620
- I don't deserve having this
- I'm sweating now! Don't touch me!

401
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,140
Here it comes. Knocking on the door

402
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,780
You have to do this

403
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,020
Hold on

404
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:38,020
Yes. It's proven that I had nothing to do
with the quotation list

405
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,420
But he kept urging me to go on leave

406
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,580
What do you think he's trying to do?

407
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,700
It seems sketchy to me

408
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,580
You said he dismissed those
that your ex-director favored, right?

409
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,700
I think he's dropping you hints
to make you resign

410
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,500
He wants me to resign?

411
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,460
No way. The company
has to give compensation for firing someone

412
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,780
I'm not quitting on my own

413
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,700
You can think about that later

414
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,260
I think you should start looking for
another job so that you have a backup plan

415
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,860
Your family isn't loaded

416
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,900
Alright. I have to get back to work. Bye!

Though it's an assistant job

What do you mean by that?

424

It's still a job. We should
treat all jobs seriously. Am I right?

00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,780
Can I get a cheaper offer?

470
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,480
You see, we offer you
a year-long professional service

471
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,280
- As for the following year...
- Following year?

472
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,580
- Two years isn't enough to find me a match?
- Of course not

473
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:25,260
A rare gem like you
will find a match in no time

474
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,699
But let's say you want to be open to
more options when the time comes

475
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,260
that's not a problem too

476
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,940
We have a member
who has been with us for five years

477
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,219
I remember a friend of mine
used to be a member here

478
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,900
Her fee wasn't this expensive

479
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,620
When did your friend sign up with us?

480
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,699
It's been quite a while back

481
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,580
Her kid is six years old now
She found her husband here

482
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,139
Is she around your age?

483
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,380
Obviously, then. Think about it

484
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,440
She wasn't even 30 when she signed up

485
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,260
But you're 36 this year, right?

486
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,820
Turning 36, but not yet

487
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,140
The fee for our female members
increases and doubles based on their age

488
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,680
How should I put this?
Yes, it's pricey, but think about it

489
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,240
The price might be different next year

490
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,660
Okay

491
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,020
How bold and unhesitating of you

492
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,220
With such a decisive character
Who would have a successful career if not you?

493
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
You are?

494
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,720
Who are you?

495
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,620
I'm new here

496
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,760
I see

497
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,140
Allow me to introduce myself

498
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,860
I'm the assistant to Yann Coffee
marketing department's new director

499
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,420
My name is Ou Yang

500
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,700
Young man. Don't forget my name

501
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,620
You'll need it in the marketing department

502
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,780
What's the name of the new director?

503
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,300
The new director's name

504
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,140
It's...

505
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,220
- It's Jian...
- Is it Jian Yi Fan?

506
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,540
- That's right. How did you know?
- That's my name

507
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,620
Mr. Jian, I'm Ou Yang

508
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,460
Coffee without sugar

509
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Got it

510
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,940
- Want coffee?
- No, thanks

511
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,440
Hello?

512
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,800
This afternoon?

513
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,460
Sure. I'll see you later

514
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
Alright. Thanks. Bye

515
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,800
Sure. Not a problem

516
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,620
I'll bring it over in the afternoon
once I'm done with work

517
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,660
Mr. Jian, here's your coffee

518
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,820
- Earlier, I was...
- Tell Qiao Xi Chen to come to my office

519
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,500
- Okay. Do you need me to take minutes?
- No need

520
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,140
Organize the data for the batch of coffee
that passed customs clearance today

521
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,060
Okay. Consider it done

522
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,300
Qiao Xi Chen

523
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,220
- Hi!
- Hi

524
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,780
- Hi
- Nice to meet you. I'm Ou Yang

525
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,740
I'm Mr. Jian's new assistant

526
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,340
- Nice to meet you
- It's my first day and...

527
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,780
I skimmed through the marketing staff details

528
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,020
It's so hard to tell from your pictures
but I recognized you right away

529
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,180
I have a keen eye, don't I?

530
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,220
- Yes
- I have a question

531
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,900
Are things usually hectic
in the marketing department?

532
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,340
Do you work on weekends?

533
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,900
That's up to you

534
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,180
Do you have any idea about Mr. Jian's hobbies?

535
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,220
I'm not that close with him

536
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,940
I think he likes playing games and tennis

537
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,260
Playing games

538
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,180
By the way, how many people
are there in the marketing department?

539
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,740
It's my first day
so I want to buy everyone milk tea

540
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,160
- Twenty-six, excluding Mr. Jian. Thanks
- Don't mention it

541
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,820
I have to be elsewhere
If there's nothing else, then I'll...

542
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,820
There is. Mr. Jian was asking for you
He wants you to come to his office

543
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,420
- Right now?
- Yes. Go on

544
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,100
- Okay. Thanks
- You're welcome

545
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,780
- Keep it up. Bye bye
- Thanks. You too

546
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,900
Mr. Jian, you wanted to see me?

547
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,900
Take me to check out the venue
for the 818 promotion this afternoon

548
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,100
We faced problems with
the online live streaming

549
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,980
There mustn't be any mistakes
with the offline event

550
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,860
I want to check on the security

551
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,460
This afternoon?

552
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,600
Is there a problem?

553
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Usually if we want to check out the venue
we have to give them a call first

554
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,180
I don't think it's possible now
on short notice

555
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,980
How about tomorrow morning instead?

556
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,140
Okay, tomorrow morning it is

557
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,620
Okay, I'll give them a call now

558
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,460
- I'll let you know once it's confirmed
- Okay

559
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,980
Okay. That's all we want to know

560
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,420
One last question

561
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,220
If you come work for us, how long do you need
before you can leave Yann Coffee?

562
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,020
Two weeks, I presume
As I'm currently handling an event

563
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,340
It would be irresponsible of me
to not follow through

564
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,780
Alright. That's all then. We'll contact you

565
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,540
Alright. Thank you

566
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,580
You've seriously hurt my feelings

567
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,900
How could you turn me down
when I'm being so sincere?

568
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,980
That is why I came to you personally
just to apologize

569
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,500
Fine. I know Damei is too small for you

570
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,700
If I leave Yann Coffee one day
I'll come straight to you, okay?

571
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,340
- Mr. Jiang should hear this
- Qiao Xi Chen

572
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,660
Sure

573
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,660
- Okay then. Bye
- Qiao Xi Chen

574
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,220
- You forgot your phone
- Thank you

575
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,420
There's something I forgot to ask earlier

576
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,140
- Besides marketing specialist...
- Everything's good. Thank you

577
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,700
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

578
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,960
Are you coming or not?

579
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,180
Qiao Xi Chen

580
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,020
Mr. Jian

581
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,700
What did Damei offer you?

582
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,260
Double your salary or some high position?

583
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,620
No

584
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,820
That means you feel uneasy
working at Yann Coffee

585
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,660
No

586
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,260
Then it must be me as the new director

587
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,620
What are you talking about?

588
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,740
So it is because of me

589
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,380
Alright, kids. Halt!

590
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,580
That's all for today's class

591
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,060
Class dismissed!

592
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,860
Goodbye, sir!

593
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,100
Go play

594
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,060
Sir, you dropped this

595
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,880
Thank you

596
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,700
Good going, Shen Zi Chang

597
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,940
You've ignored me for three days
Just you wait!

598
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,120
What are you doing? This is so embarrassing
So many people are watching

599
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,420
Shen Zi Chang
this isn't going to work anymore

600
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,580
- Take it off
- My neck!

601
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,940
Where are your hands? Where are they?

602
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,300
Come on. Get up

603
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,060
You can just take out your hands. Come on

604
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,140
I can't. I prepared you a huge present

605
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,020
What kind of present?

606
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,340
You're trying to trick me again
with a replica, aren't you?

607
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,740
This isn't a replica
Look, the receipt is in the bag

608
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,540
It's an authentic one this time

609
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,020
I couldn't afford the handbag you wanted
previously, so I got you a smaller one

610
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,140
But I've checked with them. This is
last year's collection. It's still in trend

611
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,260
I'll get you a nicer one
after I've cleared all my debt

612
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,060
- You don't feel bad?
- I do

613
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,740
But it's not because of the money
It's because of you

614
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,280
Getting my girlfriend a handbag
is no big deal

615
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,580
- Exactly
- Right? I'll just live on dirt

616
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,560
Poor thing. I'll give you a straw
so that you can live on air too

617
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,780
Thank you, Your Majesty!

618
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,300
If my wife wants me to live on air
then live on air I shall

619
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,620
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not your wife

620
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,860
- But you will be
- Cut it out

621
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,340
Quickly take this off
or you'll get a heatstroke

622
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,380
That's no big deal
I can even take a bullet for you

623
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,720
Come closer then

624
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,700
Thank you, hubby

625
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,300
My boss is best buddies
with the top millionaire of the country

626
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,640
He accompanies him to meals
whenever the millionaire visits Beijing

627
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,540
What you're earning are just peanuts

628
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,420
From the way I see it
do you not do any house chores?

629
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,620
You're still single at this age

630
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,940
Is it because of failures
in past relationships?

631
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,740
Have you done a body checkup this year?

632
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,700
Are you still physically capable of
bearing a child?

633
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,420
I love children

634
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,460
It would be brilliant
if you give me a daughter

635
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,220
Ma'am, are you really 36?

636
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,980
You don't look like it

637
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,180
You must have spent a lot on your face

638
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,660
I know a really good cosmetic surgeon
He's a friend of mine

639
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,820
Just a nose job and some bone contouring

640
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,980
I can guarantee you'll look ten years younger

641
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,580
You can afford it anyway

642
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,340
Look at me

643
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,380
Do you own a house?

644
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,860
What about a car?

645
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,300
I mean, I'm still so young

646
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,100
You can't expect me
to be the breadwinner, right?

647
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,500
Then what do you do for a living?

648
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,780
Why are you still not married at this age?

649
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,220
- I'm a driver
- That's nothing to be ashamed of

650
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,620
Do you have any illness?
Too talkative? Ask too many questions?

651
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,620
Since you know a cosmetic surgeon
why didn't you get a face job?

652
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,940
Do I need one?

653
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,700
Don't you?

654
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,460
Got it

655
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,380
I'll handle it

656
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,960
Alright, then

657
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,740
- Mr. Jian, there's been an incident
- I know

658
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,500
Our transportation van
got into an accident on the highway

659
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,500
Even the new fall products we need tomorrow
which is the osmanthus series, are all gone

660
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,460
Even if we get the factory
to make a new batch, it'll be too late

661
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,620
Tell Wu Tian Qiang
to get stock from the warehouse

662
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,860
Replace the new fall items with our classic
lattes in tins and last season's cold brew

663
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,420
How can you do that?

664
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,720
The R&D department worked overtime
for the osmanthus series

665
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,660
to launch it on Chinese Valentine's Day
before Wake Coffee

666
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,620
If you replace it with other products
all our efforts would go to waste

667
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,460
Furthermore, if Wake Coffee also launches
an osmanthus series in a couple of days

668
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,220
we would have worked so hard for nothing

669
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,780
I'm sorry. Forget what I've said

670
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,340
I was concerned about that too

671
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,580
But instead of canceling the event
I'd rather settle with the next best solution

672
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,420
Liaise with Wu Tian Qiang

673
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,780
Tell him to take down everything
related to the new products

674
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,820
Mr. Jian, there's another way

675
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,660
We haven't distributed our osmanthus series
to supermarkets and major stores

676
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,340
But in order to boost sales
for Chinese Valentine's Day

677
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,500
the factory made an expedited batch

678
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,100
Stores in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, and Hangzhou have received it

679
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,980
There are 13 stores in Beijing
which probably gives us...

680
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,440
3,200 cans

681
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,380
But we can't take all of it

682
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,100
If the factory ships it today
the products should arrive in two days

683
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,580
That way, we can put aside an amount
that's enough for two days

684
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,020
Which is 800 cans

685
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
No, wait. That's not enough

686
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,580
We have coffee tasting, lucky draw
and purchase discount for our event

687
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,260
Allocating 800 cans is too risky

688
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,580
Have those stores do an event
to only sell 77 cans for the first three days

689
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,340
Good idea. It matches Chinese Valentine's Day

690
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,300
That way, we'll have...

691
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,940
More than 400 cans extra
That would be enough, right?

692
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,980
It seems to me you're like a fish in water
working here

693
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,420
Yes, it seems like it

694
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,540
I'll get back to work, Mr. Jian

695
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,400
What are you doing?

696
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,140
Nothing

697
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,740
That's yours?

698
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,340
This is a new design

699
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,140
I don't know. I said I liked it
and my boyfriend got it for me

700
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,380
The workmanship is pretty good

701
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,420
Help me ask your boyfriend for the link

702
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,720
This bag can most likely pass as an authentic

703
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,620
- Your boyfriend has a good eye
- No, this is...

704
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,540
It looks so nice

705
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,940
I'll get the link from him

706
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,140
See you!

707
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,740
To be honest, I didn't want to come

708
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,260
You should thank your matchmaking consultant

709
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,980
She called me so many times

710
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,840
It was so annoying

711
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,180
She has a tough job too

712
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,620
So I thought, why not?
It won't hurt to come meet you

713
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,940
You look quite pretty when you smile

714
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,180
You don't look like you're almost 40

715
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,540
Yes, I did spend quite a bit on my face

716
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,340
If you keep this up
I think we might make this work

717
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,580
You are older, but luckily still under 40

718
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,380
I think it's still possible
if we quickly get married and have babies

719
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,180
And your job

720
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,500
If we get married
you'll have to find another job

721
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,340
My family is very strict

722
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,100
My family won't approve of
your high-profile job

723
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,740
Are you a registered resident in Beijing yet?

724
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,020
Not yet

725
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,860
Neither am I

726
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,740
If you're not, then it'll be a huge problem
when our kids attend school

727
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,220
Yes, it is a huge problem

728
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,020
Are you qualified for application?

729
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,020
Have you applied for your points?

730
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,380
Do you know what are minor injuries?

731
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,620
- Come again?
- Minor injuries

732
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,420
The kind that isn't considered
criminally liable. I'll list a few

733
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,980
Bruised scalp, scalp hematoma

734
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,580
Non-perforated facial injuries
linear nasal fracture

735
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,700
- These are minor injuries
- What are you trying to say?

736
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,080
I only talked about
my outer qualities earlier

737
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,180
You see

738
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,140
I have a wide range of hobbies

739
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,940
I look skinny
but I've practiced Muay Thai for five years

740
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,780
People from the northeast hate getting
nagged at. Once I'm annoyed, I get physical

741
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,040
But don't worry
You'll only get minor injuries

742
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,500
And I...

743
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,220
It's getting in my way

744
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,460
Why don't you tell me
if you're happy with this blind date?

745
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,340
I...

746
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,660
She's crazy!

747
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,900
Alright

748
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,340
1,200 cans, right?

749
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,300
Which store?

750
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:46,260
If you want more on such short notice
I'll have to recalculate everything

751
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,940
- Is this the last box?
- Yes

752
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,460
- Thank you
- Is the amount right?

753
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,180
- You need a hand?
- No, I'm fine

754
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,660
- Thank you!
- Don't sweat it

755
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,660
I appreciate your help

756
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,740
Watch out. This way

757
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,780
- Come here
- I'll take it from here

758
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,220
It's not that I don't want to help

759
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,100
Our car was hit yesterday and my husband
has gone back to his hometown

760
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,060
I have to watch the store alone
and look after the kid

761
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,180
It's fine. Don't worry about it

762
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,580
You worked overtime today
to sort this out for me

763
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,920
I'm already feeling bad as it is

764
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,980
Don't worry about me. I'll just hail a car

765
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,300
Quickly get back. Don't leave the kid alone

766
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,300
- Be careful then
- I will. I'll return the cart later

767
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,460
Sure. Bye bye!

768
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,640
(Request standard express car
Number 387 in line)

769
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,620
I think the last one was pretty good

770
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,300
That guy?

771
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,820
Didn't I pick two previously?
Were you not able to arrange a meeting?

772
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,140
The process for arranging a meeting is

773
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,720
we filter out the male members
based on your requirements

774
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,180
If you give us the green light
then only will we contact them

775
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,980
But of course, the male member
has to be interested as well

776
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,620
Got it. They're not interested in meeting me

777
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,740
- Understood
- I mean...

778
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,140
I think this is completely normal

779
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,100
Men get intimidated easily by women like you

780
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,500
That is why I wanted to talk to you
about something

781
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:59,460
How about lowering
your requirement standards?

782
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,740
You want me to go lower?

783
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,060
What is it, Mom?

784
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,820
Have you gotten off from work?

785
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,940
No, I'm working overtime

786
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,780
It's nothing, actually

787
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,820
The weather forecast said
it'll be chilly tomorrow

788
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,140
Put on more layers. Don't catch a cold

789
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,220
Okay, I will

790
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,140
I can't talk to you now
My colleague is calling me

791
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,060
- I have to hang up
- Okay, go on

792
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,460
- I'll talk to you next time
- Bye bye

793
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,260
- Miao
- Where are you, Qiao Qiao?

794
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,060
I'm stuck here
The traffic is really bad in Zhongguancun

795
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,740
Then when are you going to get back?

796
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,780
You'll have to deal with those coffee sleeves
till tomorrow morning

797
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,740
What else can I do?

798
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,500
Don't worry about it. You may go

799
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,420
Sorry, Qiao Qiao

800
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,120
My boyfriend just got back from Tianjin today

801
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,960
As you know, we barely get to meet

802
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,540
Yes, it's fine

803
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,100
I can't talk now
I've got to hail a car. Bye!

804
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,240
(Request standard express car
Number 123 in line)

805
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,160
Hello? Nan Jia

806
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,960
Are you busy?

807
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,380
Why are you sleeping at the side of the road?

808
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,960
What are these?

809
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,780
How long have you been stuck here?
Come on. Get up!

810
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,000
- Where are the male employees?
- Wait a minute, Nan Jia

811
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,700
Pull me up, please. My legs are numb

812
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,260
Are you okay?

813
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,420
- Grab on tight
- I'll just shake it off

814
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,300
Just grab on to this. I'll load the boxes

815
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,260
- Can you manage?
- Yes

816
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,620
Let me do it

817
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,060
This is so heavy, Qiao!

818
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,100
What the heck?

819
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,040
This is delicious. I'm famished
Thank you, Nan Jia

820
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,600
You poor thing

821
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,980
What's wrong with your company?

822
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,340
They left a frail girl
taking care of this on her own

823
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,860
What kind of company is that?

824
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,860
It's not their fault. This is my project

825
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,220
It's my job, anyway

826
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,620
Besides, I've been working really hard lately

827
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,380
I'm afraid that the new director
will find fault with me

828
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,660
Why would he do that?

829
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,940
I got caught going for a job interview
at another company

830
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,460
What are you doing?

831
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,980
It's like when someone
is about to be beheaded

832
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,620
What's worse isn't when you get beheaded
but when the sword is hanging over your head

833
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,180
You don't know when it will drop
It drives you nuts

834
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,060
Anyway, enough of this
I think I just have to do a great job

835
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,860
Even if he wants to fire me
there's no reason for him to do it

836
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,860
Well said!

837
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,920
What's up with you?

838
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,660
Where did you go looking all dressed up?

839
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,340
To meet a client?

840
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,820
Looking like this? I went on a blind date

841
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,260
Are you kidding me?

842
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,220
- For real?
- Yes. You think I'm lying?

843
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,020
All of a sudden?

844
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,060
It's pretty sad

845
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,660
You know, the guy I met earlier

846
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,660
I worked so hard for 36 years

847
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,700
He rejected me in 20 minutes

848
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,620
What do I lack? What's wrong with me?

849
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,300
You don't lack a single thing

850
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,260
But you know what I'm thinking?

851
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,180
If Jing Jing found out
that you went on a blind date

852
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,820
she'll definitely think
you're selling yourself short

853
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,740
Do you all think blind dates look cheap?

854
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,980
No, we don't think so

855
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:41,140
Back then, the three of us used to say
we wanted to hold a blind date party

856
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,900
But all of us think that...

857
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,740
We think that blind dates
aren't right for you

858
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,220
I used to think that
after we graduate from university

859
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,080
we would eventually compromise with life

860
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:06,940
But I always thought that the last one
to yield would surely be you

861
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,380
Just leave it
I just have to go open the door

862
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,460
- No, I'll come with you
- No, it's fine

863
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,740
You can't lift those boxes

864
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,620
Don't worry about me

865
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,420
No, just leave it

866
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,120
You can't lift them either

867
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,340
Where are the guys? I'm speechless

868
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,180
That's too big to carry. Put it down first

869
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,180
- I'll leave your bag here
- Okay

870
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,900
Leave it. Your nails are broken

871
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,260
Put it down. Just leave it

872
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,380
Just leave it and go home

873
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,980
- I'll take you home
- I'm serious!

874
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,860
I have to take care of these coffee sleeves

875
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,020
You need to put them on each cup?

876
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,340
- I have to finish it tonight
- Alone?

877
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:29,260
Don't worry. I'll call people over to help

878
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,500
Give them a call now
How can you handle this alone?

879
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,020
Don't worry. I won't ask you to help

880
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,700
Thank you. I can handle it

881
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,780
I thought you can call it a day

882
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,700
- What's wrong?
- My stomach's a little aching

883
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,900
It's nothing. Quickly get it done

884
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,820
- Is it aching badly?
- I had gastroenteritis two days ago

885
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,100
I'll leave if you don't need me
Quickly call people over

886
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,220
- It's already so late
- Don't worry. They'll be here soon

887
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,820
Go home. Drink some hot water

888
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,580
Don't worry about me. Make sure
you drink hot water once you get home

889
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,100
Have a bowl of porridge

890
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,260
- I'm really leaving!
- Bye!

891
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,160
I'm starving. Let's go

892
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,620
Why aren't you carrying the bag I gave you?

893
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,580
I left it upstairs

894
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,940
Otherwise, my colleagues would say
it's a top quality replica

895
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,620
I swear I bought you an authentic one

896
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,240
Don't worry. I wasn't blaming you

897
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,220
Seeing them being so skeptical
made me realize something

898
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,660
- What is it?
- The difference between me and Nan Jia

899
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:01,580
is that even if she's carrying a top quality
replica, people would think it's authentic

900
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:06,060
But if I carry an authentic one
people would still think it's a replica

901
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,620
So it's not that I can't afford it

902
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,460
It's just that I'm not classy enough

903
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,060
Who said so?

904
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,440
I doubt it. Let's go buy
a pricier and better bag tomorrow

905
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,980
Shen Zi Chang, you know what?

906
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,660
I like handbags, but I like you more

907
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,140
- Give me a hug
- You got it

908
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,460
- Let's go eat
- Let's go

909
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,060
- What should we eat?
- No idea

910
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,220
Though she kept saying that
she chose not to marry

911
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,500
it actually showed
how strict she was with herself

912
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:59,160
She's still full of spirit and confidence

913
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,220
Regardless of age and gender

914
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,860
there comes a time for every ambitious
and courageous soul to bloom

915
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,020
I'll be frank with you

916
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:19,780
Women like you who are older
have high income, and have stayed single

917
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,660
are the hardest ones
to find a match in the market

918
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,180
And men around this age
usually prefer women below 30

919
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:33,500
On top of that, men would mind
if the woman earns more than him

920
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,100
He thinks it's embarrassing

921
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,440
Divorced women who are above 30 are more
acceptable than those who have stayed single

922
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,860
At least she has had a marriage before

923
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,420
She has been approved of before

924
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,940
We don't think blind dates are cheap
We just think it's not right for you

925
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:54,240
But I don't know why you're making yourself
do something that doesn't suit you

926
01:03:54,380 --> 01:04:01,340
We would eventually compromise with life
but the last one to yield would surely be you

927
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,980
Xiao Tang

928
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,140
I just want to notify you

929
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,820
The meeting you arranged for me today
will be the last one

930
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,380
You can stop arranging meetings for me

931
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,460
Yes, I'm sure

932
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,580
Thanks. Goodbye

933
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,220
(Mom)

934
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,580
Yes, Mom? Why haven't you gone to bed yet?

935
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,900
I'm going to bed soon

936
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,220
I just remembered that you left
your windbreaker here last year

937
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,820
I was thinking
if you needed me to send it over

938
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,520
Don't worry about it
Beijing isn't as cold as it is back home

939
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,420
Besides, I have thick clothing here

940
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,980
What's wrong? You sound sick

941
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,860
- I'm working overtime
- What?

942
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,020
You're still working?

943
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,020
It's nothing. I'll be done soon

944
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:58,700
Alright, then. I'll leave you to it

945
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:02,500
Quickly get your work done and go home

946
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:07,100
By the way, make sure you call
a regular taxi to get home later

947
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,940
Don't try to save on money and carpool

948
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,260
- Make sure you don't. Do you hear me?
- Yes, Mom

949
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,180
I can't talk now. You're slowing me down

950
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,460
Go to bed early. I'm hanging up. Bye

951
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,640
(Money for taxi)
For goodness' sake

952
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,700
Mr. Jian

953
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,180
I was at the movies
with my boyfriend just now

954
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,020
So I thought of coming over
as I was passing by

955
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,700
What are you two doing here?

956
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,860
- Mr. Jian, you're here
- Hi, Mr. Jian

957
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,980
What are all of you doing here?

958
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,580
Well, I was just passing by

959
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,260
- What about you guys?
- Me too

960
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,979
Not me, though

961
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,180
I purposely came to help

962
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,800
Don't just stand there
Do you really plan on staying until morning?

963
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,220
- Let's get to work
- Let me tell you

964
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,420
The sales department has to work harder

965
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,899
- Look at how much Xiao Chen has done
- Divide these

966
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,540
- There's not much left to do
- Here you go

967
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:05,740
When a two-hour journey to work
feels like a nightmare

968
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:14,080
When working overtime endlessly
has taken up all the spaces in life

969
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,060
When you've given all you can, yet fail
to become a better version of yourself

970
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,180
Perhaps we can find many reasons to leave

971
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,819
But only one reason is enough to make us stay

972
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:35,380
A group of like-minded companions

973
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,180
A sweet and beautiful love

974
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,140
It could also be a night to yourself

975
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:54,360
It is these ordinary yet beautiful things
that help us get through the stormy weather

976
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,760
And allow us to see a more beautiful sight

977
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,780
- Thank you, sir
- Thank you

978
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,460
- Good job, everyone
- Good job

979
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:06,940
I'll treat all of you to supper next time
Bye bye!

980
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,700
- Bye, Mr. Jian
- Bye

981
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,340
- Thank you
- Be careful

982
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,020
Bye

983
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,460
Sir

984
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,740
- My phone
- Right. It's you. Give me a minute

985
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,540
I've tried my best. You can check and see

986
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,220
I can turn it on. Thank you, sir

987
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:50,740
