00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,400
To woman

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,440

Intoales

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,780
A hand that can reach out?

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,780
Or...

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,780
I'm sorry for being honest

9
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,780
I'm sure it's fine

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,780
I'll stop crying, so please stay with me

11
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Good morning

12
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,780
Wake me up

13
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,780
I did, but I'm not going to get up

14
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,780
Wake me up until you do

15
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,780
I told you I had a meeting at the site today

16
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,780
Oh, sorry

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,780
Again?

18
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
What?

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Oh, you said you liked me before

20
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
I'm making up

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
What?

22
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,780
But I have to go

23
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,780
I'll give it to you at the office later

24
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,780
I don't want to be caught

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Hey, Kyou

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,780
I knew it, let's go

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Where's breakfast?

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
No time

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,780
Take care

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
I'm sorry

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Is it okay?

32
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Fixing Mitsumori's book and schedule

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
OK

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
God

35
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
It's a celebration of achieving sales goals

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,780
I'm lonely without you two

37
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I love you

38
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,780
Thank you

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,780
God, I have one more request

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,780
What?

41
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,780
I have a new support set

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,780
What?

43
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,780
No, it's not a celebration

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
People...

45
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
That's right, it's a motivation

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
I'm working with God to find a motivation

47
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
I think it's good

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
If you can get results

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Director

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,780
If you have time to chat

51
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,780
The next presentation will be over

52
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
That's a critical commercial

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm going to give it to you now

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,780
I'll be right there

55
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
Sugahara

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
Yes

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Fix the marketer's documents

58
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,780
I'll ask you until next week

59
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Yes

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Oh, right

61
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,780
This is particularly difficult

62
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,780
I don't know

63
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
I don't know

64
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
I don't know

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,780
I don't know

66
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,780
I don't know

67
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,780
I don't know

68
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,780
If you don't understand, please ask

69
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Ah, yes

70
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,780
I'll do my best

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
It's small

72
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,780
Director is busy

73
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,780
I just saw the color of respect

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,780
Usually he's afraid

75
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,780
The other person is the best

76
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
What? You don't know?

77
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,780
I recorded the highest sales of my company.

78
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,780
And I kept updating the records.

79
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
And I was promoted to the president with the highest salary.

80
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,780
I never got that job.

81
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,780
If I want to make a mistake,

82
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,780
I'll sink right into the Tokyo Bay.

83
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,780
That cold-hearted guy.

84
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
And...

85
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,780
I don't have the time to make excuses.

86
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,780
That guy.

87
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,780
He's just...

88
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Kokudo.

89
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Kokudo, the boss.

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
That's what we call him.

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,780
I don't think that's enough.

92
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,780
I'm back.

93
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
Good work.

94
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Iroha.

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,780
Please organize the oriental sheet and the teaching sheet.

96
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,780
And the data for the joint.

97
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Teaching sheet?

98
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,780
I'm busy with the newbie.

99
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,780
I'm in charge of education.

100
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,780
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,780
I made you work so hard.

102
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
Never mind.

103
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
Never mind.

104
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,780
Sugawara will be here soon.

105
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Please.

106
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
I understand.

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
This is a special occasion.

108
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,780
See you.

109
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Sorry.

110
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
If it weren't for Makoto,

111
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
I wonder what would've happened.

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,780
Wait.

113
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
I think we're too fast.

114
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Isn't that light close?

115
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
It's a candle.

116
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,780
I've been thinking about it.

117
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
It's suspicious.

118
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Look at the light.

119
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
It's a light.

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Let's light it up.

121
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,780
It's a good idea.

122
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
I want a girlfriend.

123
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
I want to get married.

124
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
We're 29 years old.

125
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Right, Sugawara?

126
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
I need to use the bathroom.

127
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,780
What if someone sees us?

129
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
I'm fine.

130
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,780
You're always so stubborn.

131
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,780
I like you.

132
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
What?

133
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Wait.

134
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
What's wrong?

135
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
Nothing.

136
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
I drank too much.

138
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
Yuto.

139
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
What?

140
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Where were you?

141
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,780
A check?

142
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
Was it in the instant?

143
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,780
No, it wasn't.

144
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Come here.

145
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Okay.

146
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Makoto.

147
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
Makoto.

148
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,780
I was so worried.

149
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I thought you were drunk.

150
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Did you find out about us?

151
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
I didn't.

152
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,780
I don't have to hide it anymore.

153
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,780
I was proposed to.

154
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,780
I was supposed to have a girlfriend.

155
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
But I got a girlfriend.

156
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,780
I heard you were proposed.

157
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
You heard it, right?

158
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Propose?

159
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,780
That watch?

160
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
You bought it recently?

161
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,780
You're amazing.

162
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
It's nice.

163
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,780
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
Chief.

166
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Are you okay?

167
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Yes.

168
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,780
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm fine.

170
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Are you okay?

172
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,780
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,780
It's nothing.

175
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Chief, are you coming home now?

176
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
I'll take a taxi.

177
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,780
You can't go home like this.

178
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,780
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,780
It's not something to tell your boss.

180
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
No.

181
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
No.

183
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
But...

184
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm glad you're here.

185
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,780
If I were alone,

186
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,780
I would have fallen down and gone home.

187
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,780
I would have been so miserable that I couldn't even look at it.

188
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
I'm going out with you.

190
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,780
What?

191
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Whether it's a guchi or sake,

192
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,780
until I feel like I'm alive.

193
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
Are you okay?

195
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
I'm fine.

196
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,780
I feel good enough.

197
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
I'll go around here today.

198
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,780
Ouch.

200
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Ouch.

201
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,780
Hi.

202
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,780
You're awake.

203
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
You drank too much.

204
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,780
Are you okay?

205
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm sure the next presentation is ready.

206
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
Chief!

207
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Are you still sleeping?

208
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
What? Why?

209
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Sugawara.

211
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,780
No.

212
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Are you okay?

213
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,780
What?

214
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,780
I'm so sorry.

215
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Calm down.

216
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
I'll bring you clothes.

218
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Change and talk in the living room.

219
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
What should I do?

220
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
What should I do?

221
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Hello?

222
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Where are you?

223
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,780
You're drinking all of a sudden.

224
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,780
You can't just ignore me.

225
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
You made me change the drink.

226
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,780
You made me care for my brother.

227
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,780
Aren't you ashamed of your age?

228
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
I saw it.

229
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,780
Kawatani and...

230
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
...kissed.

231
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,780
So?

232
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,780
It's okay.

233
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Let's break up.

234
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,780
What?

235
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,780
I want to be happy with you.

236
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Wait.

237
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,780
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,780
Are you feeling better?

239
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,780
Well...

240
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
This trip was really...

241
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
Sugawara.

242
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I didn't expect to have a relationship with a direct boss.

243
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,780
I've never made a mistake in a night.

244
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
Kawatani.

245
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
Yes?

246
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,780
I know you're mistaken.

247
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,780
But yesterday...

248
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,780
I made you sleep here.

249
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
What?

250
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Nothing happened.

251
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,780
But...

252
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,780
You don't remember spilling the alcohol.

253
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,780
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
No.

255
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,780
I'm really sorry...

256
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,780
...for making you change clothes.

257
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,780
I tried to keep you from seeing it.

258
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,780
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,780
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
By the way...

262
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
I said I couldn't go home.

263
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,780
Will you live with me?

264
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,780
We have a room for people to stay.

265
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,780
If you don't have a place to go.

266
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
No, no, no.

267
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
It's okay.

268
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,780
I won't cause any more trouble.

269
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
It's not a trouble.

270
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
No.

271
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,780
But since you know the situation...

272
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,780
...you can't do anything as a boss.

273
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,780
If you have someone else to rely on...

274
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,780
...that's fine.

275
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,780
I can't leave you like this.

276
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Boss...

277
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,780
I'm not sure if I should say this...

278
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
...but I've been thinking...

279
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,780
...can I take care of you?

280
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Of course.

281
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Oh, that's the second one.

282
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,780
I heard the Fudo Club is having a hard time.

283
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,780
They've been quiet for the past few years.

284
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,780
They said they started moving again.

285
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,780
I'll check the information in the book.

286
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,780
There are some people who left the prison.

287
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I understand.

288
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,780
The Fudo Club.

289
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,780
The Fudo Club.

290
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Is it really okay?

291
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
The kitchen.

292
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,780
I'll have to move.

293
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Let me do this.

294
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,780
I'm going to be looking forward to dinner.

295
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,780
No matter how deep the sea is...

296
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,780
...there is light.

297
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,780
I might have found...

298
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,780
...that light.

299
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,780
To be continued...

300
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,780
Please look forward to the original.
