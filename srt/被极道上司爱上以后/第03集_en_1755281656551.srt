1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The information that the head of the club has moved.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Where's the young boss?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Not yet.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Maybe...

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
he knows who he is.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well...

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I knew it, but I can't say it that easily.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's definitely black.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That clerk...

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,040
Maybe it's information to make the police

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,040
get involved.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Maybe he doesn't have a young boss.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,040
I hope it's not a dream.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,040
The closer happiness comes,

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,080
the more cowardly you become.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I know that it's something

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,080
that's not like a dream.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,080
I wish I had the power to believe

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,120
that I can do it.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,120
What's wrong? You're sighing.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Good morning.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Thank you for the food.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,120
I failed at the fried egg.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,120
I could have done better if I had a frying pan.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
A frying pan?

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I didn't mean to stay all day.

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,160
No, I'm sorry I didn't notice.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm sure there's something else you need.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's go shopping together.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Yes.

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Chief, you're not wearing glasses.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm wearing contacts when I go out.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
You should have worn glasses.

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,280
No, I like both of you.

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Can I ask you one thing?

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Yes.

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Are you going to quit?

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,280
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Then...

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Mr. Otagiri...

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I'd rather quit.

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes.

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,360
I bought everything I wanted.

63
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
That's good.

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I'll tell you later.

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
It's a secret.

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I'll contact you later.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Please go shopping.

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Yes.

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I think the police found out.

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
I'll do something that's not like you.

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
I know.

76
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Huh? Makoto-senpai?

77
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I knew it!

78
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Senpai, are you shopping too?

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I started going out with my boyfriend,

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,320
but I had to prepare a lot.

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Actually, there's a lot of things that are different from the old one.

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,320
He was the type that was dependent on men.

83
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
He said he'd be fine as he was, but he'd change everything.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Look.

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I'm still talking to him.

86
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm not buying a new bed yet.

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,320
So I'm just going to use it as it is.

88
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Senpai.

89
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Chidawara.

90
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Otagiri-san.

91
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm sorry I left you alone.

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Good work, Chief.

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Chief is...

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
He's fashionable in his uniform.

96
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Why are you with Senpai?

97
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I happened to run into him.

98
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
He's shopping with me.

99
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I see.

100
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Then I'd like to go with you too.

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I can be of more help than Senpai.

102
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Kawata just joined this year.

103
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,320
He's been blinded by the fact that he can't work.

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
But as a social person,

105
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
or as a single person,

106
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,320
it's better to correct your behavior.

107
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,320
You should correct your behavior.

108
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,320
You have a good book near you.

109
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Why don't you learn from Sugawara?

110
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Let's go buy a new one.

111
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
I don't want to use this anymore.

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Um...

114
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Is everything okay?

115
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
You're a little...

116
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
immature.

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
No, I'm not.

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,320
I don't think you've misunderstood me.

119
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
I think it's fine.

120
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,320
I think it's fine to be misunderstood.

121
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,320
He's the type of person who's more than a man.

123
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm a forgetful person.

124
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I'll talk to him.

125
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm in a taxi.

127
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Let's go home.

128
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Thank you for your hard work.

130
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I didn't meet your requirements.

132
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
It's okay.

133
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm the one who's been bothering you.

134
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Hello?

135
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Really?

136
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
I'd like to see you.

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Makoto!

139
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm not going to eat.

140
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I'll talk to you if you want.

141
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
You're in trouble because you don't have a place to live.

142
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Or are you going to run into the chief's house?

143
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Senpai.

144
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,320
You're being thrown away by Yuto and you're going to switch to the chief right away.

145
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,320
You're too impatient to be a robber.

146
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
It's not like that.

147
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
But the chief and senpai...

148
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm not dating anyone.

149
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Here.

150
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
I'll give Yuto back to Senpai.

151
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,320
In exchange, please give me the chief of Oda-giri.

152
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Wait.

153
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
You like Yuto, don't you?

154
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
I don't know.

155
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,320
When I dated him, he was less respected than I thought.

156
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I thought I'd meet the chief.

157
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Certainly.

158
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
The chief is so precious to me.

159
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
But I can't do that.

161
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
What?

162
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Because it's...

163
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Because it's not up to you or me.

172
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
It's up to you, Oda-giri.

173
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
The female genitals are so...

174
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
But...

175
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Thanks to you, I...

176
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
What are you doing?

177
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Oda-giri.

178
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Chief Oda-giri.

179
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
I was just talking about the chief.

180
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Actually, I've always liked him.

181
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Makoto Senpai said he'd support me if I were the chief.

182
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
So...

183
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I only believe in what Sugawara said.

184
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,320
The most important thing to me is Sugawara.

186
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,320
The most important thing to me is Sugawara.

187
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Um...

188
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
What if I said that?

189
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Why did you avoid me recently?

190
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
What?

191
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,320
You avoided me at home and at work, right?

192
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I was looking for a house.

193
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Even though you have a house?

194
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I can't afford to live here anymore.

195
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

196
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,320
If things continue like this, I'll be spoiled forever.

197
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm scared.

198
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
You should be spoiled forever.

199
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm not in a position to be spoiled by you.

200
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
What do you mean?

201
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
The day I opened the house,

202
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I saw a stolen item.

203
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Oda-giri.

204
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
You're dating someone, aren't you?

205
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
No.

206
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:54,320
That's not something that a man who's known for a long time would care about.

207
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I'm not.

208
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,320
And I'm the one who suggested the same thing.

209
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I can't leave Sugawara.

210
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,320
As a man, not as a boss,

211
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
I care about Sugawara.

212
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
We'll start living together.

213
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
From before.

214
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Forever.

215
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
What?

216
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,320
If there's someone special to me,

217
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
it's Sugawara.

218
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
I want you to be by my side.

219
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Me too.

220
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I want to be with you forever.

221
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Sugawara.

222
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Sugawara.

223
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Will you take this?

224
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Is that okay?

225
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Of course.

226
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Thank you.

227
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Let's go home.

228
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Yes.

229
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
I'm sorry.

230
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
You're late.

231
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Where were you?

232
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Hey, what's Makoto doing?

233
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
He's probably in trouble.

234
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
You should worry about Makoto.

235
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
What's that?

236
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Stop it.

237
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,320
We can't fight him.

238
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
What do you mean?

239
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
He's connected to Yakuza.

240
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Yakuza?

241
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Makoto's been in there for a long time.

242
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
He's been threatened.

243
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,320
You're going to be in trouble too.

244
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
I'm scared.

245
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
I told you about the shop.

246
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
I'll be careful.

247
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
The place?

248
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Around here.

249
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
This is the shop.

250
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Makoto's been in there for a long time.

251
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
He's been in there for a long time.

252
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
He's been in there for a long time.

253
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
He's been in there for a long time.

254
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
He's been in there for a long time.

255
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
He's been in there for a long time.

256
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
He's been in there for a long time.

257
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
He's been in there for a long time.

258
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
He's been in there for a long time.

259
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
He's been in there for a long time.

260
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
He's been in there for a long time.

261
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
He's been in there for a long time.

262
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
He's been in there for a long time.

263
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
He's been in there for a long time.

264
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Are you pretty?

265
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
He's been there.

266
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
He's been in there for a long time.

267
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
He's been in there for a long time.

268
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Tak diyeyou...

269
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
A knock-out of the schoolируo

270
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Mr. Director Mino

271
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,120
Presidentam

272
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Principal

273
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,320
Hey.

274
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Yes.

275
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Don't mind me being quiet

276
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,320
When I'm asleep, I'll wrap myself up in a mess

277
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm going to report on the Asaba Alliance, which has been doing strange things lately.

278
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Asaba Alliance?

279
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Isn't it the hangrae group of Sagi Nagami?

280
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
That's right, but...

281
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,320
One of them said something bad about Kaneko.

282
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,320
Well, I don't think I'll be doing anything about it.

283
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,320
I've come to avoid getting involved with the members of the group.

284
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
I understand.

285
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Leave this to me.

286
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,320
The closer happiness comes, the more I become afraid.

287
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Because I know it's as fleeting as a dream.

288
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
I'm sorry.

289
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
It's over.

290
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I want the power to believe in the light that I insert.

291
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I want the power to believe in the light that I insert.

292
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Makoto-senpai, do you know that the real Makoto is Gokudo?

293
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Makoto?

294
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
I believe in it.

295
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I like Makoto.

296
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I can't stand it anymore.

297
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
The original manga is called, The Love of the Gokudo Master.

298
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,320
It's a very popular comic book.

299
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Please enjoy the original manga.
