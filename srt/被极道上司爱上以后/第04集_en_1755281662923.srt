00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
KAMEN RIDER

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,000
There's no night that never ends.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,880
I thought it was a beautiful thing.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,980
Will you accept this?

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
But...

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to believe that beautiful thing.

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,340
You promised not to call me.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,340
You shouldn't have come so suddenly.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,840
It's the same as always.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
You shouldn't do something that's useless.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
What?

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
What?

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
That's what you mean?

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Is that what you mean?

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,840
That's what I meant.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
You should go home.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,840
I see.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm Haruka Kiba, Ren's childhood friend.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm Makoto Sugawara.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,840
Sorry for the sudden visit.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Please introduce me again.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Sorry.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Please let me do that.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
I forget about the guests.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Good night.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Sugawara, see you.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm sorry for the time.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I was going to introduce you properly.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Yes.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,840
I want to talk to you slowly.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Are you going to sleep?

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,840
I don't care.

36
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Then let's go to the bedroom.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Good night.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
See you tomorrow.

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
The End

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Makoto-san, did you find anything?

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,840
No, nothing.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
If it's a love problem, I'll ask you.

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
What's that?

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell Matsumoto-kun.

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
What?

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
You should have told me earlier.

77
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Makoto.

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Yes.

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,840
There are too many cases of this kind.

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
I can't suggest anything.

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
What?

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,840
With this system, the vanguard doesn't trust us.

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I'll ask them right away.

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Will you support Matsumoto?

86
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,840
The reason you noticed here is because you put it on the wall just in case.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Yes, I understand.

88
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I'll come back early today.

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
I have something to tell you.

90
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Just the two of us.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
If you have something to say,

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
go and be my friend.

93
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Are you sure you want to be my friend?

94
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
I said be my friend.

95
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Do you know

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,840
that Chief Odagiri is the real Gokudo?

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Chief Odagiri is the real Gokudo?

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes?

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,840
You're being so hasty.

100
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Or are you in a hurry?

101
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Ta-da!

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,840
I can't believe my boss was a Yakuza.

103
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
I'm scared I can't work under him.

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Makoto-senpai,

105
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
even if you know that I'm the real Gokudo boss,

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
will you understand?

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Is this a threat?

108
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
No!

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
This is a sincere request from my subordinate.

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Chief Odagiri,

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,840
please stop working.

112
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,840
I understand your request.

113
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
But I need some time.

114
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Time?

115
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,840
I want a week of internal investigation.

116
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I'm bored of being so calm.

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Please let me finish this quickly.

118
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Otherwise,

119
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,840
I wonder what Makoto-senpai will think of me.

120
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Makoto-senpai,

121
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,840
you're a bad guy.

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
What?

123
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Sorry.

124
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Welcome back.

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
I made you dinner.

127
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,840
I won't be back for a while.

128
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
What's wrong?

129
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Did something happen?

130
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I can't tell you now.

131
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
But I'll explain it to you someday.

132
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,840
So,

133
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
please wait.

134
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I understand.

135
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
It's okay.

136
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I believe in you.

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Thank you.

138
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
I see.

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,840
You're brave enough to threaten me.

140
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
I want to get away from Sugawara

141
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,840
and turn my attention to you.

142
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Ren,

143
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
you've changed.

144
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,840
The Odagiri I know,

145
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
you're rational, cold-hearted,

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,840
and you're good at business.

147
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm glad you're happy.

148
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
You're rational, cold-hearted,

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,840
and you're good at business.

150
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I see.

151
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I'll see what I can do.

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I have to do something about this.

153
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Hey,

154
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,840
do you have any photos of your opponent?

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm Aina Kawata from the same club.

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
This girl?

157
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I was a little lost.

159
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Did something happen?

160
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
No, it's nothing.

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Thank you.

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
I want to protect

163
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Sugawara

164
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
and only her.

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Are you ready?

166
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Let's start the meeting.

167
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes.

168
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Kawatari,

169
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
can you get the time for the meeting ready by tomorrow?

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Hey, answer.

171
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Yes.

172
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Will you take it?

174
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
The next day

175
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Thank you.

176
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
It's all thanks to you.

177
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Are you really going to quit?

178
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
What?

179
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Did you say something?

180
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
It's nothing.

181
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Kawatari,

182
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I have something important to tell you.

183
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
What?

184
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Just the two of you?

185
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,840
I thought you forgot

186
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
the promise you made.

187
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
The manager is not as usual,

188
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,840
but I thought you were too desperate to be honest.

189
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
If you don't do anything, you'll be fired.

190
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
What?

191
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,840
You'll be in full investigation.

192
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
The company will ask you for a hearing.

193
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Wait.

194
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
What's going on?

195
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,840
You can't just fire me.

196
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
You're right.

197
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
That's right.

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,840
As long as there's no reason to fire me.

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,840
This is the reason.

200
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,840
This is the evidence of the information you posted on social media.

201
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,840
You used your account to post information and photos of your company's expenses repeatedly.

202
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
In addition,

203
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,840
you've also confirmed many other employees' death threats.

204
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
No.

205
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
This is strange.

206
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
It's not me.

207
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,840
From now on, you'll be contacted by the company.

208
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
You'll be waiting at home until then.

209
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Wait a minute.

210
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,840
You won't admit this?

211
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
It's not over yet!

212
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
What?

213
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
You were attacked by a red glasses?

214
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
By me?

215
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,840
You're giving yourself a reward?

216
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
This is the earring I was looking for.

217
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,840
This project is made for you.

218
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
No!

219
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I was fooled by the director.

220
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,840
The director is useless.

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,840
I knew who he was.

222
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
I'm going to be erased.

223
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Don't be fooled by everyone!

224
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
I have evidence!

225
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Are you serious?

226
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,840
You can't do that.

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Why don't you believe me?

228
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm not guilty.

229
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
You're a useless man with no technique.

230
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I didn't mean to steal it.

231
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
I want to throw it away.

232
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Is this your true self?

233
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,840
The picture of the earring is also a fake.

234
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
No.

235
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
This is real.

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
You're a fuxxing fuxxing bitch.

237
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,840
You only think of yourself as a tool by looking down on others.

238
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,840
You're breaking the law.

239
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Kawatani.

240
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Pack your things and go home.

241
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Right now.

242
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Go back to your business.

243
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm home.

244
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,840
It's all over.

245
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Sugawara.

246
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm going to be a good son to you.

247
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Will you stay with me from now on?

253
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm sorry I turned you around.

254
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
It's okay.

255
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,840
It's not right now.

256
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Please tell me...

257
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,840
...about Nagiri.

258
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,840
No matter what happens...

259
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,840
...I love you.

260
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Welcome home.

261
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I don't think...

262
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,840
...it's possible for me to live without you.

263
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,840
I don't think I can stand it tonight.

279
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I've always wanted to touch you like this.

280
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm sorry.

293
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
I'm sorry.

298
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I was just a little worried.

299
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,840
I wonder if we're dating.

300
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
I like you.

301
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I've always been more than I thought.

302
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Yes.

303
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I'm relieved.

304
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Yes.

305
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm happy.

306
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I like you.

307
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Makoto.

308
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,840
I love you too.

309
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
I'm saved this time.

310
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,840
I've been able to collect that much evidence.

311
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,840
It seems that she was very resentful.

312
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
She was self-pitying.

313
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Haruka.

314
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Thank you very much.

315
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,840
However, you can't avoid the fact that you're in the house.

316
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Yes.

317
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm going to tell you everything soon.

318
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
I'm sorry.

319
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Makoto?

320
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Did something happen?

321
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
No.

322
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Nothing.

323
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
I'm sorry.

324
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Hello.

325
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Makoto?

326
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I finally got out.

327
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I'm sorry.

328
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Mom is next to Makoto.

329
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
When I was a kid.

330
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm called Tora.

331
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm here.

332
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
If you're close to him.

333
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I don't want to be taken away by him.

334
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Please help me.
