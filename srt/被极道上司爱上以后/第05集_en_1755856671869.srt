1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
You can't avoid the sword from Ren's house, can you?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,800
I'm going to tell him everything.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Hello?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
Makoto?

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Makoto?

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Is something wrong?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,200
I was just thinking.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
It's true.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
It's true.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm glad.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Tomorrow night,

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
would you like to go out for dinner?

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I'd like to talk to you.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Well...

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
A date.

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
What?

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Yeah.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
I'd like to go.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
It's okay.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
It's okay.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Even if it's not okay,

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
if you keep doing it,

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
it will come true one day.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,200
He disappeared so quickly.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
He's gone.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
He's not in touch with anyone.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
I see.

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Mr. Ishizaki has also been transferred.

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
That's hard to say.

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
But it's for the sake of the carry-up.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
You said it once.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,200
But I've looked at the director again.

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
What?

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
It's not like anyone can settle in Tokyo.

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
There is a divine power in the hellishly evil.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
You're particular about that setting.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Only Mr. Makoto is not accepting it.

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
The End

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Mom.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I missed you, Mr. Makoto.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
The End

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Why are you here?

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I'm always here for you.

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm always here for you.

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I told you to let me go.

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Did I?

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I paid you.

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
So...

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I...

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
You know...

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm really worried about you.

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
You're the only one I have.

81
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
So please...

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
help me again.

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Please?

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
What will happen to me if I stay like this?

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Give me your wallet.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
No.

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Give it to me.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
You're so annoying.

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
You're wearing a good watch.

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Give it to me.

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Is it a fight?

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Nothing.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
She's just being nice.

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Right?

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I didn't see anything.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I have to go.

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I won't let you go.

98
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
See you, Makoto.

99
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Bye.

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
The End

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Thank you.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Makoto?

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Dora-O-kun?

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Are you okay?

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
What do you think?

107
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Do you remember?

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I think I'm a second grade.

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
If you're a second grade,

110
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,200
you're like a normal person.

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
What?

112
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm a second grade.

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm a second grade.

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
What?

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
See?

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
You're a second grade.

117
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
No matter how bad you are,

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
or how sick you are,

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm totally fine.

120
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Oh, no.

121
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm going to get a bone.

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I won.

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm here.

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm here.

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
If you're not okay,

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
call me as soon as possible.

127
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
If Makoto calls,

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'll be there.

129
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,200
You're so kind, Dora-kun.

130
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
It's nothing.

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
You're a police officer.

132
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Is your job hard?

133
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Well,

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,200
there are some things that are a little troublesome.

135
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Excuse me.

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm sorry about the job.

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
What happened?

139
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,200
The police found Ren's presence.

140
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
We'll find out how much information has leaked.

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Kaneko from Asaba Alliance

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
has been moving around lately.

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
They found out about it.

144
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Anyway,

145
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
just imagine the worst.

146
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Well,

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I can't run away.

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm a pretty stubborn person.

149
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,200
You're cool.

150
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
What about Makoto?

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
You told me when you contacted me before.

152
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
You might get married soon.

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I broke up with him.

154
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
What?

155
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
It's a common story, but

156
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I was cheated on.

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
What? When?

158
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll take care of it from now on.

159
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
No, it's okay.

160
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I don't care anymore.

161
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Okay,

162
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,200
let's go for a drink to celebrate breaking up with a loser.

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Thank you.

164
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
But I'm sorry.

165
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Actually,

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
we're going on a date.

167
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
What?

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
So,

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I see.

170
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Good girls are always around.

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Is the guy next to you okay?

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Yeah, he's good.

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
No, he's good.

175
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
He's good.

176
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I have to go now.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Sorry, I stopped you.

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
No problem.

179
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
See you.

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Makoto.

181
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
What?

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Can I talk to you?

183
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
I talked to my mom.

184
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
I know

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
she doesn't want to tell him.

186
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
But if she can trust him,

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
she can help him.

188
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
If I talk to him,

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,200
everything will be broken.

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
And

191
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I have to

192
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,200
do something.

193
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
You're a childhood friend?

194
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Yes.

195
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
We were friends since middle school.

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
We went to the same high school.

197
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
His name is Tora.

198
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
We met by chance.

199
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
We met after 9 years.

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
A guy?

201
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I wanted to talk to you today.

203
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
No,

204
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
let's talk after dinner.

205
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Are you in trouble?

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I promised.

207
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Wait.

208
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Makoto.

209
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
I found you.

210
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Why?

211
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Excuse me.

212
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Who are you?

213
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm his mother.

214
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm Oda Giri,

215
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
who is dating Makoto.

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'll ask Oda Giri.

217
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Please go home.

218
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
It's okay.

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
It's delicious.

220
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I'll do it again.

222
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
You just got here.

223
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I can't talk to you anymore.

224
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm in trouble.

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Don't touch me.

226
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
See you.

227
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
What are you looking at?

228
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Damn it.

229
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Are you okay?

230
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm really sorry.

232
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Makoto.

233
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
When did you come?

234
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
No matter where you are,

236
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
your mother is by your side.

237
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Your mother only has you.

238
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Mom.

239
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Mom.

240
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Mom.

241
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Let go.

242
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
You don't need your mother.

243
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
You don't like her.

244
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
So you can stay at home with your father.

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I don't want to do it anymore.

247
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
It's okay.

248
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I'll leave you.

249
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I'll do something for the money.

250
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Please.

251
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
What?

252
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
You're on the whiteboard.

253
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Your mother only has you.

255
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,200
You have to do something for yourself.

256
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I've been running away from my mother.

259
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,200
She was a very kind person.

260
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I tried to run away many times.

261
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
But I couldn't.

262
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,200
I don't want to be taken away by her.

263
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Only you.

264
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
So...

265
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Please help me.

266
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,200
You've been through a lot.

267
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,200
If you let go, everything will break.

269
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
No.

270
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Tora.

271
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Makoto.

272
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
What's wrong?

273
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
What's the matter?

274
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I was wondering what's wrong.

275
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Yesterday...

276
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Mr. Odagiri.

277
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,200
This is the person I talked to before.

278
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm dating you.

279
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Hello.

280
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
This is my childhood friend.

281
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Nice to meet you.

282
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Makoto.

284
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm going.

285
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
See you.

286
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Please check the mail.

288
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,200
I know who the young master is.

289
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I'll be back in a little while.

290
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
You seemed to get along well.

291
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Are you talking about Tora?

292
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I guess he was taking care of me.

293
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Tora, you've been...

294
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Tora, you've been...

295
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Nice childhood friend.

296
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm sorry.

304
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm sorry.

306
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm sorry.

307
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I'm sorry.

309
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Yes!

311
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
How was we?

312
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
How did we became a team?

313
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
It's up to you.

314
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Too mean.

315
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Too long.

316
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
It would beAPPLAUSE to this guy.
