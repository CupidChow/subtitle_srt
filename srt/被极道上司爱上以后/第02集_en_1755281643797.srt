1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Living with someone is like cooking.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Different people have different ways of thinking.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You don't know what will happen until you open the lid.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's delicious.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Good morning.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you for the food.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All of them are delicious.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm so glad.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I have bento.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll have it if you like.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was so nervous.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Am I making you so scared?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No, I mean...

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I mean, I'm getting nervous.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And I'm not sure if it's because of the director.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was totally unconscious.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, no.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Not at all.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't mean it like that.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Shido is strict.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think he has many subordinates who are dissatisfied.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But...

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sugawara is different.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's strict, but he's also very considerate.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I like his attitude.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm glad the department is doing well.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's all thanks to you.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm late.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll move.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You go ahead.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But...

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is it okay?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Of course.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then, please be kind to me.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Be careful.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll be back.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Can I ask you a favor?

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you for helping me.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Were you okay after that?

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I suddenly disappeared after the drinking party.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was worried.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The director was so angry that he ran after Sugawara.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I didn't know you were running.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll tell my boss.

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But you're like a brother.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're like a friend.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, you're going to see the director?

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Matsumoto.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What about the Mitsumori students you asked for last weekend?

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sugawara.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're taking luggage to the person's house.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What?

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you serious?

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm okay with you throwing away the rest.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you still angry?

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's just a joke.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No one believes in proposals.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Anyway,

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
we're already separated.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Look at reality.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Who will face that woman who is so angry with her mother?

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There's no one else I can rely on.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Director, did you wake him up?

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, not at all.

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Um, I...

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't know if it suits you.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you.

85
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's delicious.

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's really warm.

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If it's about looking for a house, you don't have to rush.

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, but...

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is there anything I can do to help?

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's too much for a director.

92
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
As a subordinate, I can't be spoiled anymore.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I understand.

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't get confused.

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Good night.

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Genji's Miro.

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Genji's Miro

100
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What?

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What? What?

102
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's wrong with me?

103
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't move too much. You'll fall.

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, no, no. Please put me down.

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's heavy.

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's not heavy.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, but...

108
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's why I told you not to get confused.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Genji's Miro

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Good night.

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Good night.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Good night.

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Good morning.

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Good morning.

115
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, next time...

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please.

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There's a visitor coming over the next Sunday.

118
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'd like you to open the house.

119
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I'm sorry.

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Can you put all of Sugawara's personal belongings in the guest room?

122
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All of them?

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I understand.

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll take care of it by tomorrow.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you.

127
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, what about Sugawara?

128
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, well...

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was wondering what to eat for lunch.

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll go get some food.

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't care about anything.

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If it's information about the club...

133
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I see.

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I heard that the club leader is changing generations.

135
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Change of generations?

136
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
With who?

137
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, that's...

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't even know who Atome is.

139
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know who he is.

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I just came home.

141
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry I made you feel like you were being chased out.

142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, not at all.

143
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Um, what is this?

144
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a gift for the guests.

145
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh.

146
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll make dinner right away.

147
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Why are you ignoring me?

148
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's a big trouble.

149
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So, I'm not with Kawatani. I'm...

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I won't talk to you anymore.

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait.

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I have to get back to work.

153
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mishizaki, I got a call from Sasaki-sama of Ibuki Seiyaku.

154
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's not the point.

155
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You'll know if you see it.

156
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What are you talking about?

157
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hey, calm down.

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What?

159
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're the one who...

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If you're fighting, let's have it done elsewhere.

161
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, I'm just...

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No matter what the situation is,

163
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
you can't just talk to me at work and ignore my calls.

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you're in such a terrible situation,

168
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
why don't you talk to me sooner?

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No matter what the situation is,

171
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
you can't just talk to me at work and ignore my calls.

172
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Sugawara.

173
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
From now on,

174
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I won't let you hurt the chief.

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The next day

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Where are you?

177
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry about earlier.

178
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just one more time.

179
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want you to talk to me properly.

180
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Please.

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The next day

183
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank you.

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If it had ended like that,

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I wouldn't have been able to apologize to Makoto.

186
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll change.

187
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll be with Kawatari.

188
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll think about Makoto more.

189
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can't help you.

191
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But if you can go back to being just a colleague,

192
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll pour all the water.

193
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why?

194
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm so sorry.

195
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Why won't you forgive me?

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yuuki.

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I know.

198
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You want to come back to Makoto, don't you?

199
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll forgive you if you do it at home.

200
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's go home together.

201
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wait.

202
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Stop it.

203
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You guys.

205
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You should listen to me.

206
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey, let's go to Makoto.

207
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Help me.

208
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Come here.

209
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's stop here.

210
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What are you doing?

211
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let go of me.

212
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hey.

213
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let go of me.

214
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You bastard.

215
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What did you do to her?

216
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I...

217
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I didn't do anything.

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's change the way you ask.

219
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What did you do to my woman?

220
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I...

221
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I didn't do anything.

222
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I didn't do anything.

223
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I didn't do anything.

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I didn't do anything.

225
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What did you do to her?

226
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's not a big deal to erase you.

227
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't...

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't...

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't do anything to her.

230
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please.

231
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Please.

232
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Please.

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't forget that word.

234
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There's a young man in the club.

236
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He's unknown.

237
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No one knows his face or name.

238
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No one?

239
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Do something about your forgetfulness.

240
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I always cause trouble.

241
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Young master of the club.

242
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's get rid of him.

243
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Let's be together.

244
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Until the end of the world.

245
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What's up?

246
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Mr. Senseki,

247
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
what did the club leader say?

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Where's the young master?

249
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Not yet.

250
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Go to the scene.

251
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I might know who he is.

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The End

255
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Living with someone...

256
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is like cooking.

257
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You don't know what will happen.

258
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You don't know until you open your eyes.

259
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But...

260
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I shouldn't have been born.

265
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I wish I didn't know.

266
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The End

267
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Please look forward to the original.
