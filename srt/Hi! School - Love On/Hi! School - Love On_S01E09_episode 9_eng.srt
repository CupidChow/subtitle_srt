1
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,550
Why aren't you coming?

2
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,660
I can't.

3
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,730
I don't want to do it, things like separation.

4
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,470
What do you mean?

5
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,900
You made a vow.

6
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,640
Just go back to being an angel.

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,600
This is my real vow.

8
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,710
Even if I become unhappy,

10
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,590
or can't become an angel again,

11
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,580
I want to stay by Woohyun.

12
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if it means disappearing forever after living as a human?

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,980
Even if I disappear forever.

14
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,730
You... will... regret it.

15
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,560
Thank you for everything, Senior.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
I won't forget it.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,950
I'm...

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,880
going to forget you.

19
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,340
♫  One cold yet not cold  ♫

20
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,080
♫  beginning of fall  ♫

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,750
♫  It seems chilly,  ♫

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,660
♫  yet you wore short-sleeved clothing  ♫

23
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,520
Cry.

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,050
At least cry, you idiot.

25
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,680
Cry louder!

26
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,350
♫   Spring has come,  ♫

27
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,770
♫  and you're standing in front of me again  ♫

28
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,280
♫  Staring at me...  ♫

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,250
I'll stay by your side.

30
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,920
I won't go anywhere.

31
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,880
Cry whenever you want to cry.

32
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,430
♫  Your glance alone  ♫

33
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,580
♫  is too much for me,  ♫

34
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:44,210
♫  so I watch over you, like this  ♫

35
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,110
♫  After seasons passed,  ♫

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
♫  the sunlight is warm today  ♫

37
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,140
♫  Spring has come,  ♫

38
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,740
♫  and you're in front of me again,  ♫

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:27,380
♫  staring at me, then smiling at me  ♫

40
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,370
Don't go.

41
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,900
Please don't go.

42
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,410
Don't go.

43
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,620
♫  is too much for me,  ♫

44
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,920
♫  so it (my breathing) stops like this  ♫

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,190
Is it okay...

46
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,470
for me to stay next to you?

47
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,560
♫  She turns around,  ♫

48
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,510
♫  and I feel like I can't breathe  ♫

49
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,150
♫  Your movements alone  ♫

50
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,900
♫  are too much  ♫

51
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,400
Will I not be able to see you now, Senior?

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,710
If I knew it'd be like this, I would've said a better farewell earlier.

53
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,780
In the end, you and Grandmother left.

54
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,220
Goodbye.

55
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,810
Everyone take care.

56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,610

57
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,690

58
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,210
Gosh, this guy... really.

59
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,620
Temporary leave of absence?

60
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,760
Yes.

61
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,570
He's been saying that he wants to take a break due to health problems,

62
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,270
but he became worse all of a sudden and had no choice.

63
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,760
He's sorry that he couldn't see you before leaving.

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,430
Regardless, there are things called procedures.

65
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,070
You need to immediately find a temporary music teacher.

66
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,930
Yes.

67
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,630
You take over the homeroom position.

68
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,710
Yes.  What?

69
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,660
Ah, Second Year, Room 3's class... I should... Uh, yes.

70
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,880
Hey.

71
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,660
Where's Sungyeol?

72
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,810
Why isn't he coming?

73
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,930
You ask him yourself.

74
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,450
Your answers are short!

75
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,030
Did you eat something wrong?!

76
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,140
Even my heart aches this much.

77
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,270
It must be even more painful for my Woohyun.

78
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,390
Aren't you worried?

79
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,630
You need to worry about yourself.

80
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,710
Because I hate you the most right now!

81
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,740
Can't you see why everyone's like this?

82
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,080
Did everyone here take some drugs?!

83
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,590
Okay, I caught you!

84
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,690
Teacher, Teacher that's a new one. Change it with this one!

85
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,950
This one, too. Everyone, stop what you're doing!

86
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,450
It's not P.E. class.

87
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,430
Starting from today, I am your temporary homeroom teacher.

88
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,140
 Oh my god!  No way!

89
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,610
 No way!

90
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,900
Oh, such an enthusiastic response!

91
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,060
What about our homeroom teacher?

92
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,090
That's what I want to ask.

93
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,780
Hey, how much of a hard time did you give your teacher

94
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,130
that he--

95
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,970
Why are there empty seats?  That's Shin Woohyun and who else?

96
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,030
Lee Seulbi and Hwang Sungyeol.

97
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,620
Lee Seulbi sent an absence notice, but there's no word from Hwang Sungyeol yet.

98
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,750
All the close ones are absent together?

99
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,250
From now on, unexcused absences and tardiness are prohibited.

100
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,680
Disobedience is prohibited.

101
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,150
Sleeping is prohibited.

102
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,010
Chit-chatting is prohibiting.

103
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,350
And dating within the classroom is PROHIBITED!

104
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,710
Complaining is prohibited.

105
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,750
Not a resignation but a temporary leave of absence!

106
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,080
It's not like he's sick or anything. Does it make sense that he's taking a temporary leave of absence?

107
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,070
What kind of a teacher is this irresponsible?

108
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,120
Usually, people with lots of responsibility overreact in situations like this.

109
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,100
Can you give me some pain relievers?

110
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,000
Sure.

111
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,510
Teacher, is something giving you a headache?

112
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,780
You're asking for pain relievers often these days.

113
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,630
Teacher Kwangsik won't get fired, right? Right?

114
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,950
You're subtly worried about him.

115
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,230
No.

116
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,720
He has no skills, he's not brave, he's not good looking.

117
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,700
It'll be a big deal if he gets fired.

118
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,550
He's old, too. What would happen if he doesn't have a job either?

119
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,910
Who's going to take him?

120
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,050
You should have been nicer when he was here!

121
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,160
Either way, Shin Woohyun and Seulbi are mourning,

122
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,210
but why is Hwang Sungyeol absent without notice?

123
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,910
Sungyeol didn't come to school?

124
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,080
Sungyeol's been causing trouble these days.

125
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,800
He was the perfect son.

126
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,570
I should've done something as soon as he became friends with Shin Woohyun.

127
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,830
Just because he's friends with somebody, doesn't mean he'll become a problem child.

128
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,250
Woohyun isn't a bad kid, either.

129
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,760
It's weird how Teacher Ahn gets sensitive whenever there's something about Sungyeol.

130
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,910
Does she have some sort of relationship with Sungyeol?

131
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,900
Sungyeol and Woohyun are handsome.

132
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,750
When those two are together, they're like idols.

133
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,040
Achoo! I don't want to hear it! Achoo!

134
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,910
  The person you have dialed is unavailable.

135
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,310

136
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,610
 Mom's getting married.

137
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,690
He should order someone else to be his "Bread Shuttle."  Why is he telling us to do this? 
  (A bullied person who is ordered to retrieve snacks)

138
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,060
Do you think he caught on?

139
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,300
That's not possible.

140
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,070
I do feel bad for Shin Woohyun.

141
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,520
When my grandma passed away, I cried a lot.

142
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,900
He didn't cry.

143
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,720
You should have cried for him then.

144
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,210
Ah, we went to keep an eye on Chunsik,

145
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,650
in case he decided to confess.

146
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,180
Right. We're keeping a good eye on him.

147
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,920
You did well.

148
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,760
Did Woohyun cry or not?

149
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,830
 (He didn't cry. He didn't cry.)

150
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,060
- Hey, you do it. 
 - Huh?

151
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,420
Okay.

152
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,300
I'm going to tell everybody. That Seulbi's not a thief.

153
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,240
Chunsik, were you bored? You must have been really bored.

154
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,590
I was bored.

155
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,750
Look forward to it.

156
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,530
My hand hurts from writing all this.

157
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,720
Did Chunsik confess? Will we be okay?

158
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,500
As long as you shut your mouth, we'll be okay.

159
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,040
I warned you as to what would happen to a betrayer.

160
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,570
Be careful.

161
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:51,910

162
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,750
Why do you keep cleaning the area you have already cleaned?

163
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,490
I heard you would have fewer sad thoughts if your body is worn out.

164
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
Did you send Grandma off well?

165
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,660
Yeah.

166
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,960
How's Woohyun?

167
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,100
He keeps sleeping. Or he's acting like he is.

168
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,710
Sleep is another way of overcoming sadness.

169
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,140
I see.

170
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,340
You said you were leaving. When are you going back?

171
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,860
Actually, I'm not going to go.

172
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,890
I decided not to go.

173
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,670
That's good. Did you tell the adults?

174
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,750
I don't have any adults to contact.

175
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,810
  You're the same as me.

176
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,540
Why are you here now? Did you not go to school?

177
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,730
I didn't want to go.

178
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,620
You have stuff that you don't want to do, too?

179
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,900
In your eyes, do I seem like a monster?

180
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,450
I'm saying that because you're that perfect.

181
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,800
But is there something wrong?

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,510
I just didn't want to go to school today.

183
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,420
Really?

184
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,140
That's a relief. That there isn't anything wrong.

185
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,080
You have to go to school tomorrow.

186
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,360
If you don't go because Woohyun isn't going, you'll get in trouble.

187
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,700
Ms. Gong, you're inside there, right?

188
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,570
You're just sleeping because you're tired, right?

189
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,490
Just once...

190
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,990
Just once...

191
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,710
I wish you could appear again.

192
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,900
Grandma, I couldn't even tell you that I love you.

193
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,640
You weren't at school today. Where did you go?

194
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,310
Do I have to answer?

195
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,490
You should have at least called. I was worried.

196
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,940
If you don't want to go to school, you can rest for a few days.

197
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,080
I'll talk to your father.

198
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,010
Oh, yeah! Did you eat?

199
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,830
Stop trying to act like my mom.

200
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,750
Since Teacher is acting like that, my mother is running away.

201
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,100
I'll just stay next to you as a guardian.

202
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,190
Tired words. Hateful words.

203
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,940
You can spill them out anytime, so don't hold it in.

204
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,610
Please don't do anything.

205
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,690
Absolutely nothing.

206
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,100
Hey, Sungyeol, did you eat...

207
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,180
Get up. Eat at least one spoonful.

208
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,060
Get up.

209
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,530
Now I know what sadness is, too.

210
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,200
I think it's sad that I can't do anything for you.

211
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:15,310
I miss Grandma, too.

212
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,540
I'll let Grandma know what you want to tell her.

213
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,450
So just get up, Woohyun.

214
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:54,190

215
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,700
I guess I can't see him anymore.

216
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,370
Senior! Senior.

217
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,610
Can I still see you?

218
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,550
I'm not going to see you, move.

219
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,580
I have something to ask of you.

220
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,940
A human can't ask an angel for a favor.

221
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,880
Grandma, let me see her one more time.

222
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,140
You're asking me to break the rules. I can't.

223
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,960
Even if it's through a dream?

224
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,650
If you just let Woohyun meet her once,

225
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,830
he couldn't even say goodbye properly.

226
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,070
His grandma was the whole world to him,

227
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,900
but that world has disappeared.

228
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,730
So just once,

229
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,020
let him say goodbye to Grandma.

230
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,320
Why are you doing all this for that guy?

231
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,270
I don't know.

232
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,510
I want to do something for him.

233
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,830
I want to do it,

234
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,240
but I can't do anything.

235
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,800
No, it's beyond my own powers.

236
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,180
Then tell her that he loves her...

237
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,200
that Woohyun loves her a lot.

238
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,830
Tell her that he's going to be okay.

239
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,810
I beg of you.

240
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,230
If the human love that you chose changes,

241
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,180
then you will lose the thing that's most precious to you.

242
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,020
That's your punishment for leaving our world,

243
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,260
and the rule of this world.

244
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,900
Something precious?

245
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,110
After you gave up being an angel by breaking your vows,

246
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,500
you should've expected this!

247
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,340
Even if I lose everything,

248
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,340
if Woohyun is happy, then I think I'll be okay.

249
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,290
You're really...

250
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,400
Who are you talking to?

251
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,890
Oh, no one.

252
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,580
Why are you here?

253
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,410
Here?

254
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,100
Because I missed Grandma.

255
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,860
Lee Seulbi.

256
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,640
Lee Seulbi.

257
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,640
Lee Seulbi!

258
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,930
 Even if I lose everything,

259
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,640
 if Woohyun is happy, then I think I'll be okay.

260
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,940
Lose?

261
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,670
Even if she loses everything, she'll still like Woohyun?

262
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,560
I'll lose something precious?

263
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,930
- Woohyun! 
 - You...

264
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,660
Are you hungry? Should I give you food?

265
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,690
I thought you'd left without telling me!

266
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,270
Where would I go?

267
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,060
Yes, it's Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki.

268
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,860
I can't do delivery right now. There's a circumstance at the moment.

269
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,970
Grandma is...

270
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,340
on holiday.

271
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,360
 Give me some ddeokbokki, please.

272
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,810
We are closed for business.

273
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,900
Why aren't you doing business? You have a shop and the ingredients.

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,320
You just have to make it.

275
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,200
Mister, weren't you... Educational documents?

276
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,410
You remember that? Wow, your memory is good.

277
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,520
Okay, I'll open up.

278
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,160
Nice to meet you, I congratulate you on becoming human.

279
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,590
How do you know that?

280
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,930
I was once an angel, too, but now

281
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,290
I am entrusted with the position of "President" of the human angels.

282
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,880
Do you know how humans have a president? It's something similar to that.

283
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,240
I help look after angels like you who've become humans.

284
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,950
I listen to their civil complaints and do all sorts of things.

285
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,470
Mister, you were an angel?

286
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,960
You were surprised, right? Isn't this the first time you've seen such a charming angel?

287
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,500
Your phone is ringing.

288
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,490
That's my number. We have meetings.

289
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,520
I'll let you know by text about any dates.

290
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,300
If you have anything you're curious about, call me.

291
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,890
There's something else that's important.

292
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,660
We can't let our existence be known to humans.

293
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,320
Be careful. Be very careful.

294
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,490
Mister, wait.

295
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,070
What? Do you have something you're curious about?

296
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,100
When humans are sad...

297
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh, when humans are sad?

298
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,220
When humans are sad, they drink. You know, this.

299
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,460
Oh, you're in high school.

300
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,390
Just stay next to them.

301
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,860
There isn't much to comforting someone. You just need to stay with them.

302
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,300
Wait a moment.

303
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,370
Hello? Ah, yes, Angel Kim.

304
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,490
Do you know how long it's been since you haven't paid the membership fees?

305
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,400
You're not even paying your membership fees. Why do you always eat two bowls of ramen?

306
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,690
Be with them,

307
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,450
together?

308
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,590
What are you doing?

309
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,670
It's nothing.

310
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,390
He still hasn't eaten anything?

311
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,950
Grandma constantly told you that the meal you miss today will never come back!

312
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,370
Grandma told you not to skip meals like that!

313
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,490
"The meal you don't eat today,

314
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,300
is a meal you can never eat."

315
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,230
You said that, Ms. Gong.

316
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,260
Oh, Vice President.

317
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,470
The owner gave a lot...

318
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,250
Hey, we chose the Vice President well.

319
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,360
I chose you!

320
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,680
Thank you for coming!

321
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,430
Work hard!

322
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,670
The best cure for a troubled heart is reading books.

323
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,020
Thanks.

324
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,040
For the hot dog and the book.

325
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,240
Don't eat or sleep while reading the book.

326
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,560
And don't fold the pages to bookmark what you've already read.

327
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,580
I won't.

328
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,820
I'm going to be late! I'll be going first!

329
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,900
Welcome.

330
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,480
I thought I was first.

331
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,400
Sadly, you're last.

332
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,030
Did you not go to school today either?

333
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,430
I went so you wouldn't scold me.

334
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,510
Oh, they're side dishes.

335
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,510
Did your mom make them?

336
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,130
Huh?

337
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,470
Yeah.

338
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,570
You're lucky that you have a mom

339
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,890
and a handsome dad.

340
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,800
Everybody has parents. It's nothing special.

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,660
It is special.

342
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,040
Woohyun and I don't.

343
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,140
Woohyun can't even contact his parents.

344
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,340
Now, even his grandma...

345
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,650
It's grateful that they're alive.

346
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,230
You can see them whenever.

347
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,980
♫  If you wanna be my love...  ♫

348
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,940
Seulbi...

349
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,210
♫  I wanna be your star  ♫

350
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,480
♫  I want to see you several times a day  ♫

351
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,750
♫  I want to tell you I love you, that you're the only one  ♫

352
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,930
I'll do it.

353
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,080
Are you uncomfortable?

354
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,610
No.

355
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,480
What should I help you with?

356
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,260
Will people be able to eat what they order today?

357
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,110
I did receive orders... What do we do?

358
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,820
It tastes weird.

359
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,350
♫  The underlying meaning   ♫

360
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,510
♫  behind your touch,  ♫

361
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,670
♫  and the things you want to know about me,  ♫

362
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,720
♫  I'll show you...  ♫

363
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,890
♫  If you wanna be my love...  ♫

364
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,400
Wow! You really can do everything!
♫  I wanna be your star.  ♫

365
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,800
Ever since I was young, my parents were busy

366
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,840
so I had to do everything myself.

367
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,100
Oh! When parents are busy, that means you learn more skills.

368
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,290
♫  If you wanna be my love. I wanna be your star  ♫

369
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:50,170
♫  I want to see you several times a day  ♫

370
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,200
♫  If you wanna be my love...  ♫

371
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,020
Oh.

372
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,860
Will it be okay?

373
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,580
Sungyeol did help, but...

374
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,250
Yeah, we can try!

375
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,780
If we get cussed at, we'll just remake it!

376
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,190
Seulbi, good job!

377
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,720
Thanks.

378
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,040
Woohyun, that rascal, would know the taste the best.

379
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,190
Until that rascal wakes up, let's do it.

380
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm going!

381
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,330
If it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be any deliveries.

382
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,560
Why can't I recreate the taste?

383
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,890
There's nobody that can do it right on their first attempt.

384
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,060
It'll be different from Grandma's.

385
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,740
But still, you're really amazing!

386
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,460
What about the store?

387
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,120
This store is filled with Grandma and Woohyun's memories.

388
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,970
We need to keep it running.

389
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,630
Woohyun and you?

390
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,150
For now, just me.

391
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,210
Woohyun won't wake up. I'm getting worried.

392
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,660
He'll wake up.

393
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,190
I'm going to believe that, too.

394
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,870
You'll hurt your hand! I'll do it!

395
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,750
It slipped due to the bubbles.

396
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,070
I know. Did you not get hurt?

397
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,810
Then it's fine.

398
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,250
Where's Shin Youngchul?

399
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,140
Come out now!

400
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,040
Come out Shin Youngchul!

401
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,790
Not the kids. Call the adults.

402
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,670
What's wrong?

403
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,900
Is it you? You're grandma's grandson?

404
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,140
You give it, too.

405
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,520
What are you doing right now?

406
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,800
Shin Youngchul!

407
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,500
It's illegal to do this all of a sudden!

408
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,000
Illegal?

409
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,720
Then is it legal to take other's money?

410
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,890
Look, look, look. This young one is already talking about laws.

411
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,460
This seems like the house we'll live in.

412
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,700
Okay!

413
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,820
Who are you to do this?!

414
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,600
I'm asking who you are!

415
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,620
Ah, I have some business inside. Business.

416
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,190
I have some business inside.

417
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,990
- What do you mean business? 
 - Move!

418
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,490
Either you pay up

419
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,050
or empty this house.

420
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,230
Let's see!

421
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,620
Stop! This is our grandma's!

422
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,520
What is this?

423
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,060
What do you want?

424
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,490
Who are you?

425
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,910
Are you Shin Youngchul's son?

426
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,490
Gong Malsook! Gong Malsook, where are you?

427
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,610
Don't call Grandma's name like that!

428
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,560
This friend is cute.

429
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,450
Here, look!

430
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,600
Shin Youngchul used Gong Malsook's building to get money,

431
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,990
and he's not paying up. And we can't contact him.

432
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,350
Why is that human using this place!?

433
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,160
Go!

434
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,340
This rascal!

435
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,850
You go out!

436
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,420
This is our place.

437
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,570
Ow!

438
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,070
Are you saying you wanted your money at this time of the day?

439
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,300
Hey, policeman,

440
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,610
isn't it wrong to use money and not pay up?

441
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,450
We endured a lot.

442
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,210
Let's look at the contract.

443
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:23,280
What's the big deal of looking. Everything's this and that.

444
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,820
Here.

445
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,510
40%?

446
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,970
What kind of a society is today?

447
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,210
Don't you know the maximum interest rate change?!

448
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,930
These people are in trouble, really.

449
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:47,920
We didn't even get to see the interest money.

450
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,570
We have to receive something in order to eat and live.

451
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,260
Hey!

452
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,980
Give me my money fast!

453
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,350
If his father spent the money, the son needs to at least take responsibility!

454
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,500
Mister!

455
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,730
Sungyeol, take Woohyun and go back.

456
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,730
Let's go.

457
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,880
We should... We should leave, too.

458
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,500
Where are you going? Sit down.

459
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,890
If we investigate, it will all come out.

460
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,530
What's wrong?

461
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,290
Huh?

462
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,560
What?

463
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,280
Woohyun's father used the building as collateral for a high-interest loan, but they say he can't be reached.

464
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,270
Is that true?

465
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:10,140
They're about to lose both the store and their home.

466
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,610
We can't get into contact with Woohyun's dad at all.

467
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,600
We can't find out his whereabouts either.

468
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,020
We need to look for his mother instead.

469
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,520
What about the grandmother's inheritance?

470
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,190
There should be some inheritance.

471
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,890
I don't think it's enough.

472
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,620
With the kids, even the living expenses are a problem.

473
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,490
Those men could come back to find them.

474
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,780
Please don't let them do that.

475
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,130
What about Woohyun?

476
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,850
Is he not hurt anywhere?

477
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:48,100
Honey, maybe it's because he's a student at your school, you seem worried.

478
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,400
How could a father do that...?

479
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,020
Sungyeol asked if he could borrow his tuition savings in advance.

480
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,860
He says that he'll pay us back with the money from his scholarship and part-time job once he attends university.

481
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,040
That kid, his friendship has gotten deeper

482
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,240
after going through hardships.

483
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
So, this whole building is going to get handed over?

484
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,150
Can't you get in contact with Woohyun's dad?

485
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,360
If we could, then he would have come to Grandma's funeral.

486
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,710
He left Woohyun alone.

487
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,520
How can a parent do that?

488
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,800
What about Woohyun's mother? Where is she?

489
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,870
They separated when he was young, and it seems like they haven't seen each other since then.

490
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,140
Woohyun only had his grandma.

491
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,780
He's so pitiful, what do we do?

492
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,280
Where are we going to get that huge sum of money?

493
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,330
We can't lose this house nor the shop.

494
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,610
It's filled with Grandma and Woohyun's memories.

495
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:41,170

496
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:52,170
  The customer you are calling is unavailable or your call cannot be connected at this time.

497
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,340
  The customer you are calling is unavailable—

498
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,600
Where are you?

499
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,130
Why are you, my father?

500
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,340
Why? Why!?

501
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,120
Kisook.

502
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,200
Why aren't you sleeping at this time?

503
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,600
Did those men come again?

504
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,080
I want to do this, too.

505
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,910
What? Are you asking me to split my income with you?

506
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,990
No.

507
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,090
I can't just hand over the shop and house.

508
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,220
Please introduce me to your part-time job.

509
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,870
 Most importantly, the goal of a part-time job is to survive until the end.

510
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:51,110
 Especially for us high schoolers. Since our income is low, we save money by eating the leftovers.

511
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,520
How's this?

512
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,490
It's totally weird.

513
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,530
 Two. Even if the customer isn't pretty,

514
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,570
 you have to have the courage to tell her that she is.

515
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,750
Play with us!

516
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,670
Play with us!

517
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,950
Are you going to throw balls at your teacher or not?

518
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,120
We're not going to throw them.

519
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,150
Is it okay to throw or not?

520
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,900
It's not okay.

521
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,300
What are you doing to the kids?

522
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,900
They changed the teacher.

523
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,770
 Three. No matter what situation you're in, just smile.

524
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,070
I just checked in as I was passing by.

525
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,690
You have to go to school now.

526
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:55,720
I asked my friend in the US to look for any news about your father so just wait a bit.

527
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,910
It's definite that my father borrowed money.

528
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,870
Even so,

529
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:09,280
if you know his name, social security number, or even the last place he lived, I could help you look for him.

530
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,460
To others, parents are like a fence. But to me, they're like a cliff.

531
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,990
A cliff so high...

532
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,780
that you can't see.

533
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,720
If you fall, you'll die.

534
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,050
So, please don't look for him.

535
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,040
That will help me the most.

536
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,570
If those men come again,

537
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,370
contact me immediately.

538
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,990
All right?

539
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,090
The adults probably had their own reasons.

540
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,690
Let's cheer up.

541
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,450
What really happened to you?

542
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,770
That's really a talent.

543
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,830
How can you get fired six times in one day?

544
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,160
Are 24 hours not enough?

545
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,980
You're right. Isn't there anything else I can do?

546
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,210
That's it.

547
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,760
I'm surprised that you study well with that kind of brain.

548
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,560
You probably don't have time to study

549
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,960
if you're always working hard like this.

550
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,930
Bingo!

551
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:22,520
It's because I don't have time. If I did, you guys wouldn't be able to keep up with me.

552
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,540
Let's figure something out.

553
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,020
Sure.

554
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,230
Seulbi!

555
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,330
Sungyeol!

556
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,930
Where were you all this time?

557
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,940
Kisook introduced me to some part-time jobs.

558
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,160
I wanted to raise some money, even if it was a little bit.

559
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,280
Are you hurt somewhere?

560
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,380
No.

561
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,150
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

562
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,850
It's okay. I'm really strong.

563
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,130
But what brings you here?

564
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,390
I stopped by because I was curious.

565
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,510
I'll try to find a way to raise money.

566
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,290
So don't overdo yourself and don't worry.

567
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,440
Thank you. Woohyun would be very thankful.

568
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,350
All right, go inside and rest.

569
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,810
What were you doing all this time?

570
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,600
Did you wait for me?

571
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,730
Don't do useless things.

572
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,810
There's nothing you can do.

573
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,090
If I look, I'm sure there's something.

574
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,910
You want to find my father?

575
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,390
You can't do it, right?

576
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,170
You want to pay all the debt?!

577
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,440
You can't do it, right?!

578
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,430
So, please don't do anything!

579
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,180
I really can't understand (you).

580
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,880
Why is it so hard?

581
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,240
Why is it so hard to get you to laugh and to eat?

582
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,950
I don't know how hurt you are or how sad you are.

583
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,350
If you don't know then stay still!

584
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,780
You can't just stay like this. I know this much.

585
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,220
 That's why I said to leave, you idiot.

586
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,480
♫  I hold her hand  ♫

587
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,400
♫  as I walk on this road  ♫

588
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,720
 $500?

589
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,660
♫  ...along the river that sparkles in the sun   ♫

590
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,940
Bongie!

591
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,030
Bongie!

592
00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:04,990
♫  Your scent that envelopes me    ♫

593
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,290
♫  You and I, just us two   ♫

594
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,360
Bongie!

595
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,580
Bongie!

596
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,920
Bongie!

597
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,770
♫   ...blue sky with white clouds  ♫

598
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,080
Bongie!

599
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:31,730
♫  ...and with the warm wind brushing against our clothes   ♫

600
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:38,960
♫  I look at her with a bright face  ♫

601
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,070
Seulbi!

602
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,550
Lee Seulbi!

603
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,930
Give this to Seulbi.

604
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,750
You give it to her personally.

605
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,520
Were you always this insensitive?

606
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,860
Seulbi has been working from dawn to night to repay the debt.

607
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,260
Her body smells like pain relief patches!

608
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,230
Stop acting so childish!

609
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,960
Childish?

610
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,540
Just because you have so much, do I seem childish to you because I'm acting like this over one loss?

611
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,570
Because of you, Seulbi couldn't leave!

612
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,870
I never told her to stay.

613
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,150
You never told her to leave sincerely, either.

614
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,510
Stop acting like you're the most pitiful guy in this world!

615
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,630
You received a lot of love from your grandma. I—

616
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,390
If you're done, go away.

617
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,610
I still have more.

618
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,960
I can't stand this anymore,

619
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,870
so stay away from Seulbi.

620
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,890
Because of guys like you, hardworking Seulbi is pitiful.

621
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:27,820
If I find lost dogs for people every day, I'll be able to pay off the debt pretty soon.

622
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,380
It hurts.

623
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,470
Ms. Gong,

624
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,480
I should have told you that you were pretty.

625
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,500
You didn't even know that you were sick because you were earning and saving up this money?

626
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,400
We should have gone on a world trip with this money.

627
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,500
We didn't even get to go to Jeju Island.

628
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,100
We're really stupid.

629
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,920
We have so much money saved,

630
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,450
yet why don't we have any memories?

631
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,960
Really...

632
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,550
Move.

633
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,380
I'll earn and pay you back the remaining sum.

634
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,380
Are you playing with me?

635
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,210
You will never be able to pay up.

636
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,700
I'll try my best.

637
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,750
By using whatever means, I'll make sure to repay you.

638
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,900
What "means" will you use to pay us back?

639
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,950
Pay for this as well.

640
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,120
I'm sorry.

641
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,240
I'm sorry.

642
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,320
Wait a minute.

643
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,890
You are pretty.

644
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:44,350
Little girl, there are actually a lot of ways to make money.

645
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,710
Woohyun!

646
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,400
You're scary.

647
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,160
You think you're all that?

648
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:03,620
Look at this. Money can make a person kneel.

649
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,220
Let's repay the borrowed money, okay?

650
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,540
If you don't pay up...

651
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,350
You know, right?

652
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,830
If we try our best, we'll be able to get them back soon:

653
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:29,660
the house and the store.

654
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,960
There are a lot of places high schoolers can go to earn money.

655
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,670
- You and I... 
 - Should we spend our whole life paying back the debt?

656
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,100
Is that your dream?

657
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,860
Your wish?

658
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,560
Then you do it.

659
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,490
Woohyun.

660
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,160
I don't need anything anymore.

661
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,070
I don't need it at all!

662
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:02,740
Have you ever thought how heartbroken Grandma would be if she ever saw you like this?

663
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:09,040
I'm hurting, too, because I've been left behind. I'm hurting so much I could die!

664
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,960
Do you not see me?

665
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,510
You're not alone.

666
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,550
What about me?

667
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,180
I didn't want you to be alone,

668
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,780
so I gave up everything.

669
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,520
Don't be like this, Woohyun.

670
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,400
So leave.

671
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,560
Please just leave!

672
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,970
♫  Friday, feeling deep inside you   ♫

673
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,570
♫  Now that I can sense your color   ♫

674
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,690
♫  Sweet cherry bomb, a nice calico, above the heavens   ♫

675
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,490
 You two look good together

676
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,350
 Hey!

677
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,190
 You're really best friends, right?

678
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,380
 - Oh, hey! 
 - Oh, hey!

679
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,680
 Here, let's peel it.

680
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,700
 Come here!

681
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,920
 The ethics teacher?

682
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
 You were Sungyeol's mother?

683
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,840
 Senior.

684
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,320
 Should we say that she's a bit different than the other kids?

685
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,090
 Ghost?

686
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,390
 Spirit?

687
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,190
 Seulbi,

688
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,750
 I've been waiting until today.
