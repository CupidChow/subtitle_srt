1
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,490
I know that it's shameless but please accept me.

2
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,510
Are you crazy?

3
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,770
Do you not know where this is?  Get out.

4
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,770
I can't leave now.

5
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,540
Get out right now.

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,140
Go back.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,330
I don't live here alone and

8
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,630
even with the responsibility of Seulbi, it's already plenty difficult.

9
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,290
Don't you be like this, too.

10
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,090
You heard right. You were just thrown away again.

11
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,310
Hwang Sungyeol!

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,160
If you don't leave, I'll leave.

13
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,990
Woohyun, please!

14
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,940
You... really...

15
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,400
Since you're here today, just stay.

16
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,720

17
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,910
Why did you not tell me?

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,480
If there was an issue you should have told me first...

19
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,750
I'm your father.

20
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,440
Since you're my dad, I couldn't tell you.

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,350
Because then you would be in pain, too.

22
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,270
Let's think about what we have to do.

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,620

24
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,730
At times this is medicine.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,870
I'm...

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,000
really sorry.

27
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,680
Hello.

28
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,440
 Ah, yes.  Hello.

29
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,310
 Really? I understand.

30
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,040
 Yes.  Goodbye.

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,240
Hey, Hwang Sungyeol!  You rascal...!

32
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,520
It will get colder very soon.

33
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,400
I wonder if he brought some thicker clothes.

34
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,180
I have to discuss it with Sungyeol's dad,

35
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,220
and while you're here don't make any issues with Sungyeol.

36
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,660
Woohyun, you should go back tomorrow.

37
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,600
I don't like that it's become more difficult for you because of me.

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,990
Geez, you're too much. I came here to protect you.

39
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,180
I know but...

40
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,870
Are you outside because it feels strange to be here? I'll come outside, too.

41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,610
Stop. Don't come out. I don't want to get pegged (as not doing the right thing) from the first day.

42
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,040
I can't let you catch a cold by yourself.

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,580
Oh, my Seulbi is completely full of loyalty...

44
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,200
- I am a bit. 
 - ...is what you thought I would say, right?

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,630
If you're sick, I have to do all the store work by myself. Plus, I have to go to school by myself.

46
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,360
You can't. Don't ever get sick. Even if someone gets sick, it'll be me.

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,950
Then hurry up and get inside.

48
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,590
Sungyeol hasn't come home yet.

49
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,860
He left with Mister, so don't worry.

50
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,330
Close the window and hurry up and go in.

51
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,940
- One, two— 
 - Sleep well.

52
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,650
Sweet dreams.  Sleep well.

53
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,120
Are you okay?

54
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,260
Let's go.

55
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,090

56
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,860
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,700
I'll look for a solution.

58
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,280
Will you throw your own son back out on the street?

59
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,010
Or will you let just the two of them live alone again?

60
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,240
What do you want me to do?

61
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
How can the fellow who entrusted his son to you know that?

62
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,070
But...

63
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,180
when you throw your own son out like that, I'm afraid of how bad Sungyeol must have it.

64
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,460
Geez!

65
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,920
Hey... seriously.

66
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,690
Who are you?

67
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,160
You little thing, already with the (alcohol)...

68
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,550
Come here.

69
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,580
Hey, you... so disgustingly, put it back in.

70
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,110
Jerk.

71
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,680
So dirtily.

72
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,150
Bastard.

73
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,870
You're worse.

74
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,410
For such a cold punk, your hands are warm.

75
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,980
My goodness, you cute punk. If you were this cute all the time, how nice would that be?

76
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,490
Let's not fight in our dreams.

77
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,760
I'm tired.

78
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Isn't sleeping on the floor uncomfortable?

79
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,730
Since I'm together with you, I'm okay.

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,920
Shut up.

89
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,740
♫  Close your eyes... (and listen carefully to my story)  ♫

90
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,600
Thanks for being by my side.

91
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,890
♫  Before my story ends, you will dream  ♫

92
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:49,310
♫   Little star~, tonight~  ♫

93
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,190
♫  All night, I will watch over you  ♫

94
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,730
HEY!

95
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,700
Are you crazy?

96
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,030
You almost killed me by squeezing me.

97
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,510
Why is your room so cold?

98
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,980
That bastard...

99
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,210
This is good for curing a hangover.

100
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,120
I tried cleaning it...

101
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,570
You didn't have to do that.

102
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,520
Thanks for taking me in.

103
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,940
I will do even better if you take Woohyun in, too.

104
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,100
See you then.

105
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,230
Sungyeol already left. He could've gone with us.

106
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,670
You don't have to tell the world that we are living together.

107
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,750
Living in the same house and having the same mother is not a bad thing.

108
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,300
It is nothing good, either.

109
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,850
We can't be friends now.

110
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,520
Humans are so complicated.

111
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,630
Talking about humans again.

112
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,330
Oops, my mistake.

113
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,630
It is better to have Sungyeol as a family than as a stranger.

114
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,490
You guys know each other well.

115
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,930
You can't share family members.

116
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,440
You said the family is always on your side.

117
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,300
You said you don't share them, but you can be together with them.

118
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,030
Yes, I told you that wise saying to you,  who has a good memory.

119
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:09,970
It looks delicious! I was so hungry while waiting for you. Did you sleep well?

120
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,280
I guess the cure worked.

121
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,000
You easily got drunk by drinking water with the same cup that was for alcohol.

122
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,370
I guess you take after your mother.

123
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,040
I don't want to take after anyone; including you and mom.

124
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,660
Right. Don't be like me.

125
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,740
I'm trying.

126
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,130
Woohyun must have his reasons.

127
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,630
I know it will be hard, but let's try to get along.

128
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,230
He is your friend, too.

129
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,590
He's not my friend.

130
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,690
 Come.

131
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,840
 Hey!

132
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,620
Wait, wait! I'm almost done!

133
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,650
Give me my wage; 31,500 won (approx. $31.5).

134
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,040
My wage is 5,210 won, but why do you always exclude 210 won?

135
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,660
Don't come again from now on.

136
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,770
Don't work if you don't want 5,000 won.

137
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,640
- Boss... 
 - Go away!

138
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,030
You can't pretend you're happy, but you can pretend you were surprised?

139
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,200
Your work ended early today.

140
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,840
What happened? Is it because of your boss?

141
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,750
That bastard...

142
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,700
- I will get revenge on him. 
 - Why would you do that?

143
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,710
Hmm?

144
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,920
I am really good at that.

145
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,010
 Democracy and capitalism.

146
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,100
 Find the connection between globalization and nationalism...

147
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,710
 Yohan. Chunsik. Talk to me about whether you guys are doing well or not.

148
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,500
  First, compare the social ideas nowadays with

149
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,830
  democracy, capitalism, nationalism...

150
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,830
  Please do it with the perspective of society today.

151
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,780
  Second, apart from today's social ideas...

152
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,090
No cell phones during class. You didn't know that?

153
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,040
You can have it. I will just buy a new one.

154
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,340
Is that so? I will take it anyway.

155
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,160
You should open a store for cell phones now.

156
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,190
Hand in the career paper next time. That's it.

157
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,970
Teacher!

158
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,290
You live with Sungyeol.

159
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,530
Doesn't Seulbi live with Sungyeol, too?

160
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,340
Isn't that right?

161
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,430
How about you study hard with that curiosity?

162
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,320
What is Sungyeol to you?

163
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,810
He's my son.

164
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,410
 - Son? 
 - Wow!

165
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,400
 Son?

166
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,620
Come.

167
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,300
Lee Seulbi, you're blessed.

168
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,870
What did you do?

169
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,300
Living with boys... Is that your specialty?

170
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,420
Sleeping together is the same as living together.  It is not like what you guys think, though.

171
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,540
There is a reason for that.

172
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,670
A dog that was chasing a chicken is now fixing a barn. 
  (It is a saying in Korean, and it is actually "a dog that was chasing a chicken is now looking up at the roof.")

173
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,260
So idiotic.

174
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,060
Shut your mouth before I beat you up.

175
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,010
I was only telling the truth...

176
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,380
I didn't allow you to talk with me.

177
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,120
I know you're sad because of Sungyeol, then why are you mad at me? You should be mad at Seulbi.

178
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,730
Isn't all you have to do is get along with Sungyeol?

179
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,690
What do you do now? You tried everything to get Woohyun.  But look at you now.

180
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,150
Is she your real mother? Or a new one?

181
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,940
Oh, sorry. I think I hurt your feelings.

182
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,670
Good job.

183
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,880
- Good job? 
 - You should go around babbling like that in the future, too.

184
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,820
It is hard for me to talk about them.

185
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,240
Take this back, and don't you dare care about me.

186
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,940
You should go to an audition if you want to become a singer.

187
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,020
Why are you doing that in a karaoke?

188
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,600
You know I don't keep secrets.

189
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,030
You are threatening now?

190
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,180
You use money or threaten...

191
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,530
Ah, you don't have friends.

192
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,570
I had a hard time until now. Because of her.

193
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,990
If you were threatened, you must have done something to get threatened.

194
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,610
That fits you better than being a singer.

195
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,330
Don't you feel glad to see this?

196
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,450
Why do you always hide your feelings?

197
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,440
Youngeun was looking for you because she was worried about you,

198
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,690
and you also pushed me down the stairs because you wanted to be closer to Youngeun again

199
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,450
That's not it. You wouldn't know.

200
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,020
Your eyes are sweating.

201
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,130
Human tears are warm, too.

202
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,150
Mom, she keeps making fun of me!

203
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,520
What was with those old men?

204
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,430
Those men? They were a CEO and a manager of an agency.

205
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,010
All my effort was ruined because of you.

206
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,520
Is that the only agency? Do you want me to open an agency for you?

207
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,470
Am I funny to you? Is my dream amusing?

208
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,620
I know, too, that I don't have any talent.

209
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,570
But if I don't do things like that, do you think I would ever be able to stand on a stage?

210
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,910
With no money or connections,

211
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,490
is it not okay to have a dream?

212
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,570
You, without a dream, are more pathetic than me.

213
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:36,030
Be careful with your shoulder on that side. Don't use it too much and if it gets worse, go take an X-ray.

214
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,980
Thank you.

215
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh! Is Sungyeol's mom really the Ethics teacher?

216
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,870
It was all the school was talking about.

217
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,210
I should've known... Whenever it came to Sungyeol, she reacted totally differently.

218
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,740
Wait, then isn't the Ethics teacher Sungyeol's stepmom then?

219
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,780
Everything's suddenly going so badly for Sungyeol...

220
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,780
- Why? Because she's not the birth mother? 
 - Yes.

221
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,620
My mom said that the only new thing that's bad is a new mom (stepmom).

222
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,830
It's a joke. Apparently now stepmom's are better.

223
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,420
What's the difference between a birth mother and a stepmother?

224
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,830
I guess, well, closer or less close... Why are you taking this so seriously...?

225
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,000
What's up with him?

226
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,520
2,100 won, please.

227
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,900
Is there anything else you need?

228
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,920
Give me 31,500 won (about $30).

229
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,990
This is recording well, right?

230
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,520
Even if it's a student, if they lose hard-earned money,

231
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,010
do you think they would feel good?

232
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,330
Should I officially report you to the labor department?

233
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,250
Who?

234
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,350
Who are you?

235
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,170
210 won (about $0.19) per hour for five hours a day.

236
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,070
31,500 won (about $30) for one month.

237
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,000
Are you going to admit it or not?

238
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,040
I'll give this to Jooah.

239
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,950
Next time, when you pay your part-timers,

240
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,770
start with "Good job" or "Thank you."

241
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,160
To our kids.

242
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,870
Yes.

243
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,600
It looks like humans are often born to hurt each other.

244
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,450
Hurt?

245
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,040
The sweat that comes out of the eyes is warm because the human is warm, right?

246
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,010
Sweat that comes from the eyes is normally warm.

247
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,470
If your tears were cold, too, it'd be sadder, wouldn't it?

248
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,080
There's nothing you don't know.

249
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,050
This isn't a commercial.

250
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,200
I'll go help at the store a little before I go. Could you keep it a secret from Teacher though?

251
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,190
You're lying now.

252
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,300
If Teacher told you not to come to the shop, I'm okay. Go.

253
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,610
Still, it'll be hard by yourself.

254
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,610
I have Kisoo and Chunsik, so don't worry.

255
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,530
Bring her home carefully.

256
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,020
Go.

257
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm a thing that hurts you.

258
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,970
I'll stop by at the bookstore before I go. I had something to buy but I completely forgot.

259
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,130
We can go together.

260
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,940
No, I can go by myself. I'll be right back.

261
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:03,970

262
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,600
800 won.

263
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,300
You even took out a loan to save Woohyun's store?

264
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,210
The loan and the interest, I'll work it well and repay it.

265
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,080
That's not what I'm talking about right now. You should have at least discussed it with me.

266
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,720
What am I to you? Why do you keep disappointing me this way?

267
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,120
I couldn't look the other way and I couldn't discuss it with you.

268
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,480
How could I be so shameless as to even ask?

269
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,660
How can I know what else you're hiding from me?

270
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,880
Honey! Honey, I'm sorry. I'm not hiding anything else from you, really.

271
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,650
Those words right now are the most unbelievable.

272
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,760
You even helped them with the ddeokbokki shop?

273
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,350
You wanted to help them, too.

274
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,060
Is then and now the same?

275
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,840
That's the money that Dad worked all night and earned with difficulty.

276
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,550
That wasn't your father's money.

277
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,940
It's the money I saved so difficultly while living apart from my son,

278
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,300
thinking to get a small house.

279
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,530
In the end, you were thinking of throwing me and my father away and living with your son.

280
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,960
While thinking that, why did you reveal to the kids that I was your son?

281
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,200
Since you are my son, too.

282
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,100
Then I'd better reveal that Woohyun is your biological son, too.

283
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,840
Fine. Reveal it as quickly as you can,

284
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,400
so that at least at school I can look at him comfortably.

285
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,080
You knew, right? About Sungyeol and the Ethics teacher.

286
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,200
That you didn't tell me that kind of big news, were we only in that kind of relationship?

287
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,220
Has the affection cooled?

288
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,250
Hey, the ddeokbokki will cool. Hurry up and go.

289
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,120
But anyway, Seulbi and Sungyeol in one house.

290
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,750
Will it be all right?

291
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,230
If a man and woman keep looking at each others' faces, they say that even ugly things appear pretty.

292
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,690
Hey, then to you, I must forever look pretty since I see you every day.

293
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,980
Hey, that's not true!

294
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,990
Not true, my butt.  What's he talking about?

295
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,520
Go well and come back safely.

296
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,060
How did you come?

297
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,920
Sungyeol told me that you were busy and to come to help you.

298
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,840
Even your lies show on your face.

299
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,960
What should I start with?

300
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,170
Go help Jooah.

301
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,730
Congrats on your first day of work.

302
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,070
Thanks. Isn't it sad to live in someone else's house?

303
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,190
It's not sad but it is a little difficult being watchful of their notice.

304
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,350
Living in someone else's house is like that normally. You have to be the first to wake up and the last to sleep.

305
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,500
There is really nothing you don't know.

306
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,300
You have no reaction even though you're the main character of this huge announcement. Isn't that intriguing?

307
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,670
If you've come, just play your game.

308
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,100
What's your dream?

309
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:37,840
I just tried asking wondering what kind of dream a guy who studies so well has.

310
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,490
Lee Seulbi, here.

311
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,950
The thing is...

312
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,430
I'm sorry.

313
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,780
I'll see you at home later.

314
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,290
Hey, it sounds just like the conversation of newlyweds.

315
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,600
See you at home later.

316
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,720
You'll have to help me.

317
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:37,130

318
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,770
Eat a lot. Hwang Sungyeol says that he'll treat us properly today.

319
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,870
Aren't you going to take the order?

320
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,610
Yes. What shall I get you, Customer?

321
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,540
What's that picture?

322
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,490
Jealousy, betrayal, love triangle.

323
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,610
From there to there. Bring it all.

324
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,760
Yes.

325
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,900
Customers are Seulbi's and my way to feed ourselves. Let's hold it in.

326
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,830
♫  If you wanna be my love? (I wanna be your star)  ♫

327
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,480
♫   In even one day I want to see you so many times    ♫

328
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,180
♫   That I love you,  that you're the only one   ♫

329
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,910
♫   If you'd hug me prettily   ♫

330
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:57,430
♫   Everything will change   ♫

331
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,380
♫  If you wanna be my love...  ♫

332
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,770
Oh, yes.

333
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,620
Hey, let's set the date.

334
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,160
Hey, because of you, we did earn some good money.

335
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,010
Hey, thanks.

336
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,300
It's $174 but I'll only take $170.

337
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,880
Get it from your mom since this is your mom's store.

338
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,060
What does that mean?

339
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,070
Your mom is this store's owner. Didn't you know?

340
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,020
Is that true? Did Teacher help us?

341
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,130
Since you're her biological son, she spent a lot of money.

342
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,470
So what? It doesn't matter who the owner is. Calculate it properly.

343
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,710
I'm her son on her family registry, so isn't this much okay?

344
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,570
Let's go.

345
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,560
Hey, Hwang Sungyeol. Don't you get the sense that this is really petty?

346
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll show you what being really petty is. Aren't you coming?

347
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,730
Woohyun, I'll leave first.

348
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,960
I'll see you at home.

349
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,310
Have you really decided to make things difficult for Woohyun?

350
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,370
I'm thinking to go to the end.

351
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,160
I don't know what will be at the end of that path, so don't ask.

352
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,540
You give pain to Woohyun, and you hurt as much as he does.

353
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,820
No, I don't hurt at all.

354
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,520
Are you okay?

355
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,690
You're not crying. You're quite sturdy.

356
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,780
 You normally smiled like that, warmly and sweetly.

357
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,600
Walk carefully.

358
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,500
I'm sorry for lying earlier.

359
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,470
Woohyun's shoulder seemed to hurt him. I couldn't leave him to work alone.

360
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,410
Even if you lie, I'm not going to send you any longer.

361
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,560
It would be nice if Woohyun could try living with his mother.

362
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,830
He always longed for her.

363
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,570
How many days or months it will be,

364
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,580
it's in your hands.

365
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:15,900

366
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,550
 Sungyeol, let's eat!

367
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,480
I don't care, I'll just eat later.

368
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,790
You eat first, I'll just eat later.

369
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,620
Both of you sit.

370
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:28,890
I don't know what happened to you two, but in this house, don't make it uncomfortable for everyone.

371
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,060
This isn't a place where only you two live.

372
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,980
Let's have dinner together.

373
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,090
And don't try to live off only ramen.

374
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,750
Let's try sharing the tasks. There's no one comfortable here. Got it?

375
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,740
Yes.

376
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,780
Did the store do well today?

377
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,740
Excuse me?

378
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,810
Yes. It was busy today.

379
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,800
That's a relief.

380
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,050
The store... I'll work hard to get it back.

381
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:08,130
I can't repay the debt right now, but

382
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,340
I have to pretend to ignore it even if it's a cowardly thing to do.

383
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,720
Please wait a bit.

384
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,710
For a mom, it was the natural thing to do. I would've done the same.

385
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,770
Everything...

386
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,930
Honestly, everything is uncomfortable and weird.

387
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,890
I'm uncomfortable here, too.

388
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,260
I can't smile here.

389
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,830
Even though I didn't know if my mom was ever going to come, I liked that house because I was waiting for her.

390
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,500
Sungyeol can't forget his real mom either.

391
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,130
It must be the same for you.

392
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,240
You guys are only 18.

393
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,950
I'm running towards the end of a cliff.

394
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,980
And Sungyeol, too.

395
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,620
If Sungyeol falls first, I will definitely catch him. Don't worry too much.

396
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,990
What if you fall first?

397
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,380
I can't fall. I have people to protect.

398
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,150
Thank you for taking me in.

399
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,780
Are you okay?

400
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,000
Let go, I'll do it.

401
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,700
That's right! Sungyeol is my son.

402
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,550
My goodness...

403
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,290
Why are you like this?

404
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,270
Let go.

405
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,100
Ah, let's go.

406
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,590
It's okay.

407
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,040
I heard that humans drink alcohol when they're sad.

408
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,150
Mister, Teacher, and Sungyeol all seem unhappy because of me.

409
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:44,220
Even if everyone else in the world is unhappy because of you, there will always be one person... one person who's happy because of you.

410
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,960
Who's that?

411
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,940
Me! Me!

412
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,930
Me, too! Me!

413
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,130
You are hurt, why didn't you tell me?

414
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,010
It's all better now because you worried about me. It's fine.

415
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:05,890
Pain in your body will heal over time but when will aches in your heart heal?

416
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,790
You, and Sungyeol, too.

417
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,630
Hey, Hwang Sungyeol.

418
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,570
Let's talk.

419
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,560
You go in first.

420
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,400
Don't fight.

421
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,030
Out of all the sports, basketball, soccer, and running, the reason why I have to do this today...

422
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,310
Forget it.

423
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:45,560
If I win, the relationship between Teacher, you, and I will definitely stay a secret.

424
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,410
If I win, I'll reveal Seulbi's secret.

425
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,210
What is Seulbi's secret?

426
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,060
Whatever she's hiding, wouldn't you know better?

427
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,160
♫  Recently, it seems like I'm living in a dream every day  ♫

428
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,330
♫  I’m still not used to this kind of life  ♫

429
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:10,720
♫  When I’m with you, the stars twinkle even during the day  ♫

430
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,970
♫  I don’t want to meet anyone else but you   ♫

431
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,930
♫  Without you, I don’t want to do anything   ♫

432
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:26,100
♫  Even when I’m with my friends, I’m always thinking about you  ♫

433
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,150
♫  You’re too much for me   ♫

434
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,290
♫  You’re too good for me   ♫

435

♫  Today and tomorrow, I’ll be always loving you   ♫

439
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,950
Now shut your mouth. Forever.

440
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:11,530
If you had to win with that much purpose, there must be something about Seulbi.

441
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,760
In front of each other, let's not fight.  Because of us, Seulbi is hurting.

442
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,010
♫  It was the beginning of fall  ♫

443
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,150
♫  When it was cold but not really cold   ♫

444
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,840
♫  You seemed like you’d be cold   ♫

445
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,740
♫  But you were wearing short clothes   ♫

446
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,070
♫  The season passed   ♫

447
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,760
♫  And today the sunshine is warm   ♫

448
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,990
♫  Spring has come...   ♫

449
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,930
Wh-What's the matter?

450
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,300
Are you hurt somewhere?

451
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Some painkillers...

452
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,770
Painkillers?

453
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,310
Here...

454
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,930
I'll do it.

455
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,940
Sungyeol prepared it. We knew that you were having a hard time.

456
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,840
Really?

457
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,800
Sungyeol, thank you.

458
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,200
Not bad.

459
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,330
I'll eat well.

460
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,790
- This— 
 - Woohyun.

461
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,040
Stop it!

462
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,130
What are you doing right now?!

463
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,870
Is that all you can do?

464
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,400
Being like this, you...

465
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,550
This is all your fault.

466
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:45,940
So, please stop now. Think of me.

467
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,480
Are you okay?

468
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,350
Why did you just eat it? You can't even say you can't eat it?

469
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:49,760
Sorry. The only thing I gave you was allergies.

470
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,480
Just rest.

471
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,280
When you were six and crossing a busy street,

472
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,480
you crossed alone to get to your grandma's.

473
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,650
As soon as I caught you, I hit you.

474
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:14,210
Saying "how even without you, things were difficult, why were you adding to my hardships?"

475
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:22,470
The fact that I was a divorced, single mom having to take care of you alone,

476
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,960
it was really hard and embarrassing.

477
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,560
As if you knew my feelings, you would cry yourself to sleep.

478
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:42,710
I was afraid that if I kept you, you would have died.

479
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,590
It was hard.

480
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,490
It sounds like a weak excuse to me.

481
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,170
You're right. It's an excuse.

482
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,500
You have to live.

483
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,960
And I had to live, too.

484
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,550
You would've been hurting, too.

485
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,350
Instead of me,

486
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,340
I should've taken the pain for you.

487
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:24,250
I realized that late, Woohyun.

488
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,790
But...

489
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,860
since you're hurt,

490
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,350
it's nice that I can see you for a long time.

491
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,770
I'm really bad, aren't I?

492
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,780
What do you think will change if you keep this up?

493
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,650
If you keep getting mad, both of you will just keep getting hurt more.

494
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:06,740
And also, don't bother Woohyun anymore. I won't let it go anymore.

495
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,630
Don't come close!

496
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,320
What are you?

497
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,380
What exactly are you hiding?

498
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,380
There's nothing I'm hiding.

499
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,340
Perhaps, are you—

500
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
Shut your mouth.

501
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,760
  I have nothing to do with the mess you and Teacher are in.

502
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,690
  Weirder and weirder things are happening. It's because of you, isn't it?

503
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,300
 Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong with you?!

504
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,550
 I'm sorry.

505
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,970
  Go away! Leave!

506
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,720
  Let me see you even like this.

507
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,540
 No, please!!

508
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,960
  Please don't let anything happen to us.
