1
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:27,362
Sungyeol.

2
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,422
Hey, you need to help me wash my back.

3
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,702
You can't just leave, okay?

4
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,292
Sungyeol, this...

5
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,342
Thank you.

6
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:47,882
Drink this.

7
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:57,032
Are you three close?

8
00:00:58,052 --> 00:00:59,472
Yes.

9
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:08,862
Where are your parents? Why do you live with Woohyun?

10
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:14,142
My parents aren't around, and due to some circumstances...

11
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,732
I'm staying with him.

12
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:19,012
You two together?

13
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:51,112
♫  I hold her hand  ♫

14
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,712
It's dangerous.

15
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:56,072
You're more dangerous.

16
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:58,552
♫  ...along the river  ♫

17
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,202
Be careful.

18
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:04,442
♫  ...that sparkles in the sun  ♫

19
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:09,012
I'm safe, not dangerous.

20
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,132
Understand?

21
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:16,232
♫  ...that envelopes me  ♫

22
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:19,402
♫  You and I, just us two  ♫

23
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:23,422
I knew I would be thankful to you guys one day.

24
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,962
Good job.

25
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:38,642
We have one more to add to our memories.

26
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,522
Was I this dangerous?

27
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,812
I should block the doorway.

28
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,992
I can't even trust myself.

29
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,472
Oh right! I forgot I needed to go use the restroom.

30
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,452
Bathroom.

31
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:31,982
My wishes will be fulfilled? Yeah, right.

32
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:44,072

33
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,222
Are you sick?

34
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,412
Is something wrong?

35
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:12,502
Are you mad?

36
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:22,762
What's the matter?

37
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:32,722
Through exercise,  you can change the hatred in your relationship to affection.

38
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:35,742
Place your hatred on this ball,

39
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,492
and throw it and catch it.

40
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:40,632
Throw and catch, throw and catch, throw and catch.

41
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:44,032
- Then it's over. All right? 
 - Yes.

42
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:48,232
Okay. Now then, action!

43
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:31,312
Why are you being so irritable?

44
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:38,522
Look at you. Are you mad at me or something?

45
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:42,542
And you were taking it out on Seulbi? So cowardly.

46
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,492
Fair and square? Yeah, right.

47
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:52,672
If you're going to continue to act like that, then stay away from Seulbi.

48
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,852
I never asked you to worry about it.

49
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,122
- Hey, Woohyun, are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

50
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:07,482
Hey, let me take a look.

51
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:12,852
I think you need to go to the nurse's office.

52
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:16,892
Are you okay?

53
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:25,742
What's wrong?

54
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,072
Sungyeol threw the ball right into Woohyun's side.

55
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,132
Are you hurting a lot?

56
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,032
- I'm fine— 
 - You should've been careful!

57
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,602
How can you take a joke this far?

58
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:41,982
It's my fault for not being able to avoid it. It wasn't Sungyeol's fault.

59
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:48,562
Sungyeol, are you not hurt anywhere?

60
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:50,292
Yes.

61
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:54,862
Be careful.

62
00:06:57,322 --> 00:07:00,792
What the... It's the first time I saw the witch teacher worry about anyone.

63
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:05,792
Hey, Hwang Sungyeol! Thanks to you, I get to sleep for an hour.

64
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,512
You're just pretending to be sick, right?

65
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,672
Wait.. really... It really hurts.

66
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:40,702

67
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:02,312
Teacher...

68
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:12,382
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

69
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:14,692
Why are you sorry, Teacher?

70
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:20,122
Since Sungyeol did this to you.

71
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:24,842
Let me know if you're hurting anywhere. We should go to the hospital.

72
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:27,292
I'm okay.

73
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,822
Are you feeling sick?

74
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,632
You don't look too well...

75
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,212
Sungyeol!

76
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:45,292
Are you feeling unwell, Sungyeol?

77
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,222
I have a headache.

78
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,292
Oh, I see...

79
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:54,052
Then, rest well.

80
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:01,142
Are you ditching, too?

81
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:04,052
You told me not to bother you.

82
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:07,182
Was Seulbi trying to talk to you again, instead of paying attention in class?

83
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,402
This girl... anytime I'm not around...

84
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:15,132
The Ethics teacher seems like a good person.

85
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:19,652
Parents usually stick up for their children, whether they were in the wrong or not.

86
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,632
I'm not her biological son.

87
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:25,812
Jerk, you're being irritable again.

88
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:28,712
She came to apologize to me in your stead.

89
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:38,172
You're too old to be whining like a child. How dare you complain about having a stepmom?

90
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,862
Ms. Gong used to say

91
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:46,712
that there's nothing better than having a mom. I don't have one, so I wouldn't know...

92
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:50,082
So treat her well.

93
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:06,182
I have a feeling you can't do anything without me around.

94
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,472
Are you feeling better?

95
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:13,362
Ah, it still hurts.

96
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,312
Really?!

97
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:17,292
Just kidding!

98
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:19,412
Hey!

99
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,862
Come here! You're dead.

100
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:28,492
- Woah!! 
 - Hey!

101
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,062
♫  I wanna be your star  ♫

102
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:34,962
♫  I want to see you several times a day  ♫

103
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:38,812
♫  I want to tell you I love you, that you're the only one  ♫

104
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:43,452
♫  By hugging you sweetly  ♫

105
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:50,612
♫   Everything will change then  ♫

106
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:56,262
♫  You've always told me  ♫

107
00:10:56,262 --> 00:11:01,142
♫  That we're just friends  ♫

108
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:05,592
♫  But from some time ago, I had a feeling  ♫

109
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:10,192
♫  You were changing towards me  ♫

110
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,742
♫  The underlying meaning  ♫

111
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:18,852
♫  Behind your touch  ♫

112
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:23,042
♫  And the things you want to know about me  ♫

113
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:26,832
♫  I'll show you  ♫

114
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:30,832
♫  If you wanna be my love  ♫

115
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:45,312
We need to buy you clothes that also covers your face.

116
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,792
Why?

117
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,752
Should I just place a mask on your face?

118
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:55,542
Let's go.

119
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,062
Do you want to die? Get out of my face.

120
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:15,892
What should I do?

121
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:17,462
Can you just get out of my sight?

122
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,762
I'll do anything.

123
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,442
I'll do whatever I can, if it'll make you feel better.

124
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,322
Why all of a sudden?

125
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,642
Being alone...

126
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,932
is difficult.

127
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,532
I'll do anything you ask!

128
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:36,982
Do everything your way.

129
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,492
I always did things my way, too.

130
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:48,332
If I show it to you, you'll accept it. Right?

131
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:57,132
Falling in love with an angel.

132
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,342
Have you ever fallen in love with a human?

133
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:00,702
Give it back!

134
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,712
Try to take it back, try to take it back.

135
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:13,492
I didn't want to rip it, but then you...

136
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,252
This wasn't my plan.

137
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,342
Seulbi!

138
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,532
This feels like deja vu.

139
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,002
How far is your limit?

140
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:23,802
How much more are you going to show me?

141
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:24,972
It wasn't me!

142
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,802
You didn't do it,

143
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,352
since you made Yena do it for you.

144
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:32,072
That's even worse.

145
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,722
She didn't get hurt, right?

146
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:52,622
Maybe I shouldn't have used my powers. People might suspect something.

147
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,892
Why are you doing things I never told you to do?

148
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,822
You wanted me to show you.

149
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:03,612
You were also bothered by Seulbi because of Sungyeol.

150
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:06,862
I know how you feel since Woohyun isn't returning my feelings.

151
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:16,172
I'm only going to say this once, so listen well.

152
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:20,532
I am never going to look at you, forever.

153
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:24,832
Woohyun!

154
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,502
I am also going to say this once.

155
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:30,182
Don't ever come near me, ever again.

156
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,422
Are you starting to fall for Lee Seulbi or something?

157
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:56,872
I definitely saw it.

158
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,272
Stopping in midair for a second at the stairs...

159
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,542
It's super fascinating.

160
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,992
Hey, you are eating again?

161
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,062
I thought you were going to audition again.

162
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:10,002
I am auditioning to be a comedian, so it's all right.

163
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:16,062
Are you sure you're not hurt anywhere?

164
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:19,412
Yes, I'm okay. You?

165
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,012
This time, it was me and not Hwang Sungyeol who caught you.

166
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,202
Just like fate.

167
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:26,122
Thank you.

168
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,902
  Seulbi!

169
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,702
It was weird.

170
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:54,802
She definitely...

171
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:57,412
 Hey, are you messing around with us?

172
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:04,462
You didn't bring Chunsik and came alone again?

173
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:13,982
I see you brought Sungyeol instead of Chunsik.

174
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,922
I will sell an item and give the money to you tomorrow.

175
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,972
So please let me go.

176
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,752
You're a hostage right now.

177
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:23,272
Chunsik has to come so that you can go.

178
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,642
Go.

179
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:29,032
Hey, where do you think you're going?

180
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:31,442
You have to go somewhere with us.

181
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:35,732
There's no better evidence for school violence than a video.

182
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,682
Think of the days you were a tadpole.
 (T/N: Don't forget your past)

183
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,612
I have to relieve this stress.

184
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,402
Let's go.

185
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:05,642
Isn't it weird that he's always letting Sungyeol off?

186
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:07,772
Did they date before?

187
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:10,492
Tadpole...

188
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:13,792
Let's dig into Jaeseok's past.

189
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,602
Welcome!

190
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,882
Your order came out.

191
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:21,212
Enjoy.

192
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,432
 Oh, nice!

193
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,032
You have to catch it.

194
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:35,292
Hey!

195
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,542
Hey! Pass! Pass!

196
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,652
What are you guys doing?

197
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:45,362
I was feeling crappy and couldn't find a place to exercise.

198
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:47,822
I mean, your friend Sungyeol

199
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:50,602
keeps upsetting my friend, Jaeseok.

200
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:53,052
You guys really!

201
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:55,842
Oh! There's something I saw earlier.

202
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,572
Show me your skill!

203
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,942
Please enjoy it.

204
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,542
Big Brother!

205
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,962
- Where is your sister? 
 - She's not here yet.

206
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:17,392
Oh, really?

207
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:28,432
Look, you're a mess.

208
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:32,912
But is your sister scary at home as well?

209
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,482
My sister is funny.

210
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,982
She does a lot of gags

211
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,142
and dances. It's really funny.

212
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:43,002
No way! You must've been dreaming.

213
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:46,072
What about your mom?

214
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,792
Because of work, she's always late.

215
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,692
They say dad is having an affair.

216
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:54,132
Dang. Sublimating your pain like this at such a young age.

217
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,212
No, I bought it for her because she's cute.

218
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,792
And I'm giving it because you're cute,

219
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:15,412
so accept it and get lost.

220
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:31,752
Promise me.

221
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:33,372
If I win, you'll leave quietly.

222
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,962
What if you lose? Are you going to place Lee Seulbi as your bet?

223
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,912
I'll bet my life.

224
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:40,312
There's no me if Seulbi isn't here (with me).

225
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:58,432
Shin Woohyun, you're the best!

226
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:04,232
One more time!

227
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:38,212
By chance, if they suspect you again...

228
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:41,092
Suspect what? I haven't done anything wrong.

229
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:46,302
Oh, yeah... They're always bored so that's why they suspect and bother you.

230
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:50,462
Don't worry! I'm not afraid of guys like Jaeseok.

231
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:59,502
They'll wear out before you even get to use them.

232
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:03,042
If we continue to earn money, we'll be able to regain the store. Right?

233
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:07,492
My goodness!  Since when has our Seulbi been a good housewife?

234
00:23:07,492 --> 00:23:11,692
My goodness! Since when was Our Puppy so cheesy?

235
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,242
Are you going somewhere?

236
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:18,232
I am going to stay at Woohyun's place for a couple of days.

237
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:20,532
- Why? 
 - There aren't any adults around,

238
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,212
and just in case a robber breaks in.

239
00:24:24,702 --> 00:24:28,062
Do you... like Seulbi?

240
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:35,972
I'm sorry for getting mad at school.

241
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,092
Don't be sorry in my stead from now on.

242
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,602
All right.

243
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,462
And please...

244
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,242
pack more side dishes.

245
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:58,482
Woohyun likes them.

246
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:02,242
Woohyun...

247
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,542
Okay, I got it.

248
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,272
Thank you.

249
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,212
I'm the one who's thankful.

250
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:24,902
Where can I stay?

251
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,392
Get out!

252
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,132
You're not leaving?!

253
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:29,342
Why are you being like this between us?

254
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:30,432
Give it to me.

255
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:31,612
I said get out!

256
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:33,132
It's a tie!

257
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:36,012
There's no such thing. This is our house.

258
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,522
Here it is, the lodging fee.

259
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:41,802
Wow, you shameless jerk.

260
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:43,722
Since when have you been this shameless?

261
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:45,672
Ever since I met you.

262
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:48,572
You're here to keep an eye on me and Seulbi, right?

263
00:25:48,572 --> 00:25:50,572
You pervert.

264
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,912
You two hold each other real tight when you sleep!

265
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,562
Hey!

266
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:55,822
Geez!

267
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:58,472
Seriously.

268
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,332
I thought I packed everything,

269
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:36,372
but there was something I forgot.

270
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,912
Are you not hungry?

271
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:43,602
Should I make a ddeokbokki that'll totally make you feel happy?

272
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,852
Spicy? Sweet?

273
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:47,822
Spicy and sweet?

274
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:51,182
I guess you do worry about me.

275
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:53,282
Of course, that's what friends are for.

276
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:56,542
If we don't hurry up, Woohyun will nag at us. Let's go.

277
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:04,562
We're closed.

278
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:09,232
Woohyun.

279
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:14,982
Can't you see the lights are off? (We're closed.)

280
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:16,912
I have something to say.

281
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:19,962
I don't want to hear it, leave.

282
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:22,392
I'm sorry, I did wrong.

283
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,552
You should apologize to Seulbi, not me.

284
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:29,142
- To you, I— 
 - I don't care how much you bother me,

285
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:31,442
just don't mess with Seulbi.

286
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:36,702
I'm sorry! I shouldn't have done that!

287
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,902
I don't like the person I am right now either,

288
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:45,942
but I tried everything to forget about you and nothing's working. What more do you expect from me?

289
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,242
Please, Woohyun,

290
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:52,452
just for a second...

291
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:59,052
Why aren't you going in?

292
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,332
Don't look.

293
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,462
Just look at me.

294
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,082
- Seulbi! 
 - Don't go!

295
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:24,012
If you go, I'll kill myself!

296
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,632
Do whatever you want!

297
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:27,942
Don't use your life to beg in front of me.

298
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,942
Seulbi!

299
00:28:32,782 --> 00:28:34,732
Seulbi!

300
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:36,782
Lee Seulbi!

301
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,742
It's a misunderstanding.

302
00:28:41,742 --> 00:28:43,712
That's right, a misunderstanding.

303
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:48,162
In dramas, they're always misunderstanding each other and in pain.

304
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:50,642
I'm not going to do those things.

305
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:59,912
You trust Woohyun that much?

306
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:05,532
Is there no spot for me to go in?

307
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:25,602
Lee Dayool?

308
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:30,422
Seulbi, it's not what you think.

309
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:35,522
Hey, didn't we agree to believe in each other no matter what?

310
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:37,462
Did I say anything?

311
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:41,422
What is that expression of "I'll never believe in you?"

312
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:44,302
- It's not. 
 - Then, what is it?

313
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,772
I'm just in a bad mood.

314
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:54,092
Is she being jealous right now?

315
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,772
Cute. She even knows how to get jealous?

316
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:08,612
Oh my god, that childish jerk. How dare he...

317
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:19,482
I'm letting it go.

318
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:28,722
But he probably didn't notice anything about Seulbi, right?

319
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:36,142
I'm sleeping with the enemy. Seriously, why did you come?

320
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:38,702
It's a fair opportunity.

321
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,932
You're so childish. Do you think being like this will get Seulbi—

322
00:30:40,932 --> 00:30:43,502
You have to wait and see how it turns out.

323
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:46,732
Without waiting and seeing, I know with one glance...

324
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:53,912
Did you... confess?

325
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,342
Why does it have to be Seulbi?

326
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:59,842
A lot of girls like you.

327
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:03,082
The one I like is Seulbi.

328
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:05,592
Your nosiness pierces the sky, and every day, with her strange thoughts,

329
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:08,382
she's always causing trouble and she eats too much.

330
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:09,672
Then, why don't you give up?

331
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:11,152
You have to listen until I finish speaking.

332
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:14,172
Regardless of everything, it's Seulbi for me.

333
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,992
You give up.

334
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:19,022
Let's go until the end.

335
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:21,642
You have your mom and dad.

336
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:24,542
Why are you bringing them up?

337
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:27,032
I only have Seulbi.

338
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:33,382
I want to be friends with you till the end.

339
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,532
That...

340
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:52,232
Did Seulbi give that to you?

341
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:53,892
Yeah.

342
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:58,812
Seulbi found it for me.

343
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,442
It's the only item left behind by my mother.

344
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:03,152
It was yours, not Seulbi's?

345
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:06,342
Mine's a key, and my mom's is a lock.

346
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:09,452
I was told, with this, we're always together no matter how far apart we are.

347
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:12,312
Isn't that funny?

348
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:16,162
It was all a lie.

349
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:22,462
Let's sleep.

350
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:25,402
Let me study.

351
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:29,102
Go do it at your house!

352
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:31,302
I also suggest you come over to our house.

353
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:34,172
Ah, you petty pervert.

354
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:36,642
And I call a person like you a friend.

355
00:33:46,062 --> 00:33:49,862
- Sungyeol... 
 - Today was a really hard day for me.

356
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,582
My face was in so much pain

357
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:55,632
from trying to pretend I didn't see you

358
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:58,292
and trying not to laugh when you laughed.

359
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:05,572
It's easier said than done...

360
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,412
trying to avoid you.

361
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:16,402
They say a human's love always changes.

362
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:22,202
But my love is not going to change,

363
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:25,342
so don't wait.

364
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:31,002
To both me and Woohyun,

365
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,782
you're a really good friend.

366
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,062
Saying that I'm just a friend

367
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:48,442
can really hurt.

368
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,952
Why are you doing this?

369
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,542
What do you mean by "transference?"

370
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:09,472
Please quiet down.

371
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:12,052
Why is everyone so irresponsible?

372
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:14,902
I'm already struggling because Teacher Kwangshik isn't here.

373
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:18,132
Then, who'll give educational guidance to the students?

374
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:20,312
Ah, I'll be doing it.

375
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:23,492
Why? Because I'm Superman, Batman, Aquaman,

376
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:26,762
and Ironman. Yes, I will do them all.

377
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:46,692
Did you not sleep well?

378
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:48,672
You don't look well.

379
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:55,202
Are you uncomfortable because of me?

380
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:57,332
No.

381
00:35:57,332 --> 00:35:59,822
You must be uncomfortable because of me.

382
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:04,612
If it's because of me, please don't transfer.

383
00:36:07,062 --> 00:36:10,522
Instead,

384
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:13,572
please transfer me to another school.

385
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,302
Why so suddenly?

386
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:21,382
Just because. I don't like this school anymore.

387
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:27,222
Is it because of Seulbi?

388
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:37,232
Liking a person became something to feel sorry for.

389
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:44,002
A person who can't be loved

390
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,482
becomes a burden to that person.

391
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:57,022
I really hope that you won't get hurt.

392
00:37:04,862 --> 00:37:07,402
♫  Well, I put you in a trance, ♫

393
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:16,022
Why are you dancing like a balloon figurine at an event?

394
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:17,852
You better dance properly.

395
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:21,052
Fill your dance with some feelings.

396
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:24,772
Chunsik, look at this.

397
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:38,172
♫  So dance, while I put you in a trance  ♫

398
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,102
♫  To the rhythm, to the rhythm  ♫

399
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,012
What are you doing?

400
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:56,502
Looks like you've been humiliated for good.

401
00:38:02,772 --> 00:38:04,812
What is this? Dance time?

402
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,742
If you're going to dance, you should do it like this.

403
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:12,102
Kisoo!

404
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:13,222
Me?

405
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:20,132
Next up is Lee Suk Hoon!

406
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,742
Oh yeah!

407
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:37,802
One, two...

408
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,632
One, two, three, four!

409
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,302
Hey!

410
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,702
Hey!

411
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,262
Hey!

412
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:54,982
Hey!

413
00:38:56,592 --> 00:38:58,392
Hey!

414
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:02,132
Hey!

415
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,692
Hey!

416
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:09,352
Hey!

417
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,442
Hey!

418
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,332
Dang, Woohyun is even good at dancing!

419
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:17,702
Where in the world did he learn that?

420
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:22,372
A way to mess with Shin Woohyun? Seulbi?

421
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:25,492
Lee Seulbi...

422
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:28,922
Don't you find her weird?

423
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:31,432
I really saw her freeze in midair.

424
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:33,212
You're talking about that again?

425
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:34,972
My god.

426
00:39:36,202 --> 00:39:38,972
Now that I think about it, she always looks at you right in the eye.

427
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,962
Yeah.

428
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:47,142
We just need to find out what it is then.

429
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,332
Are your auditions going well?

430
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:00,272
Do you think I'm easy?

431
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,152
You're a silent outsider. 
  (T/N: Eun tha - shortened for quietly getting left out.)

432
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:06,982
If you talk to me like this, I'll be put in a difficult position.

433
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:12,082
I guess they hold auditions in places like these lately.

434
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:13,482
Hey—

435
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:18,412
The literature teacher called me, so I'll be leaving.

436
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:20,732
What is it that you want?

437
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:26,922
Now, let me know what you found out so far.

438
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:28,342
Were there any kids who've been fighting?

439
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,132
No, there aren't any.

440
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:31,382
There aren't any. None.

441
00:40:31,382 --> 00:40:32,282
None.

442
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:36,762
Then, how about couples other than Lee Seulbi and Shin Woohyun?

443
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:38,182
They aren't a couple!

444
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:43,362
They're a couple! Woohyun even wrote a poem of dedication for Seulbi.

445
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:46,432
Hyunjung? Who's that?

446
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:51,172
Dedicate, dedicate, give, dedicate, dedicate!

447
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,132
You're driving me crazy.

448
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,762
Any other unusual things going on?

449
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,562
I heard there are some students going to some shady places.

450
00:40:59,562 --> 00:41:03,392
Shady places? Who?

451
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:05,322
I don't know that much yet.

452
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:12,302
A shady place. Just wait till I catch them. I will make sure they regret it.

453
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:24,782
 There's a meeting. Rookie, if you're absent, there'll be a penalty. If you're late, a penalty. 6:00 p.m. SkyHigh restaurant.

454
00:41:25,742 --> 00:41:27,302
I need to go somewhere.

455
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:29,002
Where? Let's go together.

456
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:32,072
No, I'll go by myself really quick, and head to the store after.

457
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,252
See you later.

458
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:34,982
Hey!

459
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:38,442
It's just us two again.

460
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:40,532
Hey, wait for me!

461
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:50,702
It's weird.

462
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:55,312
Seulbi will call!

463
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:58,192
Why doesn't it work?

464
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,962
You made a good decision.

465
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:06,482
Although you eat at different places, Ms. Gong said to sleep at one place.

466
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:11,342
I'm going to come often to eat and sleepover whenever I want to. Be anxious.

467
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,442
Is this place a rest stop?

468
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,382
Seulbi's not back yet?

469
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:16,392
I'll send her your regards.

470
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:18,592
Okay, you can go now.

471
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:20,232
Hurry up and go.

472
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,902
Oh!

473
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:49,252
There were so many suspicious humans, so I changed the location.

474
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:52,432
Operation 007. You can think of it like that.

475
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:55,902
Are there humans that notice us?

476
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:59,992
I'll say this again, but we can't get caught ever.

477
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:03,542
You can't acknowledge it with your own mouth either. Prevaricate no matter what.

478
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:11,682
Were you the one who saved me at school?

479
00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:15,172
Oh, that. I had no choice.

480
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:19,032
It was an emergency and you're under special care right now.

481
00:43:24,442 --> 00:43:27,762
The people here are all angels who have become humans.

482
00:43:27,762 --> 00:43:31,982
So the marks on their wrists are the times they have left to live as humans.

483
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:45,102
Usually, we are the only ones who can see these markings, but yours will be different.

484
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,102
Humans will be able to see it.

485
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,862
I'll get one, too?

486
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:51,302
Why is only mine visible (to humans)?

487
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:53,142
Were you clear when you made your decisions?

488
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:56,192
You swore yourself to be an angel, then returned the black note.

489
00:43:56,192 --> 00:43:58,522
I guess it got a bit confusing since you kept changing your mind.

490
00:43:58,522 --> 00:44:01,162
Think of it as your punishment.

491
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:09,002
Memorize everything that is in here.

492
00:44:09,002 --> 00:44:10,912
There's going to be a test.

493
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:16,982
Either way, a human's life is filled with tests.

494
00:44:16,982 --> 00:44:20,552
Something like the humans' work-study? Think of it like that.

495
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:22,622
Who's that mister?

496
00:44:22,622 --> 00:44:25,162
Hey, is that possibly a money envelope?

497
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,142
Then, is she getting paid to sleep with him?

498
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:30,412
This is bigger than her being an alien and having supernatural powers.

499
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:45,642
Look!  The marking appeared, right?

500
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:48,992
You'll only become a human if you don't get caught for a year from this point.

501
00:44:48,992 --> 00:44:53,872
If you receive suspicion, it'll become clearer. When you're in danger, it'll blink.

502
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:57,792
Only if you protect and endure it, will you become a human.

503
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:13,042
Are you bored again? Hurry and go to sleep.

504
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:18,392
 I heard your girlfriend had supernatural powers so I looked into it, but it seems like she had other powers.

505
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:29,972
Teacher Kwangshik! It's so lonely trying to do this by myself. What is this?!

506
00:45:30,002 --> 00:45:33,622
♫  You are not alone~   ♫

507
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:41,262
Damn it. Where did you go?! ♫  You are not—  ♫

508
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:46,202
Nice catch!

509
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,922
- Give it to me! 
 - We'll give it to you if you show us your hidden powers.

510
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:50,662
Show it to us.

511
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:54,892
I want to see this, too. What did you say she does?

512
00:45:54,942 --> 00:45:56,542
What relationship do you have with Seulbi?

513
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:58,622
Huh? With Seulbi?

514
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:03,662
Uh.. that is...

515
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,732
Jerk. How dare you touch my girlfriend's things?

516
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:14,472
Little punks. Because of humans like you,

517
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:19,352
my lifespan is decreasing. I won't be able to live my life to the fullest like this.

518
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:22,942
 Oh my! I dropped my books.

519
00:46:22,942 --> 00:46:26,582
 Your silence will protect your love.

520
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:28,332
Little punks...

521
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:33,102
Don't overdo yourself. I'm a bit busy, so I'm going to leave.

522
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,432
Everybody, all stop!

523
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:39,202
What are you guys doing there?

524
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:41,862
- Run! 
 - Hey! Hey hey hey!

525
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:45,522
- Hey, what are you doing? 
 - I love you, Teacher. 
 - Oh, I see.

526
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:48,072
- What is this? 
 - Let me know if you ever get hungry.

527
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:51,002
Oh, okay. Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

528
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:53,752
Hey! The ddeokbokgi looks good.

529
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:56,412
I'll see you at school! You guys are all dead!

530
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:01,762
♫  You are not alone~  ♫

531
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:07,842
- That person earlier... He's a good person, right? 
 - Huh?

532
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:09,132
Oh... yeah...

533
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:12,932
I hope you will only be surrounded by good people.

534
00:47:12,972 --> 00:47:18,592
 Woohyun, you know I'm different from everyone, right?

535
00:47:18,612 --> 00:47:22,072
 I'm afraid you'll disappear like the light, after shining so brightly.

536
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:25,602
 So I... will pretend like I don't know anything.

537
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:41,022
Because it seemed like I wasn't able to spend more time with you lately.

538
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,412
Why didn't you call Sungyeol out?

539
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:47,962
I knew you'd ask, so I "left" something behind on purpose.

540
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:59,132
Oh, Sungyeol! I left my wallet at home.

541
00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:02,492
Yes, hold on a sec.

542
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:04,082
In the drawer...

543
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,842
It's not here.

544
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:12,072
Ah, in the bedroom? Hold on, I'll head over after I find it.

545
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:17,112
Sungyeol wanted to transfer?

546
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:18,632
Why so suddenly?

547
00:48:18,632 --> 00:48:21,202
I guess he's uncomfortable around me.

548
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:26,582
I thought he was doing well since he's been getting along with Woohyun.

549
00:48:26,582 --> 00:48:29,202
Are you sure he wasn't just kidding?

550
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:35,272
I can't get in touch with Woohyun's father.

551
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:39,092
I think it'll be better to look for his mother instead.

552
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,322
Oh my.

553
00:48:43,322 --> 00:48:45,962
Are you okay?

554
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,222
If you find her,

555
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:53,532
it might be worse for the child. Just let her be.

556
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:58,952
I don't know if it's because he's Sungyeol's friend, but Woohyun is like a son to me.

557
00:48:58,982 --> 00:49:01,972
How is Woohyun your son?

558
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:06,242

559
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,862
Sorry.

560
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:12,602
I had a tiring day at work so I'm a bit sensitive.

561
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:19,092
Honey, you thought of your son in America, didn't you?

562
00:49:23,622 --> 00:49:25,802
I'm sorry.

563
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:28,642
I can't do anything for you.

564
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:32,582
- Why don't you tell him to come to Korea? 
 - Honey, I'm tired.

565
00:49:32,582 --> 00:49:34,652
Let's leave.

566
00:49:47,102 --> 00:49:48,982
It was here.

567
00:49:59,932 --> 00:50:02,332
 Mine's a key, and my mom's is a lock.

568
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:05,042
 It's the only item left behind by my mother.

569
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:52,072
If a human who's suspicious about you touches the marking,

570
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:55,052
you will not exist in any world

571
00:50:55,622 --> 00:50:58,392
and will be erased from the humans' memories forever.

572
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:03,422
That means Woohyun won't remember me?

573
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,792
Where's Woohyun?

574
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:15,102
He went to wash up.

575
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:25,082
♫  No matter what hardships come  ♫

576
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:30,282
♫  I can't see anything else but you  ♫

577
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:02,672
What are you doing in someone else's room?

578
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:10,932
You look like you've just been caught stealing. What's going on?

579
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,032
What were you trying to steal? Hurry, and tell me.

580
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,442
You...

581
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:22,022
What's the matter? Why are you like this?

582
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:23,862
Stay back.

583
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:25,902
Don't come any closer!

584
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:29,612

585
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:38,122
♫  Friday feeling deep inside you. 
You seem different for some reason  ♫

586
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,122
 Please help Woohyun find his mother.

587
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:43,582
 You're looking for this, right? Why is it Woohyun of all people?

588
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:46,462
 Why is he acting like that lately? Did he start his puberty late?

589
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:49,672
 I told you not to touch me.

590
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:52,882
 Getting paid to sleep with men. There are strange rumors going around.

591
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:54,922
 Who is Lee Seulbi? (What's her secret?)

592
00:52:54,922 --> 00:53:00,062
 Your girlfriend is with Sungyeol right now, and they looked intimate. It's worth seeing.

593
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:02,472
 Today, you...

594
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:04,442
 lost me (as a friend).
