1
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:19,417
Sungyeol!

2
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,607
What?  Are you sleepy?

3
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:57,367
No!

4
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:10,237
Seulbi! Seulbi!

5
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:19,727
Sungyeol!  Hwang Sungyeol!

6
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:23,867
 Sungyeol!  Hwang Sungyeol!

7
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,687
 Sungyeol!

8
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,757
Sungyeol!

9
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,887
Sungyeol!

10
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:45,897

11
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:00,507
Are you really okay?

12
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:07,647
This punk must be making up for all the sleep he missed all this time.

13
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,607
He's sleeping a long time.

14
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:28,347
♫  I’m walking on the street    ♫

15
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:33,497
♫  As I hold your hand   ♫

16
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:43,197
♫  Following the river that sparkles with the sun   ♫

17
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:52,667
♫  Your scent that touches the tip of my nose...   ♫

18
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:01,247
Sungyeol, are you okay?

19
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:03,967
Are you back to your senses?

20
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,867
Sungyeol?

21
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:26,877
Hwang Sungyeol, are you okay?

22
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:39,527
Why did you endure it until this happened? You should contact us if you're sick. Why did you endure it alone?!

23
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,567
Are you really okay?

24
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:52,177
Oh, okay.  Thank God.

25
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:56,097
It's a relief.  It's a relief.

26
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,977
Thank you, Woohyun.

27
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:14,197
 To human beings, mothers are people who first

28
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:17,437
 feel pain for you, first laugh for you, and first cry for you.

29
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:23,597
 That you have a mother means that everything will be okay very soon.

30
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,357
Because I wasn't in my right mind.

31
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:38,067
You wear them. The wind outside is cold.

32
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,387
It's okay.

33
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:42,397
But still...

34
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,457
Teacher,

35
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,837
it's a relief you're a good person.

36
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:16,267
I wish I could be sick instead of you.

37
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:22,767
Sungyeol, let's stop it now and get up.

38
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,397
I'm lonely, too, you punk.

39
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:44,517

40
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,797
You should rest more.

41
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:43,157
What's that?  Divorce?

42
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:48,077
Mister and Teacher are getting divorced?

43
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:50,627
I think it's because of me.

44
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:53,327
The two of them looked good (together).

45
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:59,137
I saw it in a drama, but they say that this kind of paper has no strength before love.

46
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:00,797
Really?

47
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,337
Let's look for a way.

48
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,967
But why aren't you going when I told you to go?

49
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,577
I want to find your smile for you before I go.

50
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:13,467
So until your hurt heals, I'll stay next to you.

51
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:16,187
If you want to send me away sooner, get better quickly.

52
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:20,607
We're going to find a way for all of us to be happy together, with the smart one, you.

53
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:25,687
That's right, you. The thing that Woohyun and I wanted to see the most.

54
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:38,247
What you want is for Seulbi to disappear? Is that right?

55
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,397
Everything that happened was because of Seulbi.

56
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:45,937
Why is your not knowing how to make friends and not being able to win the hearts of your friends Seulbi's fault?

57
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,607
I don't need any friends.

58
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:53,427
The kind of punk that is so interested in other people's business doesn't need friends?

59
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:56,337
Even you bothering the kids, doesn't it mean that you want to be friends?

60
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:59,067
- No. 
 - No?

61
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,707
Then live alone like that for the rest of your life.

62
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,537
Then no one will pay attention to the likes of you.

63
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:10,587
Seulbi worried that you'd be in pain, too.

64
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:13,357
So I'm asking you to protect Seulbi.

65
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:15,917
I'm asking you sincerely.

66
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:24,997
If you don't even have Seulbi, you'll be alone forever.

67
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:55,807
Are you okay?

68
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,357
I came because I'm okay.

69
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:01,427
After working so hard to save you, is speaking prettily so hard?

70
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,647
You're fighting again.

71
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,767
So childish.

72
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:11,587
You're the very one who can't be followed when it comes to being childish.

73
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:13,467
Ow!  Hey, hey!

74
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:30,157
When everyone else is wearing it, you should be a little more sensitive to trends.

75
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:42,337
I tied it tightly so you absolutely won't be able to untie it.

76
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,057
Teacher and Dad...

77
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,807
I think they're thinking of getting a divorce.

78
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:02,077
I'll convince Dad, you convince Teacher.

79
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:04,217
Isn't it what you wanted?

80
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:09,017
You... I'm going to report the both of you.

81
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:10,457
To whom?

82
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:12,887
Is there any other policeman I know besides Mister?

83
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:16,187
I'm going to report to him that you two are doing this kind of thing to me.

84
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:18,427
I'll leave that favor to you.

85
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,897
Hey!

86
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:22,587
That isn't how you ask for a favor.

87
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,467
Then how?

88
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:28,667
Politely; completely nicely and prettily.

89
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,677
You have to do it earnestly. Watch well.

90
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:38,447
"Friend, I have a favor to ask of you.  Please, I beg you."  Like that...

91
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:43,157
Hey! Hey! I was talking...

92
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:10,547

93
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,437
How are you feeling?

94
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,667
I'm fine.

95
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:47,627
If you're sick again, call me and don't endure it alone again.

96
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:49,547
Dad...

97
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:54,367
He doesn't call first or apologize first well.

98
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:58,647
He's short-tempered, so he says things he doesn't mean when he gets angry.

99
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:04,617
So, Teacher, it's okay for you to call him first.

100
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:16,777
Okay, today, we're going to have some free time activity...

101
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:18,787
Hey...

102
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,317
Wh-What are those things?

103
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:25,247
Hey, are you protesting something all together? Huh?

104
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:26,897
Everyone, take it off.

105
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:30,247
Oh, this is weird.

106
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,887
Seulbi, come here.

107
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,467
Right now, hurry.

108
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:40,877
Come here.

109
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:45,917
Teach, this is a new fashion trend.

110
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,777
"We are one," something like that?

111
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,187
Oh, really.

112
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,417
We're only doing this for you especially so you can't lose it.

113
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,047
Is that so?

114
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,197
Wow, I'm strong with trends, but why didn't I know about this? When did this get popular?

115
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:02,397
We love you so much, Teacher. Teacher, we love you.

116
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:04,397
Oh, really.  Oh, really.

117
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:07,407
I... I love you, too.

118
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,937
Hey!  We are one!

119
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:14,097
We are one.  Thanks. Go back. Go back.

120
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:16,497
There must be a way.

121
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,187
Hey.

122
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:24,827
Did you forget that you asked me earlier with empty hands?

123
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,697
You're going to just be still like that?

124
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:30,697
Come this way.

125
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:35,367
If they don't have the surgery fee, that young child...

126
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,837
We can help.

127
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,857
I can help, too.

128
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:44,077
I have $3. This won't even be enough for taxi fare much less surgery money.

129
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:47,547
Hey, there are ways for us to make use of.

130
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:50,417
I will make (find) a way.

131
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,807
You're confident, right?

132
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:06,257

133
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:14,107
So why didn't you live a little nicer?

134
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:18,997
You only bothered people without reason. Look at the likes of you now!

135
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:25,857
If you're scared because you're different than other people, then you can become like them.

136
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:34,177
What about me is so different?

137
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:35,917
You can be different.

138
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:40,997
The best way to stop being a loner is to just stay next to someone.

139
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:44,437
So that you can feel that you're not alone and that you are one of us.

140
00:15:57,677 --> 00:16:00,217
Tightly, pull it! Pull it!

141
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:01,627
- More, more.

142
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,477
That's right.  Okay.

143
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:13,137
On a day like this, he should come and help us. He's really no help.

144
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:20,057
Who might you be waiting for so earnestly?

145
00:16:29,257 --> 00:16:31,807
I heard that you're Cheonguk High School's Top Dog.

146
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:36,227
Do you choose the best by loser ranking?

147
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:39,037
Let's see your skills?

148
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:47,227
It's correct that he's the top dog.

149
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,307
Top dogs these days don't use their fists and

150
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,127
use their heads.

151
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:02,877
We use our fists.

152
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,737
What should we do?

153
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,847
Shall we see your skills?

154
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:12,767
Give us one order of tempura over here!

155
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,037
Okay.

156
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:19,027
If you see my mom, tell her you absolutely didn't see me.

157
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,107
I skipped golf and

158
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:25,257
this is the money that my mom saved to buy a bag.

159
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,147
Are you saying you stole it?

160
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:31,647
Well... it's not that I stole it.

161
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:35,327
Oh, hey. Won't you let go?

162
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:37,297
What are you doing?

163
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:41,147
My Match! I brought a strong punk.

164
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:45,607
Can't you see how busy it is? You should help some.

165
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:47,917
- Let's go. 
 - Hurry up and work.

166
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:04,497
Over here! Give us some ddeokbokki!

167
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:11,627
Hey, good work everyone.  Thanks, really.

168
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:16,757
You disloyal things! Why are only you doing such a good thing?

169
00:18:16,757 --> 00:18:19,067
My goodness, you pretty things!  You pretty things.

170
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,837
Teacher!

171
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:26,237
Here. It's what the teachers saved a little between us.

172
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:28,677
I hope it helps.

173
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,767
Thank you.

174
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,147
I put a lot in.

175
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,597
It's true.

176
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,057
Did you come here to show off your money again?

177
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:53,077
Get lost.

178
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:55,017
That's not it.

179
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,237
It's what we saved working the business.

180
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,007
Are you going to leave Hyeeun like that?

181
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,507
Who are you?

182
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:03,667
Why are you pitying us? We don't need it.

183
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,317
I'm sorry.  I was wrong.

184
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,097
So, can't you take this?

185
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,997
With this, can't you save your sister and me, too?

186
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,047
Be quiet.

187
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:19,807
I didn't even know that you had a younger sister.

188
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:23,177
I don't even know your younger sister's face.

189
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,197
I want to see your sister, too.

190
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:27,397
Why do you want to see my sister?!

191
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:30,527
Because she's your younger sister!

192
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:39,857
There's more but I'm sorry for not knowing anything.

193
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:44,787
I'm sorry for pretending to throw you away.

194
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:48,927
No...

195
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,067
I'm more sorry.

196
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,697
No, I'm really sorry.

197
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:59,167
No, you bitch, I'm really sorry.

198
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:20,837
What was my father like?

199
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,247
He was a good man.

200
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:29,797
Then, why did you get divorced?

201
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,487
I didn't know back then.

202
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,887
I looked at his bad side,

203
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,587
instead of looking at his good side.

204
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:49,497
He just wanted to rely on me, but...

205
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:54,207
I guess I wanted just to rely on him, too.

206
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:57,247
It would've been good if you guys relied on each other.

207
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,297
Right.

208
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,597
I didn't know that.

209
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,317
So don't regret it twice.

210
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:11,757
Mister has a dangerous job, and is sometimes a bit blunt,

211
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:12,967
and he gets mad easily sometimes.

212
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:16,607
Those things bother me, but he is tall and good-looking.

213
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:20,517
He looked like a good man who you can rely on.

214
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,297
Woohyun.

215
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,657
Take this.

216
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,927
I met you now...

217
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:47,957
and I can see you anytime, I am happy with that.

218
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:52,457
Give this to someone you love.

219
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:55,517
This will make the miracle where you will definitely

220
00:21:55,517 --> 00:22:02,287
meet that someone even if you're far away.

221
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:27,997

222
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:56,797
Aren't you tired?

223
00:22:56,797 --> 00:23:01,507
Being able to help someone makes me happy.

224
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:07,587
And I'm happy that I can do that with the people I like.

225
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,677
 You really are an angel, aren't you?

226
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:17,407
Let's think about a plan to make your dad come back on the Ethics teacher's birthday.

227
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,997
I'm tired from working hard...

228
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:24,577
Are you hurt? Do you need some medicine?

229
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:27,417
I think going outside for a bit will help it.

230
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:32,187
Let's hang out tomorrow and think about it. With that bastard, too.

231
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,117
Should we?

232
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:52,287
Let's go!

233
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,107
- Hey, aren't you going to untie it? 
 - You untie it!

234
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,917
Catch me!

235
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:45,537
Hey! Untie it!

236
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,617
Why? You're going to kiss me or something?

237
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,087
You're pretty smart.

238
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:56,237
Come here.

239
00:25:58,217 --> 00:25:59,667
Ouch.

240
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:03,197
Well, it's not embarrassing since we're not in a shower room.

241
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,287
It's more embarrassing!

242
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:07,877
Untie it.

243
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,087
Hey.

244
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:12,807
Come here.

245
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,667
Thanks.  We'll drink it happily.

246
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:26,557
- Free things are always good. 
 - I agree.

247
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,717
This is repayment for the ddeokbokki you bought last time.

248
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:31,167
Hey, that's more expensive than just this!

249
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,607
I paid for the cab, too!

250
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:36,607
If I have to say, I paid 2,300 won more than what you paid!

251
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:37,887
How smart.

252
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:41,127
Hey, this is not being smart. This is being mean!

253
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:43,517
- Meanie! 
 - What? Mean!

254
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:46,807
Oh, so he is mean. Humans' language is hard.

255
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:50,427
Mean! Meanie, meanie, meanie!

256
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:52,837
Hey, I'm going to kill you!

257
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:07,377
 Woohyun, I guess I am glad that you are my friend.

258
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:13,007
 Maybe having the same mother is fate.

259
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:16,027
 I'm sorry I didn't let you call her "mom."

260
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:19,877
 You can call her "mom," now.

261
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:23,497
 Also, please take care of my father.

262
00:27:26,297 --> 00:27:28,417
Sungyeol! Sungyeol!

263
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:30,867
Okay.

264
00:27:47,387 --> 00:27:50,437
That means you get this letter in a year, not in an instant.

265
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,907
That's really interesting and romantic.

266
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,467
Hey, if you're going to confess, do it now. Not a year later.

267
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,367
What's the meaning of it if you say it a year later when you can't say it now?

268
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,517
Hey, Hwang Sungyeol!

269
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:02,207
What are you doing so passionately?

270
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:04,627
- It's a secret. 
 - A secret?

271
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,737
That makes me more curious! Hey, wait!

272
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:08,877
Hey, let me see it!

273
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:12,167
Wow... So mean.

274
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:15,527
Mine's a love letter!

275
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,247
Is it for me? Let me see!

276
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:20,117
Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

277
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:23,087
Seriously, guys?

278
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,617
Going to be this way?  It's over.

279
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:36,797
She didn't fall asleep in the bathroom, did she?

280
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:42,057
She's still okay. I don't think she fell asleep.

281
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:44,837
- How do you know? 
 - There's a way to know it.

282
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:47,627
If Seulbi is sick, I am too.

283
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:49,527
That's how we are.

284
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:56,617
It's not just you who feels sorry. I feel sorry for you, too.

285
00:28:56,617 --> 00:29:00,127
So don't make that face. I don't want to see it.

286
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,867
So you're back?

287
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,247
If I ever left.

288
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:10,697
I was always there. It was you guys who ran away.

289
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:13,207
Wow. You're shameless, too.

290
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:17,167
Hey, tomorrow is Ethics Teacher's birthday. Make Mister come back.

291
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:22,537
I'm here.

292
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,827
Let's take a picture.

293
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:29,787
Hey. I don't like taking pictures, you know.

294
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:32,457
Hey, let's take one before you regret it.

295
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,747
Smile, everyone!

296
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,497
One, two, three.

297
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,897
"Seulbi, where are you? Seulbi, I miss you!"

298
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:55,547
He was sulking over it so much, and now that wish is granted. How loyal. They hang out excluding me.

299
00:29:55,547 --> 00:30:00,787
Why are we so busy today? I'm going to go crazy.

300
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:06,207
How about Hyeeun?

301
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,787
That's great! That's really great!

302
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,537
Thanks...

303
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:18,747
That's good. Kisoo was really worried about it.

304
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:22,367
When was I?

305
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,677
Excuse me.

306
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:28,497
One fried dish, please.

307
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:32,417
One fried dish, here.

308
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:35,587
Aren't you going to work?

309
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:38,787
You can't live having debt, I suppose.

310
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:43,617
Having debt makes you feel guilty. That's why I'm trying to pay back doing this.

311
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:46,567
Wash the towel in hot water, and use the dishwasher for the dishes.

312
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:50,597
And clean the floor with a detergent. You have to clean it once more with a dry mop.

313
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:54,827
Hey! She can't do all that by herself.

314
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:57,937
You should help her, then.

315
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:10,907
Did you have fun with Sungyeol?

316
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,977
Nothing special happened? Did you eat?

317
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,627
What did you do?

318
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,777
Did you have enough money?

319
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,257
You didn't get hurt?

320
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:24,867
Things that other kids hear all the time... I'm finally hearing them now.

321
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,847
I was just wondering...

322
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:29,137
I'm sorry.

323
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,537
I can hear it all the time.

324
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:34,377
Woohyun...

325
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:40,377
I don't think you'll need to worry about Sungyeol either. He's back to his old self.

326
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:47,227
I took care of Sungyeol a lot,

327
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:51,337
but I didn't give him my heart. That's why I feel bad for him.

328
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:55,817
And for you, I just gave you my heart without even taking care of you.

329
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:59,017
And that's why I feel bad.

330
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,617
Thank you so much.

331
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,787
For growing up so well, Woohyun.

332
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:10,487
You would've wanted me to live well.

333
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:13,127
That's why. I had no choice.

334
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,777
Next time, let's go together.

335
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,167
You like it that much?

336
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:38,717
Woohyun and I are back together like before,  so I'm really happy.

337
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:39,857
I did a good job, then?

338
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,897
You're the best! It's like you.

339
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:44,297
What is being myself like?

340
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:48,697
You're like an umbrella on a rainy day, and the shade of a tree on a sunny day.

341
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:52,947
You're like a fresh wind on a really hot day.

342
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:56,367
I bothered you so much. Don't you hate me?

343
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,937
You were the one who was suffering more.

344
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:05,517
I forgot to say another one.

345
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,717
You're always there whenever I fall.

346
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:13,857
I didn't get hurt, thanks to you.

347
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:18,217
And if we just make the two of them get back together, it's perfect. Right?

348
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,407
 Our Puppy looks so good in this picture!

349
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,097
You look better.

350
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:46,067
Lee Seulbi? She's pretty.

351
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:50,507
If this punk's going to smile, he should do it more brightly.

352
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:54,367
So this is the face when the eyes are sad, and the lips are smiling?

353
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,107
Wow, this is good.

354
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:18,177
Stop being so shy and act like a man.

355
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:24,257
You told me that a real man should be willing to kneel in front of his family.

356
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,767
Seulbi, did this guy eat something weird?

357
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,167
I put something in his food.

358
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,077
What? You put something in it?

359
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:35,867
Half a spoon of love and half a spoon of apology.

360
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,187
And a half a spoon of forgiveness.

361
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:42,327
Please buy us a meal later.

362
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,757
Sure. Where?

363
00:34:44,757 --> 00:34:46,877
We will tell you where when we decide.

364
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:50,807
Okay. Let's eat something good.

365
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:54,777
This is good.

366
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,007
Why? Do you need money?

367
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,457
Or do you have something to say?

368
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:04,527
Did you get in trouble?

369
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,867
If you offer me an allowance, I'll take it.

370
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:11,067
I didn't make any trouble yet. I am going to do that soon, though.

371
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,377
What trouble?

372
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,897
If you hit someone again, I'm going to confine you.

373
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,377
Dad.

374
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:24,887
I like that you don't get hurt while you catch so many criminals.

375
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:28,717
Don't get hurt. Don't run too much either.

376
00:35:28,717 --> 00:35:30,697
Think about your age.

377
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:34,507
This guy. I'm still strong.

378
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,797
Don't worry, you little kid.

379
00:35:36,797 --> 00:35:40,207
Hey, you're back now, my son!

380
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:42,577
I'll see you later.

381
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:50,217

382
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:05,997
 Even if I'm eating ramen, it's delicious when I'm eating with my son.

383
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,557
 Hey! Hwang Sungyeol!

384
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:12,787
 You bastard!

385
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:15,217
 Honey!  Honey! 
 - You...

386
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:29,097
 I think I'm becoming a monster now...

387
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:33,037
 Please help me.

388
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:38,227
 Okay.

389
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,467
 I will help you.

390
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:48,187
 Dad... I'm sorry.

391
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,347
Yes.

392
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:08,037
Where would I have money?

393
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,947
You always gamble and drink.

394
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:18,937
I don't have any money. And I don't have money for you either, Dad.

395
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:32,097
Sorry.

396
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:35,027
That wasn't...

397
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:49,907
Hit me. Just hit me.

398
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:53,257
It's my fault. Hit me.

399
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:07,267
I know you're in pain. I'm sorry I made you feel pain, too.

400
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:16,307
Hey, I think I'm good at getting hit.

401
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:22,607
Do you want me to make a coupon for this?

402
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,107
You smiled!

403
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:33,157
You just smiled!

404
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:34,977
You smiled!

405
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,637

406
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:06,897
I agree to this divorce.

407
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:08,877
Same here.

408
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,317
Me too.

409
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:12,857
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

410
00:39:12,857 --> 00:39:17,977
She took care of you and Sungyeol, but you didn't even come once.

411
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:23,557
Ah... That... was because I had stake-out duty.

412
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:26,647
You should've staked-out her heart.

413
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:31,177
Ah. Work is more important for you, you mean?

414
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:34,647
I did stake-out...

415
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,747
But I couldn't catch them.

416
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:41,327
I don't like guys who give up after missing once.

417
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:44,377
If you're thinking of a happy senior life, I recommend divorcing.

418
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:47,757
Right. You should stamp on this, Teacher.

419
00:39:47,777 --> 00:39:52,017
Adults tell us not to give up, but they're really fast at giving up!

420
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:52,687
Really fast!

421
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,437
Really fast!

422
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,777
This kid.

423
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,327
The weather is nice.

424
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:16,957
I'm your older brother, Shin Woohyun.

425
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,337
You call being one month older an older brother?

426
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:20,927
If you don't like it, you should've been born earlier.

427
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:24,717
Seulbi, didn't I tell you my hands are pretty expensive?

428
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:28,797
Hold it. He grabs you when you fall, and you will be happier.

429
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:30,667
That's how it was for me.

430
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:44,047
Hey, kid.

431
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,837
What are you doing?

432
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:49,077
You think I would hug just Seulbi? I hug guys, too.

433
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,537
Come here.

434
00:40:52,377 --> 00:40:53,797
You want to get hit, don't you?

435
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:55,587
I'm scared!

436
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,137
You're going to hit me?

437
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,387
So we can all live together now?

438
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:13,457
That Sungyeol sleep-talks a lot...

439
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:16,127
You can hug him while sleeping, like you've been doing.

440
00:41:16,127 --> 00:41:18,037
I can't do that.

441
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:21,577
How's your wound?

442
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:23,837
It's almost healed. You?

443
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:27,027
If you're okay, I'm okay too.

444
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:37,047
It would've been better if I had mine, too.

445
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:41,347
- Yours is right here! 
 - You had it all along?

446
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:44,417
Now I have found your master.

447
00:41:58,487 --> 00:41:59,817
This is yours.

448
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,547
That's why I'm giving it to you, indicating that you're mine.

449
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:07,797
Try it.

450
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:19,967
This is my first necklace ever.

451
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:23,577
These are miracle necklaces that make you able to meet someone that you have to.

452
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:26,967
These will make us not leave each other.

453
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:41,627
Happy birthday.

454
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:45,247
Thank you.

455
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,867
Is that...

456
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:53,427
You told me it was a miracle necklace.

457
00:42:53,457 --> 00:42:56,397
I wanted to know if it was real.

458
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:58,587
I gave mine to Seulbi.

459
00:42:58,587 --> 00:43:00,467
You told me you threw it away.

460
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:03,187
I guess it didn't work.

461
00:43:03,187 --> 00:43:06,087
Seulbi found it for me.

462
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:10,007
You two are so cute.

463
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:11,727
Get some rest.

464
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:18,297
Would we really be able to live altogether?

465
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:22,507
Am I allowed to do that?

466
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:29,167
How would I... after hurting all of you guys...?

467
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:34,427
Heal those wounds, please.

468
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:40,917
I want to get some of that "mom love" too.

469
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:49,427
Did I tell you that?

470
00:43:53,037 --> 00:43:57,967
Thanks for giving birth to me.

471
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:03,757
And I like Sungyeol.

472
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:35,717
Ms. Gong, I think I can smile for real now.

473
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:32,787
Bye, my first love.

474
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:46,077
Everyone is becoming happy.

475
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:50,907
And now, you have to be happy, Senior.

476
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:06,287
I can't be happy if you do not come back.

477
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:11,617
I am going to reveal everything, and I will show you that people's minds change.

478
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:16,787
Even if I were to lose everything, I will do it.

479
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:00,337
 Hwang Sungyeol, this bastard.

480
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:03,147
 Where are you going alone?

481
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:15,377
 I don't think I would've been able to leave if I talked to you about it face-to-face.

482
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:19,167
 I am leaving to live, so please wait for me.

483
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:24,357
 I will learn a lot more, and then come back as a new person.

484
00:48:16,177 --> 00:48:19,367

485
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:58,617
Woohyun.

486
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,837
Woohyun, it's Mom.

487
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,647
Woohyun.

488
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:06,547
What about Seulbi and Sungyeol?

489
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:31,807
What about Seulbi?

490
00:49:33,757 --> 00:49:36,457
I heard she wasn't there.

491
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:43,097
Woohyun.

492
00:49:54,267 --> 00:50:01,977

493
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,087
 A toast!

494
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:16,757
 This is Heaven!

495
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:18,497
 What's up with him?

496
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:20,627
 They told me to come and practice!

497
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:23,727
 You could've held on to me even once.

498
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:24,667
 Relationship? Really...

499
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:28,017
 Do you...

500
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:29,437
 Another life.

501
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:30,717
 Another life?

502
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:34,887
 Do you miss Lee Seulbi?

503
00:50:34,887 --> 00:50:38,407
 I didn't care if you were an angel or a human.

504
00:50:38,407 --> 00:50:41,147
 I miss you, Seulbi.
