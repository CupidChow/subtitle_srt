1
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:09,793
What do I need to do in order to go back?

2
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:19,933
I want to go back.

3
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,153
I'm going to go back.

4
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:53,493
Hey!  Are you crazy?!

5
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:56,043
Are you trying to kill yourself?!

6
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,103
It was ruined.

7
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,793
What?

8
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,193
I'm saying it was ruined because of you!

9
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:05,723
You said to leave.

10
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:07,613
You said to not follow you.

11
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:10,573
You told me you were leaving me!

12
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:12,503
Let's go.

13
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:20,943
What?

14
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:24,083
You told me not to follow you.

15
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,663
♬  My heart's beating  ♬

16
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:31,653
♬  as you walk past me again  ♬

17
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:35,623
♬  If, once again, you're the only one for me,  ♬

18
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:37,613
♬  I can't let you go like this  ♬

19
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,433
Let's go together!

20
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:45,353

♬  I'll be there for you, my love  ♬

21
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:51,403
I wonder if it's all right for me to be this happy.

22
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:55,083
As you already know, my husband's always been a great person.

23
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,973
Son?

24
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:01,633
It's a relief that studying comes easy to him.

25
00:02:03,063 --> 00:02:06,043
Good at studying and,

26
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,283
of course, he's good to me, too.

27
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:10,873
Of course.

28
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:18,093
Ah, my soup is boiling.

29
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:22,423
Let's talk later. Okay? Okay.

30
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:31,003
Clean it up.

31
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,463
Clean it, so that no one else gets hurt.

32
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:37,283
Usually the question, "Are you hurt anywhere?"

33
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,803
comes first.

34
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,833
I'm not an average person.

35
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,223
You know that, too.

36
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:50,023
Was I ever that good to you? Enough to be complimented?

37
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:53,053
Ah!  Is this doing something good?

38
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,933

39
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,123
Hey!

40
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,173
You little...

41
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,993
Are you not leaving?

42
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:43,313
Close the door!

43
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,923
I didn't see anything!

44
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,753
I promise I couldn't see anything clearly.

45
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:54,913
Clearly?!

46
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:57,343
You never said I couldn't look.

47
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,433
- This is unfair. 
 - Unfair?

48
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,663
Then I'll take a close look while you shower. Okay?

49
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:03,073
This is only fair, right?

50
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:05,273
You crazy pervert.

51
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,233
Where are you looking?

52
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,033
You better turn away.

53
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,613
You had it, too.

54
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:15,143
I definitely saw it.

55
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:17,393
Those chocolate abs, like in dramas!

56
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:18,503
Let me look at them again!

57
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:21,223
You, seriously!

58
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:23,083
Geez! What are you doing?

59
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,603
Grandma!  She came in while I was taking a shower!

60
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:28,263
She saw...

61
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:29,793
Ah, how annoying!

62
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:34,173
She's going to install a CCTV camera in there next, I swear!

63
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:38,083
My Woohyun is angry.

64
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,123
Bringing her back was a mistake.

65
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:41,793
Let's kick her out as soon as morning comes.

66
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,373
So petty!

67
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:46,813
I won't look. I promise I won't look anymore.

68
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:50,033
Please don't kick me out.

69
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:55,593
Oh my! I make these kinds of noises, too?

70
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:57,043
You're doing all sorts of things now.

71
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,213
What did you do, not eating until now?

72
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,683
Goodness.

73
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:03,563
I wonder when food tastes the best.

74
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:06,023
Why is my stomach constantly hungry?

75
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:09,143
Who said we could only eat three meals?

76
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:11,743
Do I have to live with that crazy pervert?

77
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,773
In the same house?

78
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,893
It's dangerous.

79
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:27,353
All right!

80
00:05:27,353 --> 00:05:29,913
I'm good at this now, huh?

81
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,773
It's really delicious.

82
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,893
I wish Senior could eat this, too.

83
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,383
Senior? Who's that?

84
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:42,183
Do you remember someone?

85
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:45,683
Just... I just feel bad I'm eating this alone.

86
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,703
- It's just some person. 
 - Who is it?

87
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,233
If you remember anyone, let me know. I'll find that person for you.

88
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:54,163
You can't see him. Only I can. He's not human.

89
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:56,153
What the heck!

90
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:57,533
Do you, by any chance,

91
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,163
see ghosts and things like that?

92
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:03,923
You were scared, huh?

93
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,963
I'm the idiot for trying to make conversation with you.

94
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:10,863
It's yummy!

95
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:24,633
 Wow, that's refreshing!

96
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:27,363
 You're skilled with your hands, too.

97
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:30,593
 Wow!  That's really refreshing.

98
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:31,843
 Wow!

99
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:34,803
 It's really refreshing? It doesn't hurt?

100
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:38,113
 Then, Grandmother, can you do it for me, too?

101
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:42,163
 Why does a young girl need to receive a massage from an old grandmother?

102
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:48,573
 - Is it refreshing? 
 - Ow! That hurts.

103
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:52,233
 Is pain refreshing to you?

104
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,743
Everyone, good morning!

105
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:05,973
Hey, take that off! Why are you wearing something I threw out?

106
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,453
Finders keepers. You already threw this out, so you can't say anything.

107
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:11,183
What are you two doing so early in the morning?

108
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:13,773
I threw it away in the garbage, not to you.

109
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,413
Come here.

110
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:18,353
Have you decided to transfer?

111
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:20,963
You don't have to if it'll make things hard for you.

112
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:23,023
I don't want to compensate them with money like a coward.

113
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:26,363
My Ms. Gong worked hard to make that money.

114
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,513
Come here!

115
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,643
This is prettier than Grandmother's clothes.

116
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:32,293
That's for guys.

117
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,613
You can't even tie the tie properly. I'll tie it for you, come here.

118
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,613
Really?

119
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,903
Come here!

120
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:49,083
Let go of me!

121
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,263
- Take it off! 
 - No! 
 - Hurry, and take it off!

122
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:55,503
Kids, stop it this instant!

123
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:59,053
Here!  When you buy your uniform,

124
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,473
buy some clothes for her as well.

125
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:05,463
Grandmother, you're such a nice, old, female human.

126
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,893
Are you teasing me and calling me old?

127
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:10,703
Throw those clothes away. Then I'll buy you some new clothes.

128
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:13,253
Why do you keep telling me to throw things away?

129
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,053
It's a waste to throw it away.

130
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:16,503
Then keep wearing it.

131
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:20,093
Girls these days wear pretty dresses.

132
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:22,423
There are no other angels like them.  (They look pretty in them)

133
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,513
Angel?

134
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,613
Really?

135
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,703
How about this?

136
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,943
It looks like a pineapple.

137
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,323
- Then, how about this? 
 - It looks like a watermelon.

138
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,123
Then this looks like an orange, and this like an eggplant, right?

139
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,713
I don't care. You're on your own.

140
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,243
It's not like you have great taste.

141
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:02,853
Wow, he looks handsome.

142
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,833
Wow, you're really good-looking.

143
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,513
- Stop. 
 - Your girlfriend is so cute.

144
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:13,433
She's not my girlfriend.

145
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,833
Get away from me.

146
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,543
Buy this for me, too.

147
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:21,663
Want to try it on? It'll look pretty since it's a new design.

148
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,953
No,

149
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,183
I'll buy you something else.

150
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:26,163
Buy it for me!

151
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,443
- Stop. 
 - I'm going to stick to you like gum until you buy it for me.

152
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,773
- Buy it for me, buy it for me, buy it for me! 
 - Get off me!

153
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:32,643
Hurry and try it on.

154
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,763
Hey!

155
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,863
Lee Seulbi.

156
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:39,333
I'll buy you something else.

157
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:04,153
I want this.

158
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,703
Since you've tried it on, take it off and I'll buy you something else.

159
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,703
I want this.

160
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:11,953
Why do you want a uniform when you don't even go to school?

161
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:15,973
Throw away the idea that one needs to go to school in order to wear a uniform.

162
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:18,663
I can just go to school.

163
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,723
Crazy.

164
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:30,113
I can't take any time off tomorrow,

165
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:32,353
so let's celebrate early.

166
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:34,443
Sungyeol, happy birthday.

167
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,593
I can't tomorrow, as well.

168
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,713
I promised my mom.

169
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,963
We tried to pick out a present for you,

170
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:49,443
but decided not to buy anything since you might not like it.

171
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,753
Of course!

172
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:53,533
We can go and choose together.

173
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:57,473
This guy is quite picky.

174
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:10,943

175
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,993
It looks like she's from your school.

176
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,623
Is she a friend?

177
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:39,523
Maybe we should've gone somewhere else.

178
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:41,963
I didn't realize it may be uncomfortable since there are so many students around here.

179
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:44,603
It would be more uncomfortable for me than you,

180
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,843
if they knew I was eating dinner with a teacher.

181
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,853
I will choose my own gift, so just pay for it.

182
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,043
I will leave first.

183
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,523
It'll be awkward if the other students saw this.

184
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:59,613
You little...

185
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:02,933
Take care of the check and come out.

186
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,293
Okay.

187
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:10,283
Sungyeol, let's go together.

188
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:14,093
Why does it matter whether the other students see us like this or not? It's not like we have a weird relationship.

189
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,563
We have a really weird relationship.

190
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:21,083
My purse!

191
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,373
Jihye, are you okay?

192
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,423
My purse!  My purse!

193
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:25,693
Sungyeol, stay with your mom.

194
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,833
Don't move, and stay here!

195
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,873
Out of the way!

196
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:37,803
Be careful! He's a thief!

197
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:39,273
Thief?

198
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:40,923
Catch him!

199
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:43,653
Why are you chasing after him?! It's dangerous!

200
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:11,243
Ah, so annoying!

201
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:27,253
Wait!

202
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,423
Let's take this slow.

203
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,763
There's something I need to do.

204
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,233
You're dead!

205
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,823
Not going to let go?!

206
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,503
You little...

207
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:07,423
Hey, you!

208
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,483
Umbrella.

209
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:15,773
You're better than I expected.

210
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,133
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

211
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,693
- Yeah. 
 - Okay.

212
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,913
Hey, you punk!  Get up!

213
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:28,243
Seulbi!  Lee Seulbi!

214
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,683
Come to your senses

215
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:32,433
I'm so sleepy.

216
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,133
Hey!

217
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,873
Are you okay?
- Honey.  Honey!

218
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:39,503
- Are you hurt anywhere? 
 - No.

219
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,003
You must have been shocked.

220
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,783
Oh my!

221
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:50,743
Is anything missing?

222
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,563
Thank you for getting this back for me, Sungyeol.

223
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,013
- It wasn't me— 
 - Wow, my son is so brave.

224
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,993
Is it because you take after me?

225
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:10,983
You sleep well anywhere.

226
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,553
You have a gift in startling people.

227
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,713
Why did you get involved when you knew it was dangerous?

228
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:20,393
The people I know run away when they see fire,

229
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:23,633
and hurt people because they don't want to get hurt.

230
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,853
You're different than the people I know.

231
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,163
I must be the worst among the people around you.

232
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:35,573
I always tell you to get lost and abandon you.

233
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,763
So, don't abandon me.

234
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:44,053
I have no place to go if you abandon me.

235
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,843
- Get off. 
 - I'm still dizzy.

236
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,163
The world is spinning.

237
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,533
I have no strength in my legs.

238
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:52,963
Stop eating so much.

239
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:56,283
Why do you call your grandmother, Ms. Gong?

240
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,833
Did your grandmother not marry?

241
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,483
Are you an idiot? My dad is my grandmother's son.

242
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,163
Then, why do you call her Ms. Gong?

243
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,973
That place is called "Ms. Gong," too.

244
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:08,583
If my grandmother is a missus,

245
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,033
then wouldn't she live with me longer?

246
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,583
Grandmother will live for a long time.

247
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,533
If you drool on my back, I'm going to kill you.

248
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,533
Okay.

249
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,763
Swallow it.

250
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,643
 After becoming human,

251
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:30,813
 I'm glad that

252
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,823
 you're the first person I met.

253
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,983
You have no need to recharge your energy. What are you doing?

254
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,653
Why do you come now? Do you know how long I've waited?

255
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,063
Was everything okay?

256
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,153
It's a little weird.

257
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:02,863
It doesn't seem like my abilities as an angel are gone,

258
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:05,143
but I don't think I can use it anytime.

259
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:07,243
What happens after you use it?

260
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,263
I lose all energy and become sleepy.

261
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,883
I need to rest before I can get up again.

262
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:18,713
Don't use your powers on humans for now.

263
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:27,473
These are the documents you need while you live as a human.

264
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,643
It has your SSN,

265
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:31,713
and there should be no problem with your stay here.

266
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:33,443
Thank you.

267
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,893
But why are there so many things in here?

268
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:39,843
How about that guy?

269
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,103
What kind of person is he?

270
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,783
Don't even start. He thinks he's so good.

271
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:47,153
He has a rough personality.

272
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,923
He nags a lot,

273
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:51,233
teases a lot...

274
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,503
Since it happened while saving him,

275
00:17:56,503 --> 00:18:01,603
I thought I could find the answer if I got to know him.

276
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:05,673
Let me know if you find anything.

277
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:07,953
You're leaving already?

278
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,343
I don't have any time to waste on humans.

279
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,843
Is he calling me a human?

280
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,783
Do you have to iron it?

281
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,843
I don't want my Woohyun to feel small,

282
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:47,193
and I hope his school life will straighten out like this. That's why I'm ironing it.

283
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,993
Iron mine, too.

284
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,703
My goodness.

285
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,183
Why did you buy this?

286
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,593
Do you want to go to school?

287
00:19:02,593 --> 00:19:04,983
It's because Woohyun goes to school.

288
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:06,873
My goodness.

289
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:09,983
Well, if you want to go so much, I'm sure we can find a way.

290
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,463
So...

291
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,713
do you like Woohyun?

292
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,503
- It's not that... 
  - This is driving me crazy.

293
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:20,093
 She won't believe me, even if I told her.

294
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,243
- Yes! 
 - Oh my goodness.  Really?

295
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,033
My goondess.

296
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:27,243
You're so lucky, Woohyun.

297
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:30,603
Ms. Gong, I have high standards.

298
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,373
Is that a confession?

299
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:34,693
I politely decline.

300
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,713
What do you take me for?

301
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,833
What does this mean?

302
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,663
Psycho. 
  (T/N: literally means "in between the nose," but it sounds like "psycho")

303
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:01,153
 Umbrella.

304
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:32,453
What is that?

305
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,763
It's my sibling.

306
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,823
I'm not even going to ask.

307
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:40,453
When you are done eating, go downstairs to the store and clean.

308
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:44,413
Slice the lettuce and onions. Also, put out the hot pepper paste.

309
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:48,053
Clean, lettuce,  and onion, and hot pepper paste. Okay.

310
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:51,503
Wow, Ms. Gong, you sound like an evil stepmother.

311
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:55,263
You hurry up and eat and go to school. Isn't it your first day?

312
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:58,433
There is still a lot of time.

313
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,943
I hit the clock because it kept cuckooing.

314
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:04,413
It's broken now so it can't ring.

315
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:07,623
- Why are you telling me now? 
 - Why are you telling me now?

316
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:18,243

317
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,493
Ah, because of that crazy pervert.

318
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:25,193
They will be lenient since it's my first day, right?

319
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,113
Act as natural as possible.

320
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:32,443
Okay.

321
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:34,993
I told you to do it properly.

322
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,203
Won't you pay attention?

323
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:37,383
Please be lenient.

324
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,403
Be lenient?

325
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,193
Who are you?

326
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:45,383
Today's my first day.

327
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,883
Oh, a transfer student.

328
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,913
Bend over.

329
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:54,223
Starting from my first day…

330
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:58,443
As a transfer student, you're late on your first day?

331
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,733
You bastard.

332
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,113
Lower your eyes, he's the top  (fighter)  in our school.

333
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:10,603
We are going to die if we have eye contact.

334
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:11,863
We've already made eye contact.

335
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,423
Wow, awesome.

336
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,253
I don't know you from now on.

337
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,143
Who are you?

338
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,963
These guys.

339
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:26,513
You guys have remaining energy, right?

340
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,253
Stand up!

341
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,273
Run around the track 100 times.

342
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,963
Go!

343
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:34,263
Move! Move!

344
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:35,793
Hurry up and run!

345
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:38,563
Hurry and run!

346
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:40,863
What are you?

347
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:43,353
- I'm a transfer student. 
 - Oh, a transfer student.

348
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,053
Move! Hurry up and run!

349
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,413
Go, go, go!

350
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:13,693
He's so gorgeous.

351
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:22,673
All right, all right.

352
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:27,643
This is our friend who came to us today.

353
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:31,253
Introduce yourself.

354
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,883
Nice to meet you.

355
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:37,263
I'm Shin Woohyun, who's cooler than

356
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:40,483
Won Bin, Hyun Bin, Lee Seunggi, Song Joongki, and Kim Woobin. Let's get along well!

357
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:44,083
Praise the Lord, thank you!

358
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,683
Geez, seriously...

359
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:52,823
Initiation!  Initiation! Initiation!

360
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:57,283
Initiation!  Sing a song! Sing a song!

361
00:23:57,283 --> 00:24:02,543
Sing! Sing! Sing!

362
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:05,553
Okay, okay.

363
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:07,393
Fine.

364
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:09,763
With your feelings.

365
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:21,173
♫  So that others didn't know, I was pacing and crying  ♫

366
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:29,293
♫  The past events are embedded deep in my heart  ♫

367
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:37,273
♫  When the lights under the empty sky start to shine  ♫

368
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:45,493
♫   I try sparingly to call your name, my lost love  ♫

369
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:49,333
♫  Now, what I long for  ♫

370
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,473
  Shin Woohyun: Height 176 cm with a slim body,

371
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,673
  chocolate abs, my future husband.

372
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:58,133
  Do not drool over him or look in his direction or you will die.

373
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:06,203
♫  Just as I let my thoughts of you be  ♫

374
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:13,623
♫  whenever you come to mind  ♫

375
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:22,503
All right then.

376
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,573
Go sit next to Chunsik.

377
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:31,313
What's up, Chunsik.

378
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:38,453
Hut! 1, 2, 3, 4.

379
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,443
♪ Today's questions ♪

380
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:42,573
♪ Tomorrow's tears ♪

381
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:45,613

383
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:49,603
Very good.

384
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:55,273
How awkward.

385
00:25:57,003 --> 00:26:00,363
You're really here, right?

386
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,833
He's here.

387
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:19,673
Chunsik, let's go to the bathroom together.

388
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:25,053
Again? That bastard.

389
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,243
What's wrong with them?

390
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:27,573
Initiation!

391
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:30,343
In this school, the person that sits next to the new student

392
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:33,033
has to do a mandatory initiation.

393
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:36,103
Wow, that's an interesting decision.

394
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:40,853
Chunsik, let's go.

395
00:26:40,853 --> 00:26:42,093
Let's go.

396
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:45,273
Be careful... You're dead!

397
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:57,113
What's with that Chunsik?

398
00:26:57,113 --> 00:27:00,123
Chunsik, you must be happy you have a deskmate.

399
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:03,443
If I figure out where you are,

400
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:04,933
then today is your funeral.

401
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:08,163
Oh, very tough.

402
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:13,213
He's not here.

403
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,913
He's not here either.

404
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:19,483
Where do you think Chunsik is?

405
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:23,023
You should at least cough a little.

406
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:29,663
If you come out by yourself then I'll just take your money.

407
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:32,293
If I find you, then I will take your money

408
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:35,173
and take your life.

409
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:48,323
Later when you dare to come out here,

410
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:52,143
I'll quietly send you to class.  Huh?

411
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:05,263
Aren't you going to come out?!

412
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,383
Aren't you going to come out?!

413
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:20,923
Ow, my stomach!

414
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:33,593
That's disgusting.

415
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:35,703
Come out, you bastard!

416
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,733
Come out! Come out!

417
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:41,303
Ah, that's refreshing.

418
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:49,523
While I'm asking nicely, come out!

419
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,663
Go back to class!

420
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,983
You go back to class, you bastard!

421
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,143
It's Ethics class though.

422
00:28:57,143 --> 00:29:00,463
If you ditch class again,

423
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:04,083
then you'll need to bring your parents.

424
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:07,983
Your parents are busy people.

425
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:19,113
Thanks for the good announcement.

426
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:25,423
Ethics saved you.

427
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:37,613
Oh!

428
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:45,693
No way! Who's that idiot...

429
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:48,513
who can't remember my good-looking self?

430
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,183
He is first in our class.

431
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,133
- Let's go. 
 - Thank you.

432
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,903
Those who're doing something else during class,

433
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:07,463
I'll leave a big impression on your record,

434
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:09,893
so that you'll be able to keep your eyes on it your whole life.

435
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,663
Sorry.

436
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:50,893
Let's go in together, so it'll be less humiliating.

437
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,883
It's more humiliating going in with you.

438
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:57,243
True, my face is better than yours.

439
00:30:57,243 --> 00:31:00,183
Then, come slowly.

440
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:11,623
 Son, something came up so I wasn't able to keep our promise.

441
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:14,613
 What should I do? I'm sorry. I put some money in your account.

442
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:18,323
 Buy delicious food with your friends. Happy birthday!

443
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:33,633
Sorry.

444
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:46,763
What are you guys?

445
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:49,113
Well... that... There were a lot of people in the restroom.

446
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:51,453
You two get out.

447
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,083
- We'll be more careful next...
 - Get out.

448
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,643
You're disturbing the other kids from studying.

449
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,913
Where have I seen her?

450
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,443
Try to get his profile.

451
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:13,093
Okay.

452
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,633
Wow. She's a genius.

453
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:22,873
She doesn't even talk to teach.

454
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:26,743
Why is she like that? Is she a singer?

455
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,263
Is this like lip-sync?

456
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,963
Did you find the owner of the purse?

457
00:32:33,963 --> 00:32:38,623
I'm sorry, but you're going to need to take a hit.

458
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,683
- Hey. 
 - I'm sorry, but one more.

459
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,623
What are you doing? Aren't you going to let go?

460
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,683
Are you out of your mind?

461
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:52,653
I was going to quietly get along.

462
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:54,853
Let go.

463
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:01,933
You know what happens when you fight at school, right?

464
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:04,213
Should I bring my mother?

465
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:08,373
My mom is busy, so what time should she come here by?

466
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,013
You have nothing to say?

467
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:25,263
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:27,713
It's not something that'll be forgiven by an apology.

469
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:29,963
Look at my face.

470
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:34,293
- Hit me. 
 - What?

471
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:36,773
I'm telling you to hit me two times.

472
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:44,143
I'm going to keep the other. Including interest, I'm going to hit you when I want to.

473
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:49,293
You're laughing? You won't be laughing or crying from the other hit?

474
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,853
Next time I hit you, there won't be any warnings, done.

475
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:05,273
Do you like that teacher?

476
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:07,493
You didn't get beat enough.

477
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:09,423
It's you that didn't get beat enough.

478
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,763
I still got one left.

479
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:15,973
I don't beat up those who ask nicely.

480
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:20,783
- Hey, but is she okay? 
 - Who?

481
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:25,043
Oh, that crazy pervert? Why?

482
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:26,593
She didn't seem well.

483
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:31,123
Not physically, but mentally. And badly, too.

484
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:33,213
Are you interested in her?

485
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:42,903
What is this? That unfitting innocence?

494
00:35:52,293 --> 00:36:00,723

495
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:09,993
Thank you.

496
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:15,743
It's a new face.

497
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:20,183
Grandma, what's this jelly doing here?

498
00:36:20,183 --> 00:36:23,083
Acorn! Acorn!

499
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:25,983
Does she go to our school?

500
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:30,273
She's a part-time worker. Don't worry and hurry up and eat.

501
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,403
Hey, I'm warning you.

502
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:36,693
If you stick around our Woohyun or keep your eyes on him you're going to die by me.

503
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,113
You know, right?

504
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,103
 What caused many global disputes with this?

505
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:45,093
 What is this resource?

506
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:47,563
- Water. 
 -  That's the correct answer!

507
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:51,083
 The closest galaxy to our galaxy is...

508
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:55,493
- It's Andromeda. 
 - It's Andromeda. 
 - That's correct!

509
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,293
Do you study a bit?

510
00:36:58,293 --> 00:37:00,343
I never did it before so I don't know.

511
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:04,013
Psh, that's the same as me then!

512
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,453
Hey, this is really hard. Can you solve it?

513
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:14,803
All one's today.  Two's tomorrow then.

514
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:30,283
Wow.

515
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:36,123
Ms. Gong, we're back.

516
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,863
- You're here? 
 - Hey.

517
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:40,893
Why are you solving another person's workbook?

518
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:43,043
I'm almost done.

519
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:46,343
Bye.

520
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:50,303
This is until tomorrow, okay?

521
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:52,473
That...

522
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:54,393
- Hey, hey. You guys. 
 - I ate well, Kisoo.

523
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:56,033
Okay.

524
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,703
Hey, sit here for a bit.

525
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,123
A while ago I just found out,

526
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:08,493
there is nobody reported missing.

527
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:10,783
I feel like she's from somewhere far away.

528
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:13,683
Is her name really Lee Seulbi?

529
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:15,503
Is she sure about her name?

530
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:19,603
It seems like she remembered something, but also it doesn't.

531
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:23,593
According to the police, she needs to enter an institution

532
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:27,863
- and receive professional care... 
 - We can't! She'll be a nuisance to everyone.

533
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:30,853
How can you send someone so useless there?

534
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:34,323
I think she's slowly getting her memory back, so until then...

535
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:37,063
I feel like she's remembering something.

536
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:40,033
She can get her memories back tomorrow.

537
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,613
That'll be great.

538
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,503
But we're going to need to send her to school.

539
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:48,453
- School? Where? 
 - There.

540
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:52,433
No, no way. Mrs. Gong that's a bit overboard.

541
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:56,673
I bought her uniform and it seems she's good at studying.

542
00:38:56,673 --> 00:39:00,983
Don't you think she'll get her memories back faster when she goes to school?

543
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:04,143
- If you keep using your head... 
 - It'll get worse.

544
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:07,823
Your knee hurts the more you use it, right? It's the same for your head.

545
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,373
It gets worse.

546
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:13,793
If you're going to send her to school, send her to another one. She's never coming to my school.

547
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:36,093
There's not much time left for your birthday.

548
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,813
Your father will be late.

549
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:53,313
Let's blow out the candles and make a wish by ourselves.

550
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:03,943
It seemed your earphones were broken so I bought new ones.

551
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:08,893
Thank you.

552
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,963
For finding my bag.

553
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:12,993
Don't misunderstand.

554
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,663
I gave it to you because I was worried

555
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:18,863
for my dad risking his life for that little bag.

556
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,943
There was something special to me in that bag.

557
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:24,983
I guess your ex-husband's photo was in there.

558
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,413
Let's get along quietly at school.

559
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,873
The father you worry so much about

560
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:43,793
can't get called to the school, right?

561
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:53,363
Please get out with that cake.

562
00:40:56,433 --> 00:41:02,013

563
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,463
You seem to sing a bit.

564
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:46,083
Have you thought of joining our club?

565
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,283
No, I haven't.

566
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:52,933
Especially if this is how you come and recruit, I have no intention.

567
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,403
Do you know that?

568
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:58,483
According to how I want it,

569
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:04,153
I can make your school life heaven or hell.

570
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:07,573
It's already a living hell already.

571
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,913
You'll be joining my club soon.

572
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,263
You are really messing up Shin Woohyun's life.

573
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:34,503
How much is the tutor this time?

574
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:39,023
If I'm that embarrassing then you can just take my brother and sister.

575
00:42:41,363 --> 00:42:45,733
When have you ever invited a dummy like me to a family meeting?

576
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,543
Since when did you eavesdrop?

577
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:00,113
I wasn't eavesdropping, but I just heard it.

578
00:43:04,673 --> 00:43:06,463
That bastard.

579
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:17,783
All right, Hwang Sungyeol,

580
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:20,833
50-meter freestyle.

581
00:43:35,453 --> 00:43:36,963
Hey.

582
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:40,703
Why are you so scared of the water?

583
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:43,923
It's cold. I'm a seal in a warm pool.

584
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,683
Whatever.

585
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,383
Transfer student, why aren't you going in?

586
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:12,103
I have bit of a fever. I don't think I can do it.

587
00:44:12,103 --> 00:44:13,283
Oh, really?

588
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,923
Then you come out and see me after class.

589
00:44:14,923 --> 00:44:16,473
Next!

590
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:21,523
I'm going straight to work after class.

591
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:31,733
Hey.

592
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:38,843
Okay.

593
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,903
Who are you?

594
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,393
They always hang up when I pick up. How many times is this?

595
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:46,413
Seriously, I'm busy to death.

596
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:49,243
Death?

597
00:45:49,243 --> 00:45:52,893
Why do humans keep saying they are going to die?

598
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:56,543
Ms. Gong, that's not good to say.

599
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:03,403
Who are you?

600
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:07,923
Hey!  Why are you answering the restaurant phone like it's a horror movie?

601
00:46:07,923 --> 00:46:11,093
Get me some clothes from my room without my grandma knowing.

602
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:13,463
Yeah, to the school swimming pool.

603
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:26,873
This school is really awkward.

604
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,593
What is this?

605
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:57,963
On TV it just went when you got on and moved your feet.

606
00:46:57,963 --> 00:47:00,473
Shin Woohyun, seriously.

607
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:03,793
You're a tiring human being.

608
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:51,213
Should I help you transfer student?

609
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:04,053
I can't live with a debt.

610
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:09,563
Thinking about this... I think I'll

611
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:11,853
have a lot of things to be sorry about for you.

612
00:48:11,863 --> 00:48:14,013
Let's not do anything we'll be sorry for.

613
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:16,753
I need to lock up so get out.

614
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:08,833

615
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:24,473

616
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:26,923
 The same thing?

617
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:29,063
 There is only one necklace of this kind!

618
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:31,763
 A person I can't even remember gave it to me.

619
00:49:31,783 --> 00:49:34,853
 Is it something important? That necklace.

620
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:38,113
 I looked after it so dearly.

621
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,343
 Anyways, you need to do well in school.

622
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:42,643
 - Pay attention, everyone! 
 - What I'm trying to say is...

623
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:43,853
 It's hard.

624
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:45,163
 Do you know Lee Seulbi?

625
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:46,993
 Let's have fun.

626
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:49,303
 What am I?

627
00:49:49,303 --> 00:49:51,583
 Do you want to die by me?

628
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,133
 What's wrong?
