1
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,536
Little siblings, I'll be back after school...

2
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:58,366
 If you don't hurry, I'm leaving without you.

3
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,236
I'm going! I'm going!

4
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:09,886

5
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:14,396
Yo!

6
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:16,366
Want to play a game of basketball during lunch?

7
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:19,946
- Let's bet on pizza? 
 - Okay! I'm in! I'll be the referee. The loser pays for mine as well.

8
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,446
Our sad Kisoo.

9
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:23,426
What are you going to do? Seulbi eats a lot.

10
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:25,546
Our poor Woohyunie,

11
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,646
I haven't eaten anything since last night.

12
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:28,866
Sungyeol!

13
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:31,756
- Yeah? 
 - You should play basketball, too. I'll be the referee.

14
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:35,336
Oh, our best athlete, Sungyeol. Want to be on my team?

15
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:37,636
- Nah, I'm fine. 
 - Good thinking.

16
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:41,936
Knowing when to stay out of a losing game. Good thinking.

17
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,686
I'll see you at lunch.

18
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:51,046
How much more mature are you planning to get from fighting this much?

19
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,866
Sungyeol!

20
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:55,266
And whose fault is all this?!

21
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,196
Is this really a love triangle?

22
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:58,956
Ouch! Ouch!

23
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:02,346
Do you want to mature, too? Who are you siding with?

24
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:04,926
No. No, it's not that.

25
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,686
What do you take me for?

26
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:08,836
Why should I do that?

27
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,926
We're giving you a chance.

28
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:14,116
It's sad to see you get stepped on by Shin Woohyun.

29
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:17,496
Don't mess with me.

30
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:19,916
We're asking for a favor.

31
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,736
Don't you like Shin Woohyun?

32
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:24,786
That's why I'm being like this.

33
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:27,126
Since you like Dayeol,

34
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:29,256
you'll know this feeling, too.

35
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,966
It's okay to give Shin Woohyun a hard time,

36
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,946
is this it?

37
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,496
Woohyun...

38
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:37,616
Make sure he doesn't get hurt.

39
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,096
Well, this should be fun.

40
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,186
Where is it?

41
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,656
Keep looking.

42
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,476
It's not here.

43
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,676
What should I do?

44
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,876
- What's wrong? 
 - Her phone disappeared

45
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,186
with her lesson fee.

46
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:02,836
What in the world. How much?

47
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:07,526
- $200. 
 - Didn't you say you saw Lee Seulbi yesterday?

48
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:10,766
I'm positive it was there before I saw her.

49
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:13,256
But after meeting her, I don't think it was there.

50
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:17,386
Now that I see it, Lee Seulbi

51
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:21,426
- was really interested when she saw you put the money in your phone. Wasn't she? 
 - That's true.

52
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,226
Lee Seulbi!

53
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:28,266
Perhaps, when you saw me yesterday, did you see my phone?

54
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,696
No, why?

55
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:34,956
Did you lose it?

56
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:38,366
Never mind. It can't be helped.

57
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:43,656
What is this? Does our school have a thief?

58
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:58,176
Hey! What's up Chunsik?!

59
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:01,166
How nice to see you here.

60
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:07,936
Thank you.

61
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,966
This is all I have.

62
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,136
Give me your phone.

63
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,136
No, not my phone.

64
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:20,076
Hey! We're not trying to steal your phone.

65
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,396
 Put it in Lee Seulbi's bag,

66
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,316
 so that no one knows.

67
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,956
I have no wrongs.

68
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:50,326
Because of you, it's getting harder for me.

69
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:56,226
The winning team is my team. Large pizza, please.

70
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,266
Hey! There's no time! Pass! Pass!

71
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:01,646
Feeling scared, after seeing my amazing dribbling skills?

72
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:03,236
There's no need to be worried.

73
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,776
Oh, I'll overlook your confidence just this once.

74
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,836
I decline your approval.

75
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:11,536
I sense the tension.

76
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,276
Give it to me!  You're not?

77
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:21,596
- Hey, hand over the ball. 
 - What? Is he using the special tickling strategy used by couples?

78
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,576
Aren't you going to hurry and give it to me?

79
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:25,476
Both of you are dismissed!

80
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,676
Why?

81
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,956
Penalty for being too cheesy.

82
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,856
Ah!

83
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,316
Ah, this smell!

84
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:41,846
This pungent smell that just pierces through your nose.

85
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:45,196
Sweat smell! As expected of youngsters.

86
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:46,846
Sit down.

87
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,376
Greeting accepted.

88
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:53,646
Today, in order to enhance your stamina,

89
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,316
you will have independent study.

90
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,886
Chunsik,

91
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,376
the teacher's here.

92
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,396
Teacher,

93
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:14,056
my phone disappeared.

94
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:15,166
What?

95
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,256
Your phone disappeared?

96
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:20,396
- Did you leave it at home? 
 - I brought it.

97
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:24,836
It was here until lunchtime. There was money inside it as well.

98
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,776
Empty your bags.

99
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:33,626
Everybody empty your bags. I'm going to check everyone's belongings.

100
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:35,166
Hurry!

101
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,626
Hurry! Hurry!

102
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,526
We have this thing called human rights.

103
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:46,346
It's difficult to follow your orders without prior notification of the situation at hand.

104
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,646
Oh yeah, human rights.

105
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:51,076
We have to hurry and catch the thief!

106
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,056
Hurry up and empty them!

107
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,616
Human rights, my ass.

108
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:59,176
Take everything out.

109
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,016
What is this?

110
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,666
What's wrong?

111
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,676
What is that?

112
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,946
That's Chunsik's phone.

113
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:41,826
Check.

114
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,356
Yes. This is mine.

115
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,906
Are you sure?

116
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,146
Be quiet!

117
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,646
No.

118
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:56,356
I think there's a misunderstanding..

119
00:07:56,356 --> 00:08:00,036
Seulbi was with us during lunch. He's right.

120
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:02,466
Who's behind this?

121
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:06,556
Teacher!

122
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:09,576
Honestly, I lost my phone as well.

123
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,596
She said it's been gone since she was with Lee Seulbi yesterday.

124
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:14,866
There were $200 worth of lesson fees inside as well.

125
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:19,336
Empty your bag.

126
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,216
What is this? I...

127
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:35,046
didn't do it!

128
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,796
Be quiet!

129
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,366
Check if there's money.

130
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:53,266
There's no money.

131
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:56,806
Be quiet!

132
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:00,186
It really wasn't me.

133
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:02,146
Lee Seulbi, follow me.

134
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:08,716
Seulbi,

135
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,226
a mistake isn't a sin.

136
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:16,616
- Accept it and if you're honest from now on— 
 - It really wasn't me.

137
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:32,676
Stealing your friends' belongings isn't a joke

138
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,966
but a crime.

139
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:37,696
Teacher, there's proof so why are you speaking so much?

140
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,136
Do you want to go to the police?

141
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:42,286
I really didn't do it.

142
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:44,506
Since you found it, it's fine.

143
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:48,366
It's my fault, too, for not protecting it.

144
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,086
What about you, Chun sik?

145
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:57,156
I-I'm fine, too. The money is there, too.

146
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,436
That's okay!

147
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:00,936
Then, let's settle this with volunteering on the school grounds.

148
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:04,236
It's not that simple of a problem!

149
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,726
Teacher Kim,

150
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:09,756
I took a very complicated problem and made it very simple.

151
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,736
Seulbi, your friends are forgiving you.

152
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:15,496
If it's too hard to apologize, I'll give you time.

153
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:20,076
- Wait... 
 - Wait? Why wait? Are you waiting for your wife who left home?

154
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,616
Wife..

155
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:25,096
I haven't done anything wrong.

156
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,796
Fine..

157
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,106
Seulbi, for one week,

158
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:34,236
think about your wrongdoings,

159
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,016
while doing community service.

160
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:42,726
What exactly happened?

161
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,736
Lee Seulbi is a thief...

162
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,706
Shut that mouth.

163
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:49,666
Did you see that? Pretending she doesn't know anything.

164
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,006
Her acting is amazing.

165
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,016
Everyone be quiet.

166
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,446
Seulbi,

167
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:09,746
I believe you and I'll wait.

168
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:21,226
The words you told me yesterday,

169
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:24,496
were they all lies?

170
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:30,366
What about you? What are you doing right now?

171
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:33,216
Why are you doing this to me?

172
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,496
You're really shameless.

173
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,506
You really don't know?

174
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,786
I don't like you!

175
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,856
What did I do wrong?

176
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:47,876
Think about what you took from me.

177
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,976
Your whole existence is at fault.

178
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:55,076
How much more do I have to be sorry?

179
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,106
Stop acting so nice!

180
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,606
It's so annoying!

181
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,746
- Why did you do it? 
 - Do what?

182
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,266
Are you doubting me, too?

183
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,996
I just want to know the truth.

184
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,146
Why are their phones coming out of your bag?

185
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:17,456
I don't know about Chunsik's.

186
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:20,856
But Yena's, I think Yena did it.

187
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,856
Why didn't you tell me?

188
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:26,166
- That you saw Lee Yena yesterday? 
 - That...

189
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:30,666
Yena asked me to keep it a secret.

190
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,696
Is everyone knowing a secret?

191
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,906
I need to know the truth to know whether to help you or not.

192
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,856
The truth...

193
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,866
I did say it! That I didn't steal it!

194
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,566
Why do you keep causing trouble by yourself?!

195
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:42,906
Now what?

196
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:46,016
Everybody has proof to believe that you did it.

197
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:49,166
Lee Seulbi,

198
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,026
do you not know what this situation is?

199
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:55,296
I know that you don't believe me.

200
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,976
That's not it.

201
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:10,916
It must be painful to even breathe. Please finish whatever you have to do quickly and then get hospitalized.

202
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,886
If I don't see my grandson, then I'll really won't be able to breathe.

203
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,736
I need to see that rascal,

204
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:20,316
to know that I'm still alive.

205
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,866
I rested well.

206
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,286
Did you do well during the teacher's conference?

207
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,606
What did Lee Seulbi say?

208
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,836
She said she didn't do it until the end.

209
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:33,866
She got community service because she didn't apologize.

210
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,856
She's stronger than I thought.

211
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,736
She's braver than you, Chunsik.

212
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:44,016
What's going to happen if she says she didn't do it and keeps asking me?

213
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:47,316
Why are you asking me this? You did it.

214
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:48,596
I did?

215
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:49,786
You guys made me...

216
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,556
In some circumstances, a beating is the best.

217
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,966
Protect your face.

218
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:22,726
Ko Chunsik, did you get hit again?

219
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:30,546
The phone in Seulbi's bag,

220
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,876
was it Choi Jaeseok?

221
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:33,956
No.

222
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,486
Then, was it you?

223
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,146
No.

224
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:40,546
Did Choi Jaeseok make you do it? Say it properly!

225
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,376
I lost it. Really.

226
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:44,636
I know nothing.

227
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:46,706
She got framed because of you.

228
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,706
I lost the phone and it was me who got beat up by Jaeseok.

229
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:53,566
I am the victim.

230
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,656
You keep getting beaten up because you keep running away!

231
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:59,916
Don't you realize you're creating another victim?

232
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,006
Are you okay?

233
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,556
Who did it?

234
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:10,136
I didn't do it.

235
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:14,486
You didn't do it, right?

236
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:17,286
You need to tell the truth in order for me to help you.

237
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:19,506
What can I get from your help?

238
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,126
Why are being like this to me when you stole it?

239
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:21,976
You...

240
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:23,726
Go away. This is my job.

241
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:26,306
Go away? Do you even know who made you like this?!

242
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,796
Let's treat your wounds first.

243
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:35,896
I'm going crazy.

244
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:38,706
I didn't steal it.

245
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:46,216
Seulbi, I'm waiting for the day you apologize to your friends.

246
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,716
The truth didn't get revealed yet.

247
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:52,246
I won't accept the fact that you only believe Lee Yena and Ko Chunsik's words.

248
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:54,866
It's not that I don't believe Seulbi,

249
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:55,826
the proof has already come out.

250
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:58,376
What if that evidence is a result of someone threatening another person?

251
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,216
Doubt...

252
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:03,196
creates more doubt.

253
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:08,326
You can leave now.

254
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,406
"Lee Seulbi, you bitch."

255
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,146
"Why are you living, Lee Seulbi?"

256
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,256
"Lee Seulbi, die."

257
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,356
Hey! Do you steal trash now, too?

258
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:11,106
How can I go to school when I'm too scared to come?

259
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:12,726
This isn't a trash can.

260
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,406
So shameless.

261
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,976
Let's go and not talk with a criminal.

262
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,976
Let's go.

263
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,846
I should clean my locker.

264
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,336
It's too dirty.

265
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:41,306
Right?

266
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:43,336
I know it's not you.

267
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:44,946
Really?

268
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,026
Thanks.

269
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,906
You guys worked hard, too.

270
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:26,186
Yeah. I beat up Chunsik.

271
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:31,466
I never gave the thought that you beat up Chunsik.

272
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:35,126
Then, what was that glare you gave that said you didn't believe me?

273
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:38,116
Isn't it you who doesn't believe me?

274
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:42,536
That's not it. I don't even know how this situation was created.

275
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,326
I don't want this to be unfair to you.

276
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:47,306
If you believe me, this won't be unfair.

277
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,096
Grandma!

278
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,216
Hey! Lee Seulbi!

279
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,386
Hey!

280
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:57,446
No, this wasn't it.

281
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,536
Ugh! Really!

282
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,436
Ms. Gong, why did you come so late?

283
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:03,916
Didn't you miss me?

284
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,916
I came because I missed you.

285
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:11,866
But, Seulbi, are you hurt anywhere?

286
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:16,506
No.

287
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,876
I ate well.

288
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,796
Since when did Seulbi leave leftovers?

289
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,246
Perhaps, did you guys fight?

290
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,616
Fight?

291
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,916
Wow, this is so yummy.

292
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,356
Why do you leave food?

293
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,726
Ms. Gong's homemade food is the best!

294
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,896
Eat a lot.

295
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:50,706
Psycho Shin Woohyun, I don't like you.

296
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,806
What's wrong with this?

297
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,426
It won't get any clearer even if you wipe it.

298
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:02,936
Senior...

299
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,756
It means you're slowly disappearing...

300
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:07,916
What does that mean?

301
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,176
I told you to swear to the Black Note.

302
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:15,536
You're not an angel nor a human right now.

303
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:20,236
Hurry and swear; or else, you'll disappear.

304
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:24,656
What's the reason for staying as a human after being criticized as a thief?

305
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,716
That's because there's a misunderstanding.

306
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:33,506
You asked why angels returned their Black Note and became human, right?

307
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,566
Because they loved a human?

308
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,356
Right.

309
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:40,106
And that's why everyone became unhappy at the end.

310
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:44,056
Why do you become unhappy if you love a human?

311
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:47,876
Human love always changes.

312
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:49,936
Change?

313
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,406
♫  That's not how I feel...  ♫

314
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:03,086
If it's money, I can repay it. How can I repay the scar I gave you?

315
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:09,626
♫   That's not even in my heart, I've never hated you   ♫

316
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:14,466
♫  I hope our love will never change  ♫

317
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:21,256
♫  I hope we will always smile  ♫

318
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:23,036
♫   Thank you.  ♫

319
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:31,266
♫  So far (So far) so many things have happened  ♫

320
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:38,526
♫  It's tiring (It's tiring). Things have happened  ♫

321
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:44,466
♫  Love is still so hard for us  ♫

322
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:50,526
College fee, living expenses,

323
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,286
wedding expenses,

324
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,996
house...

325
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:11,106
- Hello. 
  - The customer you are calling is unavailable

326
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:15,586
 - for your call to not be connected at this time.   
 - Ugh! What are you saying!

327
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:20,606
Woohyun's dad, pick up your phone, please!

328
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,026
Seriously, you guys.

329
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:57,726
Oh no. Since you don't have a desk, I guess you'll have to go home.

330
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,526
Why do you even bother to study?

331
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:02,996
You'll probably become rich by stealing anyway.

332
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:05,826
Since it's hard for you guys to move a desk,

333
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:08,886
and it's hard for me to bring it back,

334
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:12,286
so let's not play these games.

335
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:17,796
Isn't she too shameless?

336
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:22,806
She's really bold.

337
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:27,116
Isn't it bad to be too bold?

338
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:31,726
Why are you doing this to Seulbi?

339
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:35,236
She didn't apologize even though she stole something.

340
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,916
It's natural that this would happen.

341
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,996
You better go and tell the truth now. It's for your own good.

342
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,236
What truth?

343
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:44,966
Why do you only help and play with Lee Seulbi?

344
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,446
- There's undeniable proof! 
 - Proof?

345
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:51,496
I told you to stop doing childish things! This is a crime!

346
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,006
The criminal is Lee Seulbi!

347
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:58,096
Why do I only like Lee Seulbi?

348
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:03,806
She's completely different from you guys! Are you satisfied now?

349
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,896
♫  If you want to be my love  ♫

350

♫  Every day I want to see you  ♫

351
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:29,036
Just go home for today.

352
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:33,236
I'm not going, because I didn't do anything wrong.

353
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:35,176
Even though you act like this, nothing is going to be fixed.

354
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:38,176
If I run away, nothing is going to be fixed either.

355
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,636
Please just listen to me.

356
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,856
The more you try to get involved, the worse it gets.

357
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,646
Please move.

358
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,526
It's hard for you.

359
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:57,466
It's only hard because you don't believe me.

360
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:59,676
It's not that I don't believe you, idiot!

♫  You're my only one  ♫

369

00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,926
Attention! Bow.

373
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,826
Hello.

374
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,826
Let's be on time.

375
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:11,996
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:21,166
What's with this atmosphere? Open your books.

377
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:33,316
Is it a thing to be late to my class?

378
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:35,856
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:37,756
Go outside.

380
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:22,246
Here! The lesson fee that you lost.

381
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,446
If you need an apology, I'll apologize instead. I'm sorry.

382
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,096
Why do you have to apologize? It's fine.

383
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:33,126
It's my fault for not protecting it well.

384
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:38,746
You were really surprised, too. Right? Because Seulbi is like that.

385
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:41,456
Why did you meet Lee Seulbi that day?

386
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:43,796
Why did you ask to keep it a secret?

387
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,426
I didn't ask to keep it a secret!

388
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:49,116
Seulbi asked me to meet her, so I went.

389
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:56,706
It's a favor, but since I returned your money, don't bother Seulbi anymore.

390
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:02,006
Woohyun!

391
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:32,366
What are you guys doing? Are you crazy?

392
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:37,796
I just wanted her to drink some milk and become white.

393
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,466
She stole and doesn't even apologize.

394
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:42,296
Isn't that more crazy?

395
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:45,826
They say people play together. Since you're protecting a thief,

396
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:47,346
are you also a thief?

397
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:49,166
You...

398
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:54,126
Woohyun!

399
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:58,836
A guy like you needs a beating!

400
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:02,376
I told you I'm not going to tolerate things from now on!

401
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,626
Stop it!

402
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:07,096
Get your mind together!

403
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,696
I said get your mind together!

404
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:12,946
Move!

405
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:14,786
- Let go! 
 - Get a hold of yourself!

406
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,186
I said let go!

407
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,546
Everybody! All stop!

408
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:30,866
You don't want to study...

409
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:35,906
But you have time, is that why you fight?

410
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:39,956
You're first in class, you're last.

411
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:42,736
And you're in the middle like—

412
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:46,846
You're a full set. What are you, a Chuseok gift set?
  (T/N: Chuseok - Korean Thanksgiving Day)

413
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:48,566
Look at my face.

414
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,686
I got hit one-sidedly by Shin Woohyun!

415
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:53,796
Exactly! My goodness, what do we do with this?

416
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:55,706
Hey! Why did you hit him?

417
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,976
Choi Jaeseok was being mean.

418
00:29:57,976 --> 00:30:00,236
Isn't it mean to beat up a kid for being mean?

419
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:04,346
Teacher, if you were Woohyun, you would've also beaten him up.

420
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:07,026
Hey, Sungyeol, why are you also like this?

421
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:12,206
Is school easy because your homeroom teacher says yes to everything?

422
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:16,216
You three bring your parents. Got it?

423
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:31,996
I'm not going to do anything.

424
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:37,766
- Sorry. 
 - I'm sure you didn't do anything.

425
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:44,036
But in order to protect you, Shin Woohyun keeps getting mad and gets involved in fights.

426
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,446
It's going to get a lot harder.

427
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:53,036
If you keep getting involved, both you and Seulbi will have a hard time.

428
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:57,236
Are you telling me to just keep watching them bother her?

429
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,216
Don't you know that Choi Jaeseok let you hit him on purpose?

430
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:03,136
To get me in trouble?

431
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:06,506
Then... Seulbi, also because of me?!

432
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:10,076
Aren't you thinking?  Use your head.

433
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,746
You...

434
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:14,546
Keep talking.

435
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:17,936
Lee Yena likes you, so she'll push Seulbi.

436
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:20,086
Choi Jaeseok hates the sight of you.

437
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,716
So he'll bother Seulbi like now.

438
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:27,776
In conclusion, Choi Jaeseok is smarter than you.

439
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:28,846
Choi Jaeseok, this jerk!

440
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,476
Please think! It's going to get harder for Seulbi.

441
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,766
That surprised me.

442
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,066
Why did you tell them to bring their parents?

443
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,516
Whether they fight or cause trouble, I am the one who is responsible.

444
00:31:46,516 --> 00:31:49,146
You really don't know anything.

445
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:54,686
Are you going to take responsibility if Jaeseok's father sees his face and forms a School Violence Countermeasure Committee?

446
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:57,896
We have to take care of it first.

447
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:01,636
If this goes wrong, they could even get expelled for this incident.

448
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:05,466
Isn't that because you are not strict with them?

449
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,946
What do I do then?

450
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:13,966
You have to confine it well.

451
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,856
And to do that,

452
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:18,966
 we just need to say that everything is Woohyun's fault.

453
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,926
What is it?

454
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:32,846
Didn't you say that you didn't want to see me anymore?

455
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:39,686
Woohyun's mother,

456
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:44,456
I kept what you sent me and I've saved a bit.

457
00:32:44,456 --> 00:32:50,576
This much will be enough to pay the tuition for university and a store, too.

458
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:53,366
Why are you giving these to me?

459
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:55,286
Daughter-in-Law,

460
00:32:55,286 --> 00:33:00,416
could you take care of my Woohyun?

461
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,156
I know it is hard for you and I know your situation as well,

462
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:07,466
but you are the only one who can do it.

463
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:13,576
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

464
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:16,066
I have a situation.

465
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:20,266
I have to go far away for some time.

466
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:23,156
I really can't understand you.

467
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:25,436
Talk with Woohyun's father.

468
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,946
Hey, I did talk with him.

469
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:32,866
No, I was going to talk with him...

470
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:38,296
Were you not able to contact him, by any chance?

471
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,346
There's really no one but you.

472
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:44,356
For my Woohyun, there's only you...

473
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,326
How can I do it if his father can't?

474
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:50,836
It has been only a little over a year since I've made my own family.

475
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:54,486
If you can understand his father, please do so with me, too.

476
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:58,016
Daughter-in-Law!  Daughter-in-Law!

477
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:22,466

478
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:37,266
So, that's why I have to go to your school?

479
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:49,586
Wow. I get called to school because you got into a fight.

480
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:54,416
Are you really my son?

481
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:59,526
Who made you change like this? I want to go see him.

482
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,246
What about Mom?

483
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:05,796
I thought she might be worried, so I didn't tell her.

484
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:09,696
She'll find out tomorrow anyway when she sees me at school.

485
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:14,566
She will be teaching when you come. If you come and go quietly, she won't notice.

486
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:21,666
Until when are you going to keep your relationship with her a secret, anyway?

487
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:31,466
Okay, I'll wait.

488
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:35,896
What is this?

489
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:40,886
This brat...

490
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:44,586
Hey, she bought this thinking of you.

491
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:50,436
Drink this.

492
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:53,586
 Supper's ready.

493
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:56,086
Okay. Coming.

494
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:02,966
Drink all of these, okay?

495
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:05,666
You should help me since I helped you, too.

496
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,166
That is fair. Okay? Hurry up and

497
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,486
come out.

498
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:29,966
When I watched dramas, it was so frustrating and strange when the heroines couldn't do anything and were unfairly wronged.

499
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:32,966
But I am like that now.

500
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:37,166
I really can't do anything.

501
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:41,156
Woohyun is having a hard time because of me.

502
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:51,986
In dramas, the main guy always makes the girl happy, but what am I doing right now?

503
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:07,966
Seulbi left first, saying she had class duties.

504
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:24,056
"Grandmother..."

505
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:27,426
Hey, what does this say?

506
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:33,436
"Grandma, please come to your child's school by 2:00 p.m. today."

507
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:38,636
"Though your child practiced justice, since there was a problem with the method, the teacher requests to see you."

508
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:40,716
Hey! You wretched punk!

509
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:44,866
My goodness. Really.

510
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,866
Are your parents coming?

511
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,866
My dad. He wants to see you.

512
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:54,496
I was the one who was beaten, so why?

513
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:56,596
He says he's coming to see how badly beaten you guys were.

514
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:58,926
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

515
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:02,916
Ugh, Ms. Gong will kill me.

516
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,346
When my father comes today, it's the end for you.

517
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:07,806
Do whatever you want.

518
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:09,826
Ms. Gong has my back as well.

519
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:13,456
She's not easy. Tell your father

520
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:15,706
to prepare himself.

521
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,236
What are you going to do?

522
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:23,466
Woohyun's grandma...

523
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:32,366
Those jerks! Really!

524
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,616
My goodness. I'm sorry.

525
00:38:59,616 --> 00:39:01,066
I'm really sorry.

526
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:07,516
No. It's nothing. I'm sorry for making you come on this hot day.

527
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:10,786
Grandmother!

528
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,806
Hello.

529
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:15,166
Aren't you the policeman?

530
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,756
But why are you here?

531
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:21,176
My son... He caused trouble.

532
00:39:21,176 --> 00:39:23,886
My goodness, you're like me.

533
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:26,366
Our Puppy made trouble, too.

534
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:31,386
Then the guy who Sungyeol was talking about... is Woohyun?

535
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:37,006
Oh... You two already knew each other...

536
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:41,416
Oh, yeah, and Lee Seulbi...

537
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,256
Ah, yes! Seulbi.

538
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,746
She's still living at my house.

539
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:50,136
But what did Woohyun do wrong?

540
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:57,166
Oh that... My son... I heard he hit Woohyun.

541
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:59,286
I'm sorry.

542
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:03,206
Woohyun wasn't the one who did the hitting?

543
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:07,176
Oh my! It's all right! It's normal for kids to fight.

544
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,976
It's not okay at all!

545
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:11,966
Jaeseok's father, whose son was hit by Shin Woohyun, doesn't think it's okay at all.

546
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:15,176
W-What?

547
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:18,306
Woohyun hit who?

548
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:37,356
The fighting scandal were you guys?

549
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:43,666
And Sungyeol, too?

550
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:47,126
I'm really sorry.

551
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:49,106
Please let it go once.

552
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:53,166
Jaeseok's father, Woohyun is reflecting on this very much.

553
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:06,786
You brat!

554
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,986
Are you a gangster? Why are you hitting your friends?

555
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:12,876
My goodness. Because of you, I can't live.

556
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:15,316
Instead, let's die. Both you and me.

557
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:17,416
My goodness.

558
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,666
My goodness.

559
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,086
Really. Please. Please overlook this just this once.

560
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:26,036
Please. Please forgive us.

561
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:33,406
Jaeseok's father, a respected elder is even like this, I'll request a favorable response.

562
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,246
Those kinds of kids grow up and become the evils of society.

563
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,856
Isn't a school the place to cut these bad seeds and properly teach them?

564
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:43,816
Jaeseok's father, your words are too harsh.

565
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:46,426
Please. Please overlook this once. Please.

566
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:48,466
Grandma.

567
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:54,366
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:02,966
I did wrong.

569
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:08,926
Choi Jaeseok is absolutely not a kid to just stand there and get beaten.

570
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,396
He deserved to be hit for what he did!

571
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:14,896
If Woohyun didn't hit him, I would have!

572
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:16,816
Hwang Sungyeol!

573
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:18,426
You guys. Go back to class now.

574
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:19,766
Hurry!

575
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:23,956
Wow, your grandmother is amazing.

576
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:28,186
Does she not know how to give up or does she have no common sense?

577
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:32,946
There's nothing money can't buy. Didn't you know?

578
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,876
Does your grandmother have some money?

579
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:37,376
You jerk!

580
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:42,286
Is money all you can brag about?

581
00:42:44,846 --> 00:42:47,876
My fist is a waste on you.

582
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:54,096
We'll make sure the culprit apologizes, so...

583
00:42:54,096 --> 00:42:55,706
Jaeseok's father, please calm down.

584
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,306
Is this a situation to be calm over!?

585
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:02,476
I'm the ethics teacher, Ahn Jihye.

586
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:05,636
Like you said, Shin Woohyun

587
00:43:05,636 --> 00:43:09,236
did hit Choi Jaeseok; however,

588
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:14,116
for it to go to expulsion, it can only be seen as your retaliation.

589
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:18,256
Choi Jaeseok's cheating incident,

590
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:20,386
you easily bypassed it.

591
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:23,316
Teacher Ahn, why are you being like this!?

592
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:24,556
Jaeseok's father

593
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:27,856
said he'll redo the gym's floor and the grass—

594
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:31,836
Gym Teacher! Really...

595
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:46,866
It's all my fault.

596
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:53,986
I was criticized as a thief and was a victim of Choi Jaeseok's bullying.

597
00:43:54,916 --> 00:44:00,836
Woohyun and Sungyeol were trying to help me, and got into a fight with Jaeseok.

598
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:05,316
If someone's getting expelled,

599
00:44:05,316 --> 00:44:08,746
it should be me and Jaeseok.

600
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:17,216
As for my son's bad morals, I will take care of it as I see fit.

601
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:20,596
Teacher Han, take care of the rest.

602
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:22,946
Jaeseok's father!

603
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:24,296
Father?

604
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:27,006
We will take care of it well.

605
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:30,546
Please don't worry and leave safely.

606
00:44:39,956 --> 00:44:41,876
Seulbi!

607
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:43,736
Go to Woohyun.

608
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:45,416
He's probably not feeling well.

609
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,456
Yes, why don't you go? I can take care of Grandmother.

610
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:52,286
Then, please take care of her.

611
00:44:54,556 --> 00:44:56,176
I'll give you a ride to your home.

612
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:59,556
My goodness, I can go by myself.

613
00:45:01,146 --> 00:45:03,206
Honey, you're awesome.

614
00:45:08,356 --> 00:45:12,196
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

615
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:15,226
We live in the same direction anyway.

616
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:17,566
Oh, wait.

617
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:20,816
That... teacher...

618
00:45:20,816 --> 00:45:22,306
Yes?

619
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:27,536
Ah! You mean the really pretty and cool teacher from before?

620
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:29,676
Uh, yes.

621
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:33,386
She's my wife.

622
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:38,636
Are you okay?

623
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:42,146
Should I take you to the hospital?

624
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,506
My goodness!  My goodness!

625
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:50,606
Oh my, how can this be?!

626
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:52,376
My goodness.

627
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:58,496
Damn it. Whenever there's a conflict, my intestines get all screwed up.

628
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:00,776
Oh my! I'm so sorry!

629
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:02,946
Oh! Oh!

630
00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:06,916
Oh, this won't do!

631
00:46:08,986 --> 00:46:10,166
No, this isn't it.

632
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:13,516
Oh, what do I do!

633
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:16,766

634
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:21,786
Shin Woohyun should have also been expelled.

635
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:23,606
We were so close.

636
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:26,776
Such a waste.

637
00:46:26,776 --> 00:46:28,146
What about Chunsik?

638
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:30,606
I taught him a lesson.

639
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:33,806
The moment he opens his mouth, his life is at an end.

640
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:36,426
Chunsik was the guy that put his phone into Lee Seulbi's bag.

641
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,616
So even if he were to say anything, he would have to say that he did it. Right?

642
00:46:39,616 --> 00:46:43,296
Right! Right! RIght!

643
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:44,976
Take it easy.

644
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:48,686
Don't you know, "Too much, too bad?"

645
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:50,266
You guys are also curious, right?

646
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,836
As to what will happen to you guys?

647
00:46:51,836 --> 00:46:53,536
You guys—

648
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:55,646
H-Hold on, y-you kids—

649
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,346
Round two is coming. You guys wait for a little bit...

650
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:01,786
Wait!

651
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:07,086

652
00:47:07,086 --> 00:47:10,106
2-3 class Shin Woohyun. Discipline:  Probation 7 days. Community Service: 20 hours.

653
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,676
How in the world?

654
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:38,256
How could this happen?

655
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:42,426
My goodness. What's going to happen to Our Puppy?

656
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,896
Oh my world.

657
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:45,816
Grandma.

658
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:48,796
Oh, you guys are back.

659
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,226
Grandma.

660
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:56,226
I understand your feelings,

661
00:47:56,226 --> 00:47:58,216
How could I not know?

662
00:47:58,216 --> 00:48:01,236
But fix your anger problems.

663
00:48:01,236 --> 00:48:04,276
Don't make unfair situations.

664
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:08,226
As you live, you'll realize that this world is filled with unfairness.

665
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:09,886
Do you understand?

666
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,476
Yes.

667
00:48:11,476 --> 00:48:14,556
I'm tired, I'm going to rest for a bit.

668
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,576
My goodness.

669
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:26,506
My goodness.

670
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:30,406
Oh my.

671
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:33,196
I'm sorry.

672
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:37,306
I shouldn't have come here.

673
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:41,006
Oh my, what makes you say that?!

674
00:48:41,006 --> 00:48:44,266
It's because of me that

675
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:47,026
you and Woohyun are unhappy.

676
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:49,206
No, we're not unhappy!

677
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:53,736
What do you see us as? You be happy.

678
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:56,566
Then we won't be unhappy.

679
00:48:59,926 --> 00:49:02,176
It's fine.

680
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:25,326
What are you doing here?

681
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:29,266
I just... wanted to look at the sky.

682
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:35,996
- Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

683
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:40,086
It's because of me that you can't attend class,

684
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:43,366
and you also got hit by milk and got cursed at.

685
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:45,796
And the community service...

686
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,626
Sorry.

687
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:48,756
I'm sorry.

688
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:51,276
I'm also sorry.

689
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:52,476
For not being able to protect you from trouble,

690
00:49:52,476 --> 00:49:56,186
for getting mad and fighting.

691
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:58,686
I only made it worse for you.

692
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:01,646
In the end, I wasn't able to do anything for you.

693
00:50:01,646 --> 00:50:05,396
You've done so many things for me!

694
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:08,696
I know you didn't hit Chunsik.

695
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:11,756
And I know you didn't steal.

696
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:23,376
Should we make a promise?

697
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:25,676
What kind of promise?

698
00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:30,206
That no matter what happens, that we'll trust each other.

699
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:34,496
♫  Walking I brush by you  ♫

700
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:39,856
♫  The soft winds  ♫

701
00:50:39,856 --> 00:50:43,886
♫  Looking at you  ♫

702
00:50:43,886 --> 00:50:48,486
♫  Your cut off expression  ♫

703
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:50,956
From now on, I'll protect you.

704
00:50:51,856 --> 00:50:54,386
And I'll make you happy.

705
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:56,576
Both you and Grandmother.

706
00:51:11,356 --> 00:51:15,406
Did you see what would happen if you remained in the human world?

707
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:22,226
In order to protect you, the humans around you will end up going through more trouble.

708
00:51:22,226 --> 00:51:24,666
And it will be very painful.

709
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:28,746
And that's how they change. Both you and the human.

710
00:51:28,746 --> 00:51:31,126
So...

711
00:51:31,126 --> 00:51:34,496
will we be unhappy?

712
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:41,426
Stop now, and come back to your rightful place.

713
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:01,406
 You jerk!

714
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:03,476
 You deserve to get hit!

715
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:29,626
Thank you.

716
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:32,696
Please find happiness, Woohyun.

717
00:52:48,056 --> 00:52:52,266
♫  It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days  ♫

718
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:56,486
♫  I’m still not used to this kind of life  ♫

719
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:59,396
♫  When I’m with you  ♫

720
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:04,776
♫  The stars twinkle even during the day  ♫

721
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:08,096
 What happens to an angel that becomes a human?

722
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:12,126
 Do they save the human they love and return to an angel?

723
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:15,016
 I told you too late, I'm sorry.

724
00:53:15,016 --> 00:53:18,116
 I have to go back now.

725
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:20,536
 A love triangle?

726
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:21,986
 It seems like you'll be thrown away.

727
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:25,946
 Aren't you Woohyun's mom?

728
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:29,026
 Stay well, Woohyun.

729
00:53:29,026 --> 00:53:31,466
 I'm going to miss you.
