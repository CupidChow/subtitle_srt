1
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:54,683
The nurse said that she'll be okay. Don't worry too much.

2
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,913
Sungyeol...

3
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:03,943
Teacher...

4
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:16,513
Woo... Woohyun.

5
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,693
Did you have to do all this?

6
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:28,593
You saw your mom's face thanks to it.

7
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:30,913
I told you I didn't want to see it.

8
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:32,813
What more do you want?

9
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:36,333
You and your mom should disappear from me.

10
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,943
You should back off if you don't want to see me.

11
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:43,733
You know something about Seulbi, right?

12
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:47,713
What exactly are you hiding?

13
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:51,743
The teacher is looking for you. Go inside.

14
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:04,533

15
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,633
I told you not to fight.

16
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,363
It wasn't a fight.

17
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,463
It was an apology.

18
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,853
It's not your fault.

19
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:23,723
To me, the mom who I imagined was somewhere, suddenly appeared, but

20
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:28,843
Sungyeol probably feels like the person he trusted as a mom was taken from him now.

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,723
But our Our Puppy's handsome face...

22
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,623
Should I go hit him?

23
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:38,163
It doesn't hurt at all! It's all better!

24
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:51,933
Are you looking for me?

25
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:59,083
How can you do this?!

26
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,713
What do you want?

27
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,753
For everything to revert back to normal.

28
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:06,933
The more you do this, the more I want to stay with Woohyun.

29
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:12,333
Stay and see what happens to that guy.

30
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,113
It's going to get worse than what you saw today.

31
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,793
Senior you're like a devil.

32
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:21,173
You're the one that made me like this!

33
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:24,233
I'm not going to return as an angel.

34
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:28,553
I don't want to see you anymore.

35
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:30,383
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:42,423
All the words you said, you don't know

37
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,743
that's the most saddening.

38
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:58,563
Look at her flirt.

39
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:02,293
Their skinship is so gross.

40
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:08,263
This is totally like a newlywed's house.

41
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,563
The sesame smell is GREAT.

42
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:14,593
If high school students are already living together, what are you going to do when you become an adult?

43
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:23,603
Since you won't become an adult, you won't be able to do things like this.

44
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:25,803
I'm so pitiful to you.

45
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:32,233
If you guys dated, it wouldn't be as cool as me and Seulbi.

46
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,713
Instead of recording this, you should find love instead.

47
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,073
If you're going to record this, then take a proper picture of us, too.

48
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,103
Lee Seulbi,

49
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:53,603
being in a love triangle and living together,

50
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:56,653
your power is really amazing.

51
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:06,483
You seem really different from other people.

52
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,943
Of course.

53
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:09,393
She's my girlfriend.

54
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,743
Then, what's your relationship with Sungyeol?

55
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,353
You're wondering so much about another's life.

56
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:17,693
Hey, get some confidence in yourself.

57
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,663
Don't you think you'll have some somewhere?

58
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,353
You don't have any.

59
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:24,763
If you're going to stay...

60
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,043
Here.

61
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,033
Clean over there.

62
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,793
Eat lots.

63
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:51,833
Don't do anything dangerous.

64
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,283
Just wait and see,

65
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:56,013
it's starting from now.

66
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:12,583
Is your body okay?

67
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,473
What exactly are you thinking?

68
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:19,883
Just being around Woohyun all the time...

69
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:24,543
I really don't like you.

70
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:27,593
I don't like how you keep creating these kinds of situations,

71
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:30,793
or how I don't know what you're doing.

72
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:35,143
And above everything,

73
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:38,303
I don't want Woohyun and Sungyeol to get hurt.

74
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:40,593
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,593
Come to our house.

76
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,003
What?

77
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:54,523
Don't let Woohyun have a hard time while you're living together,

78
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,303
and come.

79
00:06:56,303 --> 00:07:01,633
There's no other solution but this to calm the rumor.

80
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,153
I don't see the reason

81
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:06,523
of why there's a problem with living with Woohyun.

82
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:10,203
The world isn't that generous.

83
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,683
You two living together;

84
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,053
honestly, even I didn't like it that much.

85
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:20,213
I promised that I'd be with Woohyun

86
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:22,933
under any circumstances.

87
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:28,193
Is your wish to make Woohyun and Sungyeol have a hard time?

88
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:32,343
Sungyeol is only going to torture Woohyun more.

89
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,573
Is that what you want?

90
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:40,583
Think carefully.

91
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,103
Byungwook isn't picking up his phone.

92
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,303
Then call him until he does.

93
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,833
His battery may be dead.

94
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,483
Ugh, pick up please.

95
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,073
Isn't that Lee Dayool?

96
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:14,143

97
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,363
What is this?

98
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,223
Hey!

99
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,123
Aren't you going to call?

100
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,523
Never mind. Go to him directly.

101
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,063
What? Now?

102
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,693
He may not be home.

103
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:28,273
Go quickly and get him!

104
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,703
Okay.

105
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:48,113
What are you doing?!

106
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,323
- Give it to me. 
 - Give what?

107
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,723
The necklace! Give it back!

108
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,503
I threw it away.

109
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:58,403
Do you know what that was!?

110
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:00,463
What was it?

111
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:04,773
How far are you going to take this?!

112
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:06,363
To wherever you're taking this to.

113
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,573
What are you doing?!

114
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,323
You jerk!

115
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,023
Honey! Honey!

116
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:17,703
You! To your mom!

117
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,943
 How can you do this!?

118
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:47,163
Was he always like this even when I wasn't here?

119
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:49,893
No. Today, I did something wrong.

120
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:53,833
Today? Then, what about the other days?

121
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,423
No.. I was looking for something in Sungyeol's room.

122
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:59,223
Sungyeol doesn't like it when someone touches his stuff.

123
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,753
But still that rascal!

124
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,603
I did something wrong!

125
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:11,883
Honey, is Sungyeol still a stranger to you?

126
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,223
What are you talking about?

127
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:16,133
Why are you enduring this?

128
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,763
If he were your real son, would you still be like this?

129
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:23,753
I'm sorry. I'll talk it over with Sungyeol.

130
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:27,663
The time we spent getting to know each other...

131
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:32,593
 They would have needed time to get used to each other.

132
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:37,143
After his real mom got married and even though he was really upset, I made him angrier.

133
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:43,073
I will try to fix this myself, so please trust me.

134
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:47,663
Why is it so hard to raise him properly...

135
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,063
♫ If you want to be my love   ♫

136
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:09,993
 What do you think about me?

137
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:14,553
♫  I miss you.  ♫

138
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:21,233
♫  That you're the only one and that I'll embrace you prettily   ♫

139
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:28,223
♫  Everything will change  ♫

140
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,863
♫  You always told me   ♫

141
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:36,933
- Hey, I'm going to sleep first. 
 - Okay.

142
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:48,093
♫  But from when did I start to feel it changing a bit   ♫

143
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:56,733
♫ These other feelings that have been dirtied by your touch

144
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:00,933
What am I doing?

145
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:05,233
♫  I'll show them to you   ♫

146

♫  If you want to be my love, I want to be your star   ♫

147

♫  In one day, I want to see so many times   ♫

148
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:21,023
♫  Do you want to come closer so no one knows, 
but not awkwardly   ♫

149
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:24,043
If I stayed with Woohyun,

150
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,933
would Woohyun and Sungyeol really have a hard time?

151
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:31,803
Woohyun would probably like to live with his mom.

152
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:35,003
♫  If you want to be my love  ♫

153
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:50,833
Can you bring Seulbi to our home?

154
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:57,463
Weren't you going to apologize to your mom?

155
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,303
Why Seulbi all of a sudden?

156
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:10,163
There are a lot of rumors about Seulbi and Woohyun living without a guardian.

157
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,023
We can't bring Woohyun.

158
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:17,543
Apologize to your mom first! Apologize before asking a favor.

159
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,873
Honey.

160
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,863
I'm really disappointed in you.

161
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,953
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:36,603
Yeah. Yes. I'm sorry as well.

163
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:43,783
I'll let go of it this time.

164
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:48,723
But if you're like this again, I won't forgive you.

165
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,753
Yes.

166
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:58,693
Go over Seulbi's problem with your mom.

167
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:21,213
What are you thinking about?

168
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:25,733
I'm only thinking of what will hurt Woohyun the most.

169
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,633
Whether it's you or Woohyun, whatever I decide,

170
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:33,213
I'm a bad mom.

171
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,853
But you're really bad as well.

172
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,373
Then throw both of us away.

173
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,423
I don't want you to get hurt,

174
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:43,733
but I don't like it more if Woohyun's hurt.

175
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,323
Now you're telling the truth.

176
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:50,723
I'm not hurt. I'm only going to make your son get hurt.

177
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:05,773
 Are they still living together? Wow, they're brave.

178
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:08,553
 What is she doing with Shin Woohyun and Sungyeol?

179
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,023
 Is she crazy?

180
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,813
 She's really brazen-faced.

181
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,603
 How could they go so far?

182
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:19,843
 How can they come to school like that?

183
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,633
 They're really too much.

184
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:30,363
♫  Close you eyes, the one I know   ♫

185
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,403
The weather's nice but the music is nicer.

186
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:36,403
When did you prepare this?

187
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,153
The song is nice.

188
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:41,593
Of course. I chose it.

189
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,633
Do you like the song or do you like me?

190
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,163
You're so childish.

191
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:50,873
♫   Tonight...  ♫

192
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,553
Why does the teacher make us clean everything?

193
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:13,453
Hey, did you two still not make up yet? This love fight is going so long.

194
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:15,883
They fought?!

195
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:21,933
If you fight, you have to fight with your body.

196
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:25,303
I'll be the referee.

197
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,373
Why don't you put that away instead

198
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,753
The teacher wants you two to come.

199
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:37,373
- Why? 
 - I don't know. Go.

200
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:41,693
Is it cause Byungwook isn't here?

201
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:46,363
Oh! Yesterday, Dayool—

202
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,563
Close that mouth.

203
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:02,103
Don't waste your time and just finish quickly

204
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,833
Let's do it together.

205
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:10,443
Are you okay?

206
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,573
Don't try to get involved.

207
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:19,533
You really can't see anything right, can you?

208
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:24,023
I can see clearly though, you guys living together.

209
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,253
I'm sorry... because of me...

210
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:40,943
I guess that kid wanted to get out of cleaning duty. He should've told us honestly though.

211
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:03,433
Hearing from your mouth that we live together,

212
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,503
it felt weird.

213
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:13,103
Even if others said it, I still had confidence.

214
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:17,443
But when you say it, I feel sad.

215
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:22,583
If you don't want to hear that, leave that house.

216
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:26,153
You know best the situation Woohyun and I are in.

217
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:30,613
You know well Woohyun and my situation as well.

218
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:34,383
If you keep staying at that house, I'm going to reveal

219
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:37,253
the relationship between Woohyun and our teacher.

220
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:40,813
Don't you know why Woohyun's not revealing it?

221
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:42,513
It's because of you.

222
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:45,913
He doesn't want to steal anything from you.

223
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:49,193
Even though it was the mom that he always wanted,

224
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:52,303
it's because of you that he's not doing anything.

225
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:56,363
Now my weapon is you.

226
00:18:56,363 --> 00:19:00,533
So if you want to protect Woohyun, think carefully.

227
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,883
I already told Seulbi.

228
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:18,583
Since when

229
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,673
did you become concerned about us?

230
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:24,893
The neighborhood is also complaining now. It's not only the school.

231
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:30,463
And you will be comfortable if you take Seulbi from me and stick her next to Sungyeol?

232
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:33,153
It's dangerous for you two to live together.

233
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:36,193
We only have each other.

234
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:39,093
What exactly is too dangerous for us?

235
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:42,883
What do you think if a female student is living together with someone?

236
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,513
Take care of Seulbi and quickly send her over to me.

237
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:53,263
That's the best for Seulbi.

248

You feelings and my feelings, I locked them up inside here.

249
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,053
So they won't go anywhere.

250
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:32,723
I think I have to go.

251
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,483
Where?

252
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:36,163
To our teacher's home.

253
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,303
Why?

254
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,933
I don't want you to leave this place because of me.

255
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,943
I'm never leaving here.

256
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:44,233
So you shouldn't go either.

257

For a while now, my heart's only been seeing your feelings.

Pretending that everything is okay,

259
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,023
is not okay with me.

260
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:02,633
I locked our hearts here so it won't go anywhere.

261
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:03,873
Only my body will leave.

262
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,003
No.

263
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:07,163
Your body shouldn't leave either.

264
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:10,963
If you leave your heart here, you'll be hurt.

265
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:16,253
I want to protect you from the rumors and stares.

♫  It's you and I, us two   ♫

323
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:17,393
♫  A clear blue sky   ♫

324
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:22,643
♫  With new white clouds    ♫

325
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:27,083
♫  The warm breeze  ♫

326
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,523
♫  That passes   ♫

327
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:36,263
♫  Through our clothes. The Forsythia Rhododendron   ♫

♫   With a bright face  ♫

329
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:48,963
♫   Oh, you and I, it's the two of us  ♫

330
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:13,133
Hey, kids.

331
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:18,153
It's not good to see you like this at this late hour.

332
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:20,693
You should go back now.

333
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,683
All right. Goodbye.

334
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:28,543
You know what'll happen if you take Byungwook home

335
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:30,853
or let him sleep at your house. Right?

336
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:34,213
You be careful, too.

337
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:35,963
Hey, hang up.

338
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:42,353
What are you?

339
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:45,423
What is this? He's still a kid.

340
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:47,163
- Is this your friend? 
 - No.

341
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:49,223
- She's my girlfriend. 
 - I'm not.

342
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:51,353
Come over here for now.

343
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,593
Let's go.

344
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:56,033
What is this punk?!

345
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:58,753
This kid, really, you want to fight?!?

346
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:02,753
He's crazy!

347
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:05,613
Why are you like this?!

348
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:08,003
What is this?

349
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,963
He's a student! Don't hit him!

350
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:13,823
What is this?!

351
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:22,513
Here.

352
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:28,223
Your handsome face will get scars.

353
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,953
Here.

354
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:37,173
You'll get a cold. Go home.

355
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:50,293

356
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,203
Excuse me.

357
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:07,183
Hey, Byungwook! Hey! Hey!

358
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:10,153
Get up! Why are you like this?

359
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:15,353
Why are you like this?!

360
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,813
We're all here.

361
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:20,383
Sit here for a second.

362
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:26,423
Hey, Woohyun! Shin Woohyun, open the door!

363
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:28,713
Hey, why is he like this? What happened?

364
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:32,233
I don't know! He was passed out on the ground.

365
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,463
Open the door.

366
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:52,393
Endure it for just a little bit.

367
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:54,223
Okay, we're done.

368
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:59,843
I want to sleep here, too, before I go.

369
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:02,093
Go sleep at your house.

370
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:05,793
Seulbi's not here and I came because I thought you'd be lonely.

371
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:09,033
Hey, you need to give me a chance to be lonely.

372
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:12,543
But do you think he doesn't have to go to the hospital?

373
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:15,303
Don't we have to contact Byungwook's family?

374
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:18,923
Don't do it. I'll die.

375
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,093
Goodnight, Seulbi.

376
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:49,603
Did Woohyun come?

377
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:51,443
Where is he?

378
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,823
We must have missed each other...

379
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,723
What is your identity?

380
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,723
Why are you so curious about me all the time?

381
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,993
There can't be a part of you that I don't know of.

382
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,963
There can't be a part of you that only Woohyun knows!

383
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:17,033
What are you guys doing?

384
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:22,223
I will do it.

385
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:28,163
At this time, where...

386
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,853
Did you perhaps go to see Woohyun?

387
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,553
Don't go visit Woohyun from now on.

388
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:41,033
Don't even go to the store.

389
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,563
Even at school, I would like for you not to spend time with him.

390
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,963
Woohyun will have a hard time doing work at the store by himself.

391
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:51,613
Don't make it worse for Woohyun by provoking Sungyeol.

392
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:55,263
Let's live quietly.

393
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:59,083
Just stay out of it. Please.

394
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,303
Okay.

395
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,243
Give me your cell phone.

396
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:09,553
Besides at school, I'd like it if you didn't contact him.

397
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,763
But still, this is a bit...

398
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:15,123
Woohyun will wait.

399
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,713
Did you not understand what I said?

400
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,963
She's not even answering her phone. Lee Seulbi, really...

401
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:56,373
There's nothing wrong, right?

402
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:20,613
♫  Beginning of fall  ♫

403
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:27,163
♫  When it feels like it's cold but not  ♫

404
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:35,133
♫ You're wearing short clothes  ♫

405
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:41,403
♫  Even though it may be a little cold  ♫

406
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:50,003
♫  The season has passed  ♫

407
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,743
♫   And today when it's warm with all the sunshine  ♫

408
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:02,763
♫  Spring is here  ♫

409
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:13,163
♫  and your standing in front of me. You look at me   ♫

410
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:17,213
♫  And then smile  ♫

411
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:25,213
♫  I can't breathe  ♫

412
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:33,043
♫  Even your eyes are too much for me  ♫

413
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:41,673
♫  So I just stare at you like this  ♫

414
00:34:53,183 --> 00:34:56,773
Please... go quickly

415
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,073
Where are you touching?! Where?!

416
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:13,573
Where are YOU touching!?

417
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:16,263
You can't do this to me!

418
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:19,413
Hey, stop it. Ugh, it's so weird to imagine...

419
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,483
Stop!

420
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:25,893
What are you guys doing? I'm leaving first.

421
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:29,833
Hey! Now that you have a girlfriend, you don't even give breakfast to your friends?!

422
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:18,923
I didn't know if you eat breakfast but I made it anyway.

423
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:24,953
You shouldn't have. We just eat simply.

424
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:29,473
Oh... starting from tomorrow, I'll prepare a simple breakfast.

425
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:36,403
Don't. It's burdensome.

426
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,363
Eat.

427
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:56,673
There's nothing to worry about.

428
00:36:56,673 --> 00:37:00,253
The people who did something wrong don't care, so why are you worrying.

429
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:10,913
If there are leftovers, it's wasteful. Eat.

430
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:24,623
Sorry, but I'll get up first.

431
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:35,823
You're burning up! When did this start?

432
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,713
We'll be late for school. Let's go.

433
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:48,073
Where do you think you are going in this condition?

434
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:52,763
I took some medicine. Woohyun will be waiting.

435
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:55,123
Just rest today.

436
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:59,733
I want to go to school. Woohyun will be worried,

437
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:02,453
and I don't have my cellphone and can't contact him.

438
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,453
Woohyun. Woohyun.

439
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:08,003
How can you only see Woohyun?

440
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,893
 - Sungyeol!  
 - No.

441
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:26,193
Even when you go to school, I won't let you see Woohyun.

442
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:27,693
 Sungyeol, please.

443
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:30,723
If you don't want to see Woohyun get hurt, just stay there.

444
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:35,933
I won't go.

445
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:40,973
Then tell Woohyun that I'm okay, and call me.

446
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:52,903
If you want to see Woohyun, just get better fast.

447
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:15,993
Why are you alone? What about Seulbi?

448
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:19,733
Is Seulbi hurt?

449
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,763
Don't bother.

450
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,383
That punk...

451
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:30,423
Then Lee Seulbi, is she living with the Ethics teacher now?

452
00:39:30,423 --> 00:39:32,893
The Ethics teacher, isn't she honorable?

453
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,803
I finally have a chance.

454
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:38,513
Would it be a chance?

455
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:47,253
- Let's go to the snack shop. 
 - The shop is that way though.

456
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:48,553
What's with his expression?

457
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,033
Why are you asking me that?

458
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:55,193
Did you just raise your voice at me?

459
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:59,763
You know that you can't raise your voice at me like that.

460
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,893
I didn't.

461
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,533
What about Seulbi?

462
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,183
Seulbi? Why Seulbi?

463
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:26,233
If you're not even interested if she came to school or not, why did you take her in?

464
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:27,333
Why can't I call her?

465
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,253
I took her phone.

466
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:30,953
Give it to me.

467
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,893
In the morning she was getting ready for school with Sungyeol.

468
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,063
I said give me the phone.

469
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,463
Did you ask Sungyeol?

470
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:47,173
There's no way he would tell me.

471
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,143
Where are you going?

472
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:53,313
I have to go see if there's something wrong, if she's hurt.

473
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:56,223
I'll go just leave it. Oh,

474
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:59,803
Sungyeol's dad said he was going to pick up her clothes.

475
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:01,573
I still haven't...

476
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:05,773
haven't told him about you yet.

477
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:10,473
Please keep it a secret until you die.  Don't make me feel sorry for him.

478
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:12,353
He seemed like a good guy.

479
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:29,823

480
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:42,763

481
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:48,523
Give the phone to Seulbi. Why can't I even call her?

482
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:50,133
If you're curious, do you want to come to our house, too?

483
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,533
Stop being so cynical.

484
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:53,823
Don't you want to live with Mom, too?

485
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:55,623
Our house with your mother.

486
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:58,873
Should I? I should try living with my real mom once.

487
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:00,993
Seulbi is there, too, so it's nice.

488
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:08,743
Call Seulbi for me. Otherwise, I'll really go.

489
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,733
So busy.

490
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:36,533
Shin Woohyun's going to be rich, huh?

491
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:42,273
You can really tell that Seulbi's not here.

492
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:48,223
Give it to me.

493
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:53,453
Oh! Chunsik! Your partner didn't come?

494
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:57,583
Yeah. They went to study. I'll help.

495
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,473
Thanks.

496
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:08,563
What is this? I'm not letting you sleep here tonight.

497
00:43:08,563 --> 00:43:14,363
I'm not here to sleep. Shin Woohyun, go outside. Someone's waiting for you.

498
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:22,803
Woohyun, today my mother and I...

499
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:25,553
You had a fight with your mother?

500
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:28,823
Let me guess. It's too scary to sleep in the spa house,

501
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:31,643
you have too much pride to go back home,

502
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:35,003
so you want to stay at my house?

503
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:38,523
I know I did a lot to Seulbi and you,

504
00:43:38,523 --> 00:43:42,823
but I'll pay you back. Just for tonight.

505
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:45,083
Okay, come in.

506
00:43:50,073 --> 00:43:53,673
All these guys live with me, so it'll be fine. Right?

507
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:07,553
She's trying super hard to take Seulbi's spot, isn't she.

508
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:12,923
I'm the flag bearer, punk!

509
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:17,103
Hey! You rascal. That was expensive.

510
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:20,213
Go to your home. Do you think this is a hotel?

511
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:22,493
Hey, punk, I'm the flag bearer.

512
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,663
Why are you like— Hey! Hey! Hey!

513
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,563
Hey. Why are you like this? Hey!

514
00:44:28,563 --> 00:44:31,973
- You cheap bastard, my boiler is broken. 
- Hey!

515
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:35,083
I can't go home until the bruise on my face is gone. Hey!

516
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,333
My parents are on a trip and I'm scared to stay alone though...

517
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,733
Hey. Shin Woohyun. Hey!

518
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:57,033
Wow... what a mess.

519
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,433
Where are you going?

520
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:25,013
What is this? Hwang Sungyeol and Teacher live in the same house?

521
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:34,973
Are you sick? Do you need to go to the hospital?

522
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:38,163
I had a deal with Sungyeol.

523
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,223
Okay... rest.

524
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:45,093
Teacher,

525
00:45:45,863 --> 00:45:49,403
can't I make a call to him?

526
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:52,403
I think Woohyun is waiting a lot.

527
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:57,983
Woohyun took your phone. Go get it at school tomorrow.

528
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:00,863
Teacher.

529
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:07,153
Thank you for taking care of me.

530
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:12,193
Family is something you never forget even if you are separated.

531
00:46:12,193 --> 00:46:17,193
Woohyun thought about his mom every day while looking at his necklace.

532
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:25,113
Rest.

533
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:56,963
They came out of the same house.

534
00:46:56,963 --> 00:46:58,923
Ah, that's where Seulbi should be.

535
00:46:58,923 --> 00:47:01,733
- So what? 
 - Sungyeol's mother is the Ethics teacher?

536
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:05,853
If you're curious, ask Sungyeol for yourself.

537
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:09,973
It looks like you're also tense around the Ethics teacher. What kind of relationship do you two have?

538
00:47:09,973 --> 00:47:15,023
Hey, what kind of relationship do we have?

539
00:47:15,023 --> 00:47:19,863
I have a girlfriend. When you see me, are you interested?

540
00:47:19,863 --> 00:47:22,323
Does your heart flutter?

541
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:25,863
Don't get any closer, it's uncomfortable.

542
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:28,793
If you let Byungwook sleep here one more time,

543
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:31,973
this restaurant'll be crushed just like his face.

544
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:36,403
What can I clean your mouth with so that it's finally clean?

545
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:39,833
Hey. Do you want to die?

546
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:42,133
I'm so mad I can't see anything right now.

547
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:46,133
So I'm just waiting for one person to get caught, that'd be great.

548
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:49,063
Let's see who gets caught first.

549
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:51,393
This is fun.

550
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,793
It's is fun. Bye!

551
00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:21,443

552
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:41,603
 You know what Seulbi is, right?

553
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:29,053
Did you go to pick up her clothes?

554
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:45,393
His dad is in the States, so he had to be alone.

555
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:49,893
That bad mother that he didn't know about, was it really you?

556
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:57,813
Tell me. Why aren't you saying anything?

557
00:49:57,813 --> 00:50:01,753
- I was going to tell you. I was going to. 
 - When?

558
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:03,763
When I die?

559
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:07,993
I knew you'd be like this, so I had no confidence.

560
00:50:07,993 --> 00:50:12,413
I really don't know who you are.

561
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:20,613
I was more worried about how you thought of me than how I thought of myself.

562
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:26,523
You... are that really bad mother...

563
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:33,203
 So, now what are you going to do?

564
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:38,213
 What else are you hiding from me? Tell me!

565
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,803
Don't come in, Teacher and—

566
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,623
Woohyun..

567
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:51,533
Are you hurt anywhere?

568
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:53,453
No...

569
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:58,623
How did you come here?

570
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,703
Did you know there are five trees in front of your room?

571
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:05,123
Did you know that when the sun sets your room is the prettiest?

572
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:17,093
 You missed me, right?

573
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:24,053
 I missed you more.

574
00:51:28,243 --> 00:51:31,013
Now it won't be difficult for me anymore.

575
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:43,003
Why are you here?

576
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,203
I won't back out anymore.

577
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:05,663
♫  Friday feeling deep inside you, 
 You who I feel to be so completely different   ♫

578
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:08,733
♫  Sweet cherry bomb, chocolate candybar   ♫

579
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:13,883
 - There is something about Seulbi, after all. 
 - Close that mouth now. Forever.

580
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:14,983
 Don't you ever knock?!

581
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:17,993
 Hey! Why are you getting mad at Seulbi?

582
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:22,333
 I guess humans are often born to hurt others.

583
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:25,163
 - Hey! Go, go, go! 
 - What's your dream?

584
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:29,523
 Don't ask me what's at the end of the road because I don't know. .

585
00:52:29,523 --> 00:52:32,453
 If your tears are cold, it makes you sadder doesn't it?

586
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:36,313
 Just one person. There will definitely be one person who's happy because of you.

587
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:40,883
♫  You make my heart tremble, tremble...   ♫
