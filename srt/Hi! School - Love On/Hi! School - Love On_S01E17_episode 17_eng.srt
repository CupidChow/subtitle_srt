1
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,850
I think we can use it together.

2
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,210
Okay.

3
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,660
Please, leave.

4
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,460
You shouldn't be here.

5
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,960
Mister and Sungyeol are waiting for you.

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,280
Can't you also wait for me?

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,090

8
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,850
You worry about Sungyeol, don't you?

9
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,180
Woohyun and Sungyeol too... I wish we could all live together.

10
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,320
But it's like strangers becoming a family.

11
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,030
Woohyun and Sungyeol always being on each other's sides,

12
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,820
I wish we could live like that.

13
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,850
Could we?

14
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,110
Eventually.

15
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,500
My goodness. It's just us two again.

16
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,830
Whatever it is you want to do... don't try to get it if it breaks you.

17
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,050
I've come too far to stop.

18
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,410
So, just give up.

19
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,880
Just forget that I am your child.

20
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,560
Do you think a person can forget his own child?

21
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,180
Since the teacher helped us, shouldn't we do the same?

22
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,520
The person who has more should be the one looking over the one with less though.

23
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,180
But it's all because of us... She probably doesn't have a house or money.

24
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,610
If you give her a place to sleep...

25
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,490
Our house isn't somewhere anyone can sleep in.

26
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,280
But the ethics teacher isn't "anyone," she's your mom.

27
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,200
She's not my mom.

28
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,960
Do you know that you two are bad? If you both say that she's not your mom,

29
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,090
have you thought about how she might feel?

30
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,450
And if I acknowledge that she's my mom, what about Sungyeol?

31
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,710
If it's because of Sungyeol...

32
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,190
Sungyeol needs her. Someone he can call mom.

33
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,810
You need her, too! Can't you both call her mom?

34
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,900
At the restaurant you call people mom all the time, but why can't you now?

35
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,640
Humans are really weird!

36
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,790
Then, are all South Korean women my mom?

37
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,760
Everything can disappear in front of your eyes, is it satisfying?

38
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,030
It's not Seulbi.

39
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,070
Seulbi... What's her secret?

40
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,080
It's none of your business.

41
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,990
If I say something about Seulbi, will something even happen?

42
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,490
What are you guys talking about, making it seem so serious?

43
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,790
Don't do something you're going to regret.

44
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,180
It'd be best if you didn't provoke me.

45
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,540
Quiet!

46
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,610
Let's see here.

47
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,480
My good kids... You've grown a lot.

48
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,540
Where'd you go after you left us?

49
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,940
Do you know how much the substitute bothered us?

50
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,450
Okay...

51
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,110
I'm sorry. You guys are going to forgive me, right?

52
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,950
For free??!

53
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,440
You should buy us pizza, Teacher.

54
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,310
Ooooh! Chicken, chicken, too!!

55
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,180
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!!!!

56
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,750
Chicken!

57
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,500
Okay, okay, okay!

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,990
I'll do this to make you guys happy,

59
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,360
but... you have to do well on this test. Okay?

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,030
 Yes!

61
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,530
Here.

62
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,300
The money from the part-time job that you didn't get. 31,500 won. (about $30).

63
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,260
This... How did you...?

64
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,630
The owner seemed pretty sorry.

65
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,570
Thank you.

66
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,280
I thought of you sometimes.

67
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,650
Well, I thought of you every day.

68
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,100
- Let's treat each other well. 
 - Why are they like that??

69
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,610
The Ethics teacher must be frustrated, too.

70
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,260
Everyone sit down.

71
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,930
I can't see the questions.

72
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,360
What is this?

73
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,830
Wait! I can see it again!

74
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,410
The tests...

75
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,600
They've disappeared?

76
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,310
This time it's the whole test?

77
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,090
That's actually better.

78
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,380
Lee Seulbi, isn't it because of you?

79
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,780
Why is it Seulbi's fault that they disappeared?

80
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,860
You have supernatural powers though. Why don't you go find them?

81
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,300
What nonsense you're speaking.

82
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,090
Teacher, I found them.

83
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,850
What is this? 
   What?

84
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,620
Isn't it strange?

85
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,160
I think I saw Seulbi's wrist sparkle.

86
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,970
Hey! I was using a mirror to joke around~

87
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,150
Hey, no wonder.

88
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,390
I was just joking.

89
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,740
Hey, but you know Taeho got hurt and he can't open his eye.

90
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,880
I'll head over to eat lunch with Yena first.

91
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,840
Hey, Kisoo. Are you hungry?

92
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,870
Hey! I'm sensitive there.

93
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,300
Stop it!

94
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,480
Here, here, here.

95
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,230
It's fun, right? You must feel so smug.

96
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,850
If I'm not here, you would be eating alone. Let's eat together.

97
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,660
Stop acting nice. And you!

98
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,840
Something weird was sparkling.

99
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,980
Your nails are nice. Did you do them?

100
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,250
No, my mom. After doing these, she was so proud.

101
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,100
You're close with your mom.

102
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,430
You can't get close with a nagging queen.

103
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,500
But wait, why are you changing the topic? You're making me confused.

104
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,770
What's that on your wrist again?

105
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,580
Hey, girls, I want to join you for lunch.

106
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,500
Welcome.

107
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,380
Cutie, hi!

108
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,730
What's with you?

109
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,840
I need to find something out.

110
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,860
Hey, a hole's going to form from your staring. Stop it.

111
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,300
Seulbi, let's go get something to drink.

112
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,690
Geez, really now.

113
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,490
Mom, these guys are making me cry!

114
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,640
- Now, it's just us two. 
 - Hey, won't you let go?

115
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,490
I just need to check them out.

116
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,730
Let go of me!

117
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,580
I definitely saw it earlier.

118
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
It sparkled!

119
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,160
Hey, I have something to tell you.

120
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,770
Huh? In a bit, I'm almost done.

121
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,720
I like you, too!

122
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,930
Say that again.

123
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,910
Then, from today, it's day one as a couple!

124
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,330
What's going on?

125
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,770
A friend was saying that while her mom was painting her nails, she would listen to her nag

126
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,690
and chat with each other and get closer.

127
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,950
You want to get closer to me?

128
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,440
Why?

129
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,550
Because you are Woohyun's and Sungyeol's mom.

130
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,850
I'm not a person who has the right to be called mom.

131
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,990
Mom. Dad. They say you don't need a right to become those two.

132
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,630
You only need love.

133
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,890
You love both Woohyun and Sungyeol.

134
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,290
What is this?

135
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,800
I'll go find Woohyun.

136
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,710
Hey, what are you doing?

137
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,690
Don't erase it!

138
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,630
Hey, Lee Seulbi!

139
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,680
Hey, come here right now!

140
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,640
That little!

141
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,020
Seulbi has the ability to make people happy.

142
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,440
That is why Sungyeol must like Seulbi.

143
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,650
Don't be sorry.

144
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,280
At some point, Sungyeol will understand your feelings.

145
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,200
By telling all the students, does this mean that something more dangerous can happen in the future?

146
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,180
I'll clean it for you.

147
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,270
Hey, hurry up!

148
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,600
Try saying "Please clean it for me."

149
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,410
Will that be okay?

150
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,220
I will clean it for you~

151
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,830
I don't think you can act cute anywhere.

152
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,610
Why? Why won't it work?

153
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,330
Why? Why? Why? Why?

154
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,800
♫  It was the beginning of fall  ♫

155
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,530
♫  when it was cold but not really cold  ♫

156
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:24,060
♫  You seemed like you’d be cold  ♫

157
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,520
It would be great if this would get cleaned off.

158
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,100
What's wrong?

159
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,770
You're going to be okay. Don't worry too much.

160
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,170
♫  and today the sunshine is warm  ♫

161
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:56,620
♫   Spring has come and you’re in front of me  ♫

162
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,090
The answer key is gone?

163
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,930
Does that even make sense?

164
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,210
When you left school, did you not lock the cabinet?

165
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,960
That's right.

166
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,470
Oh, Jesus. One minute, I'll take out all of the CCTVs...

167
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,470
No. Did you notice any suspicious activity while the students were taking the test?

168
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,190
There is, isn't there? Who is it?

169
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,250
One moment, I need to find something.

170
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,620
Hey, I mean who is it?

171
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,410
What did she see?

172
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,710
Hey, was it you?

173
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,920
There was definitely something strange going on with you during the test.

174
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,770
You took the answer key, didn't you?

175
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,240
Is that true?

176
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,910
- Wow. 
 -  You really have no morals, do you?

177
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,590
Hey!

178
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,150
Are you guys writing a fantasy novel?

179
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,890
Do you have evidence that Seulbi did it?

180
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,990
- Hey, hand it over! Where is it? 
 - Give it to us!

181
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,830
- Where did you hide it? 
 - Hand it over!

182
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,200
Yesterday, I definitely saw the Ethics teacher take the answer key with her.

183
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,370
If you're going to complain, go and complain to the Ethics teacher.

184
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,100
The Ethics teacher is your mom, go ask her.

185
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,220
Or would she answer more kindly when her biological son asks her,

186
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,480
where the answer key is?

187
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,190
For you, it would be okay... since you're in last place anyway.

188
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,800
Wouldn't it be better for you to tell your parents that the answer key was stolen rather than that you got last place?

189
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,790
Don't go anywhere and stay here.

190
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,390
Thank you.

191
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,720
No need to say thank you, I was not helping you anyhow.

192
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,460
Even though, thank you.

193
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,700
From now on, don't say the words "Thank you" and "Sorry" to me.

194
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,310
Where would I find the answer key?

195
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,920
Now all the kids are siding with me. Don't you think someone's helping me?

196
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,250
That someone must have the same heart as you.

197
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,700
Is that so?

198
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,410
Then that person will take Seulbi away, too.

199
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:16,210
Give up Seulbi. It's the only way for all three of us to be under the same sky.

200
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,030
That punk!

201
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,710
What a relief.

202
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,040

203
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,350
How did you think of this?

204
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,980
Writing board.

205
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,220
You can't always say what's in your heart, so you can write it here.

206
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,590
"Let me become first place." 
 "Let me not go to after-school tutoring."

207
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,660
"Please let Yoomin like Seunghun ♥"

208
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,090
Hey, this is your handwriting!

209
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,450
They aren't marks, they're all wishes.

210
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,970
Yep, it's a wish marking board. Why don't you write one down, too?

211
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,180
Let all the wishes come true, bippity- boppity- boo!

212
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,510
Bippity- boppity- boo!

213
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,850
Lower lower. A little lower.

214
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,320
Hey! What are you doing?

215
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,190
We hadn't had a photozone in a long time.

216
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,840
Yoohwan's idea is the best!

217
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,170
But why, out of the blue, this?

218
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,710
We'll start with Seulbi.

219
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,220
Who came up with the idea that angels have wings?

220
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,310
They always do in children's books and comics.

221
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,170
And they need wings to fly around.

222
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,640
But they'd probably be able to fly around without wings.

223
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,610
The angel's life is the wings. And so that's what makes an angel an angel.

224
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,860
Angel? What angel— Let's just put wings on your mouth, huh?

225
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,220
It's your mouth that's a problem.

226
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,420
It's Kisoo and Yoohwan's masterpiece. A photozone. It's pretty, right?

227
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,460
Thanks for earlier and the other day.

228
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,040
My other half! I'll help you with your part-time job!

229
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,280
Sorry, now it'll be uncomfortable.

230
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,920
What should we do first?

231
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,290
Seulbi?

232
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,180
What's that?

233
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,350
Why don't you just go and study?

234
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,270
Baby! Honey!

235
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,570
Why is she giving me the cold shoulder? Did I do something wrong?

236
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,320
I think there are also humans who don't express their thankful or loving heart.

237
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,250
 The moment I tell about Seulbi, you and Seulbi will be forever—

238
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,260
 I can't rest and take an eye off Sungyeol for fear of what he might do.

239
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,190
 The only person I can ask the favor of is you, although I'm sorry.

240
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,910
What's the weird stuff that's been happening yesterday and today?

241
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,100
You know something, don't you?

242
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,380
Have you found the tests?

243
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,900
Not yet.

244
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,700
The students' lives are on the line with this issue.

245
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,980
It's sad to hear that their lives depend on one answer key book.

246
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,770
Would that be the only solution?

247
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,080
Is there a solution to life?

248
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,350
If there's something going on, tell me.

249
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,240
That way we can find a solution.

250
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,290
I have a favor to ask.

251
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,740
Just what are you going to do?

252
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,100
I can't just leave Woohyun like that,

253
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,770
and I can't leave him to live with Seulbi alone either.

254
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,960
What about Sungyeol? You don't worry about him?

255
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,440
Woohyun and Sungyeol are both my kids.

256
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,490
Until they accept me, I'll just have to wait.

257
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,650
I have a favor to ask you.

258
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,460
Seulbi...

259
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,650
Seulbi... I'm trusting you to watch her well.

260
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,500
You don't need to tell me what to do.

261
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,590
If she disappears, you can't see her again.

262
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,770
It'll be fair to both of us.

263
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,400
This is better than her disappearing forever.

264
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,340
Do you trust me?

265
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,100
Yeah.

266
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,810
Why?

267
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,300
Because you like Seulbi, too.

268
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,490
Because you still want to see her.

269
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,810
No matter what happens, don't send her to me.

270
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,560
I'm begging you.

271
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:58,350
♫  It was the beginning of fall  ♫

272
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,720
♫  when it was cold but not really cold  ♫

273
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:18,150
♫  You seemed like you’d be cold but 
 you were wearing short clothes  ♫

274
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,600
♫  The season passed  ♫

275
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,300
♫  and today the sunshine is warm  ♫

276
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,170
Let's go.

277
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,050
♫  Spring has come and you’re in front of me  ♫

278
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:53,610
♫  You’re looking at me, and you’re smiling  ♫

279
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,920
♫  I can’t breathe  ♫

280
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,610
 Whatever I say, even though it might sound like lies, I'm telling the truth.

281
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,100
 Believe me.

282
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,700
 I'll always believe you. We promised, remember?

283
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,000
 I don't think I can go on like this. Because of you, everything is so difficult.

284
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,760
 Leave.

285
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,080
 I said everything's annoying.

286
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,280
 You know I hate annoying things the most, right?

287
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,780
 You said you only feel safe when I'm next to you.

288
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,460
 I feel like there'll only be more days like today.

289
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,310
 And everyone started to suspect you.

290
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,990
 Getting into danger because of you is becoming annoying.

291
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,120
 So leave.

292
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,380
 I'll believe your lies.

293
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,680
 Where do I need to go?

294
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,850
♫  You’re looking at me, and you’re smiling  ♫

295
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:10,180
♫  I can’t breathe  ♫

296
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:17,990
♫  Just one look from you is so overwhelming for me  ♫

297
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,780
♫  So I’m looking at you like this  ♫

298
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,780
♫  I’m waiting for you  ♫

299
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,700
Why are you crying?

300
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,760
If you're going to be like that.

301
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,720
It's weird. I don't want to cry but I keep sweating from my eyes.

302
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,840
Never cry in front of me again.

303
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:46,630
♫  Each body movement from you is so overwhelming for me  ♫

304
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:55,180
♫  So I’m looking at you like this  ♫

305
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,960
Don't forgive me.

306
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:29,030
How am I going to live when only a day barely passed?

307
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,900
Okay! I leveled up!

308
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,440
Hey, Kisoo! Want to go get food with me?

309
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,820
Eat breakfast, or else your head will go bad.

310
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,640
You eat breakfast every day, but why is your head so bad?

311
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,840
Hey, you! My head's good, all right?

312
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,990
I'm just saving it to use for the future.

313
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,530
Right, Seulbi?

314
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,190
What? Oh, yeah.

315
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,410
Okay! Now, next!

316
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,920
Woohyun came in!

317
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,770
That's right! Yes, okay!

318
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,260
Oh yesss! Another win!

319
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,860
Hey, why am I so good at this?

320
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,910
Hey, do it again! Reset!

321
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,560
Okay, bet on it.

322
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,670
Okay, call!

323
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,370
Hey, look!

324
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,170
All right! Another win!

325
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,870
Are you okay?

326
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,160
What?

327
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,100
Even if you're smiling on the outside, you seem to be crying on the inside.

328
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,090
I never knew I had so many faces.

329
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,280
Is there a problem with Seulbi?

330
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,370
There's nothing for you to know.

331
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,990
I'm good at catching things. If you need help, you can use me.

332
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,290
I don't need your help.

333
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,990
If you fix your problem, tell me!

334
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,050
I feel sorry for you, so I can do anything for you.

335
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,160
Nothing was caught on CCTV and

336
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,100
if we can't find the answer key, what will we do with the students' lessons?

337
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,990
This is horrible for their college resumes.

338
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,460
This really is a big deal.

339
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,750
Ugh! Just where did it go?

340
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,560
We'll have to look for it! For our students!

341
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,770
Senior!

342
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,520
Because of you and me, the students' lives are getting destroyed.

343
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,440
That won't happen.

344
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,810
Because I'll do anything. Because we're friends.

345
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,820
Senior, you don't have friends. Right?

346
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,100
I have a lot. So try all you want.

347
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,050
If I can just put you back in your place, I'm going to do anything.

348
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,190
Why are you letting Seulbi stay at Sungyeol's place?

349
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,010
Because I'm a scaredy-cat.

350
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,480
Because I'm cowardly.

351
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
It's because of Sungyeol, right?

352
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,860
Aren't you going to deliver?

353
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,490
Hey! What exactly are you thinking?

354
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,000
A bad thing is happening, a bad thing.

355
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,790
I know, right...

356
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,390
What am I thinking?

357
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,840
Seulbi, I'm now going home. Don't stay outside mad and come inside.

358
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,820
Is that Seulbi?

359
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,920
Why are you making their lives worse?

360
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,230
Me?

361
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,750
They aren't going to break up just because you stand between them.

362
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,680
Weren't you Woohyun's friend?

363
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,760
You just stay as Woohyun's friend.

364
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,260
Hey! That kid!

365
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,300
Why? What?

366
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,770
I'm not talking to you, all right.

367
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,720
I recently just changed my position, you know.

368
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,510
Let's go.

369
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,710
Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,200
Hey.

371
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,450
What's up with you guys?

372
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,060
What do you mean? We're here to catch the cowardly mouse.

373
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,620
They say when the mouse is pushed to a corner, it'll bite the cat.

374
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,890
I wonder about this handsome looking mouse right here.

375
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,550
Don't come closer.

376
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,410
Go away.

377
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,650
Hey, why cry out? We're not going to hit you.

378
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,850
Because of you, I think I lived my life so badly,

379
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,290
that I'm turning a new leaf.

380
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,730
Here, get up.

381
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,290
Thanks.

382
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,500
I'm saying this while thinking of the past,

383
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,570
but in the future, don't appear in front of me.

384
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,220
Didn't I tell you that I'll kill you if you appeared in this neighborhood?

385
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,490
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

386
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,800
Was it Jaeseok?

387
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,420
These days he's like a toothless tiger.

388
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,400
But you who're still getting hit is...

389
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,650
I was just protecting a friendship.

390
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,940
Why don't you just protect your body?

391
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,140
You look terrible.

392
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,130
Thanks!

393
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,860
Perhaps... is the content in the book all true?

394
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,960
It's right, right?

395
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,220
You'll keep the secret, right?

396
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,610
It won't do anything just because I keep the secret.

397
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,450
I'm scared.

398
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,130
That she'll disappear like that.

399
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,440
That I'll have to live without seeing her.

400
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,190
Let's look for a solution.

401
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,980
If this book is really right, there should be other books that tell of a solution.

402
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,990
I'll look for it, too.

403
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,740
Thanks.

404
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,110
I'll go now.

405
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,540
If you're going to be this hurt,

406
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,510
can you tell me about Seulbi?

407
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,990
About there being something weird about her on test day.

408
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,520
About Seulbi saying she wanted to be a human.

409
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,890
That the answer key disappeared... all of it. It's because I think they might all have something to do with Seulbi.

410
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,040
I wish you wouldn't ask.

411
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,420
I have to protect her, you know.

412
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,090
Seulbi will be looking for the answer key alone.

413
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,760
I don't know if she'll be able to find it though...

414
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:04,890

415
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:08,110
♫  That’s not how I feel but I made you sad again  ♫

416
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:15,040
 That’s not how I feel, I’ve never hated you  ♫

417
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,500
 Seulbi's at school right now. Don't leave her alone.

418
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,380
♫  Thank you  ♫

419
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:36,830
♫  So many things happened so far  ♫

420
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:43,770
♫  There were times when things were hard and tiring  ♫

421
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,270
♫  Love is still so hard for us  ♫

422
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:07,200

423
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,120
Do you think you'll be able to block us just because you do this?

424
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,890
You can't ever take Seulbi away.

425
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,380
When I count to 3, run to the school; I'll run in the opposite direction.

426
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,870
One, two, three!

427
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,100
I'm leaving her in your care.

428
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,020
Just why are you doing this to this extent?

429
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,880
It's going to go into their resumes, so it's important for our country's students.

430
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,630
Don't you feel injustice after the kids hurt you that way?

431
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,500
I don't like that they're getting in trouble because of me.

432
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,180
If it weren't for me, this situation wouldn't have occurred in the first place.

433
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,680
I'll finish up and leave, so you head out...

434
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,760
Thank you.

435
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,820
What about Seulbi?

436
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,860
No need to concern yourself.

437
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,300
Oh, you scared me!

438
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,910
What are you doing there?

439
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,710
What about Seulbi? Is she sleeping?

440
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,590
I'm scared.

441
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,930
What's wrong?

442
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,660
I feel like I'm turning into a monster.

443
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,390
Please hold onto me.

444
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,670
That's right, Dad will hold on to you.

445
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,150
How do you have this...?

446
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,380
It's not possible that you did it?

447
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,250
I found it. I tried to tape it together.

448
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,560
What is the secret that you all are hiding? And what are you exactly?

449
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,100
Why did Woohyun send you to Sungyeol?

450
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,860
Don't try to know anything.

451
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,330
Everyone! The answer key was found!

452
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,890
What? Really?

453
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,270
♫  It was the beginning of fall  ♫

454
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,250
♫   When it was cold but not really cold  ♫

455
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:34,730
♫  You seemed like you’d be cold  ♫

456
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:40,960
♫  But you were wearing short clothes  ♫

457
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,580
♫  The season passed  ♫

458
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,910
♫  And today the sunshine is warm  ♫

459
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,110
♫  Spring has come  ♫

460
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,460
♫  And you’re in front of me  ♫

461
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:14,770
I'm eating well, and sleeping well.

462
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:20,550
It would be good if you can do the same.

463
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:32,710
♫  Just one look from you is so overwhelming for me  ♫

464
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:41,020
♫  So I’m looking at you like this  ♫

465
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,810
Is it okay to leave Woohyun like that?

466
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,660
Outside he laughs like a maniac, and when he comes into the shop he gets depressed...

467
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:55,420
He doesn't eat or sleep. He's killing me.

468
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,770
Taeho? Taeho? Did someone call me?

469
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,200
But Seulbi...

470
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,740
Yes, Sir.

471
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:11,910
But Seulbi...

472
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,650
Hey! If you're going to talk about another girl, just go to your after-school tutoring.

473
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,890
No, no, no.

474
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,760
It's over, right?

475
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,210
There are five minutes left.

476
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,760
Hey! Just go. You're making it chaotic.

477
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,710
Let's go.

478
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,820
I'm leaving first.

479
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,330
Yes.

480
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,620
All right, let's try it one more time.

481
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:56,160
Teacher will probably find out very soon also, right? Continuing to lie is hard.

482
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,900
Sometimes there are times when you need to lie to protect the other person.

483
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,110
For that person...

484
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,730
 They are the words I always say to you... the words I'll have to continue to say to you...

485
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,590
I'll come back.

486
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,680
Seulbi!

487
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,590
  Woohyun is really sick, come quickly.

488
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,770
I'll just see him for a minute, Woohyun is sick.

489
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,220
If you see him for a bit, you'll want to see him more; and then tomorrow you will want to see him more, and more after that.

490
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,390
And during those times you won't think of me once.

491
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,630
It's really just for a bit, he's sick!

492
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,700
I'll go.

493
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,820
Seulbi, are you okay?

494
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,020
Seulbi, are you okay?

495
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,770
Seulbi.

496
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,590
Come back to your senses.

497
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,940
Seulbi, you okay?

498
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:45,330
 They say feeling the other's pain is love, but these two get sick at the same time.

499
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,670
 Hurry and get better, Seulbi.

500
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:50,870
 When someone is sick and tired, there's someone who gains strength.

501
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,670
 - Hey, let's go quickly.
 - There's nothing I can do.

502
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,810
 Don't turn around. I'm not there.

503
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,040
 They say she's an alien.

504
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,900
 Is Seulbi really a ghost?

505
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,910
 No matter what circumstance, we're always together!

506
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,440
 - Seulbi! 
 - Seulbi disappeared. 
 - Seulbi!

507
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,590
 I'm going to reveal everything.

508
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,300
 Sungyeol!
