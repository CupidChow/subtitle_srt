1
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,870
Why is it you?

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Why does it have to be you?!

3
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,350

4
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,320
What's wrong with that guy? Is he going through puberty late?

5
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,860
I guess I have to endure it.

6
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,850
I wonder what our Seulbi, who'll never go through puberty, is doing right now.

7
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,950
♪ My love. My everything ♪

8
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,380
♪ You fell from heaven ♪

9
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,050
♪ My two eyes.  My world ♪

10
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,020
 ♪ You stole them all ♪

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,910
♪ Little star~ ♪

12
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,870
♪ Tonight~ ♪

13
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,960
 ♪ I'll protect you all night ♪

14
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,180
Sleep well.

15
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,800
I didn't know I'd do things like this either.

16
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,910

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,330
This is all because of Lee Seulbi.

18
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,290
I knew we shouldn't have listened to you the moment you said "midair" and stuff.

19
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm serious! Lee Seulbi stopped midair.

20
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,470
Never mind. I'm going to reveal her.

21
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,170
Jaeseok really had a secret past. He used to be ostracized by the whole school.

22
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,500
No way.

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,480
They say Sungyeol saved him seconds from being beat to death.

24
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,920
Afterward, he went to the gym with Sungyeol every day. That's how he became so strong.

25
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,310
Jackpot. He fooled us this whole time?

26
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,550
You didn't get hit enough, did you?

27
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,370
Including Jaeseok, everyone who fled from the "crime" scene, flip over!

28
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,670
- Higher! 
 - Teacher!

29
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
I don't think I can do this anymore.

30
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,900
Hey!

31
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,250
Hey, Seulbi uses superpowers?

32
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,960
- Taewoo and Byungwook were talking about Seulbi's superpowers. 
 - What are you even saying?

33
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,200
Oh, yeah! Big news!

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,100
Jaeseok used to be an outcast from the whole school. They said Sungyeol saved him.

35
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,740
Of course. Sungyeol has the qualifications to be my friend. He's as cool as I am.

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,920
Why didn't Sungyeol come today?

37
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Who knows? I can't reach him. I wonder if he's sick.

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,330
You guys are best friends. But how can you not know?

39
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,050
Are you jealous?

40
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,010
Yes, I'm jealous. You said you only had me. You unfair jerk.

41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,130
As expected, jealousy is only pretty if it's Seulbi expressing it.

42
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,720
Teacher, is Sungyeol sick?

43
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
No.  Why?

44
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,380
He didn't come to school.

45
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,330
He left early this morning.

46
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,980
He's not answering his phone either.

47
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,190
Where did he go?

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,360
We'll try to find him and contact you.

49
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,780
Seulbi.

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,680
Sungyeol asked if he could transfer.

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,640
Transfer?

52
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,130
His one-sided love must have been too hard.

53
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,620
But, Seulbi, can you

54
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,500
just stay by Woohyun's side?

55
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,970
Even if anything happens, don't look at him.

56
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,860
That way Sungyeol can quickly settle his heart.

57
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,050

58
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,540
He's still not answering.

59
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,460
He even had a fit yesterday. Did something really happen?

60
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,530
What? Are you worried because he confessed to you?

61
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,320
How did you know that?

62
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,870
There's nothing I don't know.

63
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,130
Did you reply to him?

64
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,110
Somewhat.

65
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,620
You can confess shyly without confidence, but you must reject confidently with power.

66
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,460
That way the other person will hurt less.

67
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,000
Sungyeol must be hurting, right?

68
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,550
 (T/N: warning passersby that he is popping popcorn - it makes a loud noise)

69
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,150
I'm hurting, too.

70
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,940
♫  I hold her hand   ♫

71
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,090
♫  As I walk on this road  ♫

72
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,570
♫  Along the river  ♫

73
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,810
♫  That sparkles in the sun  ♫

74
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,430
♫  Your scent that envelopes me  ♫

75
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,840
You... why?

76
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,540
You need to level up before Jaeseok comes.

77
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,210
And whose fault is that? Are you trying to comfort me after what you did?

78
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm sorry that I can only help with these kinds of things.

79
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm sorry for ignoring you when you had a hard time.

80
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,920
Oh, it's Sungyeol.

81
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,560
Sungyeol's at a PC room?  Thanks, Chunsik.

82
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,900
Sungyeol's at a PC room?

83
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,790
Yeah, I'll go...

84
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,780
I'll go with you.

85
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,540
Look at you. You look like something's bothering you.

86
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,610
No, it's not.

87
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,420
Clean the kitchen, sweep the floors, organize the sales,

88
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,010
clean all the windows, and even after that's done, don't come.

89
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,830
Yes, Teacher.  Sungyeol's at a PC room.

90
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,970
I thought Sungyeol saved him.

91
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,450
So, why is he always so angry around Sungyeol?

92
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,480
The one person who can reveal his embarrassing past is in the same class.

93
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,970
The moment Sungyeol opens his mouth, he becomes a school-wide outcast again.

94
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,020
Then, in the end, it's Sungyeol who's the "best."

95
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,000
Should've acted better around Sungyeol.

96
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,250
Sungyeol?

97
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,880
You must really want to die?

98
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,100
It's time you showed us that you're really the "best."

99
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,950
Go bring Hwang Sungyeol.

100
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,460
Aren't you overdoing yourself?

101
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,610
Hurry up and bring Hwang Sungyeol!

102
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh ho! Our class's official couple.

103
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,980
You guys really suit each other.

104
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,920
Have you seen Hwang Sungyeol?

105
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,140
I haven't seen Sungyeol.

106
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,050
You're talking more now. Hurry up and find him.

107
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:09,030
Cheap and petty Shin Woohyun. Even Patzzi's mom would cry. 
  (T/N: from the Korean Cinderella story "Kongji and Patzzi")

108
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,280
Why hasn't he called yet?

109
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,950
Did he not find him yet?

110
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,170
Chunsik said he was here. I'm sorry.

111
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,250
Why should you?  Thanks.

112
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,210
I'll look around for him a bit more.

113
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,140

114
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,910
You should get back to the restaurant. Isn't it hard to work?

115
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,600
I realized life is hard.

116
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Is it really hard?

117
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,540
It's hard at times, but it's okay. Sungyeol helped out a lot.

118
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,290
I'm sure Sungyeol doesn't hate you.

119
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:36,010
He's just afraid he might like his new mom more, and forget about his biological mother.

120
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Whenever I bought a new robot, I would place it next to the old robot for some time.

121
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:48,060
Sungyeol just needs time to be okay with letting go and moving on.

122
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,750
I'll go look around some more now.

123
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,520
Wait...

124
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,650
He's a bit weird. He's determined to get beaten to death.

125
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,990
You guys saw with your own eyes, who the best really is.

126
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,170
As of today, you're dead meat.

127
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,330
Don't!  Please... don't.

128
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,120
Hey, you won't leave!

129
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,910
If you are going to hit a girl, then you really are trash.

130
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,290
Since when did I have to get your approval to be the "best"?

131
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,950
You're not supposed to hit girls and babies. That's the rule.

132
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,630
Geez!

133
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,460
Those punks...

134
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,020
Should I call Shin Woohyun over?

135
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,280
Please...

136
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,130
Please, Sungyeol.

137
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,560
Please...

138
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,990
 Your girlfriend is with Sungyeol at the park right now, and they looked intimate. It's worth seeing.

139
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,120
Are you trying to transfer because of me?

140
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,520
Can't you stay?

141
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,950
Then, are you going to look at me?

142
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,000
You're only going to look at Woohyun, yet you want me to stay by your side?

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,610
It's not that...

144
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,290
Woohyun has everything.

145
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,780
I have nothing.

146
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,020
Sungyeol!

147
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,980
♫  One cold yet not cold  ♫

148
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,310
♫  Beginning of fall  ♫

149
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,950
I wish you didn't act like this.

150
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,270
When I'm with you, I think of Woohyun even more.

151
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,160
And you! You're not alone.

152
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,090
You have both me and Woohyun.

153
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,190
♫  After seasons passed  ♫

154
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,780
Woohyun!

155
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,650
♫  The sunlight is warm today  ♫

156
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,780
♫  Spring has come  ♫

157
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,640
♫  And you're in front of me again  ♫

158
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,810
♫  Staring at me...  ♫

159
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,970
Don't look back.

160
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,390
Sungyeol's hurt.

161
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,440
Don't turn around to look at another guy!

162
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,370
♫  Your gaze alone  ♫

163
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,470
♫  Is too much for me  ♫

164
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,060
Jaeseok.

165
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,900
Get up, bastard!

166
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,130
My friend's good-looking face looks like an ugly squid like yours, thanks to you.

167
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,540
I told you even my fists are too precious to waste on someone like you.

168
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,470
Punk!

169
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,870
This is for my friend.

170
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,570
Hey, who is Lee Seulbi?

171
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,680
A prostitute? A person with special powers? There are so many strange rumors about her.

172
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,260
Want to know?

173
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,480
She's my girlfriend.

174
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,360
Sungyeol!  Oh my!  What happened?

175
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,390
Where were you?  Who did this... ?

176
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,950
Don't touch me.

177
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,020
Sungyeol?

178
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,130
 Who is Lee Seulbi?

179
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,810
I wonder if he knows something. He probably just said that, right? Hwang Sungyeol, why are you being like this, too?

180
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,510
Oh my god!

181
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,690
No wonder he was always so involved whenever it had to do with Seulbi.

182
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,380
Is this really Seulbi and Sungyeol?

183
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,910

Enjoy~

184
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:20,500

185
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,300
Hey!

186
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,350
What's wrong with your face?

187
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,570
It wasn't me.

188
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,130
Clean it well.

189
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,550
Fine! I did it! Happy?!

190
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,600
Geez!

191
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,080
Why do I have to suffer from this because of you?!

192
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,170
- I only did what you wanted to do! 
 - Shut that mouth!

193
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,750
Stop it already.

194
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,540
Stop what? Are you wondering where my end is?

195
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,720
Should I show you? Do you want to see?

196
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,920
This is all your fault!

197
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,150
What?

198
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,300
What's this?

199
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,920
There's nothing to worry about. They're just scribbles.

200
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,500
Just adding more work for us.

201
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,360
What the heck?

202
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,780
Why do I have to go through all this because of your scandal?

203
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,010
Come on.

204
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,420
We're friends.

205
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,610
Call your friend. The other main guy in this love triangle. I'm just a supporting role in all this.

206
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,210
Hey!  Kang Kisoo!

207
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,060
This is totally in-demand right now. It's the new release of the second book.

208
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,720
I taped this back up neatly.

209
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,810
Just give me my book.

210
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,740
Hey, don't you know that I don't read books? Then throw this away.

211
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,070
Why would you throw a book away?

212
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,820
Next time, don't touch my stuff.

213
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,090
Okay, okay.

214
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:10,850
Ah, it's Lee Seulbi.  I'll show you something interesting.

215
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
Seulbi, move!

216
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,200
This is attempted murder. Consider yourself lucky.

217
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,520
I saw it wrong.

218
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,570
Okay!  I've got you both.

219
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,150
Hey, Jaeseok, what's wrong with your face?

220
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,600
And Sungyeol... Are your faces a piece of drawing paper?

221
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,790
Good. Everybody, gather at the gym. Hurry!

222
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,480
Hey, get up.

223
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,500
Who will Lee Seulbi choose between you two?

224
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,010
Oh, look! It's Hwang Sungyeol. Poor Shin Woohyun.

225
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:52,500
The atmosphere is nice between the two main characters of the love triangle. Spend some quality time together.

226
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,180
Do you have nothing to say? I saw something I shouldn't have yesterday.

227
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:12,200
Why did you interfere and make this a triangle? What's going on?

228
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,540
Ethics teacher was really worried.

229
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,100
She worried about me?

230
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,830
Then, do you think she was worried about me?

231
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,300
Aren't you curious who your mother is?

232
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,070
If I'm curious, will you find her for me? Stop showing off your mom. It's childish.

233
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,090
Show off?

234
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,250
If you're going to get beaten, can't you do it sensibly?

235
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,090
From this moment on, the restaurant and my house are off-limits.

236
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm not comfortable with you anymore.

237
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,480
What are you doing, holding onto two good-looking guys?

238
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,740
You'll rip your legs like that. 
  (T/N: referring to yang dari (literally: both legs), which means two-timing in Korean)

239
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,220
- Who does she think she is? 
 - As if she's all that or something. 
 - What a joke.

240
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,590
- Seriously. 
 - How annoying.

241
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,690
It's because they've been in a prison without bars for too long.

242
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,270
Prison?

243
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,770
The school is a prison.

244
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,100
A place where no matter how many "fun" things they try to make, they'll never be fun.

245
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,770
For some reason, it's really sad.

246
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,790
I wonder what's new today? Who should we put in the spotlight (to tease) today? They're just mulling over that.

247
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,330
As long as you keep reacting, the rumors will last longer.

248
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,440
I guess so. Thanks.

249
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,900
Read this.

250
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,510
This... Why?

251
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,860
You asked me to let you know if there were other stories about angels.

252
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,190
While reading the book...

253
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,530
"Don't eat, don't sleep, and don't fold pages."

254
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,760
I know.

255
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,050
If I can use superpowers

256
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,500
and was a bit different than humans, what would you think?

257
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,280
If you have powers like that, then please do my part-time jobs for me.

258
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,010
Acting surprised.

259
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,510
"An Angel, Falls into Danger." Why?

260
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,910
Are you an angel or something?

261
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,950
Sorry. I'm sorry.

262
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,030
Hey, Lee Seul—

263
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,670
Whatever she's hiding, I will find out.

264
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,870
Sungyeol.

265
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,640
Are you okay?

266
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,130
That guy is going through puberty. Complaining and feeling annoyed about everything.

267
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,130
I heard that they do that to their moms during those times.

268
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,950
Don't worry too much.

269
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Thanks.

270
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,490
- Sungyeol... 
 - Sungyeol...

271
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,340
You don't need to worry too much about what the kids are saying.

272
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,220
You seem to be the one who's worried.

273
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,830
In dramas, love triangles are so entertaining, but in real life, they aren't.

274
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,140
Are you openly admitting that this is a love triangle?

275
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,800
I think Sungyeol is acting a bit weird lately.

276
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,330
I think it's puberty.

277
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,800
You mean  the  incurable adolescence?

278
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,500
Should we invent puberty medicine? It'll probably become huge.

279
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,200
Oh, our Woohyun's business methods seem to be improving.

280
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,670
What should I buy you if I make a lot of money?

281
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,240
- Hurry and tell me. One, two, three— 
 - I only need you.

282
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,800
Wow, you confess any time you want to.

283
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,330
Is that answer correct?

284
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,050
I'm not going to tell you.

285
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,470
Tell me. Tell me!

286
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,290
Tell me!

287
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,070
What are you doing?

288
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,360
Hey, don't go!

289
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,620
Acting cute doesn't seem to get through to her.

290
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,120
 I have something to say. Let's meet.

291
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,290
 I'll be waiting at the park.

292
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,180
By chance, he's still not waiting for me right now. Right?

293
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
Sungyeol!

294
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,070
- Sungyeol! 
 - Sungyeol!

295
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,580
Hwang Sungyeol! Sungyeol!

296
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,430
Did you contact the ethics teacher?

297
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,890
I didn't tell her he was sick so that she wouldn't worry.

298
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,570
Good job.

299
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,700
If there's no reply, he shouldn't have waited. So foolish.

300
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,240
I'll do it. Go and sleep.

301
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,560
You're tired. I can do it.

302
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,490
Here, give it to me.

303
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,950
It looks like I'm going to lose to this punk.

304
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,300
Sungyeol probably knows your feelings as well.

305
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,330
Really?

306
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,830
♫  After seasons passed   ♫

307
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,980
♫   The sunlight is warm today  ♫

308
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,830
♫   Spring has come  ♫

309
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,340
♫  And you're in front of me again  ♫

310
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,840
You're really bad, you know that?

311
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,300
You don't let me be angry whenever I want

312
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,580
and prevent me from hating you.

313
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,370
Why do I...

314
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,650
hurt when it comes to you?

315
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:18,040
♫   Your gaze alone is too much for me  ♫

316
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,190
♫  So I...  ♫

317
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,790
♫   Watch over you, like this  ♫

318
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:49,000

319
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,650
Are you okay?

320
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm sorry.

321
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,800
What were you going to say that made you wait?

322
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,830
Do you even want to know?

323
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,850
What are you doing?

324
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,570
Now, you're surprised even if I touch you?

325
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,140
You're dead now.

326
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,260
 "An Angel, Falls into Danger."

327
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,870
It definitely shined.

328
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,030
Hey, you guys are skilled in finding out about people. Right?

329
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,500
Who is it this time?

330
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,010
You keep acting up.

331
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,770
I'll do it!

332
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,420
Who?

333
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,170
Lee Seulbi.

334
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,100
The more I think of her, the weirder she is.

335
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,510
I think I saw something wrong when she floated on the stairs. Don't worry too much.

336
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,090
I'll decide that.

337
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,570
Come to the school at night.

338
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,590
He always tells us to come and go.

339
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,980
Should we kick this punk's ass?

340
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,540
Even if he was a loner in the past, I really think he's the "the best" now.

341
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,710
Look at my face.

342
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,200
You should have avoided getting hit in the face.

343
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,810
It's not the first time you got hit, right?

344
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,600
Teacher, were you the one that ordered?

345
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,680
What? Yeah..

346
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,030
Eat well.

347
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,380
Come in for a moment.

348
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,100
Here, drink this.

349
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,040
Thank you.

350
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,590
Do you always wear that necklace?

351
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:30,790
Yes, since I was young. It feels weird if I don't wear it now.

352
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,700
So it's special.

353
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,020
My mom gave it to me. Without this,

354
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,430
I might forget everything.

355
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:52,280
You ordered delivery because I said the restaurant was off-limits, right? You petty punk.

356
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,180
Why did you come? You should've sent Seulbi.

357
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,370
Your goal wasn't ddeokbokki but Seulbi, right?

358
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,570
I'll bring you drinks.

359
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,350
Can I invite Seulbi and Woohyun for dinner?

360
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,990
No thanks. We're really busy.

361
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,810
Don't worry too much.

362
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,740
Why? You like my mom's side dishes.

363
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,660
It's probably been a long time since Seulbi ate a home-cooked meal.

364
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,560
Woohyun likes your food, Mom.

365
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
You will cook for us, right?

366
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,550
Do you want to?

367
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,630
N-No...

368
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,830
Why are you making this so awkward?

369
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm okay.

370
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,260
Come with Seulbi for dinner.

371
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,450
Then I'll inconvenience you a bit.

372
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,700
I wanted to invite you guys for dinner, too.

373
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,160
You guys fed and gave Sungyeol a place to sleep all the time.

374
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,240
That's a given with friends.

375
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,350
Thank you for inviting us. It's really yummy.

376
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,010
Dad,

377
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,300
I have a favor.

378
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,980
A favor? What's your favor, my son?

379
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,360
Can you find Woohyun's mother?

380
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,130
Why are you like this?

381
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,700
That necklace, you said your mom gave it to you.

382
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,800
Seeing that you wear it every day, it means you're waiting for her just as much.

383
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,960
Well, what's most important is what he thinks.

384
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,990
Do you still not want to find her?

385
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
There's probably a reason why she's not looking for me.

386
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:45,260
My mom probably has a life. What if things become hard for her because I find her?

387
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,280
Honestly...

388
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm scared...

389
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
that I'll be abandoned again.

390
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,780
Yeah! You really are a man!

391
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,390
I like you. Eat a lot, okay?

392
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,280
Eat this, too.

393
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,850
Here.

394
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,280
I'll eat well.

395
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,740
Yeah.

396
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,010
I'll do it.

397
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,310
Oh my!

398
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,900
Oh my!

399
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,640
Are you okay?

400
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,600
Yeah, you'll get hurt. I'll do it!

401
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,450
I'm okay. I do these things well.

402
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,830
Oh my!

403
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,480
Hey, you'll get hurt.

404
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh my! I told you that you'll get hurt!

405
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
Look at it bleeding!

406
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,610
Are you okay? I told you that I'll do it.

407
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,850
If you did it, then you would've gotten hurt.

408
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,210
Sungyeol, go and bring some medication.

409
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,550
Sungyeol has been acting a bit strange lately, but I'm relieved to see that he still thinks of you a lot.

410
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,790
Wouldn't it be faster for Sungyeol's dad to find your mom?

411
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,100
She's probably a person that shouldn't be found too quickly.

412
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,500
As long as she's still alive somewhere, I'm fine.

413
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,480
It's better to think that she's someone I can still see if I really wanted to,

414
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,600
rather than being someone I can't see because she isn't here.

415
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,070
That's enough for me.

416
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,030
I refuse sympathy.

417
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,140
I looked at you because you were so cool.

418
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,240
Our little Puppy.

419
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,960
I'm pretty sure I told you that my hands were expensive.

420
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,000
I need to hold an expensive hand and become happy.

421
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,240
The stars are pretty.

422
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,430
What are you looking for?

423
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,710
Nothing.

424
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,160
I cleaned up a bit.

425
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,400
I threw away

426
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,000
all the trash, too.

427
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,860
Oh.

428
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,500
You did?

429
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,360
Thanks.

430
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:39,800

431
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,860
Are you looking for this?

432
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,320
This is...

433
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,190
what you're looking for, right?

434
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,370
Why do you have that?

435
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,870
Do you have nothing to say to me?

436
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,340
What?

437
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,930
I heard your son is the same age as me.

438
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,720
When did he return from America?

439
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,800
Shin. Woo. Hyun.

440
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,780
I'll explain. Give that to me!

441
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,180
What do you want to hear?

442
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,500
What are you going to say first?

443
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,830
That Woohyun is your son? That you lied to my dad?

444
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,690
I was going to explain! You were just faster than me!

445
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,920
To the end, you...

446
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,510
Don't tell Woohyun.

447
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,840
It's enough for you and me to be hurt.

448
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,390
You want to protect your son until the end?

449
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,690
I'm protecting you!

450
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,570
Even though my son is in front of my eyes, I'm with you!

451
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,930
What kind of qualifications do I have as a mother when I can't even call him my son?!

452
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:01,340
It's also better for Woohyun to think that his mom doesn't exist.

453
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,260
Than please leave our house.

454
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,620
I don't need you either.

455
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,510
♫  It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days  ♫

456
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,680
♫  I’m still not used to this kind of life  ♫

457
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:40,140
♫  When I’m with you, the stars twinkle even during the day  ♫

458
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,400
♫  I don’t want to meet anyone else but you  ♫

459
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,450
♫  Without you, I don’t want to do anything  ♫

460
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:55,480
♫  Even when I’m with my friends, I’m always thinking about you  ♫

461
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:04,320
♫  You’re too much for me. You're too good for me  ♫

462
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:11,600
♫   Today and tomorrow, I'll be always loving you  ♫

463
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,330
I'll go circulate these and come back. Hurry up and sleep first.

464
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,690
I'm almost done, let's go together!

465
00:45:51,500 --> 00:46:05,300

466
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,340
Seulbi!

467
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,320
Sungyeol!

468
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,750
I heard you were locked here.

469
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,490
 Lee Seulbi is locked inside the gym's storage room.

470
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Choi Jaeseok. That jerk.

471
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,390
It's a relief. Let's go.

472
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,860
Choi Jaeseok!

473
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:55,480
 Hwang Sungyeol, since Lee Seulbi uses superpowers, you can leave this place using that.

474
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,300
 You two spend a cozy time together. I'm busy so I'll go.

475
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,720
Choi Jaeseok! What are you doing!

476
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,000
It's better for you to hurry.

477
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,900
Before you get caught by your boyfriend.

478
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,720
Stop it.

479
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,910
You can't open it with your strength.

480
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,230
Woohyun will worry. Move.

481
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,370
If this is Jaeseok's plan, he would've called Woohyun.

482
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,160
He involved Woohyun again?

483
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,920
What was Jaeseok talking about?

484
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,930
What I saw on the stairs...

485
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:47,490
If I had those powers, I would've left this place already.

486
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,300
Do you not want to be with me?

487
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,260
Maybe you should have been locked up with Woohyun.

488
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,530
What's wrong with you?

489
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:03,330
You don't seem like the Hwang Sungyeol I know.

490
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,050
The Hwang Sungyeol you knew isn't here anymore.

491
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,130
Even if you're like this, my heart won't change.

492
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:20,050
I have no intention of begging for your heart, I'm going to just take it.

493
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,310
Seulbi! Lee Seulbi!

494
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,530
Seulbi!

495
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,160
Why are you doing this?

496
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,240
I'm going to...

497
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,960
steal everything Woohyun has.

498
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,310
Do you know how much Woohyun cares about you!?

499
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,910
I cared for him, too!

500
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,500
I did too.

501
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,230
Is this really because of me?

502
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,290
What should I do?

503
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,520
Seulbi! Lee Seulbi!

504
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,380
Seulbi!

505
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,590
 Are you inside?

506
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,070
Woohyun!

507
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,000
Are you okay?

508
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:23,890
Today, you lost to me.

509
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,630
Let's go.

510
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,340
We were locked in here, you jerk.

511
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:47,390
♫  One cold yet not cold  ♫

512
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,550
♫  Beginning of fall  ♫

513
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:03,050
♫  It seems chilly  ♫

514
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:09,120
♫  Yet you wore short-sleeved clothing  ♫

515
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,810
♫  After seasons passed...  ♫

516
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,060
You jerk.

517
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,580
You only have me as a friend.

518
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,270
♫  Spring has come  ♫

519
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,100
♫  And you're in front of me again  ♫

520
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,110
♫  Staring at me  ♫

521
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:44,210
♫  Then smiling at me  ♫

522
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:52,150
♫  I can't breathe  ♫

523
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,400
I'm sorry for coming late, Mother-in-Law.

524
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,180
You couldn't sleep at all, huh?

525
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,340
I slept so well, dreaming of you.

526
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:32,730
Sungyeol is probably going through something he can't talk about.

527
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,150
Could you do me a favor? Don't talk about him in front of me anymore.

528
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,050
Our little Puppy is so cool.

529
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,030
I was always cool no matter what I did.

530
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,760
Grandma would've liked it.

531
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,640
I need to tell Ms. Gong that I got a girlfriend.

532
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:54,020
That she's a complete whackjob that eats so amazingly much, whose nosiness pierces the sky, and hard to take care of.

533
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,030
Am I?

534
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,670
Did I give you a hard time again?

535
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,050
I really like it because you're here.

536
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,330
Ms. Gong wouldn't worry about me either.

537
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:06,290
Let's go quickly. Ms. Gong's waiting.

538
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,340
How can I reveal...

539
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,930
that I'm Woohyun's mom now, Mother?

540
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,020
I'm so sorry

541
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,760
that I couldn't care for him. What kind of a mother am I?

542
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,590
I have no right to be Woohyun's mom, Mother.

543
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,100
Woohyun.

544
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,290
 I'm your mom.

545
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:20,640
 I don't need a mom. Please tell me this is a lie, Grandma.

546
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,630
 What's the relationship between Shin Woohyun and our Ethics teacher?

547
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:27,170
 Is throwing your own child away and raising someone else's child compensatory?

548
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,150
 Lee Seulbi is in a love triangle and even cohabiting.

549
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,700
 Does cohabitation make sense?

550
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,500
 There's only one way: to find his mother.

551
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,030
 I'm going to steal everything from Woohyun.

552
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,280
 What are you talking about?

553
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,550
 Be on my side later. Forever.

554
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,030
 Your smile really hurts me.
