1
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,890
What exactly are you hiding?

2
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,500
There's nothing I'm hiding.

3
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,460
Are you possibly an ang... ?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,850
Shut your mouth.

5
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,970
What are you doing?

6
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,700
If you're not going to reveal it, then I'm going to find out myself.

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,290
What's that light on Seulbi's wrist?

8
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,750
You know you're weird these days, right?

9
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,790
You saw it, too.

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,710
I saw you torturing Seulbi.

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,640
If you bother Seulbi one more time, you'll die by my hand.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm going to reveal it!

13
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,590

14
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,070

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,050
When an angel is being doubted or in trouble, their sign

16
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,400
will sparkle.

17
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,320
Hey! Why are you going through someone else's bag?

18
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,740
I...

19
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,310
know what it is.

20
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,580
Hey, don't talk nonsense and let's sleep.

21
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,770
If you fall again tonight, I won't let it go.

22
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:16,860

23
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,260
Please...

24
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,760
don't let anything happen to us.

25
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,160
Dad, get me a towel!

26
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,320
Say, "Please."

27
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,410
Say, "Please."

28
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,910
 Politely say, "Please," with both hands out.

29
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,050
Please.

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
You!

31
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,400
Good job! Next time say it more cutely.

32
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,800
Okay?

33
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,150
Your body is worse than mine.

34
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,780
Do you even want to play with me?

35
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,960
Why are we getting career counseling?

36
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,680
We do it every year. It's nothing new...

37
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,740
So, every year, do we have to have a different dream?

38
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,920
You're so silly.

39
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,840
What's the point of having a dream, when reality sucks?

40
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,230
You're smart, pretty, you know a lot of things, and you're nice.

41
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,530
You'll definitely achieve your dreams.

42
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,130
You're not going to college?

43
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,370
If it's due to financial issues, there are other ways such as school loans and scholarships.

44
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,870
Even if I come out of a great college, being in debt won't change.

45
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,240
Even though it may pour rain,

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,740
you may be able to afford vinyl to patch the leaks.

47
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,490
I want to hurry and be an adult.

48
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,580
That's going to happen when time passes.

49
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,100
I don't need to be taken care of if I become an adult.

50
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,530
I can take care of myself.

51
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,230
I want to become a human.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Then, are you not a human right now?

53
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,470
Thanks, for making me laugh.

54
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,140
Are you okay? Sorry.

55
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,570
I just can't leave you alone for a second, can I?

56
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,470
Go away! Do you not know about the no dating rule?!

57
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,500
How irritating!

58
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,370
Let go!

59
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,660
Why are you being so unfair?

60
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm telling you to reveal Seulbi's secret. Is what I'm thinking correct?

61
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,050
No, you're wrong.

62
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,600
Do you even know what I was going to say?

63
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,890
You should request it. Then I may listen.

64
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,550
Whatever you know,

65
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,140
shut that mouth.

66
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,780
Then, should I reveal this?

67
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,970
You're my data shuttle. 
  (T/N: Data shuttle: a new type of school bullying where they demand a cell phone data bribe)

68
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,130
Me? No way...

69
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,190
You have no sense now.

70
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,010
Bring that jerk later.

71
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,590
Use all my data. I'll recharge it later.

72
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,020
Use a lot and be relieved.

73
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,040
 Should I reveal how our Ethics teacher is my stepmom as well as your real mom?

74
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,280
 You must think you can use it as your weapon, but it won't work on me.

75
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,840
 Having a mom whom I've grown up without is hard and troublesome.

76
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,870
 Our Ethics teacher, who's in charge of being our guidance counselor,

77
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,830
 threw her own son away, and chose me, her stepson... 
 - Stop.

78
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,150
I didn't reveal one thing due to my conscience.

79
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,340
Please shut your mouth.

80
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,870
Who do I have to shut my mouth for?

81
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,760
You? Or your mom?

82
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,570
Hwang Seungyeol.

83
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,180
It's for your sake, you jerk.

84
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,870
Straighten your back! One, two, one, two!

85
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,340
Can't you see everyone's staring at me? Don't walk too close to me.

86
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,770
I'm used to this, so I'm okay.

87
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,600
You'll get used to it, too.

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,320
What is this over-the-top drama?

89
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,640
If Witch Teacher is your birth mom, does that mean you and Sungyeol are siblings?

90
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,000
Siblings...

91
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,860
are fighting over one girl? Wow!

92
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,200
The rating will shoot through the roof, right?

93
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,760
Good luck.

94
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,330
You guys are like the three ugly brothers. Where's the other one? 
  (T/N: Three Ugly Brothers is a popular doll in Korea)

95
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,310
Good luck.

96
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,630
Let's see how much longer they can be arrogant.

97
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,750
Three ugly brothers?

98
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,300
My mom said I'm the most handsome guy in the world.

99
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,850
Bring Byungwook. Now!

100
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,930
Do I really have to?

101
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,970
I should, right?

102
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,060
Hey, it's better to get your beating over with.

103
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,890
I don't want to get hit either!

104
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,230
You jerk. Who likes getting hit?

105
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,790
Please run away today.

106
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,520
I don't have a cellphone and I can't contact you.

107
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,230
I need to switch your phone and Byungwook's.

108
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,180
Hey, friend!  Can I hit you once?

109
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,760
If you want to get beaten up and die.

110
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,420
Why did I find out about your secret the same time as these guys?

111
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,900
If you had known earlier, could you have made our teacher not be my mom?

112
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,830
Did you really get thrown away?

113
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,020
I didn't get thrown away. I just wasn't chosen.

114
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,430
That's that.

115
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,410
What kind of a mother leaves her child alone with no contact?

116
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,160
Now she's Seungyeol's mom.

117
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,280
Are you and Seungyeol okay?

118
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,820
Do you think we're okay?

119
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,660
Are you staying over at our teacher's house? Is Sungyeol's dad good to you?

120
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Sungyeol, that bastard, is cold, right? He's also like that to Seulbi, right?

121
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,630
I don't think our teacher is like that.

122
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,870
Still, it's a relief that you have Seulbi.

123
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,360
Tell me if Sungyeol doesn't treat you right. I'll beat them all up for you.

124
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,890
Me, too.

125
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,570
Please help me by staying out of trouble.

126
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,600
- Taeho. 
 - Did you get hit by Jaeseok again?

127
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
- Is Jaeseok following you? 
 - Is Taeho not here?

128
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,020
Taeho's father got into an accident so he's having surgery right now.

129
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,970
What?

130
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,740
Are you okay?

131
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,060
What happened?

132
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,440
It wasn't a broadcast accident, right?

133
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,480
How would I know that?

134
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,990
Everything is becoming weird.

135
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,900
It's because of you, right?

136
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,420
You're the one that's making everything weird.

137
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,430
Woohyun also needs to try and call his mom "mom."

138
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,310
He needs to say he's thankful to her for giving birth but why are you taking that chance away?

139
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,450
Woohyun's the one who stole everything from me!

140
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,200
I'll listen to everything you say.

141
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,710
I'll watch over your pain until it gets better.

142
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,620
So stop.

143
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Ta-da!

144
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,190
Hurry up and go to the hospital! Your father got into an accident!

145
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,400
That's Taeho, right? Did you tell him?

146
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
I won't leave that bastard, Jaeseok, alone.

147
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,210
Hey! Go to Taeho's father's hospital first.

148
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,400
What is this? Don't hide and come out.

149
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,290
So cowardly when you can't even show up. Do you think I'll give up Seulbi because you're doing this?

150
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,950
Seulbi and I will never separate!

151
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,230
I will protect her even if I die. So give up!

152
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,050
Why are you like this? What's going on?

153
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,770
I exercised. I have been out of shape these days.

154
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,510
Stop staring. My face will wear out.

155
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,090
I feel like you're always out of breath because of me.

156
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,940
Hey, that's good. That's proof that I'm alive and healthy.

157
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,960
Mister and Seungyeol haven't contacted you yet?

158
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,070
I'll find them. Eat.

159
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,040
You weren't able to eat anything all day today.

160
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,470
Please eat. I will find them.

161
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,400
I won't be able to help you with the dishes today.

162
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,070
Don't worry and come back.

163
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,640
No, why would you beat up a perfectly fine person?

164
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,160
Ow, high schoolers these days..

165
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,470
Did you really do that?

166
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,170
I won't compromise, so go ahead and file the complaint.

167
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,900
Hey, did your parents teach you to be like this?

168
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,990
No, they taught me to hit anyone who curses their parents.

169
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,460
This bastard, really!

170
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,190
Hey, hey, hey. Why are you being like this?

171
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,880
If I throw this, I can sleep here, right?

172
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,670
All right, stop it. Stop it.

173
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,860
Does it make sense for a child of a police officer to be like this?

174
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm sorry. I am very sorry.

175
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,820
What's going on? It's so unlike a model student (to act like this).

176
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,270
Keep him here today. That's his wish.

177
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,770
I know you're mad but this really isn't the answer.

178
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,600
Team Leader! Team Leader!

179
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,120
After your puberty passed,

180
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,080
is this really

181
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
the first place I spend the night with you?

182
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:47,930

184
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,940
Senior!

185
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,600
They said that even if you confess shyly with no confidence,

186
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,330
you have to reject with a loud, clear voice.

187
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,570
Stop torturing others and go back to your place.

188
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm requesting you.

189
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,230
I... I don't know why I'm doing this, but how can I go back?

190
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,940
Because of you, I can't return.

191
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,260
I'm only wearing the clothes of an angel but how am I an angel?

192
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,010
Senior, I know you're confused right now.

193
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,870
But this is not it!

194
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,950
Is rejecting easy for you? Why's everything so simple?

195
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,800
No, don't!

196
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,480
What is this?

197
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,370
- Who's there? 
 - No!

198
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,080
I'm okay as long as you're okay.

199
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,660
Who's there?  You're not going to show yourself?

200
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,680
 - Divorce! 
 - Get out. Come out!

201
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,330
 Hurry up and get out.

202
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,220
 Come out. Why aren't you coming out? Come out.

203
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,110
 Get a divorce. How can a person who threw away her own child teach Ethics class?

204
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,150
 They said it's for inheritance.

205
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,630
 Kick her out!

206
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,260
 Get out of the way. Let me see her face.

207
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,180
 Get out! Come out.

208
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,760
It's the unethical time for ethics.

209
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,000
Aren't you all going to leave?!

210
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,510
You are making the school turn into a joke.

211
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,040
Right? You should say something to your dad, right?

212
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,390
The brothers were brave.

213
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,540
Let's take class just for me.

214
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm going because I don't want to see you.

215
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,400
What are you doing not sitting?

216
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,110
Why don't you go back home and rest?

217
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,780
Open your books.

218
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,160
Sungyeol, let's take class.

219
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,320
Listen, or get out.

220
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,330
Let's start class.

221
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,700
Let's hurry and go. Today's a special.

222
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,470
- You come to school to eat, right? 
 - Let's go, Youngeun.

223
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,680
You can go, I don't want to.

224
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
Let's go. When you're done, let's go to the movies. Are you in?

225
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,450
In.

226
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:31,830

227
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,830
Woohyun.

228
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,270
The Ethics teacher turned in her resignation letter.

229
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,580
Was this really what you wanted?

230
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,660
Is it only this?

231
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,110
You guys are fighting a lot for brothers. Who's the older one?

232
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,620
You? You?

233
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,620
Hey, you need to finish what your doing.

234
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,340
Watching people fight is really fun.

235
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,840
Choi Jaeseok.

236
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,340
Go die.

237
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,050
No... This is school, punk.

238
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,240
Why are you coming only now?

239
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,030
You bastard!

240
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,470
- Stop it. 
 - Because of you I couldn't see my dad going in for surgery.

241
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,870
Stop it!

242
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:10,490
You bastard. If my dad doesn't wake up, I'll kill you!

243
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,290
I'll do it.

244
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,630
You stop, too.

245
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,860
You're dead today. Do you know how much I've been victimized?

246
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,670
Then you shouldn't have let him victimize you. Then he would have set his mind straight.

247
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,770
Calm down Taeho first.

248
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,310
Let's go.

249
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,830
You bastard! I won't stay still!

250
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,930
My pitiful father! What to do?

251
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,980
It was fun, right?

252
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,920
Although you think fighting is fun, I don't.

253
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,270
It can give someone a wound that you can't take back.

254
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,940
Since when can you speak? Shut your mouth!

255
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,350
You are not even the lowest of the low.

256
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,260
Learn how to make friends again.

257
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,520
Do you think Witch Teacher won't be fired just because we do this?

258
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,630
Thinking of Woohyun, I think quitting would be...

259
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,010
She should stay at school for Woohyun.

260
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,180
The Ethics teacher was a cold person, but she had an interest in the kids.

261
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,350
But where is Woohyun?

262
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,070
If it's not uncomfortable, let's study together.

263
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,600
Good! If we should do it anyway, let's do it for Woohyun.

264
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,190
First, let's turn in the students' petitions and try to convince the parents.

265
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,860
We'll take charge of leaving comments on the school and education office page.

266
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,270
Wow. You guys.

267
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,400
Look at this wonderful couple.

268
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,260
Thanks, you guys.

269
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,500
I'll try making the ballots.

270
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,100

271
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,630

272
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,550
You have to worry about your stepmom.

273
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,400
I...

274
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,020
think I've become a tadpole again.

275
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,290
Congrats, bastard.

276
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm scared.

277
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,660
That I'll be alone again.

278
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:30,110

279
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,240
I heard you turned in your resignation letter.

280
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,520
- Yeah. 
 - Why?

281
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,900
Kids are irritating. You two, as well.

282
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,950
I don't want to see them at school.

283
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,630
You said you became a teacher because you thought there was a chance you could've been with me.

284
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,760
That's when there was no Sungyeol.

285
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,490
It's hard when there's both of you.

286
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,150
Don't mind my business anymore. You'll only get hurt.

287
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,630
I'm on night watch. I can't come home tonight.

288
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,500
Rest and look at other schools.

289
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,840
Sungyeol's uncomfortable and Woohyun's...

290
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,520
But you really can't contact Woohyun's father?

291
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,040
I don't think it's right to let Sungyeol and Woohyun be.

292
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,170
Do you only see Seungyeol?

293
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,700
You can't see Woohyun who's pretending that everything's all right.

294
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,670
So don't let them suffer and let's look at other options!

295
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,770
You're saying that option is finding Woohyun's dad in America and sending him off?

296
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,600
It's okay to let Sungyeol survive but for Woohyun to get hurt?

297
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,270
If I knew that Sungyeol would have such a hard time, I wouldn't have taken Woohyun in.

298
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,980
I will never put Woohyun somewhere else.

299
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,240
I will raise him.

300
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,460
If she gets fired, you two can sell ddeokbokki together.

301
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,140
That's not a bad idea. Thanks for letting me know.

302
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,030
Leave.

303
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,110
- You leave. 
 - This is our house.

304
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,870
Unfair jerk. You slept at my house as well.

305
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,270
- Leave! 
 - Be quiet!

306
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,120
I'm warning you but I'm not letting you go.

307
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,180
Bad guy.

308
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:10,930
♫  When it was cold but not really cold...  ♫

309
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,400
♫  It was the beginning of fall  ♫

310
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:25,450
♫  You seemed like you'd be cold  ♫

311
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:31,960
♫  But you're wearing short clothes  ♫

312
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,930
♫  The season passed  ♫

313
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,640
♫  And today is warm  ♫

314
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,180
 The unethical teacher should step down. Step down!

315
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,890
 Step down! Step down!

316
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,870
 Resign! Resign!

317
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,320
Hey, Yoojung sign this. Yoojung!

318
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,460
Please sign this petition.

319
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,060
 The unethical teacher should step down!

320
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,730
 Self-resign! Resign! Resign!

321
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,810
Please sign this petition opposing Ethics teacher being dismissed!

322
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:18,660
 The unethical teacher should step down. Step down! Step down!

323
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,370
  Self-resign! Resign! Resign!

324
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,830
 The unethical teacher should step down. Step down, step down!

325
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,560
Is this the reason why you left the house early?

326
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,900
I don't think it's right to let our teacher go like that.

327
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,610
- She chose it herself. 
 - You also think Sungyeol's going to have a hard time,

328
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,120
so you keep all the hard times to yourself.

329
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:53,240
The teacher probably also made that decision thinking it would be hard for you.

330
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,990
You should sign this, too. We don't have enough signatures.

331
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,940
Well, good. Because I definitely agree with resignation.

332
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,500
If the teacher leaves, he'll be hurt...

333
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,560
Your father is all right, right?

334
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,080
He woke up.

335
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,980
That's a relief!

336
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,950
Did you worry?

337
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,550
I had to give this to you, so I was worried.

338
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,690
If I do this, will you give me something?

339
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,410
I gave you juice.

340
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,020
Eh?! Was this a bribe?

341
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,890
I won't take it.

342
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,410
Okay then.

343
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,090
No, I'll do it!

344
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,510
Oh my god! Are you a pervert?

345
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,090
Do you have constipation? Sign this.

346
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,260
You don't like our teacher.

347
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,420
She's also Woohyun's mother.

348
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,430
She's Seungyeol's mom, too.

349
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,040
That punk will definitely agree with dismissal.

350
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,990
He's so cold because she's his stepmother.

351
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,100
Woohyun can't even call his mother his mother.

352
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,340
Bad guy.

353
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,140
Aren't you being too involved in someone else's life?

354
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,300
I don't like it when Woohyun's having a hard time.

355
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,460
Just do it.

356
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,670
Thank you.

357
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,970
It's revenge on Sungyeol.

358
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,160
What next?

359
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,610
I don't have any interest in teachers just like how they don't have interest in us.

360
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm not saying to write your personal feelings. We need to block this unfair...

361
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,050
Did Woohyun and Sungyeol sign it?

362
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,230
Oh, they will.

363
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,870
These things, family needs to do it first.

364
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,490
- Where are you at? 
 - I'm against her being fired.

365
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,040
Than I'll do the opposite of you.

366
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,390
Do you want to do these things so you look good in front of Woohyun?

367
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,180
Never mind! So where did Woohyun do it?

368
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Are you sure?

369
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,510
Call Woohyun.

370
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,930
and tell him I have the same feelings as him.

371
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,710
Thank you! Let's each lunch together!

372
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,770
It was you? The milk?

373
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,310
You have to eat with me! I'll pay!

374
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,170
I'm on a diet!

375
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,270
Do you want to help our teacher... ?

376
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,640
Do you want to help the Ethics teacher...?

377
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,800
Why do I have to eat bread like this?

378
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,900
Hey, your teacher is having his meal.

379
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,400
Don't you know you don't even bother a dog when they're eating? What's your reason for doing this?

380
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,080
One, you want to get hit.

381
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,960
Two, you want to continue getting hit. Three, you want to get hit where you got hit again.

382
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,650
Five, you get up surprised and sit back down in embarrassment.

383
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,280
Oh, Director!

384
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,450
Oh my. Oh my, what is this?

385
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,640
I didn't expect this.  What a waste of bread.

386
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,240
Ah, yes! I was just keeping it there. It's fun to look for it.

387
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,660
It's nothing else, but I heard that the kids are moving  (doing something).

388
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,000
Ah, yes! I think they're trying to boycott against the resignation. I will do something about it soon.

389
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:02,360
Teacher, this is what I think. For students, who have no interest other than smartphones and games, to start taking action on this must mean something.

390
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,290
At times like these, I think it's okay for us to wait for them.

391
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,550
Of course! Of course! I'm your man. I will wait.

392
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,680
Yes, I will continue to wait.

393
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:23,800
That Witch Teacher, she should have taken care of her popularity. There are many more people who want her to resign.

394
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,080
Even if we do this, the final answer will still be made by the adults.

395
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,680
This is the painful result of distrust in adults.

396
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,800
We need to show them even more that we can do this.  Let's try harder.

397
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,090
Aren't you going to sign?

398
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:07,190
Lee Seulbi, I'll sign it, too.

399
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,570
- You want to? 
 - Yeah.

400
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,860
1 vote for resignation. Right?

401
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:24,600
Is that kid a bat? Since when was he with Sungyeol?

402
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,710
The more you are a coward, the more you know how to survive.

403
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,260
1 vote for resignation.

404
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,500
It's not the teacher's fault. If we gather our forces...

405
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,300
Stop it.

406
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,150
1 vote for resignation for me, too.

407
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,590
What is this? The brothers are on opposite sides?

408
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,060
They're a broken family.

409
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:03,610
I don't have a person to freely call "mom" like you.

410
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,640
You, who can call someone "mom," more than ten times a day,

411
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,830
is stuck in my throat and I can't swallow nor spit it out.

412
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,350
That's why I'm always suffocating.

413
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:32,440
The only place I can see her freely, or hear her voice, is in class.

414
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,630
I'm begging you.

415
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,050
Please let me see her like this.

416
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:51,290
Hey. Aren't you guys Woohyun's friends?

417
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,180
Woohyun thinks of you all as friends.

418
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,230
What's up with all the people who didn't sign this?

419
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,580
Did you not sign this because you couldn't eat it?

420
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,490
♫  You're in front of me  ♫

421
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,560
♫  You're looking at me  ♫

422
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,710
♫  and smiling  ♫

423
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,860
♫  I can't breathe  ♫

424
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,700
You were cool, Puppy.

425
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:39,330
♫  Just one look from you is so overwhelming for me  ♫

426
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:47,840
♫  So I'm looking at you like this  ♫

427
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,840
♫  The season passed  ♫

428
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,910
♫  and today the sunshine is warm  ♫

429
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:14,850
The student's parent's protests are no joke. I think accepting her resignation letter...

430
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,970
A strong teacher can change a student, right?

431
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,840
So I found out something new.

432
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:31,770
Even a teacher with a poor personal life can change a student's life.

433
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,810
This is proof. The kids have gathered strength.

434
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Well... I think this incident made them love and consider each other.

435
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,980
So, Teachers, I think it's time you showed what it's like to be a great teacher.

436
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,010
But... if the parents continue to interfere with school affairs every time something like this happens...

437
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:03,090
Should I hand some money (bribe) over to you? Fight them.

438
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:10,460
Properly fight, properly win, and properly love. Show and teach the kids this.

439
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:21,020
I will accept your resignation when you retire.

440
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,350
Chief Director Lee.

441
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:27,080
Just as it took you long to get to your position, take a long time to get back down.

442
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,260
There's someone who likes to write stuff like this, right?

443
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,840
Kwangsik...Teacher Kwangsik.

444
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,730
- Please leave already. 
 - Yes.

445
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:58,970
Teacher, why did you come now? I waited for you for so long. I lost all this weight because the kids bothered me so much.

446
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

447
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,640
But, Sir. Did you come from a Halloween party? You look like Gollum.

448
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,700
You guys are so meddlesome. Thanks anyway, guys!

449
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,310
Sit down. Sit down.

450
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,590
It's a relief that our teacher's going to stay at school.

451
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,720
We don't know if it's a relief or not.

452
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,320
Why is there so much?

453
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Eat a lot. Thanks so much, friends.

454
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,150
I feel great because it actually feels like we did something.

455
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,540
Friends are so good.

456
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,030
Then, how good is a boyfriend?

457
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,440
This much? Or this much? Or this much?

458
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,660
Let's talk.

459
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,250
I have nothing to say.

460
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,150
Sungyeol, I'll change.

461
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:18,500
That's why. Let's not fight anymore.

462
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:25,130
Congratulations on staying at school. I'm curious about what will happen next.

463
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,900
How much more can I do for you to forgive me?

464
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,000
Forgive you?

465
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,910
Sungyeol. Please Sungyeol.

466
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,060
Give me that necklace! You have no use for it!

467
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,820
I'm throwing it away because it's trash.

468
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,260
Give that necklace to him. I threw it away as well.

469
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,870
You heard it, right? You, who threw your son away like trash, told me to throw this away.

470
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,190
Don't talk like that.

471
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,170
It broke.

472
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,720
Good.

473
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,850
So throw it away with your own hands.

474
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,840
I can only tolerate so much.

475
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,480
There are no limits stopping me from ruining both you and the teacher.

476
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,060
Now, I won't let you steal Seulbi or teacher from me.

477
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:41,520
Yeah? The moment I talk about Lee Seulbi...

478
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,640
- You and Seulbi can forever... 
 - I told you to shut that mouth!

479
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,760
I'll explain.

480
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,330
Get out of my house, right now.

481
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,840
 I want all your wishes to be fulfilled.

482
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,590
 - I will erase it for you~ 
 - I think there are humans who don't express their love and gratitude.

483
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,810
 I feel like I'm becoming a real monster.

484
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,500
 Don't forgive me.

485
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,170
 Does that mean something more dangerous can happen?

486
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:27,350
 I'm sick of me being in danger because of you.

487
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,570
  Now, you're scary, too.

488
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,130
 So just leave.

489
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,620
  The answer as of now is just that.
