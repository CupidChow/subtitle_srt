1
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,910
Hello.

2
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,640
Oh, Lee Seulbi.

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,580
Woohyun and I are having fun at the park.

4
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,190
I'm sure you know, that it'll be even more fun from now on.

5
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,300
No, don't come!

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
What's wrong with this?

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,270
What the heck?

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,610
Seulbi!

9
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,390
Seulbi, are you okay?

10
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,840
- Woohyun... ? 
 - Wait a bit.

11
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,700
I'm going to kill...

12
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,160
You jerk, if you call on Seulbi one more time...

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,110
I originally wanted your money, but...

14
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,700
Jerk!

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,830
Hey! Hey! Hey!

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,030
Ah, you punks.

17
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,540
Why are you friends fighting? You should get along together.

18
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,660
Harmony. Music is the best for harmony. Let's start the music.

19
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,340
What's wrong?  I wasn't done yet.  I was just getting to the good part.

20
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,450
Look! I'm starting now!

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,310
♪ Everybody... ♪

22
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,050
♪ Everybody dance now... ♪

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,100
Watch out, Shin Woohyun!

24
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,460
Seulbi!

25
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,080
Lee Seulbi, get up now.

26
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,070
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm hungry.

28
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,230
I bet Grandma will get mad.

29
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,110
Guys usually mature by fighting.

30
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,240
I think I became mature without fighting.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,930
How cocky. You are surprisingly interfering.

32
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,160
I didn't ask you to help, so why did you come? Your hand is even injured.

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,270
You lived because of me.

34
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,010
- You also almost died because of me. 
 - It's simple to say you didn't do it.

35
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,390
Stop acting cool.

36
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,510
Is that why you were fighting with Choi Jaeseok?

37
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,720
Are you crazy? I'm very busy.

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,450
I'm especially not interested in you.

39
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,710
Too much concern leads to getting beaten up.

40
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,750
You know you hit me once, right?

41
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,350
Should I hit you?

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,240
I am sorry.

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,630
- What are you doing?! 
 - What are you doing?!

44
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,730
Guys relationships are by actions, not words.

45
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,790
The male leads in dramas are all like that.

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,170
Pervert.

47
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,500
I can't go with such a psycho, let's go.

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,050
Let's all go together.

49
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,650

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,460
Ow!  Do it gently.

51
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,290
Sh!  You'll wake Grandma.

52
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,730
Ah, that's right.

53
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,320
Do you also trust Sungyeol?

54
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,420
You said so yourself... that he's not that kind of person.

55
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,560
I feel the same.

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,830
I'm so proud of you, Our Puppy.

57
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,990
I'm not your grandson.

58
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,740
Anyway, don't fight.

59
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,230
- By the way, are you sick? 
 - Me?

60
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,480
No, I'm fine.

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
Then, why did you faint?

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah... right.  Why am I like that?

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,380
Why do you always seem to faint in Hwang Sungyeol's arms?

64
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.  Sungyeol was there when I fainted.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,890
I need to thank him tomorrow.

66
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,570
Thank him for what?

67
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,080
It's just whenever you faint, Sungyeol just happens to always be there.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,690
Maybe, Sungyeol...

69
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,220
- is my destiny... 
 - Destiny, my ass.  It's a coincidence!  Coincidence!

70
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,560
- If you faint on that guy one more time... 
 - Don't worry, I won't.

71
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,340

72
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,470
Athlete's Foot cream!

73
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,700
Hey, this!  What the heck... !

74
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,140
Sh! Grandma puts it on every night. I brought it secretly, so be quiet.

75
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,610
Hey!

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,250
No wonder I smelled Ms. Gong's feet.

77
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,870
Ah, seriously!

78
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,900

79
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,180
Narcolepsy?

80
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800

Dates and kiwis are good.

81
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,480
I did all this so that kid better not dare to faint on that punk again.

82
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,070
Aigoo...

83
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,430
Oh my!  What's all this?

84
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,940
Mrs. Gong, you seemed tired these days

85
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,350
so I decided to prepare breakfast.

86
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,680
It's weird seeing you doing something you don't usually do.

87
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,140
Why is your face like that?

88
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,740
- He fell... 
 - During gym class...

89
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,970
I fell during gym class.

90
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,590
You should have been careful.

91
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,560
Kiwi salad, kiwi sandwich, kiwi juice.

92
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,870
- Why all the kiwi? 
 - Huh?

93
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,260
So you'll grow taller.

94
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,790
So, you grow taller eating kiwi?

95
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,030
My goodness, do you believe those words?

96
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,330
You didn't mix anything weird into this, right?

97
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,650
In dramas, all the nice kids get fed this.

98
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,830
That's something only nice kids need to worry about.

99
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,190
Just eat it.  There's nothing wrong with it.

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,750
Ms. Gong, ah!

101
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,530
It's good, right?

102
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,060
Because you take after me, your food tastes great.

103
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,260
Grandma, ah!

104
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,760
Seulbi's tastes better.

105
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,980
 It wasn't Sungyeol.  I saw it.

106
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,770
 Seokhoon and Jaeseok were doing something suspicious together.

107
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,470
Wow, really...

108
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,200
Looks like you hit the jackpot.  Let me see.

109
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,750
I know.

110
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,330
Jackpot-hitting punk.

111
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,740
You're the one who got it good.

112
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,780
Since yesterday, your luck has come to an end.

113
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,770
So you had better be careful.

114
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,140
What do you mean "just cover this cheating scandal?"

115
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,870
If we don't cover it, what more will come out of it except gossip?

116
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,000
I was deeply touched by Jaeseok's father yesterday.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,230
I mean, is it an easy thing to acknowledge his child's wrongdoings

118
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,450
and ask for a settlement?

119
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,030
He's really a great person. He also has to go to Congress.

120
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,620
Jaeseok's father came to school?

121
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,500
If so, then why did he come to you, a teacher, instead of me, the homeroom teacher?

122
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,280
You seemed busy, so I told him to take care of it.

123
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,770
Principal, I took care of it cleanly.

124
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,720
Even so, it's my student's problem

125
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,470
so I'll look into it more...

126
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,430
Teacher, sometimes it's best to overlook things.

127
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,560
Then are you saying to also overlook how unfair it was to Hwang Sungyeol?

128
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,660
That's right. Don't you know that it'll end up as a scar for the student?

129
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,220
Since there's no change in student Choi Jaeseok being last place

130
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,120
regardless of that zero,

131
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,440
let's just end it with the punishment being campus cleanup.

132
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:04,230
Teacher Ahn, you're quite active with this issue.

133
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,530
He must be a student that you especially like.

134
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,870
Where did that happen? It must hurt.

135
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,960
Shin Woohyun?

136
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,130
What's wrong with your face?

137
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,050
I fell.

138
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,840
You should have been careful.

139
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,760
Jaeseok, Byungwook, Taeho!

140
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,600
Come over here.

141
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,690
You know, I smell something very suspicious.

142
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,020
Did you guys fight?

143
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,470
- We fell. 
 - We fell.

144
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,590
All four of you?

145
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,650
You're telling me to believe that?

146
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,320
All of you, put out your hands.

147
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,530
Drink those.

148
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,390
Right now!

149
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,830
I am giving these to you guys for good luck at the scholastic ability test.

150
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,540
I'm buying this especially for you.

151
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,150
I took care of the zero.

152
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,560
I did it so that you could self-reflect, so I expect you to do so.

153
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,750
I heard that my father said he'll invest money to redo the gym floor.

154
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,930
I can go, right?

155
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,970
So you're going to give up your conscience for the gym floor?

156
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,770
Both your conscience and the gym floor are getting stepped on.

157
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,800
I believe in you.

158
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,670
There's a saying that if you get hit by the believing ax, it'll hurt more.

159
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,750

160
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,240
You owe me a debt.

161
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,580
You're the one who got caught.

162
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,050
You know why a bomb is so scary?

163
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,700
You don't know when it'll explode with a bang.

164
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Expect it.

165
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,300
The words of a last-place troublemaker,

166
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,650
who'll believe them?

167
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,670
Oh, this time it's a historical drama audition?

168
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,510
My Lady, let's go.

169
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,260
Are you Choonhyang? 
  (T/N: Choonhyang is a character in a classic Korean love story)

170
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,460
Why are there only two Hyangdans? 
 (T/N: Hyangdan is a servant girl to Choonhyang)

171
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,250
Bring Choonhyang here immediately.

172
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,170
Won't you go away this instant?

173
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,060
- We will fall away. 
 - This scoundrel!

174
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,810
Very insolent..

175
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,490
I feel disgusted talking to lowly people like you guys.

176
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,400
- Move aside! 
 - Hey, just move aside.

177
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,490
Why don't you move aside?  You need to do better.

178
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,460
If I fail the audition, it's your fault.

179
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,330
You're too full of yourself.

180
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,760
Jaeseok, since we picked up all the trash, we're going.

181
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,040
See you later.

182
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,730
What are you two about?

183
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,780
You're the one who did that to Woohyun's face, right?

184
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,360
If I said I did, just what are you going to do about it?

185
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,720
I can make Dayool never be able to audition again in her lifetime.

186
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,900
What do you want to eat?

187
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,600
What's up with today?

188
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,860
Hey, Jaeseok!

189
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,740
Now, what do you want?

190
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,740
If you mess with Woohyun one more time, you're going to get punished!

191
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,350
Punished? Do you speak the same way as him because you live in the same house as him?

192
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,610
Ah, seriously.

193
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,540
You don't feel anything after making someone else hurt?

194
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,560
Do you want to really get punished?

195
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,650
Bad kid or good kid, I think getting hurt is all the same.

196
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,560
From now on, don't fight.

197
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,320
I hate doing projects in general, and now I have to do a group project with these ridiculous guys.

198
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
Ah, I'm so pissed!

199
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,790
I'm very sorry! Just why is this stack falling and everything?

200
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,510
If you cross the line, you die.

201
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,900
Then, where do I...

202
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,760
Don't you know that if you say don't do it, he'll want to do it more; and if you say don't cross, he'll want to cross even more?

203
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,410
What is he saying?

204
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,810
Perhaps, are you telling Kisoo to cross over? Do you like Kisoo?

205
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,500
What?

206
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
New couple here.

207
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,100
- Oh, they have something between them.  
 - Couples to be soon!

208
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,970
You are not making any sense at all.

209
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,120
Hey, Lee Seulbi, do mine as well.

210
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm so pissed.

211
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,140
Me, too... because I'm busy with my part-time job...

212
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,600
You're telling me to do everything by myself?

213
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,390
What do you mean alone? You have Woohyun.

214
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,210
- Hey! 
 - Sorry!

215
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,170
Hey! Those rascals!

216
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,440
Why? What more?

217
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,270
I'm curious if you would really want to cross over more if I tell you not to.

218
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,470
You! Don't you dare cross over.

219
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,160
Awesome! I will never cross over, okay?

220
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,510
Huh!  Does the pencil have feet?

221
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,100
- You just crossed over. 
 - No, I didn't.

222
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,280
Does an eraser have feet, too?

223
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,070
You said you would never cross the line.  I told you you would be tempted to.

224
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,460
Idiot.

225
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,930
Aren't you hot?

226
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,860
I know you like it.

227
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,110
You would like it if I were Woohyun.

228
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,000
Pro Lee. 
  (T/N: pro is a way to call a golf player)

229
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,020
Mom.

230
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,040
You should go and practice golf.

231
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,680
Mom, Young Eun is going in the same direction. Could you drive her, too?

232
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,790
I'm sorry. The coach is waiting for you so I cannot today.

233
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,310
When did you switch to golf?

234
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,430
Uh... I think a month ago...

235
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,250
Hurry up and get in.

236
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,600
Sorry. I will call you.

237
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,870
I'm not getting in even if I were allowed.

238
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,700
They are both arrogant.

239
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,450
I'll gain weight after eating all this.

240
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,510
Is she your only friend?

241
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,460
Don't you have a bright friend instead of a dark and gloomy one?

242
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,970
Even if she looks like that, she is nice.

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Ah, a friend like that, really.

244
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,450
Just read the highlighted parts.  It is summarized.

245
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,960
Mom, do I have to do golf?

246
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,940
Is there something else you want to do?

247
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Tell me! I will support you no matter what.

248
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,210
It's been a long time since you said you were sick.

249
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,550
You know how bad it is.

250
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,820
Are you scared, perhaps?

251
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,200
Of course not!

252
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
I am scared actually.

253
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,670
I hate going to a dental clinic. Sungyeol is like me, too. So he always cried whenever he went.

254
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,560
Well, you're not going to cry, are you?

255
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,700
I will be by your side.

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
Oh my.

257
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,790
Even if you are busy, you should come regularly for a check-up.

258
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,620
Okay.

259
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,420
Does it hurt a lot?

260
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,280
- I heard that getting implants hurt really bad. 
 - It doesn't hurt at all, because you are here.

261
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,630
Really? You're lying.

262
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,850
Oh, and do not tell Sungyeol that I got an implant.

263
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,670
I don't want to let him know that I am getting old.

264
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,170
You are such a good father.

265
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,920
Am I not a good husband, also?

266
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,440
I don't know.

267
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,660
Okay, I will try harder.

268
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,780
I am sorry.

269
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,130
I am grateful that you are always good to Sungyeol.

270
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,250
I will coax Sungyeol somehow.

271
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,930
Being a good father is a priority.

272
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,650
Sungyeol will be very tired these days.

273
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,200
Since I heard your story, I will talk with him sometime today.

274
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,540
Okay. I think that will be the first date in a long time.

275
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,210
Have a good time, and don't mind me.

276
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,680
You there!

277
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,220
Student! Good-looking student!

278
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,650
You have to go somewhere with me.

279
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,740
Let's go.

280
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,890
Here, let's eat.

281
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,310
I won't run away, so eat comfortably.

282
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,570
Yum.

283
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,200
I eat this every day but it tastes so much better 
 since I am with you.

284
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,700
I heard from your mom.

285
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,500
I know it's not you.

286
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,990
Whatever.

287
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,470
I like it even if it's uncomfortable since you're close to me.

288
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,440
Eat up. It's not good when it's swelled up.

289
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,020
We should eat something that takes longer next time.

290
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,870
Eat it well.

291
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:13,100

292
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,020
- Here. 
 - Oh yes.

293
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,330
Why did you suddenly want a get-together?

294
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,080
Well, this get-together was provided by Jaeseok's father...

295
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,230
...not. I mean, I, who was moved by Jaeseok's father, am paying for all of this.

296
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,340
Uh, the time has passed for the principal to arrive, why isn't she coming?

297
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,680
What about Philip?

298
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,250
He said he was going to come.

299
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,790
Oh, you're drinking well. Have another.

300
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:57,310
Teacher, let me take care of my own students next time, please.

301
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:03,070
There are no boundaries to that.  All the students are our students.

302
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,950
You and I have very different methods in dealing with students.

303
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,480
Teacher, let's not talk about school now.  Here, have a drink.

304
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,770
Oh, you drink very well. Have another drink.

305
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Wow, Teacher you drink very well

306
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,950
So, when is Philip coming?

307
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,290
Yeah... I know, right?

308
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,200
- Give it to me. 
 - Eh?

309
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,900
Oh. Yes.

310
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,200
He told me he is coming for the first time.

311
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,750
He said he can't come.

312
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,940
What? Why?

313
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,860
He's got diarrhea. He says it is not too bad, but he will rest at home.

314
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,210
Diarrhea?

315
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,330
Oh, that's really...

316
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,130
I'm going to go to Teacher Philip.

317
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,260
If you're hurt and alone, it's really lonely.

318
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,670
I am a nurse, you know.

319
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,750
Where are you going?

320
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,400
You don't even know where he lives.

321
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,900
You must be crazy!

322
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,370
Teacher! Why would you pull the skirt?

323
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,280
That's why you are still single!

324
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,880
Skinship is supposed to be natural.

325
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,140
Ah... Teacher.

326
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,720
Well, slapping someone in the face is also skinship, too, right?

327
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,510
Slap, ah. Slap, ah.

328
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,000
I will protect my hubby's face.

329
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,130
Why is it so messy here when I told you to clean up?

330
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,410
Are you hungry again?

331
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,590
I'm making porridge for Grandma.

332
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,120
Humans eat porridge when they have indigestion, right?

333
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,380
You and your humans... Miss Gong is feeling sick again?

334
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,140
I told her to go to the doctor's office. How stubborn.

335
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,820
Prepare rice, and then...

336
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,640
Breathe. Or you might die.

337
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,480
Why are you being like this between cousins?

338
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,150
Did you forget that we're cousins?

339
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,750
Oh, right. Cousins...

340
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,430
Why did you make it confusing by lying that we're cousins?

341
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,020
I hate things that take too much time.

342
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
Our Puppy,

343
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,160
if Grandma disappears, you won't go hungry.

344
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,680
If Ms. Gong isn't here, I will starve.

345
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,540
Don't talk like that.

346
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,280
I'm getting older now.

347
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,780
Ms. Gong...

348
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,300
I also know that everyone grows old.

349
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:46,690
If Ms. Gong is gone, Our Puppy won't eat food, go to school, or sleep...

350
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,050
So hurry up and get up.

351
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,390
Oh, this is so good.

352
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm getting stronger.

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,190
You know I have no one but Grandma, right?

354
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,100
So don't get hurt.

355
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, yeah...

356
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,000
Give this to Seulbi.

357
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,410
What is this?

358
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,180
Is it her salary?

359
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,650
You give her food and clothes. Why did you give her so much?

360
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,300
What about me?  Do I have to give you food, clothes, and money, too?

361
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,510
Ms. Gong is back now.

362
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,940
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

363
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,620
Please.

364
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,570
I will be fine once I get some rest.

365
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,830
Woohyun and you...

366
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,230
aren't cousins, right?

367
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,250
That...

368
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,870
Do you like Woohyun?

369
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,420
Eh?

370
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,570
I've never thought about that.

371
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,050
Then don't think about it from now on.

372
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,430
I like Woohyun.

373
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,370
Even if my breath gets cut off,

374
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,370
I only think about Woohyun.

375
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,850
Even when I feel suffocated because of my mom,

376
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,200
I only think about Woohyun.

377
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,350
Woohyun could be the reason for me dying

378
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,470
and also a reason for me to breath.

379
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,180
For Woohyun,

380
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,490
could you die?

381
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,260
Die?

382
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,280
I could die...

383
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,440
for Woohyun.

384
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,370

385
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,690
She went to go throw away the trash, but she's not picking up. Where is she?

386
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,450
Hey! Lee Seulbi!

387
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,670
Where did you just come from?

388
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,550
Just getting some fresh air.

389
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,460
If you're going somewhere, why don't you tell me or call me?

390
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,560
Why? Did something happen?

391
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,340
Why is the color of your face like that?

392
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm tired.

393
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,040
Tada! Here is your salary.

394
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,750
What's wrong with you? This is your salary.

395
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,950
Hey! Lee Seulbi!

396
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,810
I thought she would go crazy from excitement.

397
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,340
Is she hurt somewhere again?

398
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,510
 It is time for P.T. Where are you?

399
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,070
Mom...

400
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,390
I'm hurting.

401
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,630
I'm going to rest just for today.

402
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,370
 Don't you know that if you miss one day, everything you did for the week disappears?

403
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,470
 A happy day comes to you when you do your work, even when you don't want to.

404
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,570
Even if I feel like dying today?

405
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,250
 Of course. Kim Yuna, Park Taehwan... They all did that.  
  (T/N: famous Korean athletes)

406
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,270
Mom...

407
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,050
I said I'm hurting so much.

408
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,190
 Come in quickly.

409
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,420
 I will buy you the purse that you wanted, tomorrow at the mall.

410
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,310
It feels really strange right here.

411
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:12,790

412
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,440
Hey, Lee Seulbi!

413
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,510
What's wrong with her?

414
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,580
Did you two fight? Love fight?

415
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,830
Be quiet!

416
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,940
Oh, right. Cousins.

417
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,670
Okay, okay.

418
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,650
Mine, too.

419
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,590
And mine.

420
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,670
You're the only one using up your energy. Hey, Lee Seulbi!

421
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,610
Are you okay?

422
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,210
Let's go to the nurse's office.

423
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,090
Let's go.

424
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,170
The nurse is pretty late.

425
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,780
We'll just wait a little while.

426
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,170
Sorry....because of me.

427
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,650
It's fortunate. I can rest from exercising.

428
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,290
You do sports? What kind?

429
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,590
This and that. Everything but the ones I haven't done.

430
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,760
I'm trying to go to college by specializing in sports.

431
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,840
Then you can't get hurt.

432
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,640
It's going to be all right after a few days.

433
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,630
I've been hurt a lot. I know the feeling.

434
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,800
Do you have to go to college with that much effort?

435
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,070

436
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,590
My mom wants me to go to a good university.

437
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,280
Studying is too hard so I'm devoting myself to sports.

438
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,560
Mom says this is for me.

439
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,600
But I am just a being that exists only to achieve my mom's dreams for her.

440
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,630
Are you showing off that you have a mom?

441
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,220
Oh no! Sorry.

442
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,630
Your joke is like a documentary. It's boring.

443
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,120
She is late.

444
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,590
When is she coming?

445
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,160
It's hot today.

446
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,700
I know, right? It's really hot.

447
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,090
Do you want to go and eat ice cream?

448
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:18,650
Then I'll buy the ice cream, so can you go with me somewhere?

449
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,490
Let's go.

450
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,960
Welcome!

451
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,340
Ice cream is here!

452
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,920
It just melts in your mouth. I mean it melts because of this hot weather, but

453
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,260
it's ice cream that just melts in your mouth... Student!

454
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,760
Me?

455
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,330
You're the prizewinner.

456
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,480
You're my first customer since my opening.

457
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,880
I was waiting for one person... just to give it to one person!

458
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,950
For free, free!

459
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,370
It's an event, an event.

460
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,830
This is the actual ice cream. And today is 1+1 again.

461
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,490
Take this to school and eat it.  Enjoy.

462
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,300
Come, come, come, come here for a second.

463
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,910
I gave it to you for free, so you should greet me and then go.

464
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,280
Yes, yes, yes!  That's right.

465
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,180
Eat it well. That's right.

466
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,840
That's right!  Hurry up and eat it well.

467
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,470
Yeah! That's right. Go on, go on!

468
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,240
Thank you. I should have been the one to buy the ice cream.

469
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,430
Buy it next time.

470
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,880
And you chose Grandma's present. You're a really good guy.

471
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,310
I'll take you with me next time.

472
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,560
Let's go to my house right now.

473
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,040
I'll give you spicy rice cakes.

474
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,450
Oh my god, what do I do? I'm sorry.

475
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,790
No, eat this. I'll take care of it.

476
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,040
Senior.

477
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,460
You're finally alone.

478
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,450
Thank you for last time.

479
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,620
That time when the necklace fell in, you were there, right?

480
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,630
I told you not to use your powers all at once.

481
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,830
I think they're slowly disappearing... my powers.

482
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,600
Without an angel, everything becomes out-of-luck for humans.

483
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,790
I am an angel, and I am becoming like them, too?

484
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,860
But why is it unlucky to be a human?

485
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,130
Are you saying that because you actually don't know how weak they are?

486
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,520
They can't fight pain, and they don't live forever.

487
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,010
That's true, but...

488
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,440
Do you want to disappear?

489
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,760
Like that ice cream.

490
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,600
Don't give your feelings to a human.

491
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,300
I'm looking for a way for you to get back.

492
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,420
What are you doing?

493
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,050
Mmmm, this is delicious.

494
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,540
Yes. Since it's melting like this, it's ice cream.

495
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,850
That's why it's delicious.

496
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,590
Why don't kids know this?

497
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,550
What? Transfer?

498
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,480
Are you human?

499
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,570
This is also for Woohyun.

500
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,820
Even though you didn't raise him, you're still Woohyun's mom!

501
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,290
Did you forget that, too?

502
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,010
There's no benefit to let the truth out.

503
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,290
And I...

504
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,790
married again, so I have a son.

505
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,330
Then live well with that son!

506
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,070
Don't ask for an unrelated child.

507
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,340
He goes to the same school as Woohyun... my son.

508
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,640
"My son?"

509
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,880
Then make him transfer!

510
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,500
It's sorrowful enough for him to grow up without his mother, now you want him to transfer?

511
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,800
No way!

512
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,980
- Mother. 
 - I am not your mother!

513
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:54,360
Mother, I have finally felt that this is what happiness is.

514
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,290
I'm asking for your favor.

515
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,340
Do you think money solves everything?

516
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,170
You can't break your son's heart just for your own happiness!

517
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,300
Don't appear here ever again!

518
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,040
Hwang Sungyeol, did you move to this neighborhood?

519
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,340
Why do I keep seeing you?

520
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,820
Are you here now?

521
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,810
I said we should have spicy rice cakes because I was thankful.

522
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,190
- Thankful about what... 
 - Did you drop her off safely?

523
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,870
Huh? Yeah.

524
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:35,090
Are you paying for the spicy rice cakes? I'm going to eat a lot.

525
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,330
Wait!

526
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,460
Here...

527
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,290
Ms. Gong?

528
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,860
Isn't that the witch teacher?

529
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,850
Did she come here for spicy rice cakes?

530
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,340
I'll go in first. Grandma!

531
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,960
Ms. Gong, what are you doing right now?

532
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,280
Oh...

533
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,940
Why are you to Teacher...?

534
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,640
My goodness...

535
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,080
She left it inside, so I'm giving it back to her.

536
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,910
Oh... This is my grandma.

537
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:23,380
If you order delivery next time, I will make sure I bring extra change and a credit card processor.

538
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,390
Let's go. Let's go quickly.

539
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,650
Bye.

540
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,720
It's over!

541
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,660
Why are you here?

542
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,540
Ah really! Oh my god!

543
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,740
Oh my god. Oh my god.

544
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,050
Did you get chased by someone?

545
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,610
Yes. Something like that.

546
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,880
What are you doing tomorrow?

547
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,170
Not hanging out with you, for sure.

548
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,510
Let's go bike riding.

549
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,720
That's so random. It's too hot.

550
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,080
 You'd better bring Woohyun here.

551
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,090
 If you can't, you're dead meat.

552
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,000
 - Answer me!  
 - Oh no.

553
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,030
Woohyun, you have to go.

554
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,670
Save me!

555
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,380
No, you eat it.

556
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,150
It must be fun. Can I come, too?

557
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,210
Huh? Oh, that...

558
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,210
Then should we go?

559
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,060
Sungyeol, you come, too.

560
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,780
Aren't you going to the academy?

561
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,940
- Aren't you studying? 
 - Okay.

562
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,730
Such a mess here.

563
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,170
Just eat this!

564
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,950
 This is the key, and this is the lock.

565
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,240
 These two have to stick together.

566
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,920
 If you wear this necklace,

567
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,700
 we're together even if I'm away.

568
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,030
 Together?

569
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,270
 Mom and Woohyun will definitely see each other again.

570
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,940
 Don't get hurt.

571
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,360
 And listen to Grandma. Got it?

572
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,170
My Woohyun...

573
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,750
Woohyun...

574
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,020
Why do you always use it when it's not even right?

575
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,050
This has days when it's accurate.

576
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,190
Oh, earlier...

577
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,690
That teacher who came to the store... is she good to you?

578
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,280
Ah, the ethics teacher. No!

579
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,980
She's mean to you?

580
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh my! How does she treat you badly? Does she dislike you?

581
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,120
Why do you keep asking me?

582
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,090
That teacher doesn't take interest in kids. She's a witch.

583
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,780
Whoever made that name made it well.

584
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,210
Grandma!

585
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,610
You're here, too.

586
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,350
Why? I can't be here?

587
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,310
This is a present for staying with you for a month.

588
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,890
There isn't anything for me?  How cheap.

589
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,760
Grandma, try it quickly.

590
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,230
You're asking me to try it on?

591
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,170
My goodness, it's pretty!

592
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,310
How is it?

593
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,220
Ms. Gong, it looks like you put on pepper paste.

594
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,210
What terrible taste!

595
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,490
You don't know women at all!

596
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,320
It's pretty.

597
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,820
It does make my face light up.

598
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,790
I get to do good things thanks to Seulbi.

599
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,020
What should I do for you?

600
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,470
Should I show you your fortune with the cards?

601
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,920
Really? I saw that in dramas.

602
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,630
You learn about life from dramas, don't you?

603
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,850
And what happens next?

604
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,010
They go like this and do this.

605
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,710
You'll become like that too... if you like these kinds of things.

606
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,930
I'm not looking.

607
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,680
You!

608
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,250
This is just for fun!

609
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,710
There's nothing to worry about. Choose one from here.

610
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,230
Okay.

611
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,290
My goodness, it says a customer will come.

612
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,540
It says Seulbi is our house's lucky guest.

613
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,600
- Really? 
 - What lucky...

614
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,580
Then do it for me, too.

615
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,610
He's the one who said it's not accurate so he won't do it.

616
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,570
Choose one.

617
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,040
This one.

618
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:30,530
It says you will meet a lover.

619
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,570
Did you get a girlfriend?

620
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,870
What girlfriend? Ms. Gong, look at yours, too.

621
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,280
Why? What does it mean?

622
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,830
Picnic.

623
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,650
It means I'll go on a picnic when the cherry blossoms are ripe.

624
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,750
That's good, isn't it?

625
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,540
Then Grandma is going on a picnic? That sounds fun! I want to go, too!

626
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,590
You can't go alone while we're in school!

627
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,690
In my eyes,

628
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,060
it says we should go together when the cherry blossoms are brightly blooming.

629
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,820
My goodness.

630
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,520

631
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,430
Why did you bring them all?

632
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,010
Do you want it?

633
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,900
I'm sorry.

634
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,380
Seulbi.

635
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,810
Help me a bit.

636
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,140
Today, I am going to confess. You'll help me, right?

637
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,930
How would I?

638
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,980
Just don't appear in front of Woohyun. Don't be seen.

639
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,170
Seulbi.

640
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,370
I'm begging you.

641
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:56,370
Woohyun, my leg still hurts a little.

642
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,810
Will you give me a ride?

643
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,150
Do you want to ride it together?

644
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,820
Thanks.

645
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,980
 ♫  I hold your hand and ♫

646
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:31,430
 ♫ I walk on this road ♫

647
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,520
 ♫ Following the river ♫

648
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,210
 ♫ Where the sun is shining ♫

649
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,710
 ♫ It is embracing my fingers ♫

650
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,980
Woohyun, I have something to say.

651
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,190
Yeah, tell me.

652
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:57,250
Honestly, I really like you.

653
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,890
For a long time.

654
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:05,320
 ♫ The sky that is bright and blue ♫

655
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,690
I started eating spicy rice cakes a lot because of you.

656
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,690
And I wanted to become prettier because of you.

657
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,550
And because of you, I gained strength.

658
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:24,140
It would be nice if you could do that too because of me.

659
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,970
This spot is a nice spot to confess.

660
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,340
I can't see your face, so it's less embarrassing.

661
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:45,990
 ♫  La la la dee la la ♫

662
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,460
It's okay if you don't answer now.

663
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,630
Tell me after thinking about it.

664
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,090

665
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,880
I'll answer you now.

666
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,450
I'm sorry.

667
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:12,220
 ♫ That’s not how I feel but I made you sad again ♫

668
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,480
 ♫  That’s not how I feel, I've never hated you ♫

669
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,100
Does Grandma like the present?

670
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,580
- Seulbi! 
 - Huh?

671
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,020
What did you say?

672
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,690
Sorry.

673
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:39,590
 ♫ That's not how I feel, but misunderstandings bring other misunderstandings ♫

674
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,760
 ♫ That's not how I feel ♫

675
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:46,400
 ♫ but you're still so great ♫

676
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:55,320
 ♫ I hate myself for being the fool that keeps repeating my mistakes ♫

677
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,010
That's dangerous!

678
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,410
Lee Seulbi, come to me now.

679
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:12,000
 ♫ It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days ♫

680
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,180
 ♫ I'm still not used to this kind of life ♫

681
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,080
 ♫ When I'm with you ♫

682
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,320
 ♫  the stars twinkle even during the day ♫

683
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,820
 ♫  I don't want to meet anyone but you ♫

684
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:33,030
  ♫ Without you, I don't want to do anything ♫

685
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,020
 ♫ Even when I'm with my friends ♫

686
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,730
 ♫ I'm always thinking about you ♫

687
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,530
 She put the store for sale?

688
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,670
  The disease is quickly progressing.

689
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,700
 Lee Seulbi and Shin Woohyun are going out.

690
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,250
 Hold my hand.

691
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,200
 An angel becomes human after falling in love with a human.

692
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,150
 You become human after falling in love with a human?

693
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,210
 Lee Seulbi!

694
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,530
 I never avoided you.

695
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,890
 You'll become an angel again after a week of vowing.

696
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,310
 I can go back.
