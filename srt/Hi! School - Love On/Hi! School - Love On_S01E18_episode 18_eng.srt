1
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,923
What am I doing to you?

2
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:58,923
Woohyun!  Woohyun, what's wrong?!  Huh?!

3
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:02,073
Woohyun!  Woohyun, what's wrong? Woohyun!

4
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:04,433
Are you sick?

5
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:10,743
My heart... My heart is in pain.

6
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:30,183
You were always in pain whenever you were with me.

7
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,973
What am I supposed to do if you're like this again?

8
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,913
 Are you having fun?

9
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,773
 Hello?

10
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,893
 Hello?

11
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:02,823
 Hello?  Yes, I'm Ahn Jihye...

12
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:08,283
 I did? I passed?!

13
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:11,713
 Am I really a teacher now?!

14
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,913
 Oh my gosh! Thank you!

15
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:19,133
 Oh my!

16
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,783
 Hello?  Hello?

17
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,783
 Hello?

18
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:30,903
 Oh my, Woohyun!  Woohyun!  WOOHYUN!

19
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,063
 Woohyun!

20
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:44,013
 Woohyun!

21
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,823
 Woohyun!  Woohyun!

22
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:51,753
 Woohyun!  Woohyun!

23
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,033
 Oh, Woohyun!

24
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:59,333
 - Are you awake?  
 - Mama! 
 - Yes, yes, my baby!

25
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,693
 - Oh my baby! 
 - Mama! 
 -  I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

26
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:10,183
 Mom's sorry for hurting you.  I'm sorry, Woohyun.

27
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:13,343
 Woohyun, my baby.

28
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,823
Are you feeling better?

29
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,763
- Just rest. 
 - I want to go to school.

30
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:41,543
- It's dangerous to go like this. 
 - I have to go.

31
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:47,343
If it's because of Woohyun, just stay. If Woohyun finds out, he'll worry.

32
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:51,183
Do you still worry about Woohyun?

33
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:53,143
No.

34
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:01,323

35
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:19,313

36
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,573
Woohyun, are you feeling better?

37
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,893
I'm fine.

38
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:37,763
Okay.  Even still, don't go to school today.

39
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:41,743
I want to go. That's the only way I'll see her.

40
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,603
Teacher, are you okay?

41
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:57,873
I'm fine.  Are you okay? What's going on?

42
00:05:02,863 --> 00:05:06,753
Whoa!  What's wrong with you?  Are you sick?

43
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,163
What's wrong with your face?

44
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:11,673
It's all thanks to having "good friends." It's nothing.

45
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,713
Did I raise you like this? Why are you getting beaten up? It makes me sad.

46
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:18,713
The kids always hit the face. It makes me sad.

47
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:23,253
Don't get hit because of me. My heart is bruised as it is.

48
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:26,603
Oh! I'm so moved!

49
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:34,443
Hey, let's go!

50
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,893
Let's go! Let's go!

51
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:51,963
♫ It was the beginning of fall  ♫

52
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:58,253
♫  When it was cold but not really cold  ♫

53
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:12,603
♫  You seemed like you’d be cold but you 
 were wearing short clothes  ♫

54
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:16,983
Don't look back,

55
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:19,043
and don't wait for me.

56
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,493
I'm not there.

57
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:26,993
♫  And today the sunshine is warm  ♫

58
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:34,023
How did Seulbi get hurt?

59
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:38,293
You said you were going to protect her well.

60
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:43,403
- It was an accident. 
 - You came to our store yesterday, right? Was it really an accident?

61
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,603
Do you think I'd let her get hurt?

62
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,883
How hurt is she? Is there anything else wrong?

63
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,173
Your interest makes me uncomfortable.

64
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:56,503
♫  I can't breathe  ♫

65
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,753
♫  Just one look from you... ♫

66
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,843
Seulbi, you can clean this all up by yourself. Right?

67
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:16,803
Seulbi, who has special powers, found the answer sheets.

68
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,133
Use your powers to clean this all up.

69
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:24,793
You two can clean it yourselves. You fit so well together.

70
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,973
Weren't you wondering either?

71
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:38,743
I wish I had powers.

72
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:42,243
Whoever's busy can go up first. I'll clean it up.

73
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:52,903
Partner! Leave her alone. I'm totally curious as well.

74
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:55,923
You clean as well!

75
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,133
Yes, Sir.

76
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:17,723
Seulbi! Seulbi!

77
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,563
Don't go near! She's dangerous!

78
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:21,283
We could get hurt as well.

79
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,183
Hey!  Seulbi...

80
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:02,503
What's wrong?! Let's go to the nurse! Hurry! Get up!

81
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:05,743
What's wrong?!

82
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:14,103
Seriously, what's going on?

83
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,933
You used to be so healthy.

84
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,423
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

85
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:25,253
Exactly... My heart is leaking.

86
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:28,503
A heart isn't a sewer. If it's leaking, you should block it.

87
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:33,773
Just leave me alone. Whenever I block it, the hole becomes bigger.

88
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,343
Rest. I'm going.

89
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,273
Thanks.

90
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:45,373
Don't be hurt, Seulbi.

91
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:46,383
MIster, why are you here?

92
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:49,353
Mister?! He's the chairman of the board.

93
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:53,493
Can't you see the nobility flowing from his presence? His looks are comparable to most actors!

94
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,533
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:59,063
CEO Lee? Your last name was Lee? 
  (T/N: "chairman of the board" also sounds like CEO Lee in Korean)

96
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,923
No, not "Lee" as in CEO Lee or CEO Kim. He's the chief director of the foundation.

97
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:14,533
You were looking for me, right? I happened to appear right at that moment, right?

98
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:18,493
Why would he look for you?

99
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:21,733
Wouldn't it be because he has something to talk to me about?

100
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:25,513
Well, what's there to talk about between Woohyun and the director of the board?

101
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:28,343
Let's go.

102
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:31,143
Were you looking for me because of the mark on Seulbi's wrist?

103
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:33,693
What? How did you—

104
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,743
It's not easy to explain so don't ask. But how are you doing?

105
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,213
- Me? 
 - Wait a minute.

106
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:46,573
You don't look so good.

107
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:51,183
"Sharing someone else's pain" is love but you guys are even sharing the same pain.

108
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:53,323
Wow, this is real love.

109
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:58,733
So when Seulbi was hurt, I was hurting, too?

110
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:05,033
Wow, Seulbi is so lucky! She must feel safe with you beside her.

111
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:07,083
I can't be with her anymore.

112
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,983
But your heart is always with Seulbi. Always next to her.

113
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:17,743
The number of suspicious students is increasing and the symbol is shining. Do you have a good solution?

114
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:24,543
I don't know. This is a first-time experience for me too so I don't know. I guess we just have to wait until the mark recovers.

115
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,473
What if... it's not successful?

116
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,813
She'll disappear.

117
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:45,633
Look around to see if she's hurt anywhere.

118
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,933
She's the type to hide her pain even though she's hurt.

119
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,973
I'm happy because Seulbi's hurt.

120
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,393
I can't take my eyes off of her for even a second.

121
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:58,693
Thanks. Don't ever lose sight of her.

122
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,423
I can't take my eyes off of you two either.

123
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,623
Why did you hit Kisoo?

124
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,343
Kisoo? I did it to protect my friend.

125
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,503
Is the only way to protect your friend by using your fist?

126
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,393
I feel bad for you.

127
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:29,003
Yena, I think you've been slacking off on your duty.

128
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:30,713
"Duty!" (In Korean)

129
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:33,533
Yeah, yeah. Du-Duty.

130
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:38,203
I heard there are some nonsense rumors about Seulbi lately.

131
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,823
Nonsense rumors?

132
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:48,323
Like "Seulbi is a ghost," or "She's a prophet," or "She's an alien," etc.

133
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:52,753
Really? So, is Seulbi really a ghost?

134
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,853
You're the ghost. You're messing with me.
 (T/N: Literally: says water ghost, but it means messing with him.)

135
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:01,683
I'm the idiot who trusted you for new information.

136
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:05,503
What do you mean new information?

137
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:08,323
- I'll be leaving. 
 - Yeah... hurry...

138
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:22,193
2nd Grade, Class 3 has a lot of scandals.

139
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:26,543
Information age. Think of it as gathering data and creating a database.

140
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:29,963
Please don't ask my kids to do such things.

141
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:36,253
They'll be suspicious of each other, and we'll end up trusting in the wrong information. We shouldn't promote that.

142
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:41,873
Whose fault is this? Whose fault is all this? It's because you left the kids and ran away!

143
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:46,743
I'm not leaving anymore! So don't do this!

144
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,143
Sungyeol won't be able to sleep if it's hot.

145
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,723
And I already packed Sungyeol's dad's bag under the closet.

146
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:10,163
He has a lot of night shifts, so his bag needs to be packed beforehand.

147
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:12,063
Yes.

148
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:17,173
If you need more side dishes, contact me.

149
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:20,433
I'm sorry for letting you go.

150
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:24,503
No, don't worry, I'll do well.

151
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:28,063
And this.

152
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:44,703
Is Woohyun sick?

153
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:48,913
What's wrong with your face? Are you sick, too?

154
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:57,533
You two... really... How are you two sick at the same time?

155
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:16,643
Making side dishes and doing the laundry is not what a mom does.

156
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,553
Please let me do at least that.

157
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:21,843
Can't you see what I want from you?

158
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:26,523
To throw Woohyun away and only look at you and Sungyeol.

159
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:29,933
Instead of Sungyeol, let's "stick a nail" into Woohyun's heart?

160
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:36,023
I didn't know I was a bad guy, but honestly, I...

161
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:37,953
only see Sungyeol.

162
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:45,253
As a bad father, I only gave scars and asked him to understand.

163
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:52,093
He's finally now barely starting to trust you and rely on you, but that something like this happened, I'm upset too.

164
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:59,653
Woohyun lived well without you.  And when time passes and everything's settled, maybe we can consider living together.

165
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:03,373
Who said that Woohyun lived a good life without me?

166
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:09,003
Up to this point, he lived alone without a mom, enduring everything on his own and making his own decisions.

167
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:14,863
Just as Sungyeol is important to you, Woohyun is important to me.

168
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,743
Are you saying you really want to end this?

169
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:26,703
You decide that.

170
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,103
This wasn't it.

171
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:43,083
Hey! Hey! Do you want to burn the store?!

172
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,023
Come to your senses!

173
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,293
We'll clean up.

174
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,363
I'll leave it up to you.

175
00:17:55,303 --> 00:18:00,303
I can't let this go on any further. Look at both of them. Can you call that living?

176
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,043
Are you still sick?

177
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:38,613
I had a dream.

178
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:41,173
What kind of a dream was it that you slept all day?

179
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:44,723
A dream about a person I can only see inside my dream.

180
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:51,233
What should we do? Should we clean? Should we do the dishes?

181
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,443
What does Mister like? What kind of food do you like?

182
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,633
I'm better at cooking than you.

183
00:18:56,633 --> 00:19:04,813
Oh yeah. Then I want an omelet, tonkatsu, and kimchi stew.

184
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:08,293
I'm hungry. What should I help you with?

185
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,833
Do you think you'll be able to go to the field study tomorrow?

186
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,733
I'm going to eat the food you make, gain energy, and go.

187
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:21,083
I really like dramas so I really want to go there.

188
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,333
Okay, let's go.

189
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:30,383
The teacher prepared that.

190
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:33,453
Throw it away.

191
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:39,013
They are not just side dishes, but her feelings. Eat well. she's worrying a lot about you.

192
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:42,553
That's why I'm telling you to throw it away. I won't accept it.

193
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:45,563
Ms. Gong said to not throw food away.

194
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:52,873
Don't worry, I'll eat it cleanly. It'll be even better if you ate with me.

195
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:06,243
I wonder if he took some medicine.

196
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,733
Please don't be sick.

197
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:21,023
What kind of medicine do I have to take for heartaches?

198
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:26,233
Seulbi, I won't be sick only if you're not.

199
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,133
Please get well soon.

200
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,383
You're home?

201
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:59,693
Do you want something to eat?

202
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:07,883
Thank you.

203
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:12,073
The longer you stay here, the harder it will be for you to go back.

204
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:14,663
You want me to leave soon?

205
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:20,483
Thank you for this morning.

206
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,403
It was just something right for me to do as a mother,

207
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,673
but you thanked me...

208
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:38,173
You're still thinking of me as a teacher.

209
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:44,623
Proof shot is a must. Move around freely.

210
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:48,393
Most importantly, enjoy it safely.

211
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:51,143
- Okay? 
 - Yes.

212
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,643
Why are you standing there?

213
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,123
Let me take it for you.

214
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:24,323
It's okay... We'll do it.

215
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:27,183
You don't have to take it.

216
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:30,123
You guys can punch (us), too.

217
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:32,263
Punch me.

218
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,243
Except for my face though.

219
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:36,153
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

220
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,693
We will be like this from now on.

221
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:42,733
Because we'd like to apologize to you guys.

222
00:22:46,953 --> 00:22:49,573
Two... Three!

223
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:08,433
  Seulbi!

224
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:11,683
  Seulbi! Seulbi!

225
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:14,493
  Seulbi!

226
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,293
Is she in there?

227
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,573
Yeah, I think so.

228
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:25,493
Hey! You saw that, right?

229
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:27,583
Yes, that.

230
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:31,053
 - You have to watch it. 
 - Yes, it was really funny.

231
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:34,163
Are you okay? Are you getting sleepy again?

232
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,223
I'm constantly sleepy. I'll be in the garden, so come after you're done looking around.

233
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:40,483
Let's stay together. I don't like these things.

234
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:43,143
It's a group project.

235
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,923
If you get sleepy again, call me.

236
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:49,233
That can't ever happen.

237
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:53,233
Think reasonably. What if something happens to her when you leave her like that?

238
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:57,653
But after revealing it, what if kids mess around and touch it, and she disappears?

239
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:03,183
Wouldn't they help us like the way they helped you when you were in trouble?

240
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:07,013
I know it won't be easy but if we sincerely persuade them,

241
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:12,623
they will realize that Seulbi is our friend and how much she cares for them.

242
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:18,203
What are you talking about without me, huh? What kind of secret is it?

243
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:21,853
If I'm the last one to know this time again, then you're really not a friend!

244
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:24,463
Tell me! Tell me now!
 (T/N: What he says literally means "to blow")

245
00:24:56,373 --> 00:25:03,623

246
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:14,373
There's something I need to ask you guys a favor for.

247
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:17,583
Since there are students from other classes at school...

248
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:25,003
Do not speak a word from now on. Just read.

249
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,193
Please, I beg you.

250
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,633
You're just asking for it (a beating) now.

251
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,953
What is this? Woah.

252
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,863
What is this?

253
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,123
We need your help.

254
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,793
If this continues, Woohyun will die. Please help us out.

255
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:48,173
It's not like it's Seulbi's fault. Think of how Seulbi treated us.

256
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:53,363
Seulbi's always been a friend to us.

257
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,203
She's not a human?

258
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,403
Seriously, Seulbi is really an ang...

259
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:06,133
Talking about it won't matter. She won't disappear until a suspecting person touches it.

260
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:11,823
But if you guys talk about it, more people will start to suspect her.

261
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:18,773
Please help. I beg you.

262
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:21,043
The only person to be cautious about is her.

263
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,923
But it doesn't make sense!

264
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:28,023
It's interesting. What is there to not believe in? My mom talks about ghosts all the time.

265
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:29,313
She's not a ghost.

266
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:33,453
I heard it's hard to meet a friend who you can connect to.

267
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:35,813
I don't want to lose Seulbi.

268
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:43,293
Hey, my partner is asking for help! Step forward if you don't want to help. Come on!

269
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:55,323
What are they doing without me?

270
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,543
I know what you're thinking, so stop.

271
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,493
What am I thinking?

272
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,233
How do you know what I'm thinking about?

273
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,963
Isn't it obvious?

274
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:17,203
You will look for the mark as soon as you find Seulbi. So you can make her disappear by touching it!

275
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,303
No, I won't.

276
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:22,183
By doing that, do you think Woohyun will be yours?

277
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:25,823
I said it's not like that.

278
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:28,693
Speak for yourself. Why are you suddenly on Seulbi's side?

279
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:31,243
Did you give up on Sungyeol?

280
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:35,983
I'm scared to become like you. Now I can give up.

281
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:49,343
Hey, hey, wait. Read this without saying anything.

282
00:27:49,343 --> 00:27:51,513
Just read it. It's something important.

283
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:53,333
  Seulbi is a angel that turned into a human.

284
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:58,223
 If she can't protect the shining symbol you saw on her wrist for a year...

285
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:01,013
 She won't exist as a human or an angel.

286
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:06,503
  In all of our memories and lives, Seulbi will disappear.

287
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:13,613
 If Seulbi's symbol shines, just close your eyes and pretend you didn't see.

288
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:18,363
  If she's asleep, please stay by her side quietly.

289
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:23,883
 If she's lost and loses her memory, remind her that I'm always beside her.

290
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:30,233
 Help me make sure Seulbi stays by me and our sides as a good friend.

291
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:42,033
Why does she fall asleep anywhere?

292
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:45,273
Hey! Lee Seulbi!

293
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:51,793
Something was shining.

294
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:18,483
I don't think I let you lay a finger on Seulbi's body.

295
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:21,373
It's because... there was something shining and I was amazed.

296
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,003
Shut up and get lost!

297
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:27,983
I'm sorry. I'll never touch her again, okay?

298
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,373
I said get lost, you bastard!

299
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:49,423
Seulbi... disappeared.

300
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:57,793
Find her. You're really dead if you can't find her.

301
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,873
That punk...

302
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:09,953
Lee Seulbi... disappeared.

303
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,503
Seulbi!

304
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:12,693
Seulbi!

305
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:14,653
Lee Seulbi!

306
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:16,363
Lee Seulbi!

307
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,983
She's not there.

308
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:23,293
She's not there either.

309
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,413
Seulbi!

310
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,293
Lee Seulbi!

311
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,043
Seulbi!

312
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:35,063
Seulbi!

313
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:37,033
Seulbi!

314
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,873
Let's meet again here!

315
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:42,073
Lee Seulbi!

316
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,553
Seulbi!

317
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:54,723
Lee Seulbi!

318
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:12,553
I'm going to make you return. No matter what.

319
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,773
That's Seulbi, right?

320
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:35,493
Aren't you curious to see if it's real?

321
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,413
Me too. I'm also curious.

322
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:42,483
Why? Do you think you can be ranked 2nd again if Seulbi disappears?

323
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,093
Don't you hate Seulbi, too?

324
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:48,693
Sure, I don't like her but I hate not having anyone to bully even more.

325
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:54,023
Either way, I have to know for myself.

326
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:56,753
Don't do it!

327
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:58,243
Hey!

328
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:02,633
 Seulbi! Seulbi!

329
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:15,773
Seulbi,

330
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:18,763
where are you?

331
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,383
That's not it, right?

332
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:37,243
You're still here, right?

333
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:47,243
 If you're going to leave like this, why'd you make me love you?

334
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:53,443
 Why did you make me into an idiot who can't live without you?

335
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:58,043
 You promised me that you'd always be on my side!

336
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:28,673
Follow me.

337
00:33:31,963 --> 00:33:35,883
 Even if you forget every memory of me,

338
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,393
 even if I forget about you,

339
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:43,223
it's okay. So please don't go.

340
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:52,693
I still haven't been able to do anything for you.

341
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:56,793
Take me with you.

342
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:04,363
I miss you, Seulbi.

343
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:06,263
I miss you.

344
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:13,583
Don't leave me behind in a world without you.

345
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:28,223
I'm here.

346
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:34,433
Next to you. Always, I was here.

347
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,133
Where did you go?!

348
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:02,523
Our Puppy's tears are so warm.

349
00:35:09,703 --> 00:35:11,873
Don't leave me again.

350
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:16,623
Don't leave me and go somewhere.

351
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:39,553
Why are they being like that? Why are they hurting so much?

352
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:43,893
If you love someone, do their tears become warm, Partner?

353
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:49,983
It'll get as warm as much as they love them.

354
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:54,073
Woohyun seems to know what love is.

355
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:58,513
Just tell her you love her. I lost.

356
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:12,033
H-Hey, where are you going—?

357
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:18,533
But what do we do about Seulbi's wrist?

358
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:21,113
We can't leave it like that.

359
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:24,043
I have a good idea...

360
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:32,643
You're making me lose my temper.

361
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:37,693
Do you know the difference between your love and their love?

362
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:42,853
You only see your pain, right? Those two see each other's love and pain.

363
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:45,483
That's why they can't even say they're in pain.

364
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,283
So wake up.

365
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:50,453
I think I'm in pain, too.

366
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:54,493
Sure, you'd be hurting. I told you, you feel only your pain.

367
00:36:55,983 --> 00:37:01,003
You... you can't use those powers on them anymore.

368
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:09,333
Did you say the love between people is trivial?

369
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,483
There is also love that never changes.

370
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:17,863
Keep this in mind. It makes no difference whether you are a human or an angel; if you are to gain something, you will lose something.

371
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:21,253
If you gain Seulbi, you'll lose everything.

372
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,403
I'm not going to lose anything.

373
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:26,263
Really? Let's just see.

374
00:37:26,263 --> 00:37:31,683
Either way, you lost in front of their love. Completely.

375
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:50,703
"I'm hurting but Woohyun is smiling."

376
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:55,263
"I'm struggling but Woohyun is smiling."

377
00:37:56,403 --> 00:38:03,883
At first, I was just really upset.  But because you kept smiling, it began to hurt.

378
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:09,353
"Because of me, he's forcing his smile."

379
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,163
"I can't make you smile for real," is what I was thinking.

380
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:20,993
If you disappear, I can't smile ever again.

381
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:26,223
Don't disappear.

382
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:28,013
I'll be fine with that.

383
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:54,953
I know things won't change even if we do this, but here.

384
00:38:57,823 --> 00:39:01,943
♫  It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days  ♫

385
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:06,213
♫  I’m still not used to this kind of life  ♫

386
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:14,613
♫  When I’m with you, the stars twinkle even during the day  ♫

387
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:18,813
♫  I don’t want to meet anyone else but you  ♫

388
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:22,883
♫  Without you, I don’t want to do anything  ♫

389
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:30,263
♫  Even when I’m with my friends, I’m always thinking about you  ♫

390
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:34,033
In whatever situation, we're in it together!

391
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:38,013
♫  You’re too good for me  ♫

392
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:47,733
♫  Anyone can see you’re beautiful, everyone wants you, 
 I can’t believe you’re my girl  ♫

393
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:52,263
♫  Baby, baby, baby, you’re too much  ♫

00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:56,493

♫  Baby, baby, baby... Oh~ girl...  ♫

396
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,633
My friend, Lee Seulbi, should we high-five?

397
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:07,543
 Us too!

398
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:12,273
♫  You my only one, baby girl  ♫

399
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:16,603
♫  You’re more dazzling than the sun in the blue sky  ♫

400
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:20,853
♫  You’re more dazzling than the sun in the blue sky  ♫

401
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,633
Lee Seulbi.

402
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:26,813
♫  You’re too much for me  ♫

403
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:30,713
♫  You’re too good for me  ♫

404
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:36,003
♫  Anyone can see you’re beautiful, everyone wants you  ♫

405
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:40,633
♫  I can’t believe you’re my girl  ♫

406
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:43,393
♫  Baby, baby, baby  ♫

407
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:45,283
♫  You’re too much  ♫

408
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:48,363
We are loyal! Loyalty!

409
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:54,713
  I realized that what humans call friendship is another word for love.

410
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:59,273
  It was only after we shared friendship that we became a genuine "us."

411
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,643
Did Sungyeol not contact you?

412
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,303
Where did he go? I'll go look around once more.

413
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:35,933
Yena.

414
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:37,563
What?

415
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:47,103
I was using it to wipe my tears. Don't misunderstand.

416
00:41:48,393 --> 00:41:50,433
Have you seen Sungyeol by any chance?

417
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:54,053
I don't know. He's probably crying somewhere like me,

418
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,643
because of you guys.

419
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,143
Just be good to Woohyun.

420
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,733
If you make him cry again...

421
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:09,443
I'll do well.

422
00:42:13,483 --> 00:42:15,663
What's wrong?

423
00:42:15,683 --> 00:42:23,143
Youngeun's little sister is at the hospital. She needs to go to a bigger hospital but they don't even have the money for the examination, let alone for the surgery.

424
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:26,443
So pitiful, what do we do?

425
00:42:27,063 --> 00:42:29,683
I feel bad for Youngeun, too.

426
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:33,033
Today, everything is just upsetting.

427
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:00,893
Aren't you going to level up?

428
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:04,983
Hey, aren't you going to do what I tell you?

429
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,183
Huh? Do you want to die?

430
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:11,643
We told him not to do it.

431
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:18,853
He needs to enjoy his game, too.

432
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:22,823
Oh, did you hear about Seulbi? Keep it a secret.

433
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:25,813
You're so funny. Why do I have to do that?

434
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:32,023
You're going to reveal it? You want to try revealing it and get stepped on again?

435
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:38,923
Let's live nicely, you punk.

436
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:45,433
You want to do this together? It's fun.

437
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:48,693
You do it yourself!

438
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:54,103
Lee Seulbi, I won't leave you alone.

439
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,433
  I'm right here.

440
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:15,083
  Right behind you, right next to you, always.

441
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:29,153
 Sungyeol, let's eat!

442
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:41,523
Hey, where are you going? I'm hungry.

443
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:49,023
- You can leave now. 
 - Where?

444
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,933
Go to Woohyun.

445
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:52,983
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

446
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:57,313
It's uncomfortable living with you, so get lost!

447
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:03,043
No, I'm going to stay here with you.

448
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,273
You just can't seem to understand, huh?

449
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:17,683
Sungyeol, open up! I'm not going anywhere.

450
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:19,273
Go!

451
00:45:25,393 --> 00:45:27,893
Leave when I let you.

452
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:32,893
Or else, I might hold you back.

453
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:49,353
Sungyeol, you, Woohyun, and I were considered "us." 
 "Us."

454
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:55,893
From all the words in the human language, I really like the word, "us."

455
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:59,483
There is a heart in it.

456
00:45:59,483 --> 00:46:06,353
Your heart, my heart, Woohyun's heart as well.

457
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:12,153
Please let me stay until you feel better.

458
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:16,683
Leave your heart with Woohyun, and don't stay next to me.

459
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:22,213
Am I that laughable? I told you I hate you! I'm letting you go!

460
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:27,933
Don't squeeze me in between your guys' love. It's unpleasant.

461
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:40,023
I'm sorry I can't accept your love either.

462
00:46:56,683 --> 00:47:00,733
Use this excuse to go see Seulbi.

463
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:04,853
Sungyeol always gets a cold around this time of the year.

464
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:09,313
Tell him not to wear light clothes.

465
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:14,433
And they say your neck has to be warm to feel less cold.

466
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:19,833
Your immune system is weak, so you used to always get sick.

467
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,813
I'm all grown up, so it's okay.

468
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:25,023
Really? Then that's a relief.

469
00:47:25,023 --> 00:47:28,273
You'll be late. Hurry and come back.

470
00:47:46,393 --> 00:47:48,793
Is Mister going to be late?

471
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:50,803
It's cold.

472
00:47:52,213 --> 00:47:54,713
Did you wait for me?

473
00:47:57,143 --> 00:48:01,853
They're hiding all your secrets, but why not mine?!

474
00:48:01,853 --> 00:48:04,103
What's wrong with you?

475
00:48:04,893 --> 00:48:09,893
Sungyeol completely lost it and because of you, nothing ever works out.

476
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:13,563
But why do all the kids tell me to keep your secret?

477
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:17,143
I think differently.

478
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:20,483
I'm going to reveal everything.

479
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:53,293
Sungyeol! Sungyeol!

480
00:48:53,293 --> 00:48:55,223
I'll reveal it all for you.

481
00:49:11,143 --> 00:49:14,183
Why? Are you sleepy?

482
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:17,853
Then it makes everything too easy.

483
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,273
This isn't bad.

484
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:55,863

485
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:18,783
 One, two, three!

486
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,773
 I think the Ethics teacher and my dad

487
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:22,313
  are going to get a divorce.

488
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:24,713
 We can help then!

489
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:29,133
 About half a spoon of love and half a spoon of apology?

490
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:31,753
 If you don't return, then I can't be happy.

491
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:35,483
 Hwang Sungyeol, you fool! I won't let you go anywhere alone.

492
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:36,933
  You really are an angel.

493
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,103
 Woohyun!

494
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:40,813
 What about Seulbi?
