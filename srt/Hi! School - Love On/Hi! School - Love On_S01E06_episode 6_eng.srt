1
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,470
♫   That's not how I feel, but I made you sad again  ♫

2
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:51,270
♫   That's not how I feel. I never hated you  ♫

3
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,160
♫  I remember our love  ♫

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,050
♫  So I can smile whenever  ♫

5
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,720
Humans say weird things when they get a heat stroke. Wow, it's so hot.

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,480
Hey. I'm being ser—

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,390
- Hey, Lee Seulbi! 
 - Can't you see she's flustered?

8
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,100
Did I talk too directly?

9
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,490
If you say something like that when the other person isn't ready, then that's cheating.

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,180
The timing was nice though.

11
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,230
I don't know.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,200
Hey! Stop crying! Stop!

13
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,730
I looked only at Woohyun for 3 years.

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,300
I was devotion to him only.

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,450
It is devoted!

16
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,680
It's not like this is the first time you got rejected.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,360
It was my first time!

18
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,060
But why am I so hot?

19
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,850
Why does it keep beating here?

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,460
Are you okay?

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,700
Sorry about lying about being cousins.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,190
That's not something you should be apologizing to me about.

23
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,180
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,210
Actually...

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,080
Never mind. You won't believe me even if I tell you.

26
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,440
Everyone has some kind of situation.

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,050
Thank you.

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,780

29
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,710
Your teacher called saying you didn't come to study today.

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,800
Who have you been hanging around with these days?

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,240
Why? Do you think I'd go around causing trouble like someone you know?

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
What?

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,760
Mind your own business.

34
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,260
 What should I do in this kind of situation?

35
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,750
  I don't know what I should do in this kind of situation.

36
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,490
Wow. I can't believe it.

37
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,690
Am I going crazy?

38
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,560
They're not even real cousins.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
Isn't that Na Youngeun?

40
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,850
Should we leave?

41
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,000
"Lee Seulbi, come to me now."

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Shin Woohyun is totally crazy.

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,020
Please keep it a secret that Woohyun confessed to Lee Seulbi.

44
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,760
Please.

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,690
Turn your attention off and let's just eat the hot dogs.

46
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,530
I guess you're in charge of all the part-time jobs around here. You'll become rich soon.

47
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,570
Please just order, Customer.

48
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,140
Don't they teach manners to part-timers here?

49
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,840
Please give me two sets of hot dogs.

50
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,140
Sorry.

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,980
 We are temporarily closed.

53
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,830
Where's Lee Seulbi?

54
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,390
She left saying that she had classroom duties or something.

55
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,570
She already went? Without telling me?

56
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,870
Did you two fight?

57
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,810
What fight? But Ms. Gong...

58
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,620
what are you dressed like that for?

59
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,280
I worked hard, and I'm leaving.

60
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,710
I'm going on a vacation.

61
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,160
Why are you going on a vacation so suddenly?

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,300
Going on trips is supposed to be leaving without a warning.

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,830
You won't be able to endure it for one day because you'll miss me.

64
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,460
But, Ms. Gong, are you having an affair?

65
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,730
What? I can't have a boyfriend?

66
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,010
I have to see him first and give permission.

67
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,980
Why would you see my boyfriend?

68
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,290
Because I'm your guardian.

69
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,290
Is that right?

70
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,530
Take care of the house and Seulbi.

71
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,360
Don't skip any meals.

72
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,620
Ms. Gong should also be careful of cars, water, and especially men.

73
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,650
I got it.

74
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,540
My precious baby.

75
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,800
Did Shin Woohyun really fall for Lee Seulbi?

76
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,410
What? I thought they were cousins.

77
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,360
It's really like a drama!

78
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,090
The more it's like this, it's better if this spreads wider.

79
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,450
They aren't cousins.

80
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,030
Really? Then why did they say they were cousins?

81
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,740
Woohyun doesn't like annoying and complicated things.

82
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,950
They aren't cousins, but they live together? What kind of relationship do they have?

83
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,330
Hey! He knew you would be like this, so that's why he lied.

84
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,230
@&amp;!$*!*#

85
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,460
Hey, Kang Kisoo, this is all because you completely
messed up that day!

86
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,090
How are you going to take responsibility? Huh?!

87
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,960
I also did not know it would turn out like this. I am telling the truth.

88
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,930
You!

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,050
Hey. New couple!

90
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,630
Couples, to be announced!

91
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,690
She pops up even more since they're apart.

92
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,990
How far did they go?

93
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,170
Like this?

94
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,820
You guys should stop.

95
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,820
I said be quiet!

96
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,550
Seulbi, what are you doing? Go in.

97
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,370
Teacher! Lee Seulbi and Shin Woohyun are dating.

98
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,440
Lee Seulbi and Shin Woohyun aren't cousins.

99
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,220
What? You aren't cousins?

100
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,470
I'm the one who first said they were cousins, right?

101
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,580
Sorry about that. Sorry, sorry.

102
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,320
Are you going to apologize?

103
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,960
Why did you come empty-handed?

104
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
I didn't know what to bring.

105
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,760
At least bring an apple then!   
 (T/N: apple and apologize are homophones in Korean)

106
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
That's why you're forever single! So sad.

107
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,280
There is a way though.

108
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,250
In these moments, you should naturally...

109
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,640
Eh! Does that even make sense?

110
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
Fine, then don't...

111
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,600
Wait!

112
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,460
Are you sure?

113
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,990
Listen carefully.

114
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,350
You are forever single. And I'm a returned single.

115
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,540
If you look at it from afar, there's a huge difference.

116
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,950
Before I was married, a bunch of girls

117
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,620
lined up; one, two, three...

118
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,550
"Ya! There's no cutting, go to the back!"

119
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,070
"You look in the mirror!"

120
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,540
Okay. Nice.

121
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,420
Okay?

122
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,080
Okay, then to prepare...

123
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,550
Now, naturally "Ah."

124
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,610
 Teacher Phillip, you can't be like this.

125
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,040
You can't do that!

126
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,070
You can, you can.

127
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,610
Oh, I like you Teacher Phillip...

128
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,240
Mine.

129
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,120
What's the problem?

130
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,130
You don't know?

131
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,910
You really don't know?

132
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,630
Usually, if you do this, you look really pitiful.

133
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,780
Like, this image... Geez!

134
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,190
Seulbi!

135
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,550
Sorry, Sungyeol. I have to go first.

136
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,770
Lee Seulbi!

137
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,020
If you're not intending to put your name as number one for the real-time charts, then stop it.

138
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,440
Whatever I do, it's always number one on the search engines.

139
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,530
Can't you see Seulbi's in trouble because of you?

140
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,410
Why? Do you want to be first on the search engines, too?

141
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,270
These things are really dangerous.

142
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,580
Anyone can see this is a love triangle.

143
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,470
Lee Seulbi!

144
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,910
Grandma! Grandma!

145
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,160
Where did she go?

146
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,190
She went on vacation.

147
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,730
Why all of a sudden?

148
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,740
What's the point of coming here first when you don't even have the keys?

149
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,290
I came here early to help Grandma.

150
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,340
Lies.

151
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,480
I'm not lying...

152
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,390
I can hear your lies now.

153
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,300

154
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,700
Are you studying?

155
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,110
It's hot in here.

156
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,160
Drink this.

157
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,690
Are you cos-playing as a good mom?

158
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,800
Then please don't disturb me and leave.

159
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,200
About the cheating incident... I'm sorry.

160
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,280
Next time, I won't let such an unfair incident happen.

161
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,800
To me, not being able to live with my mom is unfair.

162
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,130
No matter how much you push me away,

163
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,300
I'm going to live in this house with you happily.

164
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,640
Whatever happens, I'm going to be your mom and protect you.

165
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,590
Our relationship will also be revealed to the school.

166
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,410
So you can relax?

167
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,910
Doesn't a real mom worry about her child's discomfort and feelings,

168
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,960
and endures her own discomfort?

169
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,600
Teacher, you're not my mom.

170
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,700
Yes, I know.

171
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,320
All those times I was fake.

172
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,310
From now on, I'll try my best to become a real mom.

173
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,240
And...

174
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,830
If you miss your mom, you can meet her any time.

175
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,500
Your mom...

176
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,640
probably misses you a lot.

177
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,490
Please eat this.

178
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,380
Why am I so tired? I should sleep.

179
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,920
Of course, you're tired.

180
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,400
From running away from me.

181
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,060
I never avoided you.

182
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,150
Ms. Gong said you make sure to lock up well before going to bed.

183
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,760
Sleep well.

184
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,260
You, too.

185
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,330
Sorry.

186
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,450
You read the message but you aren't replying?

187
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,300
Lee Seulbi, you're ignoring Talk now? 
   (T/N: short for KakaoTalk, a Korean messaging app)

188
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,660
I didn't want to wake you up.

189
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,060
Good job then.

190
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,730
Woohyun, the words you said yesterday...

191
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,590
If it's a rejection, I refuse to hear it.

192
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,830
I'm not rejecting you...

193
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,490
Then, are you accepting it?!

194
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,870
Honestly, I...

195
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,880
I don't really know.

196
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,000
Do you not like me by chance?

197
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,730
No! That's definitely not it!

198
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,810
When I'm with you, it's fun and nice.

199
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,630
Okay. Then I'll wait until you know.

200
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,170
I'm a cool guy.

201
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,220
But you can't avoid me.

202
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,310
Okay.

203
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,580
Did you know it's the first time you smiled at me today?

204
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,810
Is it?

205
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,770
Sorry.

206
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,550
Are you sorry? Then stay with me for the whole day tomorrow.

207
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,960
All day? What are we going to do?

208
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,900
Don't be curious about tomorrow, okay?

209
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,140
Lee Seulbi! Come out quickly!

210
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,800
Today's schedule is full!

211
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,760
Lee Seulbi, did you see?

212
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,170
You should be honored.

213
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,170
You won't ever meet a teacher as good as me.

214
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,460
Would I be able to ride it well? I'm nervous.

215
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,320
Believe me.

216
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,550
You have to pedal pretty quickly at first.

217
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,330
Shouldn't I be going slowly?

218
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,280
You won't fall the faster you go.

219
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,560
I guess bikes are different.

220
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,280
Don't worry.

221
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,100
Pedal hard.

222
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,640
You're going!

223
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,780
Go! You're going!

224
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,680
What is this?

225
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,350
Is she a pro?

226
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,320
Wow!

227
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,930
Wow.

228
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
I ride the bike well, right?

229
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,720
It's because I taught you well.

230
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,940
It's delicious!

231
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,660
Our puppy can cook well and ride the bike well.

232
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,790
You're imitating Ms. Gong again.

233
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,670
There's nothing I can't do.

234
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,640
It would have been nice if Grandma came too.

235
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,570
Now that I see it, Grandma's fortune matched really well! It said we were going to go on a picnic.

236
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,100
I know, right.

237
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,040
She also predicted correctly that I would find someone I like.

238
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,460
What is Ms. Gong doing?

239
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,540
Should I call and brag?

240
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,020
You didn't come with a guardian?

241
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,200
 Ms. Gong, I'm your guardian.

242
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,370
I'm the guardian.

243
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,120
Please go on.

244
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,260
You need to be hospitalized.

245
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,330
The speed at which it's processing is quicker than we expected.

246
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,370
The symptoms will worsen.

247
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,430
Doctor, just don't let me feel the pain for a few days.

248
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,190
I won't ask you to save me.

249
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,710
I just need a little bit of time to sort out things.

250
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,420

251
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,380
I am busy having fun. Why are you calling?

252
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,710
It's really nice here.

253
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,640
You also went to have fun?

254
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,090
That's good.

255
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,520
My friends are calling to take a picture.

256
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,800
Let's hang up.

257
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,590
She's completely having fun.

258
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,210
But then again, she couldn't ever go out due to doing work all the time.

259
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,600
She only went through hard work raising me.

260
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,730
I'll do everything for her from now on.

261
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,420
Our puppy is all grown up.

262
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,090
I've always been older than you.

263
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,250
Oh.

264
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,090
Eun Hae,

265
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,190
will you marry me?

266
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,860
 Kiss! Kiss!

267
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,180
 Kiss! Kiss!

268
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,010
We're almost here!

269
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,100
What is it? Hurry!

270
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,800
Tada!

271
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,170
Wow.

272
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,430
Do you like it?

273
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,450
Just "wow"?

274
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,780
It's really pretty.

275
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,050
I took some time picking this location.

276
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:03,200
- There are pretty things even where humans live. 
 -Talking about humans again!

277
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,550
I'm only showing this to you especially.

278
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,530
Then I'm watching it nicely just for you.

279
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,510
Should I tell you how to look at it prettily?

280
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,950
What is it?

281
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,760
It hurts! It hurts!

282
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,890
As much as it hurts, it looks pretty, right?

283
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,070
It seems like it.

284
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,700
Dummy.

285
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,870
"How to get closer to someone you like."

286
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
"Prepare one popcorn and cola."

287
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,070
"Watch a horror movie on the phone."

288
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,660
"Then you can shorten the distance between you and the girl a whole lot."

289
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,640
This is a good method.

290
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,640
Horror movies are the best during the summer.

291
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,290
Is this really scary?

292
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,900
It's okay. I'm here.

293
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,280
But why are we leaving the TV and watching it on a small screen?

294
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,380
Tha- That way it's scarier.

295
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,550
Our puppy is such a scaredy-cat.

296
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:51,140
Hey. I'm very far from being like a scaredy-cat, whiner, and troublemaker.

297
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,290
Let's just say that.

298
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm closer to being a cool guy and a guy full of sense.

299
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,210
What happened?

300
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,330
Woohyun. Woohyun!

301
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,140
Woohyun!

302
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,700
Hey! Wake up!

303
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,810
He— Wow, he fainted twice.

304
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,850
Hey! You're the one who wanted to watch horror!

305
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,610
Hey!

306
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,820
Two siblings in a house with the lights off. Very good.

307
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,860
It's cool, cool.

308
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,330
Oh my!

309
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,150
You.

310
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,930
 Why do I...

311
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,540
 continue getting caught?

312
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,380
 Why am I?

313
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,250
 Oh dear.

314
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,900
 La la la. La la la.

315
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,940
You must be busy with work, but thank you.

316
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,330
It's my job.

317
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,390
It's a must as a parent.

318
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,130
There are more dangerous places near schools.

319
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,260
That's right.

320
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,240
Hey.

321
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,690
I told you to prepare it in advance.

322
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:00,370
You didn't charge the money in the PC this month, too.

323
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,180
My mom blocked my phone payments.

324
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,730
Then use a card.

325
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,000
Or you can just give us the cash.

326
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,640
It's a bit of a waste of my time but I guess I'll do it myself.

327
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,830
Wow. You're on a roll today.

328
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,000
Of course.

329
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,350
Do you want to start rolling now, too?

330
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,450
Shall we go?

331
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,190
What are you doing?

332
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,110
You're not doing it?

333
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,550
Let's roll a bit more.

334
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,220
Do you think you'll be able to think of a good response anytime soon?

335
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,240
Good.

336
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,880
They look like my students.

337
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,910
Oh, really?

338
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,480
What are you doing?

339
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,040
Hey, why are you falling all of a sudden while walking normally?

340
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,130
Do you want to have a talk with me for a second?

341
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,850
No, it's fine. I didn't get hit. It's for real.

342
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,980
Jaeseok, you!

343
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,520
You. You remember me, right?

344
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,080
How do you know Jaeseok?

345
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,480
He was friends with Sungyeol since middle school.

346
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,450
Oh, hey!  It's nice meeting you.

347
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,230
Teacher!

348
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,500
Hey, run!

349
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,570
Hey! You rascals!

350
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,280
Oops. I guess I saw the wrong person.

351
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,370
The back of your heads looked identical. What should I do?

352
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,420
Do I have to get arrested? Here you go.

353
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,690
Oh right! Oh right!

354
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,250
 Let's shake hands. I really mistook you for someone else. I'm really sorry.

355
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,100
How was it today?

356
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,370
It was fun.

357
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,860
Especially, when you passed out. That was the most exciting part.

358
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,750
Hey. That's because I just got sleepy all of a sudden.  Like you.

359
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,740
I'll pretend it was because of that.

360
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,020
Candles and music. It seems like a drama.

361
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,690
Don't you think that's a bit of a dangerous statement?

362
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,940
What is?

363
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,010
What happens in dramas when there are two people alone with candles and music?

364
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,990
They kissed.

365
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,730
It quickly transitions into a sunny morning scene.

366
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,040
I thought you liked dramas. Do you even see them properly?

367
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm going to sleep.

368
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,140
Sleep well.

369
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,840
If I just didn't faint, then it would have been so cool and perfect.

370
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,160
Stupid.

371
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,380
Woohyun fainting was cute, right?

372
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,850
Did she leave first again?

373
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,800
 I'm leaving first today because of classroom duties.

374
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,890
 - I prepared fish rice rolls.   
 - No way.

375
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,530
As expected.

376
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,610
Is this even edible?

377
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,320
If grandma saw this, I'd be in trouble.

378
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,690
Even all this...

379
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,680
Senior.

380
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,190
It's not easy living as a human.

381
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:26,270
Wow. Help me out tomorrow, too.

382
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,950
You found it?

383
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,940
From where?

384
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,290
It's not yours.

385
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:44,720
- Then? 
 - I got it from the angels who personally returned their black notes to become human.

386
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,600
If you choose to be an angel again, then this black note will become yours.

387
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,390
And they said you'll receive the rights to be an angel again.

388
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,510
Then I can go back?

389
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,170
Aren't you happy?

390
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,320
I am. Thank you.

391
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,550
But why did those angels return their black notes and become human?

392
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,230
Swear to it.

393
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,520
After you swear to it, you'll become an angel again after a week.

394
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,690
You have a week left.

395
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,120
Don't give your heart to the humans.

396
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,180
Senior.

397
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,130
Oh, you came?

398
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,810
I finished all the organizing in the classroom.

399
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,910
Leave some for me next time.

400
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,630
Who cares if I do it? We're both on classroom duty.

401
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,740
I'll do the rest.

402
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,660
I'm sick of being indebted to others.

403
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,940
Oh, Teacher!

404
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,590
I was very sorry about last time.

405
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,000
I wasn't trying to grab your skirt on purpose...

406
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,390
Be quiet.

407
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,750
Do you want to make a public announcement?

408
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,790
It's not that...

409
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,240
It's hot.

410
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,200
Teacher Choi.

411
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,830
Teacher Choi,

412
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:05,120
don't you need to heal the scars in the heart, too, in order to be a true nurse?

413
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,550
What are you talking about?

414
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,780
According to my full life and love experience,

415
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,100
your face and appearance don't last very long.

416
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,110
Our viper teacher, you have great skills...

417
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,700
and great personality and are very manly, too!

418
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,290
Full of responsibility, too!

419
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,130
Bingo.

420
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,740
But the reason why you had to become  forever single,

421
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,770
- I wonder what that is? 
 - Exactly!

422
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,260
That's the unsolved mystery.

423
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,330
What might it be?

424
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,450
An unsolved mystery.

425
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,650
I shouldn't waste my breath.

426
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,110
Wai-Wait, Teacher. Wait.

427
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,080
But he came all this way to give this to you, you should still accept it.

428
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,520
No, it's fine.

429
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,710
- It's fine. 
 - She said she doesn't want it!

430
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,870
You-You!

431
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,540
Oh no!

432
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,090
I can't live because of you!

433
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,350
You little— Why you little!

434
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,330
Those troublemaking brothers!

435
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,300
This is so stupid!

436
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,230
He is no help in my life!

437
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,650
Ah, really! I am going to kill them!

438
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,650
No matter where I go, I am so popular.

439
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,950
It's really tiring.

440
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,750
Yes.

441
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,780
I know that it is natural for butterflies to come to a flower,

442
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,880
but it is really tiring if all the guys come at once.

443
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,650
Yes.

444
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,470
Really...

445
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,340
No matter where I go, I am so popular.

446
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,670
It's really tiring.

447
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,970
I know that it is natural for butterflies to come to a flower,

448
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,340
but it is really tiring if all the guys come at once.

449
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,360
Don't sleep just because it is an in-class lesson.

450
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,050
If you talk or sleep... You know, right?

451
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,850
 - Yes.  
 - Okay, we're starting now.

452
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:17,990
Stamina Enhancement and Elements for Practice.

453
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,620
No.1...

454
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,750
No.2...

455
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,630
Focus when it's time to study.

456
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,490
Yeah.

457
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,410
Thanks for the breakfast today.

458
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,070
Was it that good? I'll do it again next time.

459
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,480
You can't! Next time, I'm doing it.

460
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,950
You shouldn't mess with food.

461
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,050
Don't mess around in class either.

462
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,810
Are you ignoring me because this is gym class? Stand up!

463
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,040
What are you doing?

464
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,270
Be quiet!

465
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,880
Focus. Focus.

466
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,820
Are you laughing?

467
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,740
I can do it by myself.

468
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,580
I like doing things together more than doing them alone.

469
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,710
I hate annoying things.

470
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,900
You're similar to Woohyun. You don't like annoying things.

471
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,450
He just says that.

472
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,160
Oh. Then, is he asking for annoying things?

473
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,240
But does an angel actually fall in love?

474
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,760
How? An angel can't feel human emotions.

475
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,480
It's a special case.

476
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,610
The angel here falls in love with a human, so she becomes human.

477
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,900
Become a human after falling in love with a human?

478
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,710
Do you have an interest in angels as well?

479
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,400
So then what happens? The angel who turned into a  human.

480
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,500
I don't know. I haven't read it all yet.

481
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,660
Instead of this book, are there other books as well?

482
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,400
Seulbi! Just a moment...

483
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,890
You must have worked hard doing all my homework and I haven't given you a single thing.

484
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,200
Sorry about yesterday.

485
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,290
Are you really giving this to me? I love these things! Thanks!

486
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,550
If you eat the two together, you'll like it even more.

487
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,990
First, eat the ice cream, then drink the cola.

488
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,540
Try it.

489
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,840
My goodness. The bomb exploded.

490
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,330
What is this?

491
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,060
Are you okay? Sorry.

492
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,870
Why are you doing this to me?

493
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,230
Are you okay?

494
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm okay, but Yena...

495
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,370
Seulbi, you must have been surprised.

496
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,250
I'm all right.

497
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,600
Sorry. Let's go.

498
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,840
I'm really sorry.

499
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,070
This isn't what was supposed to happen!

500
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,250
The bus has already left.

501
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,980
I can't take this anymore.

502
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,770
If you like her, stay with her or just move away.

503
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,870
Your interest in Seulbi, is it love or friendship?

504
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,930
It might get hard for Seulbi because of you.

505
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,340
Don't mind her. If anyone's protecting her, it has to be me.

506
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
You move away.

507
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,310
I need to wash this.

508
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,420
It's so annoying!

509
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,300
I'm sorry. Should I wash it for you?

510
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,460
It's fine! Disgusting...

511
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,210
Money comes out of there!

512
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,530
What do you even know?

513
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,390
Here, the laundry fee.

514
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,700
No! I should be the one giving it to you.

515
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,570
It's okay.

516
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,370
Don't say anything else later, and take it.

517
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:55,320
Let me borrow some money from Woohyun, wait.

518
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,510
I said it's fine!

519
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,980
She said she doesn't need it. Thank you!

520
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,450
I gave it to you.

521
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,190
I'll give it to you later. Sorry!

522
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,850
When is Grandma coming?

523
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,710
Ah... There is no one who can work for me.

524
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,080
Let's go play some games! You pay for the games and ramen.

525
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,880
Lee Seulbi, you go, too.

526
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,340
Why Seulbi? She doesn't even play games.

527
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,680
The air there isn't even good.

528
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,840
Don't include me. I want to go home and rest.

529
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,680
Are you sick?

530
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,390
I'll go home, too.

531
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,240
Ah, Woohyun, you bastard. Are you like this because you got a girlfriend?

532
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,230
What girlfriend?

533
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,970
I'm not sick. I have to wash my uniform. Go play games with Kisoo.

534
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,780
Are you going to be all right? Ms. Gong isn't there.

535
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,680
Don't worry. I'm going to have fun and watch dramas by myself.

536
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,120
I'll be back soon.

537
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,720
Hey! Let's go together.

538
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,640
Go well and come back.

539
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,990
Who is it?

540
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,500
Did Grandma go somewhere? She's not even answering her phone.

541
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,310
She went on a trip.

542
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,220
What's the matter?

543
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,470
She put this store for sale. And there is a customer who wants to buy it.

544
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,760
She put the store for sale?

545
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,700
Tell her that it took some time to look for someone who matched the conditions.

546
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,670
Please tell her to contact me when she comes back.

547
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,310
Oh, Seulbi? The store?

548
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,040
I'll go and deal with it.

549
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,160
Don't tell Puppy.

550
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,320
Why is it a secret from Woohyun?

551
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,740
It's strange.

552
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,780
There's no energy in Grandma's voice.

553
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,380
I want to see Grandma.

554
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,630
No,

555
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,300
trying to protect her son who's not even blood related,

556
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,190
she wants my Woohyun to transfer.

557
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,840
My goodness. That's not going to work. I'll live without seeing you either.

558
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,440
What will happen to Our Puppy?

559
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,380
So I was fooled?

560
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,740
You wouldn't have come if I didn't.

561
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,480
Hey. I hope you know that I am expensive to use for a worker.

562
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,360
I think I've seen this somewhere.

563
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,480
Do it like you are a professional. Okay?

564
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,350
What is it this time?

565
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,460
My brother...

566
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,500
became a captain for the school soccer team.

567
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,350
Isn't he awesome?

568
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,860
So what?

569
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,930
He needs uniform shoes for soccer, you know...

570
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,530
Do it carefully. It is crooked.

571
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,010
The same goes for you.

572
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,050
Hey. I will take this as a reward.

573
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,400
No, you can't. I have to pay for it if one is missing.

574
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,290
You're so mean. I will bite you off.

575
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,080
I know that nothing is for free in this world.

576
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,980
Who are you going to give it to? Seulbi?

577
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,720
Don't ask when you know it. It's embarrassing.

578
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,810
Yena?

579
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,000
 I have no reason to live now...

580
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,910
 Please take care of Woohyun.

581
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,070
Don't do it, Yena. I am coming. Where are you?

582
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,640
Are you okay? I was worried.

583
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,090
Don't pity me.

584
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,980
I am not pitying you. You are just pathetic.

585
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,150
You can't see Woohyun if you die.

586
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,670
If you like him that much, you should live and see him.

587
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,870
It doesn't matter if I see him. He doesn't even care about me.

588
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,790
He looks only at you.

589
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,920
I'm not even in his nose (philtrum). 
  (T/N: she says injoong -philtrum- instead of anjoong -sight)

590
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,950
It's sight. 
  (T/N: he says injoong -philtrum- instead of anjoong -sight)

591
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,250
I liked him before you.

592
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,650
If it wasn't you...

593
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,280
My love...

594
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,900
My confession...

595
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,850
wouldn't have been so miserable.

596
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,450
So humans cry when they like someone...

597
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,150
Because my heart hurts.

598
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,460
Isn't it natural to be hurt

599
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,040
if you like someone this much?

600
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,100
I am sorry that you are hurt.

601
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,170
Don't cry.

602
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,040
"Sorry" isn't enough.

603
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,860
There is nothing I can do. I am sorry.

604
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,740
If you're sorry, please buy me a tissue and water.

605
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,930
Umm... okay.  Just wait.

606
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,160
Hey, buy them with this.

607
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,710
I have money, too.

608
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,270
I am the one who asked you to buy something.

609
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,740
You can leave your purse here.

610
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,240
Please buy them with this.

611
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,020
Okay.

612
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,810
I told you you don't have to walk me home.

613
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,380
I am worried, you know.

614
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,570
Don't worry. I am not thinking of doing bad things.

615
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,750
Woohyun isn't the only guy in the world.

616
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,760
I think it will take some time, but I will forget him.

617
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,060
You will meet a cool guy, since you are a pretty female human.

618
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,600
There is no other cool guy in the world except Woohyun.

619
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,570
When time passes, he will realize how you feel about him.

620
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,520
When time passes? How about you?

621
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,740
I have to go back.

622
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,110
Go back? Where?

623
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,040
That is...

624
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,680
Home. I have to go home. Woohyun might be waiting for me.

625
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,040
Ah. Don't tell Woohyun that you met me.

626
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,940
It's embarrassing.

627
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,460
Promise?

628
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,120
Okay.

629
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:28,220

630
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,810
Did you put it in well?

631
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,280
Of course.

632
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,470
I think Lee Seulbi is nice though...

633
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,850
Hey. She is pretending to be.

634
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,130
She is stupid, too.

635
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,190
Does Woohyun like that type of girl?

636
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,160
I am a stupid charm, too.

637
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,970
It's stupid!  Stupid.

638
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,350
It is a bit uncomfortable without a cell though, right?

639
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,250
Yeah, right.

640
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,520
It hurts when you like someone?

641
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,370
And you cry, too?

642
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:11,970
If I don't cry, does that mean I don't like someone?

643
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,000
It is so complicated.

644
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,880
Woohyun!

645
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,600
What is this? You look hungry.

646
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,720
Why are you coming now?

647
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,610
Oh. You waited for me?

648
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,820
Where were you anyway?

649
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,980
 Please don't tell Woohyun that you met me.

650
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,200
I just went for a walk.

651
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,110
Did you come out here to meet me?

652
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,310
You should have called me. Then I would have come earlier.

653
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,210
I know.

654
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,720
What is that?

655
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,630
A present for you.

656
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,550
This is my younger sister/brother's friend!

657
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,430
He/she won't be lonely now.

658
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,310
Hold hands.

659
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,200
What are you thinking? Hold this.

660
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,450
My hands are expensive. Don't even think of holding them.

661
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,900
Let's go.

662
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:19,030
 ♫ I feel like I am living in a dream every day ♫

663
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,150
 ♫ I am not used to living like this ♫

664
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:31,510
 ♫ When I am with you, stars are twinkling even during the day ♫

665
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,800
 ♫ I don't want to meet anyone except for you ♫

666
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,980
 ♫ I don't want to do anything without you ♫

667
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,390
 ♫ Even when I meet my friends, I think only of you ♫

668
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,600
 Do you want to go to the police station?

669
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,750
 - What do I do? 
 - She says that her phone is gone.

670
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,550
 Put it in the purse, without anyone noticing.

671
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,330
 To think "that" Seulbi put money with her phone,

672
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,830
 isn't it interesting?

673
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,950
 - Will she be able to continue going to school? 
 - I told you I didn't steal it!

674
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,660
 With that teacher...

675
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,440
 She is my wife.

676
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,670
 - Oh. 
 - Okay, let's just go and die together.

677
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,220
 I am sorry.
