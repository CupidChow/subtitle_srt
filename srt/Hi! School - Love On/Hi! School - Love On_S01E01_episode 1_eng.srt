1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,700

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,220
Sorry.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,100
Hey, you!

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,610

5
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,350

6
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,860
That necklace...

7
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,210
You...

8
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,280
 All of the moments of the days that I tried,

9
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,660
 we loved each other.

10
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,700
 And right now in this moment,

11
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,730
 I'm looking at you now.

12
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,470

13
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,450

14
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,590

15
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,660
What are you doing now?

16
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,660
Aigoo, I was going to do it. Why are you doing it?

17
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,770
I didn't want to see you crying.

18
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,740
Are those even real tears? It's because of the onions.

19
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,210
Anyways, don't cry.

20
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,500
There's no other robber. You'll probably become a chaebol 
(T/N: conglomerate wealthy person).

21
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,860
I'll become a chaebol and I'll give you a luxurious life, Grandma.

22
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,800
Even if you were jobless, looking at your face is like having a luxurious life.

23
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,170
That's right. As expected, my grandma is realistic.

24
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,010
- I'll be back! 
 - Okay!

25
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm leaving.

26
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,070
Are you seriously going to act like this?

27
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,420
What did I do?

28
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,990
Your mom doesn't like you eating ramen.

29
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,790
- Which mom? 
 - BOTH!

30
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,220
They're both lying.

31
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,390
Why do you not like your new mom?

32
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,890
She's not my style.

33
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,660
You punk, saying...

34
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,300
 Mister!  Mister!  Come to your senses!  Mister!

35
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,440
1, 2, 3, 4...

36
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,930
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

37
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm a cop. Please back away. Back away just a bit.

38
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,040
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

39
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,410
Yes, this is the four corners at Myeongseonbu. There's a person who has collapsed on the street.

40
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,840
Please send an ambulance quickly! Yes.

41
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,580
Okay, everyone please stay back.

42
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

43
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,980
You come out.

44
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,490
Lee Yeon Dong, 59 years of age, male. Died June 13.

45
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,380
Am I really dead?

46
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,550
All humans die. Only then are you like a human.

47
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,880
Then you are...

48
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,650
 I guide the dead humans.

49
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,030
 In these situations, humans call me an angel.

50
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,770
Follow me.

51
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,000
Ah, shoot.

52
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,200
Student!

53
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,220
Thank you!

54
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,160
 We and humans are different beings.

55
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,610
 That's why even if our hearts pass, we can't feel it.

56
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,430
 But after I met them, unusual things happened.

57
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,170

58
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,210
Oh my! He's so awesome!

59
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,670
Even his heart is perfect as expected.

60
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,220
Turn him over while I say it nicely.

61
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,740
Tell me if you need more.

62
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,370
I heard you skipped tutoring yesterday to follow my husband.

63
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,920
Mind your own business.

64
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,250
At this rate, can you even become the top student?

65
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,940
Here.

66
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,600
This...

67
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,400
Those who haven't eaten breakfast, come and eat.

68
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,380
Sit down!

69
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,310
Hurry and sit down!

70
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,540
It's so disorganized and loud in here!

71
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Nice catch!

72
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,510
You punk, really.

73
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,980
Jinyoung's mother!

74
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,590
Who's Shin Woohyun?

75
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,480
Shin...

76
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,640
Shin Woohyun...

77
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,490
Mom!

78
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,030
How dare you seduce my daughter?

79
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,820
If she can't go to college because she's ditching class and dating instead,

80
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,850
are you going to take care of Jinyoung?

81
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,520
A thing like you...

82
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,130
just needs to stay at the bottom, so that she'll stay on top.

83
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,470
Everyone, put your phones away!

84
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,240
Those of you who carry two phones,

85
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,060
- your phones will be confiscated.
 - You shouldn't be like this either.

86
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,000
You should have not let a kid like this get even close to my kid.

87
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,320
How dare he not even know his place?

88
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,840
Mom, please!  I'm the one who followed him around.

89
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,100
It's easy to seduce her because all she knows is studying, right?

90
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,600
I never seduced her. I also haven't fallen down.

91
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,340
People who have no manners act like you.

92
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,900
Kim Jinyoung,

93
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,500
do you think I paid for those expensive classes to have you open a ddeokkbokki business?!

94
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,400
And you...

95
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,060
if you come near Jinyoung one more time,

96
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,310
this won't be the end.

97
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,600
It seems Jinyoung doesn't resemble her mother, looking at how embarrassed she is.

98
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,020
What?

99
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,440
Who do you think I am that you're acting up?

100
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,100
What are all of you doing?  Hurry up and put those phones away!

101
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,290
I'll look forward to your abilities.

102
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,270

103
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,390
You immediately follow me to the principal's office.

104
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,640
You guys self-study.

105
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,400
 Why do you like human dramas?

106
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,400
It's the same old story always with only human beings being exchanged, what are you so curious about?

107
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,140
What hurts and what's happy?

108
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,020
What's that feeling of love?

109
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,550
Why do people love when they know they'll break up?

110
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,600
Why do people live when they know they're going to die?

111
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,870
It seems like I'll know a little bit once I watch that.

112
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,120
The reason that human beings definitely won't let us rest is certain.

113
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,700
Good job.

114
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,580
Don't get interested in human problems and do your work properly.

115
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,680
Yes, yes.

116
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,860
What to do?  What to do?

117
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,830
This can't be happening now, it's at the climax.

118
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,490
These guys.

119
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,120
Jinyoung!

120
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,080
What are you doing?

121
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh...

122
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,120
it's you.

123
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,720
For me,

124
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,110
it isn't my first time here.

125
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,460
Whenever I'm frustrated, pathetic,

126
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,590
and when I don't want to see my mom, I always come up here.

127
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,650
I hate my mom and I hate myself even more.

128
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,800
If you're going to die, let's die together.

129
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,970
Woohyun!

130
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,980
Grab my hand.

131
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,710
Is this a drama?

132
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm busy.

133
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,880
I'm ready.

134
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,100
Are you ready?

135
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,640
Oh, it's Shin Woohyun.

136
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,120
What?  Who is it?

137
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,110
What's wrong with this?

138
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,770
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

139
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,240
Just move out of my way!

140
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,620
What's this?!

141
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,810
What are you two doing?  Oh my god!  My car!  My car!  My car is damaged!

142
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,310
- Oh my god, what did you do?! 
 - Oh!  Jinyoung!

143
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,720
- Hey! Kim Jinyoung, come down here! 
 - My daughter.

144
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,120
Oh my baby, Jinyoung!

145
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,090
What should I do? What is this? Seriously.

146
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,600
What?!

147
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,360
Am I okay?

148
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,190
You're awake.

149
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,010
Excuse me...

150
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,990
Is that friend okay?

151
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,000
It's just a temporary shock.  She just needs to get some IV fluids before she goes.

152
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,990
Are you back to your senses?

153
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,810
 What is this?

154
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,050
 Can he see me?

155
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,650
Is there nothing broken?

156
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,680
Are you okay?

157
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,800
 Hurt?

158
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,800
Are you really okay?

159
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,510
You aren't possibly...

160
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,340
saying that to me, right?

161
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,700
What are you saying?

162
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,630
What?

163
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,170
- What's wrong? 
 - My black note is missing.

164
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,070
- What is it? 
 - My black note.

165
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,190
No way!  What should I do?

166
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,850
Black note? Are you looking for a black notebook?

167
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,610
You need to tell me in order for me to find it. I can find everything else except for your mind.

168
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,430
Do you perhaps remember where you used to live or a phone number?

169
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,170
Why do I need to remember that?

170
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,520
Remember where you are from.

171
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,130
You won't believe me even if I tell you.

172
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,620
I'll believe it. Tell me everything. I'll believe everything.

173
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,610
See, you don't even believe me.

174
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,740
It's more original to say that you're from the ground.

175
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,510
What's wrong?

176
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,050
It's beating here. Are you like that, too?

177
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,850
Hey! Where are you touching?

178
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,770
What do I do?

179
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,260
What are you doing?

180
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,770
Yours is beating, too. Did I really become human?

181
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,330
Hey!

182
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,970
Senior!

183
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,420
Quickly, quickly, Senior!

184
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,650
What is she doing? It creeps me out.

185
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,420
What happened to you exactly?

186
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,620
No, about that...

187
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,210
I was saving him and I ended up like this. The black note has disappeared also.

188
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,840
The black note disappeared?

189
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,350
I looked for it but I can't seem to find it.

190
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,370
Who is she talking to?

191
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't know where I lost it.

192
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,920
Could she be like this... because of me?

193
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,880
No way.  It can't be, right?

194
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,210
You ended up like this while trying to save him, right?

195
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,630
Let's go. We have somewhere to go before it gets any worse.

196
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,770
Find a way for me to get back.

197
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,730
I think there's an answer in him.

198
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,830
I think there's only this place you can go to.

199
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,430
♪ I want to break free. I want to break... ♪

200
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,940
♪ FREE! I want to break... ♪

201
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,380
Your name?

202
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,420
She said she doesn't know her name or even where she lives.

203
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,640
She seems to be safeguarding her mind elsewhere.

204
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,950
Oh, this morning, you're the praiseworthy friend from the accident.

205
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,510
Team Leader, do you know these kids?

206
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,850
I need to know something in order to help them. What should I do?

207
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,390
Can I ask you a few questions?

208
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,720
Is it Kisoo? Why?

209
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,220
What?  You're at the police station?

210
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,230
Oh, why are you there?

211
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,890
Why is my Woohyun at the police station?

212
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,240
Since he's already at the police station, it's a great thing.

213
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,070
No, it's...

214
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,660
Hey, watch the restaurant for me.

215
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,500
Ah, yes.  Be careful.

216
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,760
You can't remember your name?

217
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,910

218
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,930
Lee Seul!

219
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,870
Lee Seul?

220
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,620
Then, what's your surname?

221
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,270

222
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,250
Bi!

223
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,690
Bi?

224
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,470
Bi... Bi... Bi Seul... Bi Seul...

225
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,300
- Lee Seul Bi! 
 - Lee Seulbi.

226
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,430
- Lee Seulbi! 
  - Ah, Lee Seulbi.

227
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,320
So cheap. She wouldn't tell me when I asked her.

228
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,840
You remember your name? Then I guess you remember other things, too.

229
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,670
Please find it.

230
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,580
If you find anything,

231
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,000
text me.

232
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,320
I'm busy.

233
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,950
You know where you belong.

234
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,050
Teacher!

235
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,680
What brings you here?

236
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,150
To sue this guy.

237
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,920
For the crime of assisting a suicide and as an assailant to school violence.

238
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,810
Ma'am!

239
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,670
My daughter... tried to die because of this kind of punk!

240
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,660
Seriously, really.

241
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,720
Just eat up (ruin) your own life, deliciously.

242
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,930
Don't intrude in someone else's life and spray your shit water.

243
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,810
Seriously, really.

244
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,230
My goodness, hey!

245
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,070
- Grandma! 
 - What is all this?

246
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,280
Tell me.

247
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,540
More than suing, it's better to settle it while talking...

248
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,740
Sue?

249
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,210
Oh, really. Is the police taking the side of the assailant right now?

250
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,850
It's not that, but it's hard to sue without clear evidence.

251
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,410
Also, since it's the kids' problems, let's hear them out first.

252
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,430
He saved your daughter. I saw.

253
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,520
What are you?

254
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,400
Really!

255
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,980
The children are submitting a school violence declaration regarding  that  child.

256
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,470
There's plenty of evidence, isn't there? I will request your expeditious handling of it.

257
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,340
Teacher!

258
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,600
He didn't do anything wrong. I saw it!

259
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,170
Who are you to get in the way? Really!

260
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,850
Me?

261
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,150
I'm Lee Seulbi. Who are you?

262
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,680
You little thing, seriously... to an adult. Who do you think I am...?

263
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,040
Bad Lady!

264
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,230
Don't say anything and go outside!

265
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,760
But I said I saw it!

266
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,190
Stay outside!

267
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,940
Don't move a muscle and stay quiet.

268
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,350
Hey!

269
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,190
Stay still my ass!

270
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,840
Woohyun?!

271
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,630
My god, you guys are the loud ones.

272
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,270
Please forgive us. Please forgive us once.

273
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,520
Elder, please stand up and talk.

274
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,790
He has to at least graduate high school to be able to make a living.

275
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,640
Why are you begging me about making a living, so squalidly?

276
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,830
It's really...so disgusting.

277
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,550
Look here. Look over here.

278
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,630
Are you all right?

279
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,460
Did the kids really write that report?

280
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,940
No, well why did you cause problems?

281
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,420
Detective Park, why don't you investigate this penmanship.

282
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,380
Yes.

283
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,010
We take care of lying adults through the law.

284
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,740
A bit more aggressively.

285
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,920
 Mother, but still that's a little...

286
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,530
That declaration is a lie.

287
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,090
Why?  Are you so afraid of Jinyoung's mom?

288
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,980
Because she's the school committee's president?! Because she's the money line for our school?!

289
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,800
I've handled it so that it'll be in the same district.

290
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,820
This is the best I can do.

291
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,710
My goodness.  Thank you. Thank you so much.

292
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,980
I saved Jinyoung. I'm the victim.

293
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,670
Do you think I worked my fingers to the bone to raise you so you could frequent the police station?!

294
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,760
Grandma, you don't believe me?

295
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,420
I'm in an unfair situation.

296
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,870
If you end up here one more time, I'm taking you off my family registry.  (In Korea, family bloodlines are registered.)

297
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,690
Oh!  Oh my god!

298
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,640
Just a minute. Who is this?! "Liar"?!

299
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,410
Who is this? "Stupid. Bad Lady."

300
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,750
Who did this? My car.  "Shut up, Lady!"

301
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,550
"Ugly looking"? Where am I ugly looking?

302
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,710
 He puts it in his mouth.

303
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,670
 He chews it.

304
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,800
 Then gulps and swallows it down.

305
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,580
 Okay!

306
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,610
Hey! Geez.

307
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,350
You did that on purpose, right?

308
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,120
Sorry.

309
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,610
Why I ought to...

310
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,970
My goodness, what is this?

311
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,610
You're a total attention seeker, aren't you? You can't even eat spicy things?

312
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,280
Ddeokbokki... is good like this.

313
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,680
- Spicy? 
 - Here.

314
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,190
How old are you?

315
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,950
I never counted that.

316
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,590
I'm the same age as him.

317
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,300
You're 18?

318
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,750
Yeah, 18.

319
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,040
Hey, aren't you bluffing when you're younger than me?

320
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,120

321
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,780
I'll do that.

322
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,440
Have you worked before?

323
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,930
Hey, don't even think of mooching off us. We're only letting you sleep here tonight.

324
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,230
Your parents are around?

325
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,340
You don't remember?

326
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,090
You'll remember after you eat a lot and rest.

327
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,400
You can stay as long as you want since you saved Woohyun.

328
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,510
- Grandma! 
 - She is your life's saver.

329
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,290
Go upstairs and change.

330
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,950
Thanks. Thank you.

331
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,840
What was that?

332
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,430
You really didn't get hurt at all in that situation?

333
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,650
Wow, it's completely mysterious.

334
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,250
I know.  There was no one other than me.

335
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,670
When are you transferring?

336
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,130
Just come to my school. The girls at my school have prettier faces.

337
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,700
There's nothing I can do.

338
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,900
- Put that away. 
 - Stop resisting and just come.

339
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,030
Being cowardly is the fastest way.

340
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:53,130
Geez, being so popular is really such a headache.

341
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,690
That's why if you give me your know-how then I can share that burden...

342
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,610
Hey. Hey!

343
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,730
Hey, let's go together!  Hey!  Hey, Woohyun, you punk!

344
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,440
Miss Gong, you gathered a lot today, too.

345
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,070
Why? You have something to say?

346
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,650
Miss Gong.

347
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,390
My goodness! Why are you touching dirty money after you have showered?

348
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,890
Even if you keep saying it's dirty, it's the thing you like the most.

349
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,930
When you get old, money is the greatest help.

350
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,840
It's a present for you.

351
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,070
From Dad?

352
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,930
Your father's sense is zero, zero!

353
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,350
How could he keep sending the same size?

354
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,560
Just ask him for money, like Mom.

355
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,380
You can have it.

356
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,540
You're really giving them to me? Thanks.

357
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:19,050
Did your dad send it from America? Then, where's your mom?

358
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,980
Your mom doesn't live here?

359
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,010
Ay, hey, hey! You must be tired, go rest.

360
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,690
I'm not going to transfer. I'm not going to go.

361
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,040
Are you planning to sleep with me?

362
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,760
Why? We can't sleep together?

363
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,080
They all sleep together in dramas.

364
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,450
Don't you think that that's too dangerous of a wish? What about the next scene?

365
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,860
It was dark.

366
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,690
At least you watched it properly.

367
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,780
Grandma, sleep tight.

368
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,620
Hey, hey.

369
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,930
Don't talk about his mom in front of him again.

370
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,690
Even by chance if you bring up talk of his mother, you'll have to leave this house.

371
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,590
Understand?

372
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,620
Why is that?

373
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,310
Yes.

374
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:23,450

375
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,050
Where is my mom living?

376
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,390
 pJinyoung[

377
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,040
It's delicious.

378
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,830
Ah, it's bubbly.

379
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,590
You scared me!

380
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,720
I'm sorry.

381
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,840
Let's not see each other anymore.

382
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,010
I don't want to get expelled.

383
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,010
Even if it's hard, don't die.

384
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,940
You did that while saving me, so talk with my mom...

385
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,990
You're asking me to beg her?

386
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,530
I can't let you transfer.

387
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,140
I'm going to block you from transferring no matter what it takes.

388
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,020
I'll... I'll block it.

389
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,440
So in the end my transfer is in your hands.

390
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,130
If you date me, I'll make sure you don't transfer.

391
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,240
Please believe me.

392
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,850
I'm sorry, but can you go? My girlfriend is here.

393
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,960
- What are you doing at this time? 
 - What?

394
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,350
Well...

395
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,670
Let's go. It's late.

396
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,120
Shin Woohyun!

397
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,710
Don't... Don't turn around. Look straight.

398
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,760
Hey! You bastard!

399
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,270
Look at you spilling stuff behind you.

400
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,230
Wow, you're really good.

401
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,770
I can't even do it.

402
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,100
Calling you my girlfriend...

403
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,100
I'm fine. I saw that on dramas a lot.

404
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,230
What was it? Wow, it's so fun!

405
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,580
I'm a girlfriend not a boyfriend.

406
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,870
It's not even something that's completely wrong.

407
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,490
Instead, you should have been a boy.

408
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,300
Are you really not transferring? Is that bad?

409
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,750
It's bad.

410
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,500
It's not bad. It's getting my memories taken.

411
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,680
Memories taken? Then that's bad.

412
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,800
There are memories that I want to erase.

413
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,030
Taken away and erase them.

414
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,980
Humans are too complicated.

415
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,790
You talk as if you're not human.

416
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,310
When will I get to go back?

417
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,040
Will I be able to go back?

418
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,390
Look here! I'm here!

419
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm also here!

420
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,190
But who are you talking to?

421
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,600
Ay, you are crazy.

422
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,920
Then, how long do I need to live as a human?

423
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,770
Until I find a way.

424
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,880
If you can't, will I die while living as a human?

425
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,910
If I can't, you probably will.

426
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,150
I'll die?

427
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,120
Senior, find a way.

428
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,760
But why are you doing this?

429
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,920
It's something that I found out, but the basics for humans are using chopsticks.

430
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,840
You need to do this in order to live and eat.

431
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,810
The things that humans eat are good.

432
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,340
If you eat together...

433
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,280
You are not human, don't forget it.

434
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,390
I'm leaving.

435
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,500
Senior.

436
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm sorry.

437
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,360
About what? Being human?

438
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,510
I don't know, just everything.

439
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,800
No, avoid him!

440
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,830
What are you doing?

441
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
Were you talking with someone?

442
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,420
I was alone.

443
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,570
Are you doing this because of last time?

444
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,260
Does it hurt a lot here?

445
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,150
What does it mean to "hurt"?

446
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,360
- What is it? 
 - Wow.

447
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,280
Grandma, I don't think she's normal.

448
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,690
Your words will take seed (and what you say will come to pass).

449
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,970
Seulbi, come here and watch what I do carefully.

450
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,930
You put the onions like this.

451
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,830
Yes, this is Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki!   (Spicy rice cake).

452
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,800
Yes.

453
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,710
510 East.104?

454
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,320
A set?

455
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,950
Yes, I'll bring it right over.

456
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,870
Let's eat, Son.

457
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,730
Let's eat separately.

458
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,900
I also don't want to eat with you.

459
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,730
Hurry and come out. The food will cool.

460
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,940
We're going out right now.

461
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,350
There's shouldn't be anyone coming.

462
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,480
- I'll go out. 
 - Okay.

463
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,570
We didn't order.

464
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,150
Isn't this 510 East. 104?

465
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,260
That's right, but we didn't order.

466
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,440
Wait a minute.

467
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,310
It's right. You really didn't order?

468
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,340
I said I didn't...

469
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,750
It's you, right?

470
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,770
I was hungry.

471
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,440
Sungyeol ordered it.

472
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,170
Wait just a minute.

473
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,160
Oh, look at my mind.

474
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,770
I must have forgotten after ordering.

475
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,260
Why did you come so late?

476
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,140
I'm sorry.

477
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,690
I only brought 1,000 Won in change.

478
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,260
You accept cards, right?

479
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,730
You need to tell us before hand for us to bring the machine.

480
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,730
Then, what do you want me to do?

481
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm sorry. It's my fault for not bringing enough change,

482
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,540
so eat well and pay next time.

483
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,510
Oh, here. No need for change.

484
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,060
Oh, thank you.

485
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,690
Oh, and next time it's only possible to order delivery if it's over 10,000 won.

486
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,870
The fuel price is expensive.

487
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:42,000
Really? Then, I guess we'll have to order from somewhere else.

488
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,750
You can do that, but the taste is the best at ours.

489
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,400
My grandma's cooking is great.

490
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,350
If you order the 10,000 won minimum, next time we'll include lots of service (free sides).

491
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,100
Son, let's eat.

492
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,020
Eat well and order again.

493
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,020
All right, work hard.

494
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,260
"Let's eat, son."

495
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,400
I hope you get indigestion.

496
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,910
Why?

497
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,510
All right, I'll be there.

498
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,160
I guess I'll need to go to cooking school starting next week.

499
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,370
Maybe it's because he's growing, but he doesn't seem to have any appetite.

500
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,920
If we're going to eat anyway, make it royal court food.

501
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,620
Sungyeol,

502
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,130
aren't you even curious if the person that got into an accident yesterday is alive or dead?

503
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,600
I'm more curious about my mom.

504
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,090
That brat.

505
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,050
Who does he resemble to be like that?

506
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,400
Why are you being like that?

507
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,290
It's because he has not adjusted to me yet.

508
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,130
Your acting is great.

509
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,920
Yours was enough to win a new actor award, too.

510
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,060
You're a complete fake.

511
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,110
A certain amount of pretense is good manners.

512
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,250
If you show them everything, they get sick of you right away.

513
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,420
A person who has shattered another person's family is teaching ethics at school?

514
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,270
Isn't that completely funny?

515
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,680
That person is also your new mother.

516
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm not the reason that it shattered.

517
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,500
I'm the person who came in to take responsibility for the shattered family.

518
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,060
No, if it wasn't for you, then my dad

519
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,830
wouldn't have separated from my mom.

520
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,010
Perhaps you think too highly of me.

521
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,430
I'm thankful, but leave the adult work to the adults;

522
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,820
and why don't you just study? They say the test will be hard.

523
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,120
10,000,000 won?

524
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,280
What car repair fee is 10,000,000 won?

525
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,820
Did you really do it?

526
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,190
She can just eat bean rice  (in jail)  with your grandson.

527
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,980
Cozily.

528
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,130
Are you doing this because of my transfer?

529
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,450
Yeah, it seems your head works a bit.

530
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,900
But I'm sure I told you,

531
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,830
if you meet my Jinyoung one more time, you're expelled.

532
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,250
But you called her out again last night.

533
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,130
She called him out.

534
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,970
You stay still.

535
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,750
Aren't the pair of you just playing around?

536
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,560
I'm not transferring.

537
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,660
Okay, then don't go.

538
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,570
You will pay the price for your crime and I will receive 10,000,000 won.

539
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,180
And for you; expulsion.

540
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,000
It'll be better if you move Jinyoung to another school,

541
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,910
when you have a lot of money and abilities.

542
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,480
That's not right.

543
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,780
Actually, there's no guarantee that my Jinyoung will be first place at another school.

544
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,040
So, you go.

545
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,790
Then I won't accept this measly 10,000,000 won.

546
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,080
Woohyun, don't transfer.

547
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,570
I'll pay that bill!

548
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,370
If you show up in front of my Woohyun again then it's your funeral day.

549
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,310
Funeral day? What are you saying right now?

550
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,950
What?

551
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,790
Expulsion?

552
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,040
Should I expel you from your life, too?

553
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,270
My goodness, really! What are you going to do with that spoon?!

554
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,670
She's right. You're really bad.

555
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,800
My good, seriously. Hey! Because of you...

556
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,830
No, it's because of you!

557
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,850
You come out.

558
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,950
Ah, seriously.

559
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:12,580

560
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,880
Was it really you who did it?

561
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,630
I'm asking if it was you?

562
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,920
I felt that it was unfair for you.

563
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,490
That woman is a bad person.

564
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,660
You're worse.

565
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,780
You're worse because you just interfere anytime and cause accidents.

566
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,710
Because of you, I'm...

567
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,480
I was trying to help you.

568
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,880
Who's helping who?

569
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,190
You don't even know where you live. How are you going to help?

570
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,120
That...

571
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,820
I don't know you anymore.

572
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,360
I only know you.

573
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,640
I don't know you, so get lost.

574
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,650
Aren't you going to get lost?

575
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,940
Then I'll leave.

576
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,490
Woohyun,

577
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:57,560
I only know you in this world.

578
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,970
Let's go together.

579
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,060
Why is it me?

580
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,790
It's already hard and crazy enough for me without you.

581
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,890
After meeting you,

582
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,690
there's nothing that's working right.

583
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,410
Don't follow me.

584
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,900
If I had gotten a part-time job, then I wouldn't be in this predicament.

585
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,000
Seriously...

586
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,910
Senior told me not to trust humans.

587
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,870
Ah, he was right.

588
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,560
You have the same fate as me.

589
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,330
This is what betrayal feels like.

590
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,970
I even saved his life,

591
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:41,530
but he treats me as the enemy.

592
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,460
Bad guy.

593
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,690
Not you.

594
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,330
There's a bad guy.

595
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,160
You are just like Shin Woohyun!

596
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,470
You are giving this to me?

597
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,890
Really? Thanks.

598
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,730
I cancel calling you just like Woohyun.

599
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,790
I don't have the black note.

600
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,810
I have nowhere to go.

601
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,780
Die while living like a human?

602
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,660
What do I need to do in order to go back?

603
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,160
I want to go back.

604
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,970
I'm going to go back.

605
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:22,750
