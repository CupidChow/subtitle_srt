1
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,906
It's a relief that you didn't get hurt.

2
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,386
Can't you see you got hurt?

3
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:56,296
I'm saying it's a relief that you didn't get hurt.

4
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,826
Is it really okay to not go to the hospital?

5
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:06,496
Don't smile. What's so great about getting hurt that you're smiling?

6
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:10,996
Because you're looking and talking to me now. I think I can live a little now.

7
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:13,226
About before...

8
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:25,826
Never mind. It's late, so you should go and rest.

9
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,656
Goodnight, Woohyun.

10
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,916
Perhaps, Senior...

11
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,356
It can't be.

12
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:17,896
Did I see it wrongly because I was so tired?

13
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:23,506
No. I definitely saw it. Seulbi also got hurt.

14
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,916
A ghost? Spirit?

15
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:35,866

16
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:44,006
"Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki Investment Proposal."

17
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:45,086
What is this?

18
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:49,416
I'm researching the changes in the retail business and the stores and people in the area.

19
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,536
Since it's a store filled with tradition, there are many regulars.

20
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:55,786
You'll be able to get more profit than from bank interests.

21
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:58,316
Impressive.

22
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,406
But when did you do all this?

23
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,546
Someone has to worry about the money.

24
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:05,506
So that no one loses anything.

25
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:14,056
But, Sungyeol, I don't have extra money right now.

26
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,296
Could there be no solution?

27
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:20,776
I'm not sure.

28
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,286
I'll be leaving.

29
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,676
All right. Have a good day.

30
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:35,596
That rascal. He's become admirable.

31
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:39,086
No...

32
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:43,416
What if he grows up and becomes a guarantor for all his friends?

33
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:49,576
If only I had some extra money...

34
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,406
Even if it's just a restaurant.

35
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:56,336
No doubt, it's hard for students to manage.

36
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:01,726
What to do? This is a big problem. It'd be nice to help them. It's not like we can ignore it.

37
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,196
Who are you?

38
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:30,106
The cooking utensils are a mess. The refrigerator has been turned inside out.

39
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,866
I can't even rest for a little bit.

40
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:37,856
Thank you, Woohyun, for coming back!

41
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:40,346
I told you my hands are very expensive.

42
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:44,916
Why do you smell like pain relief patches?

43
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,396
Do you fight?

44
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:49,356
Do you want to get hit once?

45
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,436
I wanted to hit you because you really wouldn't listen to me.

46
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,576
Hit me, it serves me right.

47
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:01,116
Let's do well from now on.

48
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,876
It's been a long time since you've smiled.

49
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:11,286
What are you going to do about the store?

50
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,946
Let's find a solution.

51
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,706
If you and I both look for it, it won't be tiring.

52
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:19,206
Are you sure it won't be tiring? And not more tiring?

53
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:21,546
Do you really want to get hit?

54
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,856
Why do you always butt in every time and take away my chance?

55
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:29,956
- What chance? 
 - A chance for me to protect you.

56
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,026
You have to give me a chance so that I can protect you.

57
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:33,606
Who cares if it's me protecting you?

58
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:38,756
It's because you don't know a lot about men, but the moment a man can't protect his woman...

59
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:44,036
We'll be late, let's go to school.

60
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,366
The kids have probably waited for me a lot.

61
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,906

62
00:05:56,206 --> 00:06:01,956
Did you, by chance, tell the teacher that you were the one who planted the phone on Seulbi?

63
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,106
Are you crazy?!

64
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:07,556
Did you say I was part of it, too?

65
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:10,326
I just said what I did.

66
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,476
You tell them yourself.

67
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:15,326
Aren't you afraid of Jaeseok?

68
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,856
- I'm scared. 
 - But..?

69
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,516
I'm scared of my cowardly self more.

70
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,446
 Woohyun, I'm sorry.

71
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,456
 To be honest, inside Seulbi's backpack, I...

72
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,426
What are you doing?

73
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,116
Youngeun.

74
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,656
Do you seriously want to die?

75
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,086
I-It's not that!

76
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,356
Finally, it's time.

77
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:38,076
Now, let's quickly forget the hurt and remember our happiness for a long time.

78
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,526
- Then... 
 - Teacher!

79
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:45,426
The culprit who put the cellphone inside Seulbi's backpack was Yena.

80
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,226
Youngeun!

81
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:49,066
I had a guilty conscience.

82
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:52,846
To frame Lee Seulbi, she plotted the whole thing.

83
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,696
 Wow, so it was her...

84
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:57,136
Quiet!

85
00:07:57,136 --> 00:08:00,346
Everyone put your backpacks on top of your desks.

86
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,266
Hurry!

87
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,396
Dating in class is forbidden!

88
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:18,646
I made seating partners for couples that could never happen.

89
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:22,086
While making this, look at my eye! Eye! It looks like I'm dying.

90
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,556
 Whatever!

91
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,756
Complaining is prohibited!

92
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,466
What happened?

93
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,046
I fell.

94
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,916
- You should have been careful. 
 - I should have.

95
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,066
Also, Yena!

96
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,516
Come to my office right now.

97
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:51,236
Right now. Do you know what I'm saying?

98
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:52,786
Yes.

99
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,546
Oh, just come. You didn't hear me, huh? Come!

100
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,176
Oh, my eye hurts.

101
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,536
I did wrong.

102
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:13,136
I have a duty for you.

103
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,296
Yes?

104
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,026
What "ty"?

105
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:25,526
Duty! Duty! Duty! Study some English!

106
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:29,536
What do I have to do?

107
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:34,556
Come here.

108
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:36,786
Come closer.

109
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:50,236
You're deadly happy to see me, right?

110
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,686
How did Seulbi get hurt?

111
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,066
There was something like that.

112
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:58,206
What exactly are you doing that she's always getting hurt?

113
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,826
How is Seulbi yours? She's mine.

114
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:04,006
If you can't protect her, I warned you to move aside, didn't I?

115
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:10,016
You woke up and I waited, so it's fair. Right?

116
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,266
What do you mean?

117
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,016
I'm going to pursue Seulbi now, too.

118
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,806
Is your injury okay?

119
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,826
That must have hurt a lot.

120
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:25,866
We're sorry for misunderstanding.

121
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,366
I knew from the start that you wouldn't have done such a thing.

122
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,986
Lee Yena has always been sneaky, right?

123
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,686
Yeah.

124
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,506
Lee Seulbi.

125
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,976
Seulbi.

126
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:47,246
This is the difference between us, you call her Lee Seulbi and I just call her Seulbi.

127
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,246
Try and catch up to me.

128
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:53,276
It's time now. Let's go.

129
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:54,466
What time?

130
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,406
Time to see my face.

131
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,386
I think Woohyun is becoming more charming.

132
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:07,066
Sungyeol.

133
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,576
Do you guys want to go to the cafeteria? I'll pay.

134
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,706
So that you can put your phone in our bag when we're not looking?

135
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:21,816
It's not that—

136
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:25,576
They say that love blinds you,

137
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:27,976
but you're really pathetic.

138
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,286
I'll buy. Let's go.

139
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,666
What are you doing? Pay up.

140
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,166
You guys use your own money.

141
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,486
Did I hear him wrong?

142
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:07,936
Since we don't have money, you pay.

143
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:11,726
If you don't have money, don't eat.

144
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,926
Hey, didn't I tell you to take care of him?

145
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:22,406
That... About that...

146
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,256
It seems he became tolerant of getting beaten.

147
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,986
You two need to get your heads on straight, first!

148
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:35,576
Bingo! Caught red-handed!

149
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:10,266
♫  If you wanna be my love. I wanna be your star  ♫

150
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:15,246
♫  I want to see you several times a day  ♫

151
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:16,606
♫  I want to tell you I love you...  ♫

152
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:22,076
 What's so good about a guy that keeps hurting you?

153
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:26,286
 If I hurt you, would you like me back as well?

154
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:41,116
♫  You've always told me that we're just friends  ♫

155
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,986
Why are you doing this?

156
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:52,676
Why are you asking me? You should ask Chunsik.

157
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,376
Chunsik?

158
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:03,426
From now on, you're filling in Chunsik's position.

159
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:18,296
- What's wrong? 
 - It's because of you!

160
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,236
It was better when you got bullied.

161
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:25,246
Your face... Did Jaeseok do that?

162
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:30,056
He says that if you're not going to get bullied, the rest of us will be like this.

163
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,126
What are you going to do?

164
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,236
Congratulations on clearing your name.

165
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:51,436
I read it well. This book is really good.

166
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,316
That means you liked it, right?

167
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:55,726
You read my mind.

168
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:59,936
You know, you're a bit weird. Did you know that?

169
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,586
How?

170
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:04,286
You're different from an average person.

171
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,466
Like the book, you're a little "GapTokTwe."

172
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:10,116
What's GapTokTwe? Can you eat it?

173
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:14,806
It's an acronym for "suddenly jumping out of nowhere." You didn't know that?

174
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:18,986
I forgot for a moment. I did hear it before.

175
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,606
But why do kids these days shorten their words?

176
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:26,256
To study, to play games and to chat, we don't even have much time. Why would we write everything out?

177
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,726
Of course! Why would we write everything out? You're busy, right?

178
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,856
Work hard.

179
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,696

180
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,536
Thank you.

181
00:15:56,536 --> 00:16:01,026
Why do you keep giggling during class? Are you having an affair?

182
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,806
I did? When?

183
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:07,556
Whenever you see Sungyeol, you giggle to yourself. Do you know how stupid you look?

184
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:08,996
You're being jealous, right?

185
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,606
What? Jealous?

186
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,826
I need to be lacking in something to be doing that.

187
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,766
Everything's overflowing for me.

188
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,166
Including your jealousy.

189
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:21,696
If you giggle in front of Sungyeol one more time...

190
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,166
Senior!

191
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:43,006
Senior, what are you doing?

192
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,346
The pot from last time was your doing, too. Right?

193
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:52,526
Look at you, always getting hurt while trying to save that guy.

194
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:53,576
What are you doing?

195
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,966
Angels are supposed to save humans.

196
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,766
Don't misunderstand.

197
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,456
You're no longer an angel.

198
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,006
You don't have any right to be an angel, either.

199
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:06,496
What kind of an angel puts humans in danger?

200
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:08,896
Senior.

201
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:21,206
Angel?

202
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:26,276

203
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:48,806

204
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:59,746
 Look here! I'm here!

205
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,876
As soon as the identity of an angel is revealed, they will have to return.

206
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:12,346
Does that mean I will have to act like I don't know anything, and not talk about it either?

207
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:17,176
I seem to have dropped some books.

208
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:31,476
Your silence will protect your love.

209
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:44,176
You...

210
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:48,646
I was trying to avoid you, but I can't take this anymore.

211
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:50,176
Follow me.

212
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:58,736

213
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,756

214
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,486

215
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,276

216
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:10,746
The first angel to become a human. Human angel #1, Choi Sunggo.

217
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,706
That's me.

218
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:17,086
Well, I was pretty famous when I was up there (as an angel), so you probably know me...

219
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,696
Maybe you don't know.

220
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:22,796
Do I need to recite my CV (curriculum vitae) with my own mouth, Junior?

221
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:26,076
No. I'm sorry for not being able to recognize you.

222
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,336
Okay.

223
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,286
I'll get to the point. Junior, do you want to become a human?

224
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,036
Then make your choice like a man.

225
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:39,486
I don't have any interest in humans, who are unpredictable and insignificant.

226
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,196
Ah, is that right?

227
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:45,896
Once we are revealed as an angel, we have to return.

228
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:50,156
So you're using that? Isn't that a bit unfair?

229
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,266
Well, if you want to see Seulbi that badly then I understand.

230
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:56,286
An angel does not miss a human!

231
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,366
Did you just get mad?

232
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,226
Look. You're mad.

233
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:03,716
You're sad, you're jealous, and you miss someone.

234
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:05,996
All these emotions are for humans.

235
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,136
But why are you doing this? It's dangerous.

236
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:10,756
I never did that.

237
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:16,516
Now you're even feigning ignorance, which is what the lowest humans only do.

238
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,126
You're hopeless. Come here and let me hit you.

239
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,136
Reveal your forehead.

240
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:33,156
If you blink, avoid,

241
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:36,276
or move, I'm going to do it again.

242
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,666
Today, I saw a devil in an angel's eyes.

243
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,626
You're going into training starting now.

244
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:45,246
One, two...

245
00:20:51,436 --> 00:20:54,866
See how it's red? This is pain.

246
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:58,566
Your pain, I'm going to take it.

247
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:01,536
This is love.

248
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,656
Here.

249
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,796
They say if you use this, it becomes cleaner.

250
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:17,586
It erased clearly for me!

251
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:21,736
What's that? Can I try it, too?

252
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:24,036
There's none for you.

253
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:26,776
Seulbi, do you want to try it?

254
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,916
Oh! It's moist!

255
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,516
You're not supposed to put that on your face.

256
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:41,056
By using that, maybe she wants to become prettier for someone.

257
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:43,126
Do you really become prettier?

258
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:52,516
How much is that? When I go and buy it, I'll buy yours too.

259
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:58,066
Here, use a lot. That way, you can clean your conscience as well.

260
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:06,916
Everybody in their seats!

261
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:11,506
Be quiet!

262
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:16,986
I think I hear your voices. Report cards are out.

263
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,256
Be quiet!

264
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,156
Here, Sukhoon.

265
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:27,456
I told you to do well, but you dropped to fifth place.

266
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,346
Did the second place get pushed back?

267
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,136
Then, who's in second?

268
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,756
Here...

269
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,506
Hwang Sungyeol.

270
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,276
Second place.

271
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:39,996
What? Then, who's in first place?

272
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:41,936
Be quiet!

273
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:46,746
Hey, don't worry about others but yourself.

274
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,096
Here, first place is...

275
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:52,066
Lee Seulbi.

276
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,386
Really?

277
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,416
Good job!

278
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,776
Be quiet!

279
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,196
Congratulations.

280
00:22:58,196 --> 00:22:59,906
Thanks.

281
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:12,576
Is that an ability?

282
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:16,066
Or perhaps, an angel's skill?

283
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,556
Hurry up, Woohyun!

284
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,436
Oh, yeah.

285
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:24,666
Hey, you, Seulbi.  How far does your talent go?

286
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,176
It's mysterious.

287
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:29,656
Ability? Mystery? It's luck! Luck!

288
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:31,896
Did you copy from someone?

289
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,576
Don't you know that luck is an ability as well?

290
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:39,366
My luck and ability are so good. Those things need to go to Woohyun though.

291
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,806
That... That thing! Come here!

292
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:46,036
Yikes. Isn't that the game only couples can do, "Catch me if you can?"

293
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:48,776
Catch me if— Sorry.

294
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,166
We are perfectly broke.

295
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,376
You can just earn money.

296
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,616
A high schooler's minimum wage is ₩5,210 ($4.87). When on earth (will we be able to earn all that money)?

297
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:13,136
Those bad guys won't come again, right?

298
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:15,126
For now.

299
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:17,266
I should have taken some money and thrown it in their faces.

300
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:20,086
If you have money to throw, then throw it here.

301
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,586
Are you already money-crazed?

302
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:28,166
Can't we take care of the store ourselves?

303
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,156
Should we try to ask the new owners?

304
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,816
You're sad, right?

305
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:38,286
But it's a relief that we were able to keep the house.

306
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:44,216
As of now, let's work hard and get this place back.

307
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,586
Yeah.

308
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,656
But...

309
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:51,536
Don't talk about my parents.

310
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,266
Can you really see through my heart?

311
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:56,046
It's written all over your face.

312
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:03,526
Let's try to find your parents. We can probably find them.

313
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:08,066
I don't need them. Those who abandon me, I won't look at them anymore.

314
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:11,226
Lies.

315
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:16,816
I will never look for them.

316
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:19,736
Why do you keep on lying?

317
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,666
I only need you.

318
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,496
The truth goes through, right?

319
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:43,206
Yes, this is Ms. Gong's ddeokbokki.

320
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:47,376
What? 100 servings?

321
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:49,086
SangBit Park.

322
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,786
Yes. Yes.

323
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:55,286
Hey, what are you doing?

324
00:25:56,166 --> 00:26:02,746
♫  Friday feeling deep inside you. 
You seem different for some reason  ♫

325
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:09,186
♫  Sweet cherry night, chocolate chemical, I fly in the skies  ♫

326
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:13,216
♫  Let's say I planned to meet you at 3:00  ♫

327
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,626
♫  Then my heart will start to flutter at least by 10:00  ♫

328
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:19,596
♫  When it comes to dating, I can't be calculating or play games  ♫

329
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:20,926
♫  The wind feels just cool enough  ♫

330
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:24,806
Let's try not to cause much trouble. How could you just accept a 100 servings order?

331
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:28,276
- It's just this once. 
 - But you still did it all.

332
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:32,046
Of course! Our Woohyun has some skills.

333
00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:33,966
To chief?

334
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:36,326
Are you a foreign student?

335
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:39,596
Sometimes you don't understand the things we all know.

336
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:41,866
How are you so good at studying?

337
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,006
You're so weird.

338
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:46,186
Kids like her are kind of slow when it comes to these things. 
  (T/N: He's saying she's only book smart)

339
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:48,736
True, that's only fair.

340
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:52,126
Hey, but this, it tastes really similar to Grandma's.

341
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,856
Grandma left us the recipe.

342
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:56,496
Of course, our grandma.

343
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,016
I miss her.

344
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:05,706
Do you think you'll miss her as much as I do?

345
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:09,746
Of course! You're the best at everything!

346
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:17,536
Hey, but this is a bit too much for us to carry by ourselves.

347
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:23,216
- What's wrong? 
 - Why are you here?

348
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:26,236
We were really busy, so I called him to help us.

349
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:28,776
- Why him? 
 - Why you?

350
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:31,206
Ey, the Tom and Jerry couple.

351
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:33,796
Let's go before the ddeokbokki bloats.

352
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:36,496
Finally, our first sale!

353
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:44,036
♫  If you're still there. If you're still waiting for me  ♫

354
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,126
Why are you guys...

355
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:06,916
Who ordered ddeokbokki?

356
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:13,406
I'm sure they said to bring it to this park.

357
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:19,506
I think I know now.

358
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:20,876
Me too.

359
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:23,696
Those guys seriously...

360
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:26,996
Why are you guys here?

361
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,566
You called the store.

362
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:31,536
Can't we call? You should have told us sooner.

363
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,816
Grandmother said not to fight.

364
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:43,136
They say throwing away food is a sin. You'll probably get punished for this, Woohyun.

365
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,026
You'll be the one who gets punished. I'm not going to throw it away.

366
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:50,446
I thought today's sale would be a hit but looks like it flunked.

367
00:28:50,446 --> 00:28:51,616
We feel so sorry. What should we do?

368
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:55,706
I feel more sorry for you guys who only have time to play these tricks.

369
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,396
Should I make a sorry sight of you, permanently?

370
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,486
This is too much.

371
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:18,476
If you don't want to die, move.

372
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:20,666
You, Jaeseok

373
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,826
Hey.

374
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:29,846
Hey, come back here!

375
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:36,256
Aren't&nbsp;you embarrassed to get bullied in front of your friends?

376
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:47,696
Ah, seriously. What is this? It's so embarrassing!

377
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:52,076
This smells, seriously.

378
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,376
Did I just get hit?

379
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,086
Probably.

380
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:10,076
Please try this and come to Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki.

381
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,066
Thank you.

382
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:20,926
♫ If you wanna be my love, I wanna be your star ♫

383
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:25,756
♫ I want to see you several times a day ♫

384
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:31,286
♫ I want to tell you I love you, that you're the only one, 
by hugging you sweetly ♫

385
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,596
You punk. Thanks!

386
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,126
I'm more thankful.

387
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,706
Chunsik, you've grown so much. You're even helping me.

388
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:40,756
Where did Seulbi go?

389
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,426
Lee Seulbi!

390
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:47,566
Hello, we're from Mrs. Gong's Ddeokbokki. Please come.

391
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:53,836
We're from Miss Gong's Ddeokbokki. Please come.

392
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,276
Thanks.

393
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:57,936
I'm paying back my debt.

394
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:00,916
For the time you did the classroom duties by yourself.

395
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,566
You're a really good friend.

396
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:06,806
I'll go there and give out some more.

397
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:17,026
You're so good-looking.

398
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:18,456
You're so good-looking!

399
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:28,166
This is from Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki.

400
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:34,166
How can you do this to me?

401
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,236
Why do you think I did this? You used me.

402
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,746
Do you know how much I did for you?

403
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:43,316
- But just because of that you... 
 - Just because of that?

404
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:45,846
Because of you, what did I become to Sungyeol?

405
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:49,966
Did you think you were the only one who wanted to look good in front of Woohyun? I, too, in front of Sungyeol, want to be—

406
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:55,336
Never mind. Let's stop.

407
00:31:56,656 --> 00:32:03,366
As you live, try to take responsibility for what you did.

408
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,056
Do you know how much I did for you?

409
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,956
Do you know how much money I spent on you?

410
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:12,216
Say that again.

411
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,816
Without me, how will you eat and survive?

412
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,086
Am I a beggar?

413
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,646
You better look down!

414
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:27,616
What are you doing?!

415
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,026
Are you okay?

416
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:47,226
You, seriously...

417
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,556
You're worse than I thought you were.

418
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:54,036
Sungyeol.

419
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:55,826
Let's go.

420
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,876
You look so pretty.

421
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,556
How old are you?

422
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:35,436
I'm not a bad big brother!

423
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,446
Do you want to eat this?

424
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:42,966
Here.

425
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,446
Try it.

426
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:47,876
That's it.

427
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,566
It's delicious.

428
00:33:57,416 --> 00:34:00,836
I have a younger sibling around your age.

429
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:02,086
Who are you waiting for?

430
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:03,766
My big sister.

431
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:05,856
If your big sister looks like you, she must be pretty.

432
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:06,906
How old is your big sister?

433
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,366
She's in her second year of high school.

434
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:10,326
She's the same age as me!

435
00:34:10,326 --> 00:34:13,366
Come to the ddeokbokki store with your older sister, okay?

436
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,966
Na Yeeun!

437
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:19,316
This voice...

438
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,596
Oh god! What are you doing here?

439
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:27,906
Sis, this brother gave me this.

440
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,706
I told you not to eat anything that a stranger gives you.

441
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:31,996
I'm hungry!

442
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:35,826
I'm going to eat it. You're not supposed to throw away food.

443
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,936
Your younger sister is very smart.

444
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,756
Did you cry?

445
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,056
Shut your mouth.

446
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:55,766
Bye, Brother!

447
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,186
Bye!

448
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:01,126
She definitely cried.

449
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,196
Are you studying?

450
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:21,516
What's that?

451
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:23,286
When's your birthday?

452
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:24,916
My birthday?

453
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:27,206
I don't really remember...

454
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,516
Then let's have this day as your birthday.

455
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,556
The day you came here.

456
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,566
Let's record all of our anniversaries here.

457
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,056
Why?

458
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:42,276
If we record everything, then they'll become our memories.

459
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:46,236
- Memories? 
 - If you're ill or feel weird, tell me straight away.

460
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:48,106
Okay?

461
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,906
Yeah, I understand.

462
00:35:50,906 --> 00:35:54,266
Why study? You're already first in the class.

463
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:55,826
Go rest.

464
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,556
Quickly, rest!

465
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:18,746
Why, why? What's wrong?

466
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:21,446
You already laid out the blankets? I could have done that.

467
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:23,876
Yeah, because you might be tired.

468
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:27,026
You worked hard today. Hurry and get some rest.

469
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:29,546
Yeah, goodnight.

470
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:32,236
Goodnight.

471
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:38,476
Does Woohyun know?

472
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:43,056
Do I have to tell Woohyun?

473
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,946
You can't go back without these clothes, right?

474
00:36:57,946 --> 00:37:00,376
I don't know anything.

475
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:04,076
I'm only going to know you.

476
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,876
So don't go back.

477
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:21,216
 Mom is getting married

478
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:25,056
 I really want to be congratulated by you, Son.

479
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:45,076
Your mom's marriage...

480
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,036
Let's congratulate her.

481
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:52,586
Can you congratulate her?

482
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:54,156
From the same point of view?

483
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:56,166
Sungyeol, I'm really sorry, but—

484
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:59,076
This is adult business, so a kid like you should just quietly study instead?

485
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,066
You rascal!

486
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,926
That's not what I meant!

487
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:06,916
I'm not going to live like you, Dad.

488
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,796
And I won't meet a girl like Mom, either.

489
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:21,536
I'm sorry.

490
00:38:35,026 --> 00:38:38,036

491
00:38:38,036 --> 00:38:42,496
 I can't congratulate you. Don't wish for too much.

492
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:53,266
 But this time, you have to be happy, Mom.

493
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:14,026
Is there something going on?

494
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,726
No.

495
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:17,326
Are you sick?

496
00:39:17,326 --> 00:39:18,826
No.

497
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:21,406
Do you miss me? Why do you keep appearing in front of me?

498
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:24,016
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

499
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,036
Let's do this.

500
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,546

($187.04)

501
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:35,576
Now, we will start the jjajangmyeon speed-eating contest.

502
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:38,326
The winning person will gain ₩200,000.

503
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:42,396
Now,, get ready and we will start!

504
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:11,326
I wish we could have more contests like this.

505
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,216
I get to eat jjajangmyeon for free and earn money!

506
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:15,986
You're really unique.

507
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:19,016
Other girls just watch those kinds of contests.

508
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,346
Seulbi likes jjajangmyeon a lot.

509
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:22,626
You like these types of songs, right?

510
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:26,406
♫  Mother said she didn't like jjajangmyun  ♫

511
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:29,236
Why didn't you eat jjajangmyeon? It was yummy.

512
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:31,506
I like this more.

513
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:35,096
Hwang Sungyeol, do you eat delicious food like this every day?

514
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:38,426
Your mom's cooking is an art.

515
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:40,436
It fits my taste perfectly.

516
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,586
Is it that good?

517
00:40:45,196 --> 00:40:47,436
You ate jjajangmyeon earlier!

518
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:50,626
This is mine. I'm eating all of it.

519
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,566
Did I come in the wrong room?

520
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:59,716
I thought this was your room.

521
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:07,546
I'm letting you use the bed. Think of it as an honor.

522
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:13,686
If you have nowhere else to sleep, you can go to the sauna or another friend's house.

523
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:18,126
Then again, you don't have any other friends besides me.

524
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,266
But what's wrong?

525
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,816
An honor student like you ran away from home and all.

526
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:29,666
I'm staying out, not running away.

527
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:32,356
Did you contact your parents?

528
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:33,936
Which parents?

529
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,836
My dad? Or my stepfather?

530
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:41,996
My mom or my stepmother?

531
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:45,526
I'm wondering who to contact.

532
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:49,116
Why do you have so many moms and dads?

533
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:51,466
I have none.

534
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:53,686
You said you couldn't contact them.

535
00:41:53,686 --> 00:41:58,446
In my phone, there are over 300 phone numbers, but none of them are my mom's or my dad's.

536
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:02,826
It's the same as them not existing if I don't have their numbers.

537
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:08,746
Hey, call them quickly. If you're not going to, then go home.

538
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:16,816
Let me be. I want them to wait.

539
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:24,256
I always waited. I'm always waiting. Just me.

540
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,006
Why are you so sincere?

541
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:35,806
My mom got married today. Turn the lights off.

542
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,416
Punk, it hurts.

543
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:59,336
Ms. Gong told me to never send an empty plate back.

544
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:07,166
Take this to Sungyeol's mother.

545
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,006
To say thank you.

546
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:12,616
And this is the ddeokbokki I made.

547
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:14,756
Eat it deliciously.

548
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:16,586
Thanks.

549
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:19,356
- Sungyeol... 
 - I will let him sleep at our house tonight.

550
00:43:19,356 --> 00:43:21,506
That way, he'll be less lonely.

551
00:43:22,376 --> 00:43:25,646
Yeah. Look after him well.

552
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:47,146
This is what grandmas do.

553
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:49,376
I've been living for a long—

554
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:52,676
Trust me.

555
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:04,906
I'm sorry. I needlessly asked to eat jjajangmyeon.

556
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:07,686
Don't be hurt.

557
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,396
I guess I should continue to get hurt.

558
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:11,596
No!

559
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:13,876
You're looking at me because I'm hurt.

560
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,386
Seulbi,

561
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:27,516
if you have time, can you look after me, too?

562
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:35,606
I've fallen asleep from exhaustion after waiting all day for my mom and dad.

563
00:44:36,846 --> 00:44:41,336
I even waited until today for my mom, who is never coming back.

564
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,586
I'm very good at waiting.

565
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,146
I...

566
00:44:55,116 --> 00:44:59,416
If you smile today, I shouldn't.

567
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:03,566
If you talk, I shouldn't respond.

568
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:06,246
I think about it every day.

569
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:12,036
But I was never able to go through with it.

570
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:20,556
So, I will wait.

571
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:26,236
♫ ...and you're in front of me again ♫

572
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:31,266
♫ Staring at me, then smiling at me ♫

573
00:45:35,386 --> 00:45:41,546
♫  I can't breathe  ♫

574
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:46,196
♫  Your gaze alone  ♫

575
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:49,506
What is this? That's the expression of you waiting for me.

576
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:54,746
Is it good that I waited?

577
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:57,376
It's hard waiting for someone who won't return,

578
00:45:57,446 --> 00:46:01,066
but waiting for someone who'll appear like this in front of you will make your heart flutter. Right?

579
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,936
Why?

580
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,086
 I'll wait.

581
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:07,336
Nothing. It's nothing.

582
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:16,456
 Thank you, I ate it well.

583
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:20,876
 I regained my strength thanks to you. Sungyeol's mom is the best!

584
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:27,426
Sungyeol's mother?

585
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:32,896
Woohyun.

586
00:46:34,276 --> 00:46:38,036
If we can live as strangers like this, let's live like that.

587
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,786
I'm sorry.

588
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,156
I'm sorry.

589
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:01,056
Hey! Hey! Hey!

590
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:02,736
What is this?!

591
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:07,966
What's going on? What's wrong?

592
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:09,196
Give it!

593
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,696
I gave you my bed, not my body.

594
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:13,326
Didn't you pull me down?

595
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:17,646
Even if you fell, you should have just slept. How dare you violate my body?

596
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,766
Did something happen last night?

597
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:24,696
No.

598
00:47:27,776 --> 00:47:29,716
What is this awkwardness?

599
00:47:34,526 --> 00:47:35,826
We're eating ddeokbokki for breakfast.

600
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:38,776
In a ddeokbokki house, we eat ddeokbokki for all three meals. Didn't you know that?

601
00:47:38,796 --> 00:47:42,726
You should eat what you're given instead of violating another person's body.

602
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:46,496
You two look good together.

603
00:47:46,546 --> 00:47:47,706
Hey!

604
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:52,606
For high school guys like you, you're considered best friends. Right?

605
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:56,576
It's the weekend, so let's go somewhere. There's a place I really wanted to go to!

606
00:48:04,976 --> 00:48:06,966
That necklace.

607
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:09,086
Necklace?

608
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,986
You have a good eye.

609
00:48:10,986 --> 00:48:15,306
Even if I can give you everything, I won't be able to give you Seulbi or this necklace.

610
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:16,856
It's the only one in this world.

611
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:19,856
When are you going to return Seulbi to where she came from?

612
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,576
I'm respecting her decision.

613
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:23,076
Should I ask my dad to find out?

614
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:25,796
No, I found out.

615
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:29,956
Her parents passed away, so she's lived a hard life by herself.

616
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:31,656
It's better here than there.

617
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:33,646
Really?

618
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:36,846
Seulbi's waiting. Let's go.

619
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:44,126
The loser pays for the rice drink and eggs.

620
00:48:44,146 --> 00:48:48,136
Ready, set, go!

621
00:48:53,426 --> 00:48:55,866
Hey!

622
00:48:57,256 --> 00:49:02,326

623
00:49:04,326 --> 00:49:06,286
One for you, too.

624
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:08,556
I saw this place many times in dramas.

625
00:49:08,556 --> 00:49:12,296
It's really hot, cool (refreshing), spacious, and nice!

626
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:14,496
Is this your first time?

627
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,996
You must be happy that there's a lot to eat.

628
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:20,486
Ow!

629
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:23,156
An egg cracks well when cracked on the head.

630
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:25,726
It'll crack best on your head.

631
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:28,206
Come here, Seulbi. Come here.

632
00:49:28,206 --> 00:49:30,696
Should I crack it (on your head)? Ow!

633
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:32,976
That jerk... Come back here!

634
00:49:32,976 --> 00:49:35,366
I'm sorry.

635
00:49:35,366 --> 00:49:38,006
Teacher!

636
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:39,606
Mister?

637
00:49:45,406 --> 00:49:47,856
Where are you going?

638
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:51,856
This is Sungyeol's mom.

639
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,776
Mom? The Ethics teacher?

640
00:49:57,776 --> 00:50:00,456
You were Sungyeol's mother?

641
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,486
Why are you here?

642
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:05,406
Oh...

643
00:50:05,406 --> 00:50:09,056
We came to the sauna because your mom was feeling a bit tired.

644
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:15,246
Woohyun, I'm really thankful that you are getting along with Sungyeol.

645
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:19,356
He started becoming like a human after meeting you.

646
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:21,036
I'll count on you from now on, too.

647
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:22,526
Just leave him to me.

648
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:24,656
Your debt keeps getting bigger.

649
00:50:25,976 --> 00:50:27,946
Oh, do you want anything more to eat?

650
00:50:27,946 --> 00:50:29,776
Tell me. I'll buy everything.

651
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:33,836
Really? I want seaweed soup,

652
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:37,686
fried pork cutlet, cold noodles...

653
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:39,476
- All of that? 
 - All of that?

654
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:56,126
What are you spying on now?

655
00:50:57,816 --> 00:51:00,476
It looks nice, (for) Sungyeol.

656
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,456
I can't believe the Ethics teacher is his mom.

657
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:04,646
Why didn't he say anything?

658
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,316
He doesn't like anything that makes him uncomfortable.

659
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:10,186
He doesn't like uncomfortable things, while you don't like annoying things?

660
00:51:10,186 --> 00:51:14,886
Usually, no one explains who their mom is. There's nothing weird about that.

661
00:51:18,526 --> 00:51:20,986
What is this expression of pity?

662
00:51:21,506 --> 00:51:24,726
I think it's great to have a family.

663
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:27,406
It depends on the family.

664
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:29,326
Your dad...

665
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:31,356
hasn't called yet. Right?

666
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:33,306
I don't have a dad.

667
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:38,856
Don't you want to find your mom?

668
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,836
I don't have a mom, either.

669
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:46,746
You know, Woohyun.

670
00:51:48,456 --> 00:51:49,856
I...

671
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:56,026
What is this expression like you are about to confess?

672
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:01,316
I... have something I didn't tell you.

673
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:05,706
Whatever I do or whatever I say,

674
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:08,246
you're going to believe me. Right?

675
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:11,216
I...

676
00:52:11,216 --> 00:52:12,956
actually...

677
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:20,336

678
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:28,196
♫  I hold her hand  ♫

679
00:52:28,836 --> 00:52:30,636
 Don't say anything.

680
00:52:30,636 --> 00:52:34,446
 Whoever you are or what you did before, I don't care.

681
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:36,416
 Just stay next to me.

682
00:52:37,806 --> 00:52:43,106
♫  ...along the river that sparkles in the sun  ♫

683
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:51,496
♫  Your scent that envelopes me  ♫

684
00:52:51,496 --> 00:52:59,756
♫  You and I, just us two  ♫

685
00:53:02,296 --> 00:53:08,586
♫  Under the clear, blue sky with white clouds  ♫

686
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:10,556
 Don't wait for me.

687
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:13,296
 Seulbi!

688
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:16,576
 But isn't there something weird about Lee Seulbi?

689
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:18,716
 We just need to find out what it is.

690
00:53:23,296 --> 00:53:25,426
 Transfer me to another school.

691
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:30,826
♫  ...with a bright face  ♫

692
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:34,126
 Don't come. Don't come closer.
