1
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:55,267
I can't live with a debt.

2
00:00:56,207 --> 00:01:02,707
Thinking about this, I think I'll have a lot of things I'll be sorry for about you.

3
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,887
Let's not do anything we'll be sorry for.

4
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:07,777
I need to lock up, so get out.

5
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,317
What's taking him so long?

6
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:40,907
Here he comes.  Here he comes.

7
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:42,687
Did you take care of it?

8
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,187
Let's go.

9
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,947
Let go.

10
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:29,477
Stand up straight. Your feet touch the ground.

11
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:40,917
Are you okay? Are you really okay?

12
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:44,897
In dramas, you have to breathe, "phoo," like this.

13
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,547
Hurry up and do it.

14
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:55,877
Earlier, the water was over my head (deep) for sure.

15
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:59,527
It's because you're sitting in the water. Can't you swim?

16
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:03,217
Hey, my nickname is seal.

17
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:06,367
Seals swim well, though.

18
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,507
But don't dogs swim well, too?

19
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,307
Woof, woof.

20
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:15,957
You little... You subtly diss people while acting like you don't know anything.

21
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:18,017
So embarrassing.

22
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,637
Wear this.

23
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,527
What about you?

24
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:38,767
Mine's newer. How can you make her wear something that smells?

25
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,687
You can't go home like that either.

26
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,857
Pretending like you're cool.

27
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:48,517
We'll change in the bathroom, so change in here.

28
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,357
Thank you.

29
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:12,817

30
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:29,257
Was it hard at school today?

31
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:34,827
Should I call in the troublemaking students and interrogate them?

32
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,427
It was okay.

33
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:41,557
Come here.

34
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,837
It's about Sungyeol...

35
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:54,537
I thought he was all grown up, but I didn't realize he'd still miss his mom.

36
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,667
It's his mom.

37
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,417
Of course, he'd miss her... forever.

38
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:06,337
And I'm sure Sungyeol's mom misses him a lot, too.

39
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,877
Let them see each other often.

40
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:20,307
I'm sorry... and thank you.

41
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,727
Do you remember this place?

42
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,837
Ah, right! Umbrella.

43
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,807
It was really cold that day.

44
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,337
Where do you live? I'll walk you home.

45
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:37,087
I live with him, way over there at the ddeokbokki pla-

46
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,067
Let's go. You're going the same way as me.

47
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,797
That's right! I can go with him.

48
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:45,007
Let's see each other often.

49
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,897
Hurry up and come, you piece of gum.

50
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,207
Look at you.

51
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:04,227
I really like these clothes. Where do they sell them? They're super comfortable and nice.

52
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:07,287
You can't buy them. They're super expensive.

53
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:10,957
Really? Why are humans' clothes so expensive?

54
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:14,747
You didn't, by any chance, jump in to try to save me, did you?

55
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:18,487
I did. I jumped in to save a seal that couldn't swim.

56
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,697
Hey!

57
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,527
You really can't swim?

58
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,137
I just didn't.

59
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:27,777
- Why not? 
 - Because I didn't feel like it.

60
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:31,227
Next time, even if you don't feel like it, swim. Like Umbrella.

61
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:36,937
I can swim well when I feel like it. I wasn't feeling well today.

62
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,307
Did you catch a cold?

63
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,527
Next time, don't jump into things so rashly.

64
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:50,257
But if you're in danger—

65
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:53,497
And you. Why do you giggle so much whenever you see Sungyeol?

66
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,897
Sungyeol? Umbrella's name is Sungyeol?

67
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:58,757
His name is also nice and cool...

68
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,867
There's no such thing as having a nice and cool name.

69
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,527
You're cool, too. Just your name.

70
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:05,437
Just my name? It's "also," too. 
  (T/N: he's saying he is as cool as his name.)

71
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:08,787
This names you perfectly. (Psycho)

72
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,507
Crazy—

73
00:07:38,117 --> 00:07:39,757
Good morning, Our Puppy!

74
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:41,667
Don't be silly.

75
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,697
What are you looking for?

76
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,367
My necklace.

77
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,447
Necklace?

78
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:53,157
Did you lose it? Where? How?

79
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:56,967
I don't know. Where in the world is it?

80
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:01,837
Stop looking for it and eat. I will buy you the same exact one.

81
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:06,067
Same one? How are you going to buy something that's one-of-a-kind?

82
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,497
Even if it looks the same, it won't mean the same.

83
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:12,527
When you lose something, you should just forget about it.

84
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:16,067
If you lose me, Grandma, are you just going to forget me?

85
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:17,857
How can you say things like that?

86
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:20,807
You said that family is something you shouldn't forget, even if you don't live together!

87
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,157
Woohyun!

88
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:25,867
That little jerk!

89
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:28,257
My goodness... My goodness...

90
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:32,387
He treasured it because his mom gave it to him.

91
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,997
He must be so upset.

92
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,437
His mom gave it to him?

93
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:39,567
Grandma.

94
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,867
Where on earth is it?

95
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,667
Are you very sick?

96
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:28,187
I'm not sick.

97
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:31,867
Please don't be sick, you'll make Woohyun worry.

98
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,387
Don't worry about it.

99
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:38,297
Go and rest a bit. You'll be tired when you work later.

100
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,267
I have to submit this by today.

101
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:57,707
Can you help Woohyun with his studies, too?

102
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,167
Woohyun isn't smart either?

103
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:03,067
No, it's just that he doesn't study. He would be smart if he did.

104
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,137
Do you want to go to school, too?

105
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:11,967
You can make new friends and regain your memories more quickly.

106
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,667
I'll go! To school!

107
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:33,447
Here are your transfer papers.

108
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,707
How did you know I was going to school?

109
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:40,867
Yes, that's right. I don't know certain things; but other than that, I know pretty much everything. So just accept it. Okay?

110
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:44,067
Give it here. We just need to trade papers.

111
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,387
You just doubted me, right?

112
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,337
You're doubting me...

113
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:55,407
Wow, you've become all human. Already doubting me and all.

114
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:59,287
Fine, fine. You're so cheap. I'll prove it to you.

115
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,687
- What does it say? 
 - Lee Seulbi...

116
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,367
- What's your name? 
 - Lee Seulbi.

117
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,267
Then this is yours, you little twerp.

118
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,187
It really is...

119
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:09,997
Give it to me. We just need to trade.

120
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:12,597
How do you know my name?

121
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:15,457
Why do you keep asking things? Just take it

122
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:18,377
Anyway, you need to have a good school life.

123
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,687
School, what I'm trying to say is, is a tough place,

124
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:24,017
but it's also fun.

125
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,357
Yes.

126
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:28,137
Ah, be careful of boys. Keep that in mind.

127
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,987
Boys? What are you trying to say?

128
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:35,167
I'm a guy, too. But guys are either kids or dogs.

129
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,487
Just be careful, huh?

130
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:40,467
Oh? Dear? Ah, oh dear? 
  (T/N: 애걔 means "Oh dear" like "Oh my")

131
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,227
Not "oh dear," but baby and dog. 
  (T/N: 애 - baby; and 개 - dog)

132
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:47,067
Baby like "wahh-wahh,"

133
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:53,837
and dog like "woof-woof."

134
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,047
Senior!

135
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,187
You came to see me?

136
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:06,787
Hey, I told you to be careful of guys.

137
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:18,467
If you keep talking to yourself like this, you're going to end up in a mental institution. Be careful.

138
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:25,037
What is he saying?

139
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:30,557
Humans are more interesting than we thought.

140
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:34,097
I guess you're okay with living as a human.

141
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:38,927
It's okay so far, thanks to the documents you prepared for me.

142
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:41,557
Why don't you continue living as a human if you're okay with it?

143
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,497
What nonsense are you saying?

144
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:46,687
I can't do anything about it until I find a way back.

145
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:49,587
Do you even want to return?

146
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,787
What do you mean?

147
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,867
Can you see me well?

148
00:12:54,867 --> 00:13:01,627
Why are you being like this? Are you saying I won't be able to see you as well, Senior?

149
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:05,687
It's normal for humans to be unable to see us.

150
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:08,067
But I'm not human.

151
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:12,137
I just became like this because I tried to save a human.

152
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:17,987
Whether it's because you wanted to save a human, or tried to become one. How would I know what you're thinking?

153
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:22,017
Senior.

154
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:58,657
I should've saved you before leaving yesterday, but I was running late for tutoring.

155
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:02,637
On that note, I'll buy some from you...

156
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:05,487
all of your place's ddeokbokki.

157
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,427
I guess you researched a lot about me.

158
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,287
I wonder if there'll be any left for you to eat.

159
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:22,287
Then, should I just chew you up nicely?

160
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,337
Eat this instead.

161
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:34,327
If you bother me one more time, I won't let you go so easily.

162
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:35,747
Understand?

163
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,287
Do you have a death wish?

164
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,887
I totally like you.

165
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:45,787
What to do? I totally don't like you.

166
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,867
Here, here. Everyone, sit down.

167
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,847
What are you doing?

168
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,287
Why are you here?

169
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:07,847
You introduce yourself quite interestingly.

170
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,667
Come here, introduce yourself.

171
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,387
I'm sorry, she came to the wrong place.

172
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,687
Hey, go...

173
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,207
- Shin Woohyun. 
 - Yes?

174
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:22,137
Do you know Lee Seulbi?

175
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:25,197
That... so... that is...

176
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,357
Yes, I live with Woohyun!

177
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,977
Wow, awesome!

178
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:30,357
Are you two like twins?

179
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:31,267
It's not that.

180
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,997
This is driving me crazy.

181
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:35,267
How dare you sway your tail?

182
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,777
You wag tails. 
  (T/N: means flirting)

183
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,077
We can't just leave her like this.

184
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:44,517
Shin Woohyun. Lee Seulbi. You two have different last names.

185
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:47,327
Are you guys cousins (by maternal aunt)?

186
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:50,907
Yes, well, it's just we have a situation at home.

187
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:56,847
Lee Seulbi, come here.

188
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:06,237
I'm Lee Seulbi, and I live with Woohyun.

189
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:09,587
Come visit our ddeokbokki place. I'll give you a lot.

190
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,987
And you!

191
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:16,287
Don't come. We have the right to refuse customers.

192
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,177
Please, Lord.

193
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:23,077
This teacher really loves ddeokbokki, too.

194
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:25,637
Please come, Teacher.

195
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:28,777
Is it fine if I sit with Woohyun?

196
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:31,987
Is she crazy?

197
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:34,987
Woohyun already has a partner.

198
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:39,787
Teacher, I'm okay with changing seats.

199
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,557
Hey, what's the matter?

200
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,777
Ini-ti-a-tion.

201
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,287
Ay, I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy.

202
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,637
Here.

203
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,267
Are you having a hard time?

204
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,077
It's not good to take so many medications.

205
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,747
You never know,

206
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:22,007
conversation can be a better treatment.

207
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:29,087
I will drink them both.

208
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:35,327
She's so cold. How did she marry twice?

209
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:38,227
I'm so jealous.

210
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,377
Nurse Oh!

211
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:43,877
They asked that you prepare the first-aid kit to take to the volunteering activity.

212
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:45,587
I already did.

213
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:48,717
- Coffee. 
 - Thank you.

214
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,887
Ah, how pretty.

215
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:55,157
Next time, I ask that you make it french-style.

216
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,967
French? Next time?

217
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,477
You definitely said "next time"!

218
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:09,627
- You know me, right? 
 - Of course.

219
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,237
I finished it. Here.

220
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:17,177
She's already acting as shuttle? 
  (T/N: shuttle - does whatever the bully wants)

221
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,217
How does she know Youngeun?

222
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:25,607
- If you order Seulbi to do things like this already... 
 - What? What about it?

223
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,557
Then, do you want to do it?

224
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:33,167
The person doing it can continue...

225
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,317
right?

226
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:37,767
Umbrella!

227
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,317
That little...

228
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:47,557
We're in the same class. Now, we'll really see each other often.

229
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:49,767
Oh, I guess.

230
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:55,417
This is really like a drama since you're also in the same class.

231
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:58,477
Just don't look.

232
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:14,917
Oh my, sorry.

233
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,547
Is this yours?

234
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,107
Ah, sorry.

235
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:35,987
You should be careful. Are you hurt?

236
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,617
Thank you.

237
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,067
Let's have fun today.

238
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:46,667
It'll be really fun today.

239
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,267
What is up with them? Those little girls.

240
00:19:56,127 --> 00:20:02,167

241
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,247
What are you doing?

242
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,667
Ah, she's bleeding. Look.

243
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,897
Woohyun...

244
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:53,357
Woohyun, it's not like that.

245
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:01,157
How dare those two dating? And during class, too!

246
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:03,847
Hey, what are you doing?

247
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:05,367
Huh?

248
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:17,057
Are you stupid?

249
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:19,297
All the kids are attacking you to harass you.

250
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,827
They're harassing me?

251
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,327
Me? Why?

252
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:23,587
This is driving me crazy.

253
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:27,277
If it hurts, just say so. Don't just smile like a fool.

254
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:32,127
It must be inconvenient for humans, seeing how you bleed so easily like this.

255
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:39,227
If you can't do anything right, then don't cause any trouble.

256
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,637
This is so uncomfortable.

257
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:47,577
Humans die if they can't breathe.

258
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:51,407
We don't die that easily, didn't you know?

259
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:53,187
Really?

260
00:22:58,017 --> 00:23:00,797
You two are dead.

261
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,247
How dare you ditch during class and date?

262
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,977
- Coach. 
 - Follow me!

263
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:09,267
You two will tidy up the library, clean the bathrooms, and volunteer on school grounds for one week.

264
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,287
Coach, it's not like that.

265
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:14,407
I'm going to add an hour to every word you say.

266
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:16,907
We'll finish it quickly if we work together, right?

267
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:18,267
Are you kidding me, right now?

268
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:21,867
Okay, ace. I'll take an hour and give you an hour more.

269
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,427
Teacher!

270
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:28,917
♫  It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days  ♫

271

♫  I don’t want to meet  ♫

275
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:47,027
Are you doing this because of me?

276

♫  I don't want to do anything. Even when I'm with my friends,  ♫

 How to Eat Well and Live Well.

285
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:22,017
Crazy pervert.

286
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,247
You smiled. You just smiled, right?

287
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:28,227
Be quiet. We're in a library.

288

♫  I'll be always loving you  ♫

289

00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:39,007
You didn't, right?

291
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,747
I don't need it.

292
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,547
What's the point in keeping something given by a person I can't even remember?

293
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:46,967
It's better this way.

294
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:52,347
I didn't need it anyway. I feel at ease now.

295
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,267
If you're upset, then say you're upset. Don't lie.

296
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,007
I'm not lying.

297
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:02,097
Then, why do I hear your lies?

298
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:03,727
It's weird. I keep hearing them.

299
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,507
You're even weirder.

300
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:08,687
Don't you ever touch my body again.

301
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,267
Clean all of this up.

302
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,297
I understand.

303
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:34,357
I thought crazy pervert was your style.

304
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:36,627
Let's go to the internet cafe.

305
00:25:37,477 --> 00:25:39,487
Oh! Seulbi!

306
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,317
You're not coming along, are you?

307
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:45,077
- I'll go separately. 
 - I can't go with you.

308
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,197
I'm going first!

309
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,807
I got fooled by that crazy pervert again.

310
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,307
Seriously.

311
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,297
Sorry. Continue with what you were doing.

312
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,187
Sorry.

313
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,337
Aren't you going to tutoring?

314
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:06,607
Are you crazy, thinking that I would go to tutoring?

315
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,467
There aren't that many days left before the test.

316
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:12,057
You can study all you want.

317
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:23,907
Why hide?  What did I do wrong?

318
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:27,227
Hey, you guys! Why are you bothering me?

319
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:34,967
I saw it in dramas, but the end for you guys isn't good.

320
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,927
Ah, should I warm up in a while?

321
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:41,447
I should've said that!

322
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:44,637
You're sorry, right? Apologize.

323
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:48,587
If you guys knew my identity then you wouldn't be able to bother me.

324
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,787
I warned you!

325
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:53,077
I am sorry.

326
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:02,177
Here! Catch!

327
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:04,767
Here!

328
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,267
I'm sorry!

329
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,387
I said not to run in the hallways!

330
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:16,047
I'm sorry.

331
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:18,027
I'm sorry.

332
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,877
What happened?

333
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:38,027
I'm trying to find something.

334
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:42,987
I think I lost it at the swimming pool, but the doors are locked.

335
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:45,017
Wait a little bit.

336
00:27:57,357 --> 00:28:00,027
- Teacher! 
 - Huh?

337
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:02,827
I forgot something at the swimming pool, please give me the keys.

338
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,227
Oh.

339
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:11,677
Hey, you!

340
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:13,677
All you do is study.

341
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:16,167
That's why you look so pale.

342
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:20,957
Go outside and kick some balls and feel the sunshine sometimes.

343
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:24,027
Studying isn't everything in your life.

344
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:26,097
Oh, isn't that right, Sukhoon?

345
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:30,137
I can kick balls and study well though.

346
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:32,357
I know!

347
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:33,927
I know...

348
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:38,417
But instead of being good at it, you need to put in all your effort.

349
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,367
If they do put in all their effort, then that's being good.

350
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:44,677
Well, that's true. But, Teacher,

351
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:47,397
this one student is always first place in his class.

352
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:51,757
Then there are problems with the other students, too.

353
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:56,937
Sukhoon!

354
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:59,697
You can get first with this test by doing your best.

355
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,557
Yes, I will definitely get first place.

356
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:03,307
- Fighting! 
 - Thank you.

357
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,117
Goodbye.

358
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:10,257
Affection for popularity rises from their inferiority.

359
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:13,587
Yes, that's right. Wait!  Where does it come out from?

360
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,267
Inferiority?

361
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,357
Is that necklace important?

362
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:32,937
Yeah.

363
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:35,587
Who gave it to you?

364
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:37,807
Your boyfriend?

365
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,427
No!

366
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:43,337
My mom.

367
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:45,507
When do they clean up here?

368
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:50,317
About once a month by taking out the water.

369
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,077
Ah, I can't breathe.

370
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:17,467
I don't like this feeling.

371
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,427
Are you sure this is where you lost it?

372
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:38,167
Maybe it's not here.

373
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,247
You said you need to go to your part-time job.

374
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:52,447
I keep being thankful to you. What's this?

375
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,017
Repay it.

376
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:55,867
How?

377
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,227
I'll think about it.

378
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,727
You can go first.

379
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,007
I'll leave after I return the key.

380
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:04,517
Thanks for that, too.

381
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:06,537
I'll go first!

382
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:36,487
Thank you!

383
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:39,507
Hey, is it Sungyeol's store or Woohyun's store?

384
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:40,987
Then should you call or should I?

385
00:31:40,987 --> 00:31:42,757
You call.

386
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:44,457
Ay, fine.

387
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:47,027
She can recognize your voice.

388
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:52,487
This is Miss Gong's Ddeokbokki, right?

389
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:54,347
Please bring two sets here.

390
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,727
Quickly! Quickly!

391
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,027
Lee Seulbi answered?

392
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,037
Yeah.

393
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:03,537
Is she really Woohyun's cousin?

394
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:06,247
What if she's lying so she can date Woohyun?

395
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,817
Impossible!

396
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:10,237
It'll be makjang then! 
  (T/N: makjang - a korean drama genre; the most dramatic kind)

397
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:16,147
Well, she looked close to Sungyeol. Maybe?

398
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:20,497
Hey! If that's true, then  that  would become the real makjang!

399
00:32:20,497 --> 00:32:22,927
If you order other food that's not from here, you're going to get in trouble with the boss.

400
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:25,147
Go eat it outside.

401
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,247
Before we get into trouble with the boss,

402
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,677
do you want to get hit by me?

403
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:37,007
Don't worry. We aren't going to eat it.

404
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,317
Did you not find the necklace?

405
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:11,197
Let's go.

406
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,317
Where?

407
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,787
How much are you going to play again today?

408
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:17,307
What did your opponents do wrong?

409
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:20,407
- You want one? 
 - No, I'm fine.

410
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:23,387
My jaw is getting wider these days.

411
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:27,757
♪ Hey, friend! Your heart is empty! ♪

412
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,177
♪ Me, my stomach is empty! ♪

413
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:32,247
♪ It's time for snacking! ♪

414
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:37,237
Let's go, hurry.

415
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:38,687
Hurry, stand up.

416
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:42,437
Hey, did you always die on purpose?

417
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,347
Ah, I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

418
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:48,817
I don't know what I want.

419
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:50,887
I want to eat two.

420
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:53,237
I don't have money.

421
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:55,387
This is more delicious!

422
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:58,287
Let's order this and this, and share.

423
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,167
Ah, really.

424
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:03,627
What else should we order?

425
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:16,117
Who ordered ddeokbokki?

426
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:19,037
Did you track me down?

427
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,377
What are those girls?

428
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:25,257
You deliver now?

429
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:27,137
She usually delivers.

430
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:28,437
Move! Why aren't you moving?!

431
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:30,507
Give it to me!

432
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,547
I said give it to me!

433
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:36,087
This girl!

434
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,357
What do you think you're doing right now?

435
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:41,017
What do you think both of you are doing?

436
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:43,897
Woohyun, are you okay?

437
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:46,197
What should we eat today?

438
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:50,367
I don't know, but can we avoid eating ramen?

439
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:54,577
My son always eats ramen. I don't understand how he doesn't get sick of it.

440
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:59,247
All right! Let's eat simply in American style today.

441
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:03,787
 Give it back!

442
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:06,287
Please give us the money.

443
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:08,177
What are you? Let go!

444
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,467
What do you think you're doing right now?

445
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:13,307
Do you have nothing else to do that you stole the kid's money?

446
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,647
Hey! Let go of me!

447
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,857
- I'm a detective. 
 - Let go!

448
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:21,747
I'm her father. Mind your own business and get back to your duties.

449
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:26,717
Please take him.

450
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:29,017
Hey! Are you crazy?!

451
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:30,767
I said I'm your father, you bitch!

452
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,297
Here.

453
00:35:37,987 --> 00:35:40,967
But is he really your father?

454
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,827
No, I don't know this person.

455
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:46,777
Business interference, abuse, violation of property; please make sure he gets charged for all of that.

456
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,517
As long as you can.

457
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:50,037
Do you know how I raised you?!

458
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:53,337
You could't feed me and raise me like others!

459
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:57,317
And you just earn all the money for yourself,

460
00:35:57,317 --> 00:36:00,717
so you can eat well and dress well by yourself.

461
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:07,967
I grew up by myself. I have no father.

462
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,777
Let's go.

463
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:12,027
I said that I'm this girl's father!

464
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:15,847
If we go and investigate, everything will be revealed.Let's go first.

465
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:19,977
Hey, how could you?! Let go!

466
00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:24,217
It's okay now.

467
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:33,557
If you're done watching, can you please leave?

468
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:35,257
No I.... You-

469
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:36,797
Kisoo, let's go eat ice cream.

470
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:39,007
Why? I want to eat a hot dog.

471
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:40,547
Let's eat hot dogs.

472
00:36:40,547 --> 00:36:41,797
Let's go.

473
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:44,687
Oh, then are you paying?

474
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:58,107
Did I do something wrong? She looked angry.

475
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:02,607
Oh yeah! I didn't get the money for the ddeokbokki.

476
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:05,987
It's okay. Don't get the money. I'll tell my grandma.

477
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:08,637
Why? Still...

478
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:12,257
Hello?

479
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:14,467
I'm Shin Woohyun.

480
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,707
Who?

481
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,997
Seulbi?

482
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:21,527
Tell me.

483
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:27,527
Hang up in ten seconds.

484
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,737
Sungyeol?

485
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:34,687
Really? No, I'll go there.  Hold on.

486
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:37,537
Where are you going?

487
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:40,487
I'm going to meet Umbrella.

488
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:43,157
Grandma told me to buy this. Thanks for the favor!

489
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:45,357
Hey! Seulbi!

490
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:47,737
It seems like she's going to meet an idol or something.

491
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:49,947
Three people...

492
00:37:49,947 --> 00:37:52,507
Oh my god! Is this a love triangle?

493
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:55,177
Don't bring random people into this!

494
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:04,747
What are you doing?

495
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:11,997
Eat this and rest before you continue. Make sure to take your vitamins, too.

496
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:16,147
This—

497
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:19,627
Why do you have this?

498
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,087
It's a friend's.

499
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:23,837
Friend?

500
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:26,997
Which friend?

501
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:31,727
Who is this friend?

502
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:02,627
Is this what you were looking for?

503
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:05,167
Yeah, it's this! How did you find it?

504
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:08,487
- I suffered a bit looking for this. 
 - I'm really thankful.

505
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:10,987
If you're thankful, buy a car.

506
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:12,447
Car?

507
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,587
I have some bad memories with a car.

508
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,477
Bad memories?

509
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:22,277
Yeah. Something like that.

510
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,797
Yes!

511
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:47,337
Oh no!

512
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:56,327
Yeah! Yeah! That's right!

513
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,467
Hey, step on it! More! More!

514
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:07,487
As expected, this brings trouble.

515
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:34,607
Here. I'm buying this for you.

516
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,247
Thank you for today.

517
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:46,727
I'm more thankful. I wasn't feeling well today.

518
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,597
Why? Was someone bothering you?

519
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:50,797
Tell me and I'll punish them for you!

520
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:53,457
So you can get in trouble, too?

521
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,547
Did you catch a cold?

522
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:02,667
You should take some medicine.

523
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:05,297
No, it's okay. I'll take it at home.

524
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:06,667
Are you going to be okay?

525
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:13,007
Of course! I'm totally strong! I've never had medicine.

526
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:16,317
How long are you going to stay at Woohyun's house?

527
00:41:16,317 --> 00:41:18,497
Until I find something.

528
00:41:18,497 --> 00:41:21,367
Why are you frequently losing things?

529
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:25,687
I guess I do.

530
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,777
I'll take you there.

531
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,677
No, it's okay. I can go quickly by myself.

532
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:32,617
Thank you!

533
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:38,427
She's really fast.

534
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,277
Hey! Try to catch me!

535
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:02,547
If I catch you, you're going to die!

536
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:05,637
What game are you playing? So childish.

537
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,817
Tofu...

538
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:18,067
Teacher!

539
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:23,397
Teacher, you can take it.

540
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,657
Woohyun, let's go. Your grandma said to come quickly.

541
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:28,637
Whoa, Teacher! Hello.

542
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,817
Eat it deliciously.

543
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,147
W-Wait a minute!

544
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:37,537
What's your name again?

545
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,127
I am Shin Woohyun.

546
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:46,277
Shin Woohyun?

547
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,807
Shin Woohyun...

548
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,837
When is Lee Seulbi coming?

549
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:30,797
Grandma! I'm extremely hungry.

550
00:43:30,797 --> 00:43:34,187
Welcome, sit here.

551
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:40,817
Why would you fill your stomach with ddeokbokki? A person should eat rice. Should I give you rice?

552
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:45,377
The only person who thinks about me is you, Grandma.

553
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:47,837
Welcome!

554
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:49,557
Teacher!

555
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:53,377
T-T-Teacher?

556
00:43:54,047 --> 00:43:58,507
After transferring,

557
00:43:58,507 --> 00:44:00,737
I never had time to come and visit you.

558
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,767
Hey, here! Here!

559
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:06,297
Hey, what kind of language is that towards your teacher?

560
00:44:06,297 --> 00:44:08,377
I'm sorry, Teacher.

561
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:11,297
You know who Teacher Phillip is, right?

562
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:16,357
Oh my! Teacher?! Are you?

563
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:20,227
- Oh my, what should I do? 
 - Just do as you usually do.

564
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:21,537
Okay?

565
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:25,107
No okay. No okay. Oh my goodness!

566
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:30,617
My goodness, look at my mind. I'll bring the food out, so sit down for a bit.

567
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,147
Sit down.

568
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,007
Are you helping your grandma by working?

569
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,087
I'm very proud.

570
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:49,817
The one and only grandson of grandma. And our school teacher.

571
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,357
Hello. I'm the newly transferred Shin Woohyun.

572
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,697
Okay...

573
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:57,717
You're really good looking.

574
00:44:57,717 --> 00:45:03,517
You look like that idol from that group "Infin-" I can't remember.

575
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:05,387
You are totally my style.

576
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:07,807
Thank you.

577
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:10,657
Why are all the teachers here like that?

578
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:12,447
So unfamiliar.

579
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:22,197
Thank you.

580
00:45:28,117 --> 00:45:30,187
Are you playing pass-the-spoon?

581
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:35,847
Are you making sure to eat the vitamins that I gave you?

582
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:37,407
Vitamins?

583
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,517
Oh, that? I'll give it to the music teacher.

584
00:45:41,517 --> 00:45:43,077
I don't need it yet.

585
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:47,507
Oh yeah, me too. Lately, I've been feeling down and my head has been frequently hurting.

586
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:51,127
Yes. Those who grow old by themselves are usually like that.

587
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:52,977
Try dating.

588
00:45:54,777 --> 00:45:59,717
Those who are getting old by themselves need more care.

589
00:46:04,747 --> 00:46:09,087
This mouth really made a problem, a problem.

590
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:13,207
Just because I said something doesn't mean our baby is going to get punished, right?

591
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:19,817
Miss Gong, I'm sorry.

592
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:25,087
Grandma's sorry, too. I didn't know your heart.

593
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:29,407
But wait. Why isn't Seulbi here yet?

594
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:31,027
Can you go out and find her?

595
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:34,947
Why should I? I guess she'll get here on her own.

596
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:38,307
Hwang Sungyeol, are you together with Seulbi?

597
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:39,957
Where are you?

598
00:46:41,947 --> 00:46:43,747
This is weird.

599
00:46:44,577 --> 00:46:47,017
What do I say when he asks why I called?

600
00:46:49,547 --> 00:46:52,777
Where is she and what is she doing?!

601
00:46:54,697 --> 00:46:58,327
Crazy Pervert, if you're going to be late at least call.

602
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:03,407
She doesn't have a phone, right? So frustrating!

603
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:29,487
Oh no, the necklace!

604
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:44,807
Here it is.

605
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:50,457
The necklace!

606
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:57,587
Seriously.

607
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:11,637
Please!

608
00:48:56,317 --> 00:49:00,487
What's wrong? And what have you been doing?

609
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:03,287
He left you alone when you're like this?

610
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:07,127
Tada! I found your necklace!

611
00:49:14,237 --> 00:49:17,437
Please don't lose it anymore. I'm tired.

612
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:20,107
- You— 
 - Aren't you glad I found it?

613
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:22,687
But Sungyeol...

614
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:30,447
Thank you.

615
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:38,367
What is this smell?!

616
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:43,447
Just where did you fall and come back out of?

617
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,247
How did you know that I fell in?

618
00:49:45,247 --> 00:49:47,507
Where did you fall into?

619
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:50,387
Don't tell me... you fell in love?

620
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,407
Huh? What?

621
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:55,457
If you're going to fall, fall in love.

622
00:50:05,397 --> 00:50:09,607
♫  It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days  ♫

623
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:13,817
♫  I’m still not used to this kind of life  ♫

624
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:16,707
♫  When I’m with you,  ♫

625
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:22,167
♫  the stars twinkle even during the day  ♫

626
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:25,797
♫  I don’t want to meet anyone else but you  ♫

627
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:28,817
 One, two, three!

628
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:31,487
 My Woohyun?

629
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,987
 Are you Woohyun?

630
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:34,637
 Is it you?

631
00:50:34,637 --> 00:50:38,387
 I'm not sure. He had two answer sheets.

632
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:40,887
 - I never asked for your help. 
 - I saw it.

633
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:45,317
 It can end up unfair for you if you get involved without evidence.

634
00:50:45,317 --> 00:50:48,467
 - No, don't come. 
 - I'll ask again.

635
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:50,237
 Who is it?
