1
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:55,112
Woohyun, it's not your fault.

2
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:59,492
What if he doesn't ever wake up?  What do I do?

3
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:05,812
He'll wake up. You're next to him, watching over him.

4
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:11,452
It should've been me who got hurt instead of Sungyeol.

5
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:17,072
You saved Sungyeol though.

6
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:21,112
That's right. It's not your fault, Woohyun.

7
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:33,972

8
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:53,532

9
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:10,022
That necklace...

10
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:19,612
You...

11
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,632
  For one day. No, just one hour,

12
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:33,512
  or even one second. If I could see you just once...

13
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:42,572

14
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:55,832
This is Heaven.

15
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:59,952
Hey, stop with your ideal woman search today and come to class, you punk.

16
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:04,742
The sun is nice, the wind is nice, they're all my ideal type.

17
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:08,682
So you be my representative today also, okay?  I'm busy so that's it for me.

18
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:09,822
 Oppa.

19
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,212
Yeah? It's Oppa.

20
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:14,892
Hey! Hey! Hwang Sungyeol! Hey!

21
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,342
Who could dissuade you?

22
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:24,262
Your ddeokbbokki is here!

23
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,662
I'm back.

24
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:37,802
What about Sungyeol?

25
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,412
He says that he has a date.

26
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,692
Hey, that's a skill, too.

27
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:47,072
How can he not miss one day and go on a date every day? He should take me with him at least once. Disloyal punk.

28
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,962
You still haven't been hit enough, have you?

29
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,402
I've been hit so much, for a minute I wasn't in my right mind for a moment.

30
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:57,062
Hey. Since Woohyun is here now, how about we go and watch a movie?

31
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,792
At the movie theater, let's give you the rest of the hits that you didn't get yesterday.

32
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:03,792
If possible, hit me with your lips.

33
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:07,502
Are you serious? Come here!

34
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,332
 Sell a lot.

35
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,702
Bye! Thank you!

36
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:15,772
Hey, leave it. I'll clean it. Go up and change first.

37
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:17,952
Where's Mom?

38
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:25,442
Does it make sense not to have a dream?

39
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:27,722
Even when I sleep, dreaming is annoying.

40
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:31,302
You guys can have everything turn out the way you dream.

41
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:34,222
We don't have money or support, and our bag straps will be short.

42
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,922
Our faces have no hope before doing plastic surgery.

43
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,392
We have to face reality.

44
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:43,092
You can buy bags with money you earn,

45
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:46,462
and you can buy bags with long straps.

46
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:50,422
- Look how pretty you are. 
 - Geez!

47
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,212
How annoying.

48
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:54,202
Geez?

49
00:04:56,932 --> 00:05:01,532
You guys who have not one dream are more irritating to me.

50
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:08,652
Here. Write in here until you find your dreams.

51
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:14,192
Even if things look dark in the beginning, eventually there will be a time when there's light.

52
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:17,432
What's she saying? Is the counseling session over?

53
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:26,332
Wow! Jackpot! They're so hot!

54
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:31,142
Don't you want to go to college with these Oppas?  You could go together with these Oppas.

55
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:35,252
Where do they go? I definitely want to go!

56
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,972
So, have a dream.

57
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,902
Sons, thank you for today also.

58
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:51,922
What are your hobbies?

59
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:58,772
Hm... Meeting girls, flirting, playing,

60
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,202
and breaking up with girls.

61
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:06,632
You're very honest. I like honesty.

62
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,182
I don't like girls without any intuition though.

63
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:14,172
Sorry!

64
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:20,872
Yeah, it's Oppa. Are you busy today?

65
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:44,972
Yeah, we're here for lunch. Let's go inside.

66
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:55,922
You didn't cause any accidents today? And you didn't break a cup?

67
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:59,872
I didn't break a cup but I spilled coffee on a customer.

68
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:02,262
Of course.

69
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,542
Your done, right? Let's go.

70
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:23,662
I haven't even eaten half of it yet!

71
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,932
You'll catch a cold.

72
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:18,472
It's acid rain so all your hair will fall out.

73
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:22,122
What's the reason that you held an umbrella so tightly in your hand and got rained on?

74
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:25,872
I seem crazy, right?

75
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:30,062
Yeah. And not only when you're drenched with rain either.

76
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:43,462
What do you plan on doing to me after giving me alcohol?

77
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,232
I'm going to attack you.

78
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:50,762
Want to try once? Come here. Try calling me "Big Brother" once.

79
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:56,652
- You're fooling around again. 
 - Call me "Big Brother, you punk. 
 - It hurts, you bastard."

80
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:58,892
Bastard?

81
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:05,022
Is it that hard to say that word? My birthday is earlier.  Of course, I'm the big brother.

82
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,782
Does it hurt that much? Your acting's improving.

83
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:15,302
Anyway, if you had said it earlier, you wouldn't have been hurt.

84
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:18,112
Big Brother.

85
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:22,422
What's the matter?

86
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:25,082
Brother, you want to see Seulbi, don't you?

87
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:33,212
You want to see Seulbi. Right, Brother?

88
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:50,692
Why'd you drink so much when you can't even handle it?

89
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,232
With your uselessly long legs...

90
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:59,532
Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki? "Ms. Gong?"

91
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,002
What kind of ddeokbokki place is named like this?

92
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,392
Still taking it for now.

93
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,832
 When you get this,

94
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,402
  to be there next to you and read the letter with you,

95
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:30,992
 I'm praying for that today, too.

96
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:35,862
 But even if I'm not by your side,

97
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:39,292
 even if we can't recognize each other,

98
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:42,872
 if we wear these necklaces, we'll meet again.

99
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:46,452
 And let's love each other from the start again.

100
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:49,552
  Goodbye. I'm Lee Seulbi.

101
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:52,522
 The one who loved Shin Woohyun a lot.

102
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:58,052
  Woohyun, have I said these words yet?

103
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:04,422
  I love you. Even in all the moments we won't remember,

104
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:06,752
  I love you, too.

105
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:41,922
After leaving me all alone, where did you go?

106
00:11:49,162 --> 00:11:51,582
I miss you, Seulbi.

107
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:16,072
You guys are really great. Did you go to college to drink?

108
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:19,682
These punks...

109
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:22,572
Why are you always next to Woohyun, huh?

110
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:25,542
You brought me back without dragging any of my arms or legs, right?

111
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:29,722
I cleaned the whole neighborhood with your legs. Spotlessly.

112
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:30,842
Annoying jerk.

113
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:33,462
This punk. Why are you acting like this towards your older brother?

114
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,722
Hitting his head with the spoon though?

115
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:46,142
 I'm unemployed now.

116
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:51,752
 I quit.

117
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:58,432
 I'll take good care of Sungyeol. It was an accident.

118
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:04,292
 From now on, I want to become a good father.

119
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:07,102
 To Sungyeol

120
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,392
 and to Woohyun.

121
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:20,802
You— Lee Seulbi?

122
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:25,132
Seulbi! Where did you go that you're only coming back now?

123
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:30,272
Lee Seulbi? My name is Cheon Sarang. 
 (T/N: Her name can be translated as Heaven's Love)

124
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:34,082
- Seulbi... 
 - I'm not being disqualified from the part-time job because my last name isn't Gong,

125
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:39,092
and because my name isn't Seulbi. Right?

126
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:43,022
I have to earn my school tuition and I'm behind on my boarding fees.

127
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,892
What are you talking about? Of course, you're hired.

128
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,462
Thank you! I'll work hard. What should I do first?

129
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,742
Seulbi!

130
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,542
Seulbi...

131
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:07,422
What are you doing right now?

132
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:13,412
Seulbi

133
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:18,132
Why is everyone doing this? Who is Seulbi?

134
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:28,252
I'm sorry... So why did you hug a person you don't know?

135
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,432
Your tears...

136
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:41,482
 Our Puppy's tears are really warm.

137
00:14:56,692 --> 00:15:00,572

138
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,462

139
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:19,472
What are these scribbles on the wall?

140
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:23,552
As a commemorative of my first day of work, I'll erase all of these cleanly.

141
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:26,292
It's someone's memories.

142
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,382
Even if you try, you can't erase memories.

143
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:34,872
That's great. I was wondering what I'd do if you asked me to erase them.

144
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:41,372
You're Umbrella from that time!

145
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:48,632
How did you know that I worked here?

146
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:51,852
Seulbi! Do you remember Sungyeol?

147
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:56,102
Oh, so his name is Sungyeol. Even his name is cool.

148
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,922
Hey. She's not Lee Seulbi.

149
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:16,102
Do you think Lee Seulbi would forget about me?

150
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:19,482
She doesn't remember me, so why would she remember you?

151
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:22,802
She's just a look-a-like. Her name's even Cheon Sarang.

152
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:26,502
No. I think it's Seulbi.

153
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:29,632
So you think she has amnesia or something?

154
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,362
Or not?

155
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:37,072
I don't know. I don't know.

156
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,242
You saved Seulbi. Because of you,

157
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:46,212
she didn't disappear from this world...

158
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:49,862
It's not the humans that lost their memory, it's Seulbi.

159
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,242
What are you going to do about Seulbi?

160
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,632
I can't let go of Seulbi.

161
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:57,692
You know now that there is love that doesn't change.

162
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,242
My love hasn't changed.

163
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:03,612
I want to stay like this even as Seulbi's guardian.

164
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:08,452
Woohyun is holding even Seulbi's pain all by himself.

165
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:12,662
So speaking of that, your love and Woohyun's love, of course,

166
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:15,182
even Seulbi's love, you're hurting so many people like this.

167
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:20,352
We're in this world to make humans happy.

168
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:25,812
Still, I wish that Seulbi would never remember.

169
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,702
Even if she doesn't remember, those two who have memories

170
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,412
will already be feeling it.

171
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:35,462
They're connected by an invisible thread, those two people.

172
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:41,522
Now she shouldn't be Cheon Sarang,

173
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:46,032
and you should let her go to live as Lee Seulbi.

174
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:15,602
Three, two, one... done!

175
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:18,282
My work time is over!

176
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:23,362
Oh, yeah, yes. You worked hard today. Be careful on your way back.

177
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:24,762
Are you going somewhere?

178
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,912
It's close.  It's in the neighborhood right in front.

179
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,592
Woohyun, go with her. Go together.

180
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:34,792
No, it's fine. I can go by myself. Don't worry.

181
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,572
Is that really Seulbi?

182
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:51,732
I don't know... The way she talks and her gaze looks just like Seulbi's.

183
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,952
She couldn't be putting on a show because she's sorry for showing up late, could she?

184
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:12,892
You live here?

185
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:16,002
Yeah. You didn't have to bring me.

186
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:19,522
I'm sorry for giving you trouble.

187
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:20,942
Am I uncomfortable to you?

188
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,592
It's our first time meeting each other.

189
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,292
First...?

190
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,122
Um, that person from before, Sungyeol...

191
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:35,472
Does he have a girlfriend? How old is he?

192
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,052
Why?

193
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:41,172
No, just... Since we have a owner/worker relationship,

194
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:43,832
it just seems like I should appear well in front of him.

195
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:47,422
Hey. You should try to look good in front of me first.

196
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:50,472
Goodbye.

197
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:54,072
But why are you speaking informally to me?

198
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:57,092
Isn't it a little rude to talk like that since it's our first time meeting each other?

199
00:19:57,092 --> 00:20:02,172
You can't do that when you just met someone.

200
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:04,062
How old are you?

201
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:05,862
What about you?

202
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,392
I'm 20 years old.

203
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,672
See, see, I knew it.

204
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,872
We're the same age, but you're an owner?

205
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:16,702
Reality is really unfair. One is a part-time worker

206
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,302
and the other is the owner.

207
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,422
Well, then you can speak casually, too.

208
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:26,222
You're not by chance going to fire me or cut my part-time wage. Right?

209
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:31,552
The fairest thing in this world seems like age.

210
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,232
I'm Shin Woohyun.

211
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,862
I'm...

212
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,732
Cheon Sarang.

213
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,492
Why are you not going in?

214
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:53,152
Brother, this is my boss.

215
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:56,772
Go on in. It's cold.

216
00:20:57,362 --> 00:21:00,562
I'll see you tomorrow. (formal speech) I'll see you later! (informal)

217
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:09,472
Brother?

218
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,032
You met Seulbi, right?

219
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:32,062
As expected... it is Seulbi.

220
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:36,562
If you knew it was going to happen, why didn't you say anything?

221
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:40,262
We needed time for everything to go back to normal.

222
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:42,832
Waiting is also a form of love.

223
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,202
Seulbi can't remember anything.

224
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:52,932
Probably. There was an accident when she was trying to protect you.

225
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,392
Accident?

226
00:21:56,122 --> 00:22:01,152
On the day of the accident in order to watch over you, Seulbi sacrificed herself.

227
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:04,432
Seulbi and another being came and saved you.

228
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:06,962
Another being?

229
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:10,962
Then... perhaps, that brother of hers...

230
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,762
Yeah, he's a guardian angel.

231
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,432
Another angel that became a human.

232
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:25,042
Then... will Seulbi ever remember?

233
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:28,462
Well... I only know up to there.

234
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:33,532
We should just hope that your love for Seulbi brings back her memory quickly.

235
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:51,342
Is there something on my face?

236
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:54,032
What? Yeah...

237
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:55,492
What is it?

238
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:59,602
Familiarity. It's definitely a face I've seen before...

239
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:02,442
Your face is covered with familiarity.

240
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:06,252
It's me! Me! Kisoo!

241
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,702
Ahh...

242
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:11,532
Oh! Yeah! Do you remember? You remember me, right?

243
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:15,262
Leader of deliveries? That Kisoo? 
  (T/N: Ki Soo means leader, flag bearer in Korean)

244
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,542
When did you start working part-time here?

245
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,252
Hey, don't joke around. You're going to make me sad.

246
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:22,422
Are you the boss's friend?

247
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:25,232
They pay you your part-time wage on time, right?

248
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,212
I thought he would give a lot of work though...

249
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:31,162
Seulbi... what happened?

250
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,152
You're here early. Should I make you ddeokbokki?

251
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:39,662
Sweet and spicy ddeokbokki that will raise your spirit?

252
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:41,692
Do you remember now?

253
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,342
Memory. Memory!  Memory!!

254
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:46,842
Do I have to remember something?

255
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,532
Sorry...

256
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:52,702
But don't be like that, it's uncomfortable.

257
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,602
Really?

258
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:59,742
Sungyeol? Why is she like this?

259
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:03,732
Woohyun! Oh, our Woohyun.

260
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:16,722
It's not good if you overfill the cup.

261
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,432
Perhaps, do you like guys?

262
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,582
I'm respecting Woohyun.

263
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,762
And does he acknowledge that respect?

264
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,712
She really doesn't recognize me.

265
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:36,692
She forgot your love?

266
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,612
Why would she forget that kind of thing?

267
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:43,032
Well, it doesn't amount to any money.

268
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,352
What are you saying?

269
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:47,162
When she sees Sungyeol, her eyes shine with hearts.

270
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:50,152
The sense of betrayal is huge.

271
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:53,562
Won't her memory come back if she gets hit in the head?

272
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:56,702
In the movies and dramas that always happens.

273
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,862
I'll try it. I'm good at that kind of thing.

274
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,932
Hey. Calm down your girlfriend.

275
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,202
Eat.

276
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,402
Besides that, isn't there another way?

277
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:09,262
We just have to find her memories.

278
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:12,902
Hey, do you have a good plan?

279
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:16,592
Didn't we gather here to find that?

280
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:18,762
You just eat.

281
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:21,982
Can you not go to your part-time today?

282
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:23,932
I have a fever...

283
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:28,112
You have a fever because you drank too much.

284
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:30,432
Is your part-time important or am I more important?

285
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:33,192
- Part-time. 
 - What?

286
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,092
Are you being serious?

287
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,362
Yeah...

288
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:44,062
Why are you fine saying such a thing like that to me?

289
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:48,472
Enough to not hesitate once,

290
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,902
am I nothing to you?

291
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:54,622
Why are you getting angry?

292
00:25:55,542 --> 00:26:00,002
Even one time, you could hold onto me.

293
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:05,602
You should ask me at least once...

294
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:07,912
why I want to be with you.

295
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,052
You, who gets fooled every time, really...

296
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:34,842
How can you not be surprised once? So pettily.

297
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:38,022
Your work isn't too hard? And the boss treats you well?

298
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:41,392
The boss' gaze bothers me a bit.

299
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:45,042
- His gaze? 
 - Sometimes he looks at me really tenderly,

300
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,812
but most of the time he looks at me really sadly.

301
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:51,862
It sometimes seems like he's earnestly telling me something.

302
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,842
 They're connected by an invisible thread, those two people.

303
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:58,842
I have a lot of reports to do. I think I'll have to stay up all night.

304
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:01,762
Hey! What are you doing?

305
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:04,292
This will fall down like this. Let's get rid of this immediately.

306
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:05,832
Wait!

307
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:09,032
Between people who love each other, with the thought of locking their love,

308
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:11,782
it's our store's emblem. Don't you remember this?

309
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:13,822
Ah, that complaint about my memory.

310
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:19,782
You're talking about memories and thoughts of something that happened, but I'm really seeing you for the first time.

311
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,422
And saying that love doesn't change just by this kind of thing?

312
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:26,102
Then, why do couples in this world always break up?

313
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:29,202
Of course, love changes. Have you never dated?

314
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:31,172
Have you ever dated?

315
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:34,292
Do I have to? Dramas show all of it.

316
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:36,252
- Move! 
 - Hey, no.

317
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:38,372
If you don't want to be fired, let go.

318
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:41,582
Why do you always so pettily threaten a person with their way to pay their bills?

319
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:44,562
Then, why don't you take this off? It doesn't match anything.

320
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:47,212
Just try taking it off. You'll definitely be fired.

321
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:50,382
You're such a petty human boss, really.

322
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,582
That complaint about humans...

323
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,712
You must've locked your memory in here, too.

324
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:19,212
I lost. I lost again.

325
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:23,112
How do you not contact me even once?

326
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:26,382
You didn't go to school?

327
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:32,672
You had taken leave again, without permission.

328
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:40,392
If I can just earn this year's school tuition, I think I'll be able to cover the next year somehow.

329
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:45,902
Today is weird... all the customers ran away.

330
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,962
I rented the whole restaurant for an hour.

331
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,442
Do you want to show off your money in front of me right now?

332
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:58,742
I can't see your face for even one hour each day because of your part-time jobs.

333
00:29:58,742 --> 00:30:02,292
If you have the money to spend then donate that instead.

334
00:30:02,312 --> 00:30:05,122
Get out immediately.

335
00:30:08,712 --> 00:30:10,382
What's the matter?

336
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:16,582
This is the money I earned doing jobs with you.

337
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,792
Are you showing off your money?

338
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:29,042
I thought what I'd gathered with you was money but it was memories.

339
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:35,212
Use this money. And go back to school.

340
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:42,712
Get up.

341
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,782
I don't need it.

342
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,362
I'll do it by myself. I did it well by myself up till now.

343
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:59,962
All this time I was by your side.

344
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:06,332
You...  Where are you going?

345
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:12,102
For the two years that I'm gone, don't have a hard time.

346
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:18,212
Lean on the money instead of me...

347
00:31:19,832 --> 00:31:25,362
and wait for me. Even if you are just sorry for me.

348
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:31,332
Are you going to the military?

349
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:43,612
Don't smile at another guy,

350
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:48,532
and sit in the furthest corner in the library,

351
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:53,952
and cover your face with a hat whenever.

352
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:57,642
Understand?

353
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:14,002
Did you know how hard it was waiting? Don't cry.

354
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:19,712
You bastard.. You jerk!

355
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:28,952
If you don't wait for me... I guess I'll wait for you,

356
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:32,082
until you come back to me.

357
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,692
I'll wait.

358
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:50,182
Don't hurt. My partner for life.

359
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,882
Be careful to lock the door and live well, Seulbi.

360
00:33:55,882 --> 00:34:00,042
In the end, I couldn't open the door to your heart.

361
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:06,542
Sorry for making things hard.

362
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:31,482
Are you going somewhere?

363
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:33,552
It's time for me to go now.

364
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:38,132
Please take care of... Seulbi for me.

365
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:52,102
Thank you for saving Seulbi.

366
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,132
Since it's your love that saved Seulbi,

367
00:34:55,132 --> 00:35:00,252
her memory will return.

368
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:06,962
Even when she was with me, Seulbi was always with you.

369
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:27,462
I'll love Seulbi even more.

370
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:49,412
I'm late because of you—

371
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:13,352
My eyes keep on sweating and I keep chopping onions.

372
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:24,532
I'm sharing my know-how because you're so dirty.

373
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:26,992
I don't know why but it seems like these words are familiar.

374
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:29,752
Thank you.

375
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:34,482
It's because it's not Seulbi.

376
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:37,502
What do you see? It looks like Seulbi though.

377
00:36:37,502 --> 00:36:40,712
Seeing how she is interested in me, I know it's not Seulbi.

378
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,752
Seulbi only sees Woohyun.

379
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,042
Don't look at me like that!

380
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:50,662
She's not my type anymore. My type changed completely.

381
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:53,112
You have about 100 types, don't you?

382
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:57,082
No. About 1,000 probably?

383
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,922
Go! What is he saying?!

384
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:16,132
Kids, these days, have no rules. Don't you know you aren't supposed to take money from graduates?

385
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:19,172
- Do you know what it's like to study for another year in college? 
 - What is he even saying?

386
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:22,292
- What? 
 - Wait, wait, wait!

387
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,852
Hey, give me your wallet.

388
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:29,282
Are you crazy? Get out of my sight.

389
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:32,152
Yeah, right...

390
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:35,962
- Look at these kids... Back in the day, I was..... 
 - Hey, grab him.

391
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,252
Hey, let me go!

392
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:41,582
Let me go!

393
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:57,752
What is this?

394
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:01,352
Kids, these days... If you touch them, you will be in trouble. You didn't know that?

395
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:03,042
I wasn't THAT bad.

396
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:07,252
Wow... You guys are so selfish.

397
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:12,882
A loser dating... What the heck?

398
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:16,392
What's with his attitude?

399
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:19,402
- I did better at English than him. 
 - Really?!

400
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:22,062
How did your audition go?

401
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,632
It's fine. Just go next time and audition again.

402
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:30,922
If you practice a lot, it improves your skill. Right?

403
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:36,302
- They said to come and practice! 
 - Really?

404
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:40,352
I knew you'd make it!

405
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:51,172
It's not easy to eat and live, right?

406
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:57,102
It's not easy but it's fun. It feels like I'm really living.

407
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:03,662
You! You! That stare looks like you're trying to make a girl fall for you.

408
00:39:03,662 --> 00:39:05,702
Huh? Me?

409
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:08,492
Seeing how you're embarrassed perhaps it's for real?

410
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:11,622
I saw it in a drama. I'm a drama fan.

411
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:13,612
I know.

412
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:18,982
You know? How? Do you stalk me?

413
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:39,672
 Wow, you're really good at this! I don't think I can do it...

414
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:51,002
I do this all the time. You're going to fall, so always tie your shoelaces.

415
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,622
When you fall hold my hand.

416
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:57,742
Then you'd fall over, too.

417
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:02,162
If we fall together, it's less embarrassing and we can get up together.

418
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:06,832
Then I guess I can't fall. You shouldn't get hurt.

419
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:08,832
Why?

420
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:13,722
Because you're my boss and source for grocery money.

421
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:22,832
 So I am somewhere in your memory.

422
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:30,672
I could've come alone but thanks for today.

423
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,922
That necklace...

424
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:41,392
I don't know when I had that necklace, but it's like a part of me.

425
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:44,982
They say it's a necklace that leads you to someone you loved again.

426
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:49,922
Again? Then they're saying I'm going to meet someone I've already met?

427
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:54,032
But I want to fall in love with someone new... I guess I should take this off.

428
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:56,832
N-No! It'll also let you meet new people.

429
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,282
Really?

430
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:01,172
But you have something like this, too, don't you?

431
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:07,452
There are a lot of people who believe in that. It's all fake.

432
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,632
I'll see you tomorrow.

433
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:13,202
Okay... Bye!

434
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:27,242

435
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:53,332
 It doesn't matter if you're the old Seulbi or the new one.

436
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:58,182
 Just like it didn't matter if you were a human or angel .

437
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,632
 Just stay next to me.

438
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:28,502
Yes! Two came out! I got two!

439
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:30,652
Congrats.

440
00:42:30,652 --> 00:42:34,082
My brother got a job and left, so there's a lot to celebrate.

441
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:37,662
I have a feeling that something really good is going to happen today.

442
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:41,792
Saying what other people say, you still have that habit.

443
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,232
The world must be small for me to be going to the same school as you.

444
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:48,292
- So you don't like it? 
 - There's nothing to like.

445
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:52,062
Those looks... They make me feel like I'm guilty or something.

446
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:54,372
At this school, I'm pretty popular.

447
00:42:54,372 --> 00:43:00,022
If it's singing then singing. Dance then dance. Sports then sports.

448
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,432
Hey!  Let's go together!

449
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:05,292
I still have more things I'm good at!

450
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,862
 Please try it.

451
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:11,252
 Say it, Oppa. OP-PA.

452
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:18,252
One minute.

453
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:24,102
Hey. I'm against you showing up all the time. You're not my style.

454
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,702
It's not like I'm asking you to do anything.

455
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:29,132
- I can't have a one-sided crush? 
 - No, you can't.

456
00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:32,372
Why? Why can't it work? It's my heart.

457
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:34,772
Woohyun lived to protect you.

458
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:38,202
You and I always made him wait.

459
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,972
If you won't find your memories then get lost from my sight.

460
00:43:47,182 --> 00:43:50,882
Good job. You're cool, Hwang Sungyeol.

461
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:53,982
 Yeah, it's Oppa.

462
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:57,552
Bad Umbrella. Fall over! Yap!

463
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,892
Teachers!

464
00:44:35,892 --> 00:44:38,732
Ah, say hello, Mr. Chun. These are the other teachers.

465
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:40,062
Ah, yes.

466
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:43,592
Hello. I am the new Literature teacher, Cheon Changjoo.

467
00:44:43,592 --> 00:44:49,482
Ah, yes-yes.  You look like someone who is from a different world than us.

468
00:44:49,482 --> 00:44:53,852
Finally, we have our F4. 
  (T/N: Referring to Boys Over Flowers and the 4 most good-looking men in school)

469
00:44:53,852 --> 00:45:01,602
Director Lee, me, Literature Teacher, and... Let's just make it F3 instead.

470
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:10,102
There is no need to worry. He is a good person, just accept him.

471
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:15,122
You are the teacher with style so Goo Junpyo. 
 (T/N: Referring to Boys Over Flowers again, Goo Junpyo was the leader of F4)

472
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:21,582
Oh my god, Goo Junpyo!

473
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:25,212
It's a good thing that I wore this new jacket.

474
00:45:25,662 --> 00:45:28,132
Goo Junpyo!

475
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:17,222
What is it that I'm forgetting?

476
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,742
Does it hurt since I can't remember?

477
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:34,252
It hurts waiting.

478
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:38,192
Then... is it bad being alone?

479
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,532
It's not a bad thing.

480
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:42,712
It just hurts.

481
00:47:43,262 --> 00:47:47,272
I told Sungyeol... but it was a bong. (fail)

482
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:50,942
Really?

483
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:53,392
It's okay.

484
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:56,602
But that's my first confession.

485
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:35,922
You are really!

486
00:48:54,552 --> 00:49:03,582

487
00:49:13,302 --> 00:49:17,352
 Lee Seulbi, just stop and come to me.

488
00:49:22,032 --> 00:49:25,862
 What I'm saying is... The truth is...

489
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:34,152
 It's my first necklace.

490
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:37,762
 It's a miracle necklace that helps you meet the one you're destined to meet.

491
00:49:37,762 --> 00:49:40,952
 So we can never be apart.

492
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:54,592
I'm sorry...

493
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:05,642
for getting angry at you.

494
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:09,502
It's getting late. Go and rest.

495
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:17,172
Our Puppy.

496
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:50,482
I... I...

497
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:56,442
I'm sorry for remembering so late.

498
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:58,502
Seulbi!

499
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:15,172
I'm sorry for making you wait.

500
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:18,992
I missed you.

501
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:25,582
I really missed you.

502
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:07,942
- Sorry! 
 - You little rascal.

503
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:09,362
Geez.

504
00:52:09,362 --> 00:52:11,282
Woah, now we're all here.

505
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:14,982
Let's cheer for Seulbi (remembering).

506
00:52:14,982 --> 00:52:17,802
Cheers!

507
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:18,702
Congratulations!  Congratulations!

508
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,882
Hey, try and lose your memory once more. It's enough with me not remembering.

509
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:29,222
Hey. It's not that you don't remember, it's because you don't have a brain.

510
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:31,942
What's my Christmas present?

511
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:33,352
That...

512
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:34,602
I'm fine with just you.

513
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:38,872
Ahh! Seriously. So cheesy. Don't go overboard!

514
00:52:38,872 --> 00:52:41,402
Your present, uh...

515
00:52:41,402 --> 00:52:43,262
Me!

516
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:45,992
- Enough. Don't go overboard. 
 - Ah.. Don't be like this!

517
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:47,682
Here! Merry Christmas!

518
00:52:47,682 --> 00:52:49,892
Merry Christmas!!

 We met again like fate and fell in love.
