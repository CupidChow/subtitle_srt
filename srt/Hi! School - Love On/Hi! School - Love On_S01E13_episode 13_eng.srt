1
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:39,483
Woohyun... about this...

2
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,423
I'm your son?

3
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,773
Woohyun...

4
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:47,353
Teacher, you are Sungyeol's mother.

5
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:54,893
Seulbi, did I hear it wrong?

6
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,913
I'm sorry. I'll explain.

7
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:02,483
No, don't say anything.

8
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:09,593
There was a situation. That's why I couldn't tell you.

9
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,823
It's unbelievable, but...

10
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:21,083
I'm... I'm your mother.

11
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:28,283
I don't have a mother or father.  Move out of the way.

12
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:34,123
I have to greet my grandmother,

13
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,283
please leave.

14
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:51,623
Ms. Gong, have you been well?

15
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:55,023
I miss you.

16
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:01,513
Why do these kinds of things happen to me?

17
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,933
Grandma,

18
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:09,823
please say something.

19
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,373
To me, Grandma

20
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,273
is both my mother and father.

21
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,783
The weather's great.

22
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:05,303
 Your smile hurts.

23
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:13,143

24
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:23,113
 Don't come any closer!

25
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,933
  Aren't you curious about your mother?

26
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,243
He knew it all.

27
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,663
What am I to you?

28
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:57,133
Until when are you going to keep hiding things?

29
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,493
Do you feel deflated because I found out first?

30
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,813
I think so.

31
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,933
I haven't changed.

32
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,843
I don't care whose son you are.

33
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:10,333
It matters to me. Why does your mom have to be my mom?!

34
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,023
I don't need a mother.  So just take care of yours.

35
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:15,783
I came to say that.

36
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:18,083
Are you saying you don't need her cause she's your birth mom?

37
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,573
If you need her, you can have her, crybaby!

38
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:26,473
They say that you can't deceive bloodlines...

39
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:29,533
you're the same as your mom when it comes to acting fake.

40
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,003
Tell me again.

41
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,923
Now, I'm tired of getting involved with you.

42
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,973
Your mom's sick. Look after her.

43
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:14,153
I have a stakeout. I'm requesting it from you.

44
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:20,103
Are you sick, too? You don't look well.

45
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,623
I'm hurting.

46
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,773
So much I could die.

47
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:32,173
There's no fever.

48
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:34,473
It must be because we're between seasons.

49
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,263
- Dad... 
 - Take your medicine well.

50
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,733
Take your medicine and rest.

51
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,753
I have to go.

52
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:02,723
Why does it have to be that woman?

53
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:05,283
Why does it have to be Woohyun's mom?

54
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:42,093

55
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:52,643
 This is all I received so this is all I can throw out.

56
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,853
What are you doing?

57
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:21,563
When you're having a hard time and fall, I want to catch you.

58
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:23,803
I don't think I can hold it.

59
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,583
Why?

60
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,153
If I hold you, you'll fall with me.

61
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:35,163
What's wrong with falling down together? It's less embarrassing and we can get up together.

62
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:40,313
Okay. Our Seulbi shouldn't hurt so I'll make sure not to fall.

63
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:43,483
- Woohyun. 
 - Let's go. We'll be late.

64
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:49,063
You don't pick up your phones. You aren't appearing.

65
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:50,513
You don't want to do it?

66
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,923
It's not that I didn't go, I couldn't go.

67
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:57,003
As soon as I came out... my dad... smack!

68
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,693
And you?

69
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:04,453
I slept because I was tired.

70
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:13,643
Because you're so honest, my fist wants to be honest as well.

71
00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:18,033
Were you playing games all night? You didn't answer the phone.

72
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:23,033
I'll look over this once. Everybody makes mistakes.

73
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:27,083
Partner! Our homeroom teacher wants you for a moment. Hurry!

74
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,163
Be careful.

75
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,443
You have ketchup on you.

76
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:06,533
You don't need to go to our homeroom teacher. I lied.

77
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,123
I know.

78
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:12,113
How did he know?

79
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,613
Was it nice being alone with Seulbi? Did she use her powers?

80
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,733
Does she teleport?

81
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:29,243
I will let you spend quality time with Seulbi and make Shin Woohyun mad.

82
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:32,023
Shouldn't you be thankful to me?

83
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:38,453
Did you two plan this?

84
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:44,363
Keep going if you have the confidence to not hurt yourself while hurting me.

85
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,213
Seulbi can't be in between our problem.

86
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:57,223
I feel like something fun is going to happen between you two.

87
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:00,683
Wouldn't the kids find the relationship between you and me more interesting?

88
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:06,623
There's something going on between those two. I'll find out what it is.

89
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:11,463
Find what out? Pick your nose? 
  (T/N: Can mean both digging your nose or digging information)

90
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:14,253
Before you dig your grave, dig through your studies first.

91
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:17,943
Become a human oil well, drilling until the oil comes pouring out.

92
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,703
Jaeseok.

93
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,933
Why have a birthday party when it's not even your birthday?

94
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:24,753
I suddenly wanted to. Gather everyone.

95
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,383
Youngeun knows your birthday.

96
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:29,793
It doesn't matter. I'm not going to invite her.

97
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:33,113
Did you forget that Youngeun is the "best" now?

98
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:37,413
I'll take care of everything myself. You just gather everyone.

99
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:43,183
That thing... seriously.

100
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,523
Since when were you close with Yena?

101
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:51,943
The affection was enough to raise goosebumps.

102
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,383
Why did you two break up to torture me?!

103
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,973
Those things... really...

104
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:11,363
Some group project... geez.

105
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:17,733
♫  I want to be your star. Every day I miss you so much  ♫

106
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:26,213

107
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:33,043
♫   Everything will become different  ♫

108
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:38,673
♫ If you wanna be my love...  ♫

109
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,083

110
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,603
I marked all the essential points.

111
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:55,253
I did my part so you do the rest.

112
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,343
That's a good way to do it.

113
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,913
I'll mark the essential points and send them to you.

114
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:10,223
Then I'll organize.

115
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,773
Why aren't you leaving?

116
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,083
I'll leave.

117
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:28,673
Give me that. I need to send it to Sungyeol.

118
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,893
Say it, "Please give it to me."

119
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:42,713
Say it, "Please... give it... to me."

120
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:43,783
Please give it to me.

121
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,353
No feeling.  Say it again, cutely.

122
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:51,063
Please, give it to me~

123
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,413
I shouldn't have asked.

124
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,573
Would you give it to me?

125
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,683
Don't do that anywhere else, okay?

126
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,233
Why are you mad?

127
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,313
Why does he listen to music all day?

128
00:13:44,343 --> 00:13:46,973
I don't want to see him having a hard time.

129
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:32,083
Woohyun!

130
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,163
Hello.

131
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:39,263
You're quite diligent. You're working so hard.

132
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:43,823
What? Do you have something to say?

133
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:47,633
No, then I'll be leaving.

134
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:54,443
Sungyeol seems depressed. Is something going on?

135
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,883
They had an argument, I bet.

136
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:05,593
It must be true.  You two had a fight.

137
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:08,073
It would be weird if they didn't argue.

138
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,963
At the age when they're hot-blooded and they punch each other and that's how they know they're alive.

139
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,623
It's a good time.

140
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,403
Then, I'll be leaving.

141
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,753
I think he's the one who won.

142
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:33,383
What happened between those two?

143
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,903
Woohyun must have been hurt.

144
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:56,703
♫   An autumn joy   ♫

145
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:03,183
♫   That wouldn't even dance    ♫

146
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:11,083
♫   It seems like it would be chilly    ♫

147
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:17,083
♫   You're the one wearing short clothes   ♫

148
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:25,883
♫   After the season passes   ♫

149
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,483
It is not Woohyun's fault.

150
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,203
♫   The sunlight that is warm today  ♫

151
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:32,963
And it's also not your fault.

152
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:37,373
It must have been shocking and hard for you, but Woohyun feels the same.

153
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:41,023
So? Do you want me to comfort Woohyun?

154
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:43,343
That's a problem the adults chose.

155
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:48,153
There was nothing you guys could've done. If you think of it nicely,

156
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:52,503
- you were truly friends and now... 
 - We're worse than strangers.

157
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:59,963
Woohyun and you were really nice to look at.

158
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,723
You can only see Woohyun, right?

159
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,593
If you keep doing this, you don't know what I'll do.

160
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:10,373
Don't do that. After hurting Woohyun, you're hurting as well.

161
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:16,063
We're not friends nor family, so is it okay if I steal you now?

162
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:19,813
- What are you talking about? 
 - Did you forget that I'm going to steal everything?

163
00:17:19,813 --> 00:17:23,613
If you provoke me like this, I'll do it faster and more forcefully.

164
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:26,923
I'm going to take everything from Woohyun.

165
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:28,633
Sungyeol, please!

166
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:31,843
So don't mention Woohyun in front of me again.

167
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:36,763
♫   The sunshine that is warm today  ♫

168
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:43,133
♫   Spring came  ♫

169
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:49,523
♫   And you are also in front of my eyes  ♫

170
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:57,053
♫   You gaze at me  ♫

171
00:17:57,053 --> 00:18:00,903
♫   I'm looking back at you   ♫

172
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:08,293
♫   I think that I won't have enough breath   ♫

173
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:11,863
Ms. Gong,

174
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,083
please don't let anyone get hurt.

175
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:22,233
♫   Like this    ♫

176
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,123
♫  I look at you  ♫

177
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:32,753
  I invite everyone to Yena's birthday party.

178
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:35,863
 The location is Ms. Gong's Ddeokbokki. The food is on me,

179
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:38,783
 and the newest smartphone will be up for lottery!

180
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:41,433
Unlimited ddeokbokki. Awesome!

181
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:42,613
Let's go.

182
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:45,563
Hey, hey, hey! It's time for you to change your phone, right?

183
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:46,533
Let's go, too.

184
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,773
You guys go yourselves, like poor jerks.

185
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:53,993
Oh, he's really...

186
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:57,043
Free is good, that's what my dad says.

187
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,503
Let's go. Let's go. Huh?

188
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:08,073
It's a scene that I'm so sick of that I'm not even that surprised.

189
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,723
It's something I gave your grandmother every month.

190
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:14,483
Because your grandmother passed away, giving it to you is certain.

191
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,983
You didn't use any of that money.

192
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:22,273
She eventually used it on repaying my father's debts.

193
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:25,733
You're too young to earn a living salary.

194
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,983
Seulbi as well.

195
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,453
Why is she with you?

196
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,123
Don't worry about Seulbi.

197
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,953
The thing you need the most right now is money.

198
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:37,503
How are you going to live?

199
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:40,423
It's normally an age when love and attention are needed,

200
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,513
to a teenager like me.

201
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:47,853
Teacher, I won't ever ask anything of you, so you don't have to worry.

202
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:51,873
I'm saying that you have to be realistic.

203
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,803
"By chance, if I run into her;

204
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:58,443
although I won't be able to recognize her face, through smell or something like that,

205
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:01,563
they say they can all recognize their mothers.

206
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:03,803
What do I do if I can't recognize her?

207
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,433
What must my mom look like?

208
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:09,943
Would my mom nag about those things, too?

209
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:13,833
When I meet her, should I laugh, or cry?"

210
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,763
I worried about that.

211
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,863
If Grandmother asked you to help me, please act like you didn't hear it.

212
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:30,543
When I believed that my mom was out there in the world, hoping I was living well wherever she was,

213
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:32,533
I was happy.

214
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:40,123
Right now, I'm in hell.

215
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:45,313
Just...

216
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,833
be Sungyeol's mom, please.

217
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,563
Woohyun...

218
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,543
Please don't call me that.

219
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:59,893
Even my name, because it hurts.

220
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:06,413
I can't come here anymore.

221
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:11,053
I'll have to live as Sungyeol's mom,

222
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,223
from now on.

223
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:14,753
Yes.

224
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:17,283
Please don't come.

225
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,863
Ever.

226
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,403
Just once...

227
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,543
Let me hug you just once.

228
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:34,373
You're a bother to the business. Please leave.

229
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:19,333
These jerks, did they really come?

230
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:09,083
Grandma said, "If you cook while thinking of the person who'll eat it. It'll be taste better."

231
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,773
If you make it with a face like that, the people who are eating it will be sad.

232
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:17,073
That's right, like that. You look the coolest when you smile.

233
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,843
So clumsy.

234
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:39,703
Your wrist is the prettiest, so you can't just let it show.

235
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:47,113
Hey, your arm looks longer and nice.

236
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,923
Was it you?

237
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,063
Make it delicious for us.

238
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:09,773
I'm going to return the money to you, so go do it somewhere else.

239
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:14,063
Are you really the owner? Let's make some money.

240
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:17,403
Woohyun made it really delicious.

241
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:18,993
Sit, sit.

242
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:24,203
Thank you for coming. Eat well and have a good time.

243
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:26,133
Let's eat.

244
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,143
Let's eat.

245
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:30,063
When are you doing the lottery?

246
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:34,503
Shouldn't you say happy birthday first? You're only interested in the "bait," right?

247
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:36,453
Don't you mean "prize"?

248
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:43,133
But what about your best friend?

249
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:46,033
Who knows? I texted her but why isn't she coming?

250
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:46,963
Maybe she's busy...

251
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:49,613
You told us not to contact Youngeun though.

252
00:24:51,263 --> 00:24:53,173
It's delicious, right?

253
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:02,713
Partner! Eat!

254
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:07,173
Foam kiss parody! Ddeokbukki kiss!

255
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:12,033
It's scary. It's a horror.

256
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:16,733
Don't smile when you eat. Ever.

257
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:19,503
Don't smile.

258
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:27,563
  I'm full!

259
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:29,283
  Stop eating. Stop eating.

260
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:40,433
I'm in a hurry but all the restrooms are full.

261
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:42,843
Can I use the bathroom?

262
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,763
If you go up there, it's on the 2nd floor.

263
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:46,553
Thanks.

264
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:29,693

265
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:58,343
It's not for you, it's for your sister.

266
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:05,213
It's Yena's birthday, why aren't you going?

267
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:10,053
You really didn't know.

268
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:14,323
If I see you in this neighborhood one more time, you're dead.

269
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:20,133
Is this just your neighborhood?!

270
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,653
I live here, too!

271
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:45,933
I keep seeing you. This is my place.

272
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:48,633
You go move somewhere else.

273
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,413
I have something I'm curious about and if you answer it, I'll think about it.

274
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:58,913
Our teacher was crying in front of Shin Woohyun's restaurant. Super sad as well.

275
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:02,903
What's their relationship with each other?

276
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:08,923
Why are you so surprised? It's so obvious you know something.

277
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,703
Even if I knew something,

278
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:15,563
would I tell you?

279
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:18,563
Move somewhere else starting from tomorrow.

280
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,333
That jerk...

281
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:28,593
Now I'm even more curious.

282
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:32,933
Look at this.

283
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,653
Do you like money more than your boyfriend?

284
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:37,803
Because money is important to humans,

285
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,803
a boyfriend who earns a lot of money is good.

286
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:44,973
She's smart but avoiding a girl like Yena is the wisest thing.

287
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,953
This is all because you are popular.

288
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:50,553
Did someone say it's not?

289
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:53,233
I'm tired. I'm tired.

290
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,183
It's not a bad thing to like someone, but...

291
00:28:56,183 --> 00:29:00,793
too much of it can hurt others.

292
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,813
Although they never meant for it to happen.

293
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:06,763
There's one thing in the world that you can't receive even if someone gives it to you.

294
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:09,313
And that's your heart.

295
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,403
Heart.

296
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:20,463
Yes.

297
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:22,683
I understand.

298
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,943
I'm going to go out for a bit.

299
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,263
It's because I don't want to eat alone, you rascal.

300
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:41,253
Let's eat together!

301
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:45,333
You rascal...

302
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:50,213
Oh, Woohyun! Here! Here!

303
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:08,743
I heard you two fought. Yeah?

304
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:11,523
You rascals...

305
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:14,533
I was just going to leave you two alone,

306
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:18,753
but wouldn't reconciliation and arbitration be my specialty?

307
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:26,003
Hey. Are you two by chance fighting because of Seulbi?

308
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,583
Please eat.

309
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:33,573
I'm full just by looking at you two eat.

310
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:36,513
Woohyun, you really are like a son to me.

311
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:39,073
Friendship...

312
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:41,913
is just as important as love.

313
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:48,013
Woohyun, it seems like your dad is still in the United States.

314
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,783
No matter how I think about it, I think it would be best to look for your mom.

315
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,173
You two living on your own, it could become a problem later.

316
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:58,403
Actually, I found her.

317
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:00,903
You found her?

318
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,433
Did you meet her?

319
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,773
I met her today.

320
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:09,503
But, of course, I was left behind.

321
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:13,563
We decided to live our own separate lives like before.

322
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:17,193
Ah, that's what happened.

323
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:20,883
Woohyun, stay strong.

324
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:24,013
- Stay strong. 
 - Thank you for being concerned.

325
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,953
Then I will be getting up first.

326
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,393
I left Seulbi alone to come here.

327
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,683
I'm going.

328
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,083
Oh, okay. Go safely.

329
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:37,433
If you need my help, tell me whenever.

330
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:50,443
Woohyun finding his mom, did you know about it, too?

331
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:51,983
No.

332
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:56,393
That kid, how hard that must have been.

333
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,623
These are the moments when men need friendship.

334
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:02,263
If you find a good friend, you need to do good as well.

335
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:07,043
From now on, you should look after him and understand him. Got it?

336
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:11,313
Ah, that kid. How sad he must have been.

337
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:32,433
Why is he so late?

338
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:47,303
Are you having fun?

339
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:28,263
 ♪ My love. My everything ♪

340
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:32,323
 ♪ You fell from Heaven ♪

341
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:35,023
I'm good at singing lullabies as well.

342
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,583
When did you get here?

343
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,473
Just now.

344
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:47,693
What is family?

345
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,723
People always on my side.

346
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:54,683
Then, do I really have no one? I don't even have Ms. Gong.

347
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:57,383
I'm here.

348
00:33:57,383 --> 00:34:01,933
You and I aren't family... yet.

349
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:04,903
But I'm always on your side. You don't believe me?

350
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:08,003
Right now, you can't be. Ever.

351
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:09,823
Why? Why can't I?

352
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:11,613
You said you've watched a lot of dramas.

353
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:16,093
If you and I are family, from now on, in the end, we won't be.

354
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:19,643
A love that can't be lost. Something like that?

355
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:25,333
Make sure to be by my side later. Forever. Got it?

356
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:33,893
♫  My love~ tonight~  ♫

357
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:35,553
Who sang this song?

358
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:38,553
I'm feeling sleepy so fast.

359
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:47,023
♫  I'll forever  ♫

360
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:50,573
♫  Protect you  ♫

361
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:58,613
Woohyun says he found his mom.

362
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,973
But it seems they decided to live separately.

363
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:05,723
If she knew that he repaid his father's loan shark debt and

364
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:11,003
if she knew that he's working this hard to live, would she even be able to sleep?

365
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:13,743
Would she be able to eat?

366
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:16,263
Mothers these days...

367
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,993
think that their life is more important than their kids.

368
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,783
Isn't that too much?

369
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:25,853
My heart hurts!

370
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:32,043
Maybe it's because he's Sungyeol's friend, but he seems like a son to me.

371
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:35,763
Since Sungyeol is an only child, too, I hope that they can both spend good times together like brothers.

372
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:37,843
Don't you think so?

373
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:04,103
What's the reason you haven't told your dad?

374
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:06,703
Who would that benefit?

375
00:36:06,703 --> 00:36:10,453
I'm going to watch you sink.

376
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:15,153
You are different than Woohyun.

377
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:18,023
Are you comparing me with your birth son now?

378
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:20,513
I can't compare.

379
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:24,243
You're my son on the family register.

380
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:27,583
Woohyun is a stranger.

381
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,503
But just looking at your real son's store makes you start crying, right?

382
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:37,873
Stop making it obvious before Dad finds out about it.

383
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,403
I'm going to tell him.

384
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:41,553
It's not time yet.

385
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:44,113
If someone's going to reveal it, I'm going to.

386
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:52,043
Will you do that?

387
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:55,333
I can't build the courage.

388
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:22,353
"If you're hurt, I hurt, too."

389
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,693
"In me, there's you."

390
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:29,723
"In a really sad life, nothing happens as you are living."

391
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:33,163
What are these words that seem like I read for the first time, but aren't?

392
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:35,473
This, I thought of it all night.

393
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:37,863
You copied it down to the microscopic level.

394
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:39,523
They're all lines from a drama.

395
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,813
- You're smart. 
 - We're going to be late for school.

396
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:43,873
Baby, let's go.

397
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:46,383
Ah, that's right. I forgot that one.

398
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:48,883
Awesome. They live together?

399
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:50,533
Shin Woohyun and Lee Seulbi live together.

400
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:53,513
Shin Woohyun and Lee Seulbi live together?

401
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,643
Hey, is it okay for highschoolers to live together?

402
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:59,603
Awesome. This makes no sense!

403
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:01,273
They aren't even cousins.

404
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:05,433
Seulbi works at the ddeokbokki store.

405
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:10,293
Because Shin Woohyun had his grandmother who passed away, it's correct that he is alone.

406
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:17,283
But Lee Seulbi... her parents aren't around.

407
00:38:17,283 --> 00:38:21,803
Then those two... why are they living together?

408
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:24,193
Ah, headache.

409
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:27,923
Please, let's just live quietly. Please!

410
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,923
What else?

411
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,653
There isn't anything.

412
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:36,093
Good job.

413
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:39,043
What would I expect from you?

414
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,633
You really are great.

415
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:56,113
There was a picture circulating with you embracing Sungyeol and now you have set up house with Woohyun?

416
00:38:56,113 --> 00:39:00,133
Between Woohyun and Sungyeol, who is it? You haven't decided?

417
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:03,243
- Is it you again? 
 - What did I do?

418
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:06,093
If you keep doing this, you will keep moving further away from Woohyun.

419
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,953
I am going to move closer.

420
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:12,563
That thing!

421
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:16,053
It's so loud starting from this morning.

422
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,463
Youngeun, why didn't you come yesterday?

423
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:21,333
Dayool got the smartphone.

424
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:26,523
I didn't go because I didn't want someone to die on their birthday.

425
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:31,233
At the Christmas party, there will be a newer model phone.

426
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,803
Make sure to come then.

427
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,923
Seriously!

428
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,233
You can't.

429
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:45,613
They say you should avoid poop because it is disgusting.

430
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:48,533
If you touch it, it'll only smell!

431
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:52,243
Instead hit me.

432
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:22,383
Have a seat.

433
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:27,333
He's the new director.

434
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:33,363
Ah!  Ah, I've heard a lot about you.

435
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:35,733
He's young but has a lot of experience.

436
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,403
When I first came in, I thought a movie star had walked in. I was really surprised.

437
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,693
I wish I could live one day with that face.

438
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:44,783
Hey, then I could remarry right away...

439
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:47,763
I know.

440
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:52,113
We'll start our meeting.

441
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:59,013
Lee Seulbi and Shin Woohyun, these two students living together in one house. How is this a problem?

442
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:03,383
No, how did you know that?

443
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:07,113
How did you know that? You even figured out the purpose behind the meeting beforehand.

444
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:10,673
Wow. You must have a very packed schedule.

445
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:15,083
Does it make sense that a minor boy and girl are living together?

446
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,663
We should separate them immediately.

447
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:20,153
I know these two don't have parents.

448
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:22,253
I am asking if there are any legal problems.

449
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:24,103
There are no problems with legal actions.

450
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:25,373
Is that so?

451
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:26,573
It's all settled then.

452
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:28,643
Then, why are we having this meeting?

453
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,453
Do you really have that much free time?

454
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:34,553
However, it will become a problem when the student's parents find out.

455
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:37,333
There's going to be a problem if they live together,

456
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:41,933
and that's nothing good for our school image.

457
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:45,743
High schoolers living together? I can't accept that.

458
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:49,273
If we ignore hot-blooded kids and she gets pregnant, who will take responsibility for that?

459
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,583
Responsibility?

460
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,343
Nobody is taking responsibility even now.

461
00:41:59,343 --> 00:42:02,593
Why would these two live together?

462
00:42:02,593 --> 00:42:06,733
Why these two came to live together, the background or the circumstances,

463
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:11,643
you didn't have any interest but now you'll only seek responsibility.

464
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:19,123
Nurse,

465
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:20,623
you're in charge of sex education. Right?

466
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:24,023
What do you think of this?

467
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:26,303
Me?

468
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:28,533
Ah, yes.

469
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:31,173
I—

470
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:35,763
Nowadays, kids are introduced to sex through porn.

471
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:40,943
If they get proper education on sex, there would be no problem.

472
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:45,363
Instead, because of the adults who are judgmental,

473
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:49,843
I hate that they are losing their innocence,

474
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:52,073
and I think of it as unfortunate.

475
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:55,133
Have some water and continue speaking.

476
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,123
It's an impressive observation.

477
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:58,423
Thank you.

478
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:01,673
I'm talking about her.

479
00:43:02,503 --> 00:43:05,323
I think this way.

480
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:10,833
I think that adults looking at children and judging them is the most wrongful schooling.

481
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,673
Let's do this...

482
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,163
Either make your best plan you can think of,

483
00:43:15,163 --> 00:43:20,123
or accept these kid's love for each other.

484
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:23,483
Let's end the meeting.

485
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:27,173
Teacher Kim Kwangshik...

486
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:30,043
Have you not tried to find him?

487
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:34,233
How can you all be so callous to the fact that a coworker put in a leave of absence?

488
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:39,503
And while doing so, you ask the children to live close happy lives with good relationships?

489
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:42,463
What is this? Please change.

490
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,523
If we change, the kids will change.

491
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:56,103
Teacher, it seems like you have much ability.

492
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:59,493
Please show us that ability. I'll look after you.

493
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:01,603
Yes! Please look after me!

494
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:05,023
I will make sure to find Teacher Kim Kwangshik.

495
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:06,043
Thank you!

496
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,793
Oh!

497
00:44:09,903 --> 00:44:12,073
Please return safely.

498
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:15,473
Hey, I heard you two live together.

499
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:18,173
Hey, only you two are living together?

500
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:20,463
I'm so jealous of you.

501
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:24,073
What's wrong with living together? Is there a problem?

502
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:26,633
Stop being interested in other people's business and just mind your own.

503
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:31,993
Ah, when you're grandmother passed away you must have been happy.

504
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:34,253
So you can live with Lee Seulbi alone.

505
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:37,123
You jerk!

506
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:40,083
Now there's not even a grandmother to come to school for you,

507
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,403
are you really going to hit me?

508
00:44:41,403 --> 00:44:43,263
Choi Jaeseok, stop it.

509
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,143
I told you that I'm going to punish you.

510
00:44:48,963 --> 00:44:52,863
I don't have a grandmother who can come, but I do have a Seulbi who will leave with me.

511
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,303
Do you guys play like this at home, too?

512
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:58,893
Do you think we play like this? We have more fun.

513
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:16,533
Oh, goodness.

514
00:45:18,703 --> 00:45:20,793
What are we going to do with Shin Woohyun and Lee Seulbi?

515
00:45:20,793 --> 00:45:23,253
We can't even send them to a facility.

516
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:27,133
Director Lee wants to see my ability.

517
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:31,563
Their thoughts are important too when it comes to sending them to a facility.

518
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:36,053
That doesn't mean I can be in charge of Lee Seulbi.

519
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:41,683
Teacher Ahn or Teacher Choi taking care of them temporarily... that is something

520
00:45:41,683 --> 00:45:45,133
not to even be imagined. That's something to cause big trouble! We can't do that.

521
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,743
That... That... It won't work, right?

522
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:53,303
That won't work. There's only one solution.

523
00:45:53,303 --> 00:45:57,553
Shin Woohyun's parents divorced and his father's in the US,

524
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:59,113
so we can't send him there.

525
00:45:59,113 --> 00:46:01,153
So we find his remarried mother.

526
00:46:01,153 --> 00:46:03,493
Yes. Right?

527
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:09,293
If it was a situation that she'd take him after she married, she would've taken him already.

528
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:12,863
Still, when her son is in this difficult situation, would she ignore him?

529
00:46:12,863 --> 00:46:14,773
There's only one solution.

530
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,643
We find his mom.

531
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,463
Mom.

532
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:22,663
 Family relations are love, understanding, accommodation, but...

533
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:26,553
 instead of sacrificing one's mutual distrust, competition,

534
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:30,483
 illusions of affection, there is a negative phenomenon that's occurring,

535
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:34,673
 and because of this kind of phenomenon depravity is occurring.

536
00:46:34,673 --> 00:46:38,593
 Depravity occurs between father and son, mother and son, siblings, and married couples.

537
00:46:38,643 --> 00:46:41,123
 Because of wrongly developed hostility

538
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:43,163
 or because of serious mistrust,

539
00:46:43,163 --> 00:46:47,323
 I'm talking about the senseless violence that should never happen.

540
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,933
If you have no questions, you're dismissed.

541
00:46:58,243 --> 00:47:01,053
They call a child that throws their parent away depraved,

542
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:03,733
but is a parent that throws their child away also depraved?

543
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:12,243
It depends on the situation.

544
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:15,933
Is throwing your own child away and raising someone else's child restitution?

545
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,753
Or vicarious satisfaction?

546
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:19,943
Or a mental problem?

547
00:47:24,773 --> 00:47:29,003
If you want to know, come visit me separately.

548
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:32,343
Dismissed.

549
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:48,683
Hey...

550
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:52,773
What did Sungyeol say to the witch teacher?

551
00:47:52,773 --> 00:47:55,583
Depraved, and someone else's child.

552
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:58,953
He makes easy words so hard to understand.

553
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:02,243
Witch Teacher left with a pale face as well.

554
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:06,843
Sungyeol either likes or hates Witch Teacher.

555
00:48:07,853 --> 00:48:10,823
You go first.

556
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:15,843
Woohyun!

557
00:48:15,843 --> 00:48:19,003
Hey! You can't just leave me alone!

558
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:22,653
What was that childish act during class?

559
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:25,523
Why? Are you worried?

560
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:28,013
- Because they were strong words? 
 - Stop it.

561
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:31,443
Even an abandoned dog can still look for its puppies.

562
00:48:31,443 --> 00:48:33,243
Are you happy you found her?

563
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,053
You jerk.

564
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:37,543
If you're going to hit me, hit me well.

565
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,803
I promised not to fight.

566
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:43,373
To Grandma and Seulbi.

567
00:48:43,373 --> 00:48:45,503
What's going to happen?

568
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:47,763
You won't be able to keep that promise.

569
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:52,923
Fine! Hit me!

570
00:48:52,923 --> 00:48:56,293
If that's how you're going to release your anger, I'll take them.

571
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,953
You crazy bastard.

572
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,833
I...

573
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,053
I...

574
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:14,533
Did you know?

575
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:18,213
I thought if I studied hard I could go to college with you!

576
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:21,993
I wanted to go to the military with you and drink my first alcohol with you!

577
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:24,333
My future didn't have just Seulbi.

578
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,153
You were there, you jerk.

579
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:28,813
Now, not just a mere teacher,

580
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:30,783
I was starting to see her as my guardian that I could lean on.

581
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:32,673
Me too!

582
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:35,443
Rather than a mother I didn't even know of,

583
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:37,893
I saw you, who I fought and laughed with,

584
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,103
as a friend.

585
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:44,553
Because it's you, I'm hurting more.

586
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:47,763
Stop it.

587
00:49:47,763 --> 00:49:49,913
Since it's disgusting.

588
00:49:49,913 --> 00:49:52,023
Even if you're like this,

589
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:54,103
I won't hate you.

590
00:49:56,673 --> 00:49:59,213
I'm not going to hate you.

591
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,683
Stop it!

592
00:50:13,683 --> 00:50:15,443
Stop it!

593
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:22,843
What are you doing?

594
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:26,583
Answer my question.

595
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,063
Did you think a mother that throws her child away and raises someone else's,

596
00:50:29,063 --> 00:50:31,573
did you think she'd hurt from this kind of nonsense?!

597
00:50:34,703 --> 00:50:36,683
Look carefully.

598
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:39,963
- You probably missed him a lot. 
 - Sungyeol.

599
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:44,963
I wish you wouldn't create any problems with Sungyeol.

600
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:48,673
The one who made problems is you, Teacher.

601
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,683
I threw it away.

602
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,613
Just like you threw me away, throw everything away as well.

603
00:50:55,613 --> 00:50:58,073
Only look after this guy.

604
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:03,403
Do you want to see if you can really throw it away?

605
00:51:05,793 --> 00:51:07,703
- Sungyeol. 
 - What are you doing?

606
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:12,323
You come up here as well.

607
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:14,393
Want to see who she will save first?

608
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:18,363
- Hwang Sungyeol! 
 - Stop being childish and come down now!

609
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:23,003
Would she save you, her biological son, or me?

610
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:25,563
Who will she save first?

611
00:51:28,023 --> 00:51:31,043
- Sungyeol. 
 - You crazy jerk, come down now!

612
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,663
Sungyeol!

613
00:51:41,703 --> 00:51:43,893
Senior...

614
00:51:46,763 --> 00:51:48,543
Don't do it!

615
00:51:52,563 --> 00:51:54,483
Lee Seulbi,

616
00:51:58,043 --> 00:51:59,853
what are you doing?

617
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:21,793
You're safe now.

618
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:31,943

619
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:36,383
 Take a picture!

620
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:38,243
 Is it bad that we're living together?

621
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:40,883
 From an adult's point of view, it could be bad.

622
00:52:40,883 --> 00:52:42,813
 Don't hit me!

623
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:44,323
 Don't intervene.

624
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:48,923
 It's because of you. I don't want to take anything away from you.

625
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:50,873
 What are you doing!?

626
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,613
 Where are you planning to take this?!

627
00:52:52,613 --> 00:52:55,733
 What will I do when I become an adult?

628
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:57,563
 Hey, you're burning up.

629
00:52:57,563 --> 00:53:01,293
 You pretending to be fine,

630
00:53:01,293 --> 00:53:03,983
 isn't fine with me.
