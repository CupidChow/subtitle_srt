1
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,260
Good job.

2
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,400
Since you swore, you'll return as an angel in a week.

3
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,540
One week?

4
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,570
That will be enough time to get organized.

5
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,160
Congratulations on returning.

6
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,580
I wish that

7
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,990
no one gets hurt anymore.

8
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,650
If I wasn't here, this wouldn't have happened.

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,210
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,100

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,840
Study hard.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't doze off because I'm not there.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,960
Smile.

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,700
You look ugly, so you need to smile to look pretty.

15
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,110
Hey, friend! I'm bored of being alone, should I go with you guys?

16
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,820
Want to?

17
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,610
Seulbi, cheer up! But you have to win for sure.

18
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,110
Let's go! I'll walk you to the meeting room.

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
Can you piggyback me?

20
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,720
Oh yeah! Tadah!

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,760
You...

22
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,590
saw Yena on the 29th, right?

23
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,010
Yeah...

24
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,750
As expected...

25
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,250
That day, Yena and Youngeun came to the store.

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,610
That book...

27
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,400
The angel that loved a human, right?

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,700
What happened to the angel later?

29
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,030
After saving the human it loved, it became an angel again.

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,950
If you want to read more, borrow it from the library. I'm not lending you mine.

31
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,800
Of course.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,850
It becomes an angel again.

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,160
It returns.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,760
If you don't have any more questions, we're done.

35
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,130
Teacher.

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, Seulbi.

37
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,090
I want to apologize.

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,470
I'm sorry, everyone.

39
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,620
Because of me, you all had to suffer.

40
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm really sorry.

41
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,610
I won't let this happen again.

42
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,850
Did you come because you were worried about Woohyun?

43
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,530
None of your business.

44
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,900
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,800
What are you planning?

46
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Why do you keep apologizing?

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,110
Because I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

48
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,600
And making you do all kinds of things.

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,890
Stop acting nice. Who's going to believe a thief?

50
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,350
The one who knows the truth is you.

51
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,430
If you really like Woohyun,

52
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,760
think of what Woohyun would want

53
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,100
and see into his heart.

54
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,850
Not these wrongful ways.

55
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,780
Then Woohyun will understand you as well.

56
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,950
You're disgusting 'til the end.

57
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,900
Who are you to give me advice?

58
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,200
 I'll return your money. Sorry, Woohyun.

59
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,850
Woohyun gave money?

60
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,580
Seulbi acknowledged it, so now it's the end.

61
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,450
No, no, no, no, no.

62
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,720
We decide the end.

63
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,690
It's not the end,

64
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,520
but the start.

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,780
I feel very dirty about Seulbi apologizing.

66
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,250
Because there's no way to say that it was you.

67
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,110
You guys take care of the losers.

68
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,610
I can't get the loser-ness on my hands.

69
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,600
I'll pay for both of you.

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,430
Club? Okay!

71
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,980
After a long time, I'm getting my groove on.

72
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,150
You guys really...

73
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,960
Oh, look!  Who is this?

74
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,360
The thief has come.

75
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,060
It's no fun because you confessed so easily!

76
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,610
We'll show you something fun.

77
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,320
What are you doing? Is that a new technique?

78
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,950
So if you stay still,

79
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,740
you'll be able to use superpowers?

80
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,480
You're cute when you joke with people.

81
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,980
I'm not going to hold it in either.

82
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,140
If you mess with the people I like,

83
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,040
I really...

84
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,400
won't be able to endure it.

85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,830
Oh, Hwang Sungyeol,

86
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,990
Lee Seulbi said she liked you.

87
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,090
Love triangle?

88
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,430
I think you will be dumped,

89
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,560
Sungyeol.

90
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,270
So, why did you apologize?

91
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,610
Lying is bad,

92
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,700
but sometimes you really have to do it.

93
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,990
Don't you feel resentful?

94
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,210
At first, I did.  But you and Woohyun believe me,

95
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,740
so it's fine.

96
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,950
Don't get near Jaeseok. It's dangerous.

97
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,590
But I feel really great today.

98
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,470
I've always received from you.

99
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,840
Even though today I just blocked for you.

100
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,050
Thanks for blocking.

101
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,800
I still have a lot of debt for being luggage around you.

102
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,050
Debt?

103
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,990
So I was wondering,

104
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,240
do you want anything or want to do something?

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,690
I'll do it all! Tell me everything!

106
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,300
If you tell me sooner, that'll be better.

107
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,600
What? Seulbi is not the one who stole it?

108
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,050
- Yena likes Woohyun, so I think she planned it. 
 - What?

109
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,350
It wasn't the first time that Chunsik was bullied by Jaeseok.

110
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,990
Teacher, you really didn't know?

111
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,480
Yeah...

112
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,450
I...

113
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,420
Seulbi took the blame for everyone.

114
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,760
I thought that you should know.

115
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,860
What? Am I invisible?

116
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,720
Why's he acting like that?

117
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,160
This is an expensive dress, but you didn't notice me?

118
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:18,130
Ah, acting like you're not interested?

119
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,210
It's not working because you're learning how to date through reading.

120
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:38,990

121
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,160
Mind your own business.

122
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,020
What did I do?

123
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,450
Why? Do you want to confess your guilt as well?

124
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm watching over you.

125
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,900
Seulbi!

126
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,720
Lee Seulbi!

127
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,600
You're giving Woohyun your notes, too?

128
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,450
He's building a wall with studying, he probably doesn't need it. Right?

129
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,230
That's why he needs it more.

130
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,720
It's because he doesn't study. If he does, he'll do well.

131
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
It must be encouraging to have you by his side.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,580
No. He always gets into trouble when he's with me.

133
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,530
There's nothing I can do.

134
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,990
A true friend always stays by your side.

135
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,260
That sounds like a really good quote.

136
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,980
Woohyun has a smart friend like you,

137
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,140
so he must be really happy.

138
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,140
What's that? Were you really talking about me?

139
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,190
You're not a tiger. A mouse or a cat fits you more.

140
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,950
What?

141
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,530
Your true friend Sungyeol is giving you this.

142
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,280
A true friend?

143
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,390
I can't even eat this, but why?

144
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,460
- You know you're thankful. 
 - Then eat it.

145
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,940
Change into something to eat!

146
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,590
Next time, I suggest you bring it with something to eat.

147
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,480
Let's go to class.

148
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,490
I'll be back.

149
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,040
Why are they walking so close to each other?

150
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,360
Fall down, zap!

151
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,190
What?

152
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,430
Hello... 
 - Okay.

153
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,400
Really, why is he like that?!

154
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,290
This is so expensive though...

155
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,420
- You feel really curious and annoyed, right? 
 - What?

156
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,740
It'll appear soon.

157
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,260
What are you imagining?

158
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,030
The feeling of someone stealing my expired bread!

159
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,670
The bread that goes over the expiration date spoils in no time.

160
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,990
It rots real soon!

161
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,710
Teacher Choi! My expiration date is still far away!

162
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,620
I'm still good. It's just that I got divorced once.

163
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,200
Are you here to see Shin Woohyun?

164
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,090
I'm so jealous.

165
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,270
Ko Chunsik, you got something to say to me?

166
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,140
No. Just because.

167
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,540
You? Did you come to write a letter of apology?

168
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,020
Good luck.

169
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you not get a grasp of the situation?

170
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,620
I'm the victim and you're the offender.

171
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,550
I'll reveal your wrongdoings. Just wait.

172
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,560
- Don't you know Lee Seulbi confessed to being the thief? 
 - What?

173
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,620
It was fun to see her apologize so earnestly.

174
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,770
You must regret not seeing it because you were here.

175
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,340
It's your doing.

176
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,900
Oh! You're smart.

177
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,350
Did you call me?

178
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,330
Shin Woohyun, aren't you on probation?

179
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:39,750
Jaeseok, I'm tired of seeing your face everywhere.

180
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,620
Go.

181
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,040
Is it a poem? "Lee Seulbi is innocent."

182
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,080
Ah. Lee Seulbi did not steal it.

183
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,200
She stole it, Lee Seulbi.

184
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,280
That's not it.

185
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,810
Your heart.

186
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,800
Do you feel wronged?

187
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,610
Huh?

188
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,670
Woohyun, this thing called life is usually unfair.

189
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,090
It's easier to recognize that and accept it.

190
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,030
He looked like a good person.

191
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,900
Yes.

192
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,890
Your son is good looking, too.

193
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,430
Yes.

194
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Thank you. Thanks to you, Woohyun wasn't expelled.

195
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,730
I just followed the policy.

196
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,330
I won't ask you to live with him.

197
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,900
Just watch over him from time to time.

198
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,620
Where are you going?

199
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,570
He and Sungyeol don't know.

200
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,570
They think he's living in America with his dad.

201
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,420
You take good care of your child.

202
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,030
Woohyun is your biological son.

203
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,240
I told you to transfer schools.

204
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,400
Getting into trouble, and doing that.

205
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,870
Why? Does he not stack up well against your good-student son?

206
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,100
Are you worried because he's good friends with your son?

207
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,410
Do you really not know your son?

208
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,200
Do you think our Woohyun gets into trouble anywhere with anyone?

209
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,480
Our Woohyun is not like that.

210
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,040
It's not like I'm asking you to raise him.

211
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,780
I'm just asking you to watch over him from time to time.

212
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,720
Can you really not do it?

213
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,520
Yes.

214
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,590
Yeah? Then...

215
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,070
I'm going to tell your husband and your son

216
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,640
that Woohyun is your son.

217
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,430
- Mother. 
 - What?

218
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,350
Are you getting a divorce if that's revealed?

219
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,210
Well, that's even better.

220
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,670
If you get divorced, you can live with Woohyun.

221
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,540
Get divorced again?

222
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,830
He gets sick when he's with me and only looks for you.

223
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,200
And you want me to live with Woohyun?

224
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,920
You told me to leave since you would take good care of Woohyun.

225
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,030
I'm now about to live my own life.

226
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,670
Don't come to see me again.

227
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,800
Hey! Hey!

228
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,170
My goodness.

229
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,130
Woohyun and I are so pitiful.

230
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,200
My goodness. My Woohyun, that poor thing.

231
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,700
Why are you apologizing when it's not even your business?

232
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,710
Why did you give Yena money?

233
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,180
That's not your business.

234
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,130
I'm not acknowledging that,

235
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,250
I just don't like being dirty and cheap.

236
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,410
And I don't like it when you're having a hard time.

237
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm fine.

238
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,030
I said I would reveal it. You don't trust me?

239
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,700
I totally trust you. You totally trust me, right?

240
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,000
So everything's fine now.

241
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,040
Oh, my arm is so sore from writing the apology letter.

242
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,230
Why does my arm hurt so much?

243
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,110
What kind of door is an apology letter? (wordplay)

244
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,430
What kind of question is that?

245
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, that feels nice.

246
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,200
And there, too.

247
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,300
So nice!

248
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,180
It hurts here, too.

249
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,580
You don't use your left hand!

250
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,720
You're smart.

251
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,330
After you're done eating, you have to come somewhere with me.

252
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,560
If you don't go, you'll regret it.

253
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,150
♫ If you wanna be my love...  ♫

254
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,200
I like this.

255
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,840
The same thing twice?

256
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,040
Ah! I saw it in a drama.

257
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,900
It's a couple t-shirt!

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
Why are you explaining it so nicely?

259
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,170
Is this okay?

260
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
Oh, it looks nice!

261
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Yeah.

262
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,530
Let's buy grandma's, too.

263
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,950
Should we?

264
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,900
Does it taste good?

265
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,230
Why doesn't it taste like this when I do it?

266
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,450
Does it happen overnight? You learn over time.

267
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,010
Grandma, teach me.

268
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,220
I told you not to play with food.

269
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,540
Woohyun, do you want to learn as well?

270
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,630
I can probably do it with my feet and still be better than her.

271
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,100
I can probably own this store just by doing what I've learned by watching over the years.

272
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,090
So you can do it? You should have told me earlier.

273
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,490
I put the store up for sale.

274
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,630
You put the store for sale?!

275
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm getting older.

276
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,550
I want to go on vacation and live in peace.

277
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,070
Ms. Gong,

278
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,670
are you having an affair?

279
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,840
Are you hurt somewhere?

280
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,980
Hurt? I'm still healthy!

281
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,470
A few years ago, I was thinking of retiring.

282
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,730
But luckily, there was someone who was willing to buy.

283
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,300
Good thinking.

284
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,710
I agree.

285
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,340
I won't hear your tired sleep talking anymore.

286
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,500
Then, what are we going to eat from now on?

287
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,140
Ms. Gong,

288
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,990
do you have a post-retirement plan?

289
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,560
This is your school fee,

290
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,660
and this is your wedding money,

291
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,080
and this is for your apartment.

292
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,100
That's it.

293
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,160
I always prepared it.

294
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,110
Why are you being so strange?

295
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,120
Are you showing off your money?

296
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,380
I don't want an apartment.

297
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,550
I want to live here with you.

298
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,480
This is what you have to decide with your future wife.

299
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,440
Just look carefully!

300
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,360
Fine. There's nothing to see.

301
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,800
Since you're always causing trouble,

302
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,140
you should grow up now.

303
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,050
I'm giving you this so you can take care of yourself.

304
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,020
You need to learn how to look over your own money.

305
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,400
This is too rough.

306
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,690
Up to here, it's rejection.

307
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,540
Grandma was rich...

308
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,650
I wasn't rich but I don't want to be regretful.

309
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,370
I learned that as I worked hard,

310
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,980
money slowly began to save up and so I can help others.

311
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,330
You can live like that, too. Right?

312
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,410
Why are you so strange, Ms. Gong?

313
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,210
Grandmother, are you going anywhere?

314
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,310
Go where?

315
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,940
I told you I'm going to go on vacations from now on!

316
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,410
But if you go alone, I'm going to get upset.

317
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,990
Let's go on a picnic!

318
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,290
With couple t-shirts!

319
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
I have lost the road.

320
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,370
My children and myself.

321
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,000
Teacher, we all grew up like that.

322
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,270
Recently, the students have only expressed how they feel.

323
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,070
The nature of the stronger one taking advantage of the weaker one has existed from the beginning of time.

324
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,610
Survival of the fittest.

325
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,250
Also, they are of a higher status than us.

326
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,560
Higher status than a teacher's status.

327
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,090
Teacher, have you known about this?

328
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,950
For me, it was so obvious.

329
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,140
Only I didn't know

330
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,390
how much pain our students were in.

331
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,450
Ah, why are you suddenly blaming yourself?

332
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,710
You should have told me!

333
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,030
I trusted my students!

334
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,240
You only saw what you wanted to see and believed what you wanted to believe.

335
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:51,540
Waiting for students who have no judgmental skills is not believing but merely watching in ignorance.

336
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,550
That's my thinking, Teacher.

337
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,160
What should I do?

338
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,690
What could you do?

339
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,060
You have to finish it well.

340
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,900
Before the situation gets worse.

341
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,300
Water?

342
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,620
Why do you keep getting involved with Woohyun?

343
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,530
Because he's my friend.

344
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,460
 I still have a long way to go before making up my debt.

345
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,220
I did it because I like you,

346
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,250
but for you, I gave you a debt.

347
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,460
You want to throw this away?

348
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,220
Yeah, why? Do I have to get permission to throw my clothes away?

349
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,220
This is the prettiest though.

350
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,360
If you throw everything away, what are you going to wear?

351
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,660
Due to the clothes, the house may explode.

352
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,180
Let me organize while I have the chance.

353
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,000
How many clothes do you think you have, Grandma?

354
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,610
Not this either.

355
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,440
Give me that! It's old, I need to throw it away!

356
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,530
It smells like you, Ms. Gong.

357
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
What? It smells like me?

358
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,570
A suspicious smell is coming out of it.

359
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,270
If you tell me now, I'll forgive you.

360
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,770
There's no such thing as that kind of a smell.

361
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,160
Stop it, my appetite is gone.

362
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,220
Our Ms. Gong's smell. Grandma,

363
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,460
if I pay up for all this time I've hurt you, you have to totally live longer.

364
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,450
Oh you, you.

365
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,580
You smell like sweat! Go shower!

366
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,940
I don't smell.

367
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,860
Well, just a little.

368
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,500
What are you doing?

369
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,970
Organizing my clothes.

370
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,990
How many clothes do you have to organize as well?

371
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,800
Here.

372
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,110
Ms. Gong's ddeokbokki recipe.

373
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,450
I wrote it down just in case I forgot.

374
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,080
Thank you.

375
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,040
Seulbi,

376
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,540
you have to cook while you think of the eater for it to taste well.

377
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,570
That's my secret.

378
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,200
It would be so good if time stopped like this.

379
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
Ms. Gong, are you all ready?

380
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,310
Yes, Woohyun, I'm ready.

381
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,560
Did we get everything? Nothing's missing?

382
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,030
You only need to pack your senses.

383
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,050
Let's go!

384
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,040
Ms. Gong, get on.

385
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,550
It's okay. It makes my butt hurt.

386
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,030
Just wait a little more.

387
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,360
I'll earn money soon and let you ride in a convertible.

388
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,650
Really?

389
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,590
When I get my paycheck, I'm going to give it all to you. And when I get a car, I'll let you ride in it.

390
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,150
Is that right?

391
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,020
Oh, that's good then.

392
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,560
What's this? A doubtful look.

393
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,980
Why? Does it hurt you?

394
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,100
As if!

395
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,380
Is a convertible really expensive?

396
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,240
Then I'll just get a car with a roof.

397
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,120
Is that really possible?

398
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,520
Woohyun is similar to Grandma, in that he's being suspicious.

399
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,640
Hey!

400
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,160
Was Woohyun suspicious of you?

401
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,320
Yes, last time, Woohyun—

402
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,120
Try and catch me!

403
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,840
If I catch you, you're going to get into a lot of trouble. I'm really fast.

404
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,310
 Woohyun!  Woohyun!  WOOHYUN!

405
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,110
Why is my grandma like that? Why?

406
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,780
Is there no other adult with you?

407
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,560
Please tell me. I'm my grandmother's guardian.

408
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,410
By the time she came to the hospital, the gallbladder cancer had already reached its final stage.

409
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,330
It had already spread to the other organs,

410
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,790
so it was too late for treatment.

411
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,300
From now on, you should prepare.

412
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,210
Prepare for what?

413
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,770
What should I prepare for?

414
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,580
Woohyun!

415
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,030
Save her!  Please, save her!

416
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,380
Please save my grandma!

417
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,240
Please...

418
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,910
You were strange.

419
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,170
Ms. Gong, recently you were acting strange. Only I didn't know.

420
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,880
If you're hurt, you should have told me that you're hurt. Why didn't you let me do anything? Why?!

421
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,620
Grandma,

422
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,920
are you okay?

423
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,840
I'm not okay.

424
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,380
You're too noisy.

425
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,690
Why didn't you tell me?

426
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,790
It'll hurt me.

427
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,410
I don't like our Woohyun's heart being hurt.

428
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,270
Who says those kinds of things?

429
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm Grandma's guardian.  I should know.

430
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,430
Grandma, they'll save you.

431
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,010
So don't worry, okay?

432
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm not going to die.

433
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,660
Don't worry and take Seulbi back home.

434
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,060
Grandma's scent is not good.

435
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,900
Seulbi,

436
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,240
take Woohyun and go home.

437
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,070
No, I'm going to stay next to you.

438
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,960
Then...

439
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,850
can you bring my bag?

440
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,170
Don't forget to lock the doors.

441
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,390
I won't be gone long.

442
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,930
I'm leaving her with you.

443
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,740
Seulbi,

444
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,020
don't you know that you look the prettiest when you smile?

445
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,830
At least, you

446
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,430
smile for me.

447
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,900
Do you understand?

448
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,030
I'm going to sleep.

449
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,600
How could this...

450
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,860
Ms. Gong...

451
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,540
You're lying, right?

452
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,480
Get up right now.

453
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,960
I thought you said you couldn't live if you didn't see me.

454
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,010
I couldn't do anything for Grandma!

455
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,110
What do you expect me to do by myself?

456
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,870
I can't live either if I don't have you.

457
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,550
Get up, please!

458
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,600
Get up!

459
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,580
Grandma...

460
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,380
Grandma, get up.

461
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,760
Save her... Save her...

462
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,010
 - Grandma...  
 - Senior!

463
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,230
Nothing will change just because you're doing this.

464
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,550
Wait.

465
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,440
Take Grandma a bit later.

466
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,900
I beg  of you.

467
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,790
Seulbi,

468
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,280
you can see me?

469
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,830
Are you an angel?

470
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,550
Grandma...

471
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,530
We can't change a person's fate.

472
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,430
Humans will always die,

473
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,360
that the death of a person is definite,

474
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,360
that's why now I'm receiving the punishment.

475
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,980
If I knew how much the heart hurts like this,

476
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,250
if so,

477
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,220
I would have been kinder when talking to a dead person.

478
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,180
At least let them say goodbye to their loved ones.

479
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,720
When they asked how the people they left behind are doing,

480
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,160
I should have kindly told them.

481
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,350
Senior,

482
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,610
I beg you.

483
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,230
My poor Puppy.

484
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,250
Grandma is really sorry.

485
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,560
Let's go.

486
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,060
If I'm not here, Woohyun will be all alone.

487
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,800
How do I tell him that I'm leaving?

488
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,200
You're leaving?

489
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,700
Woohyun...

490
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,370
About that...

491
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,100
I have to go back now.

492
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,660
Your memory returned?

493
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,760
Yeah...

494
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,910
When are you leaving?

495
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:52,330
I couldn't tell you before. I'm sorry.

496
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,240
You did great, so go.

497
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,120
Woohyun...

498
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,100
Go.

499
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,200
Just go!

500
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,870
Woohyun!

501
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:16,560
♫  That’s not how I feel, I’ve never hated you  ♫

502
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,270
♫  I hope our love will never change  ♫

503
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:27,970
♫  I hope we will always smile  ♫

504
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,810
♫  Thank you  ♫

505
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:38,180
♫  So many things happened so far  ♫

506
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:45,330
♫  There were times when things were hard and tiring  ♫

507
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,340
 While humans are afraid of dying,

508
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:56,830
 I think I know why they talk during funerals.

509
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,450
 They want to support each other's sadness,

510
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:08,140
 and keep the memories of the deceased human.

511
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,400
 That's why it's even more sad.

512
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,470
Why are you guys here?

513
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,170
You're not allowed here.

514
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:32,140
My dad, he doesn't usually go to events, but

515
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,810
he said I'll become a man if I go to a funeral...

516
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,760
You came well.

517
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,700
Come on in.

518
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,100
Why are you pushing me?

519
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,680
Honey!

520
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,220
Why are you here?

521
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,570
Sungyeol came.

522
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:41,720
There are many things to organize, but since his parents aren't here, it will be hard for Woohyun.

523
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,660
Honey, are you okay?

524
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,520
Your face looks a little pale.

525
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,370
I'm fine.

526
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,920
The teachers are here, so I should probably go to them.

527
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,560
Oh, yeah, go on in.

528
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,360
Excuse me? You're Woohyun's mother.

529
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,650
It's been a long time. Where have you been?

530
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,220
I think you got the wrong person.

531
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,190
No...

532
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,700
I think I was right...

533
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,610
- Yeah, Mom. 
 -  Do you have time over the weekend?

534
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,300
Why? Do you want to go on a date with me?

535
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,520
 Mom is getting married.

536
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,390
Married?

537
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,490
Who is? Mom?

538
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:35,210
 I really want a "congrats" from you.

539
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,640
 You're grown up now and I feel that you'll understand me.

540
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:45,160
I still have time to grow up. And even if I become an adult, I'll never understand you and Dad.

541
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,760
 Is it okay if you're happy?

542
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,050
Me! What about me!?

543
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,460
Why doesn't anyone care?

544
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,100
If you're going to abandon me, why did you give birth to me?!

545
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,170
 Sungyeol. Hwang Sungyeol.

546
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:18,740

547
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,900
 Adults are very bad.

548
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,600
 It's not because they don't like you that they leave.

549
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,710
 They thought you would understand.

550
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,480
 Since you're their son.

551
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,660
 Anyway, it's nice.

552
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,380
Did you meet someone at the funeral?

553
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,750
Oh, no.

554
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,300
She must have got the wrong person.

555
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,200
Woohyun and Sungyeol, I think they're good friends.

556
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,600
Those rascals.

557
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,730
What will happen to Woohyun? His father is all the way in the US.

558
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,410
Is there no way of contacting him?

559
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,480
What about his mother? Should I look for her?

560
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,170
Why?

561
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,340
Why would you?

562
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,460
The kids may end up just getting hurt.

563
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,600
Plus, he's probably having a hard time right now.

564
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,360
Is that so?

565
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,640
Well, you did major in that area.

566
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,850
Oh! I'm tired.

567
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,790
I didn't even know that Grandma was sick.

568
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,500
I asked her if she had a boyfriend.

569
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,480
How funny.

570
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,020
Grandma only scolded.

571
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:30,300
I'm sorry for leaving you alone like this.

572
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,700
I purposely had fits and caused trouble.

573
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,040
I'm a bastard.

574
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,580
Do you know how happy I was because of you?

575
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,730
You miss your parents, so what should you do?

576
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,570
What do you do since you miss them?

577
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,420
What should I do when I miss you and want to touch you?

578
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,100
Even though you took all those medicines like your meals, I didn't know.

579
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,910
I just...

580
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:10,180
I just thought that you'd always live with me.

581
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,570
I thought you wouldn't die.

582
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,620
It hurts Woohyun!

583
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,400
Don't say that! It's not your fault.

584
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:33,520
What can I do about you guys?

585
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,710
I should have given this to you earlier, but I didn't have time.

586
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,010
You looked like you enjoyed listening to music.

587
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,610
You're weird today.

588
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,950
If you press this and make a wish, that wish will come true.

589
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,450
I collect these as well.

590
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:24,280
Really? As expected, we understood each other.

591
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,890
Understood?

592
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,790
Why is it past tense?

593
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,980
Thank you...

594
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,740
I have to go back.

595
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,770
To where?

596
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,150
It's a place you don't know of.

597
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,580
I was always thankful.

598
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,020
If I don't accept this,

599
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,690
will you not go?

600
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,240
For being my friend,

601
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,100
I was glad.

602
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,160
I'll miss you.

603
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,940
You're good at everything, so...

604
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,750
I really don't know why

605
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,940
you're saying goodbye.

606
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,380
Woohyun...

607
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,920
Now, I have to...

608
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,090
You haven't left?

609
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,360
Go.

610
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,100
I said go!

611
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:01,760

612
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,020
We should go.

613
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,760
Because of you, Woohyun seems happier.

614
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,880
Let's leave him alone and go.

615
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,600
Grandma...

616
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,950
Seulbi, do well.

617
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,690
Go to him and hit him.

618
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,310
Just hit him really hard.

619
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,700
I taught My Puppy not to cry.

620
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,840
He can't even cry.

621
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,860
Just hit him so he can cry peacefully.

622
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:04,950
Seulbi, I'm leaving Woohyun with you.

623
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,110
You're so pretty when you smile.

624
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,960
We should go now.

625
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,030
My Puppy...

626
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,040
He's strong.

627
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,600
Grandma...

628
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,720
Ms. Gong,

629
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,410
it's nice here.

630
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,290
The breeze is nice.

631
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,970
And they say that, in spring, a lot of flowers bloom.

632
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,290
In autumn, there are a lot of colors.

633
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,630
Will it be cold in the winter?

634
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,730
It's time for you to go.

635
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,380
- I haven't said goodbye— 
 - Farewells are best when they are short and fast.

636
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,250
If you're like this then it's only hard on that guy.

637
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:41,700
You've sworn to the book. You will have to return for everything to turn back to normal.

638
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,470
You and him.

639
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,970
Ms. Gong,

640
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,090
Seulbi left, too.

641
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,930
She was annoying.

642
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,880
It's good.

643
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,040
Let's go.  Quickly, Senior.

644
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:11,620
Do well, Woohyun.

645
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,060
Now, I'm...

646
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,350
really alone.

647
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,760
Grandma...

648
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,930
I'm sorry.

649
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:35,110
I only think of the bad things I have done.

650
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,890
How do I live now?

651
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:50,480

652
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,190
 Did I really become human!?

653
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,550
 Why do humans love when they know they're going to separate?

654
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,890
 Why do you live when you know you're going to die?

655
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,760
 What it feels like to be hurt or what it feels like to be happy.

656
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,260
 What it feels like to be in love.

657
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,130
 Lee Seulbi, come over to me now.

658
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,840
 That's a relief.

659
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,380
 After I became a human, the first person I met was you.
