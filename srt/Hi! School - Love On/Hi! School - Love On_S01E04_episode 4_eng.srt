1
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:34,947
How did you know I fell in?

2
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,987
Where did you fall in?

3
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:38,387
Maybe...

4
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,037
did you fall in love?

5
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:42,137
Huh?  What?

6
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:45,297
If you're going to fall in, at least fall in love.

7
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,737
Hey!  Lee Seulbi!

8
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:03,357
Senior, why do you keep avoiding me?

9
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,867
Hey!  Lee Seulbi!

10
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,637
Senior!  Senior!

11
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:16,907
Senior, wait!

12
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:20,757
What are you looking at?

13
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,607
Senior.

14
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,977
You saw someone you know?

15
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,877
Did your memories return?

16
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,087
Hey!

17
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:34,457
Seulbi!

18
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:36,447
Come to your senses!

19
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:01,027
Your body is burning up with a fever, really.

20
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:14,697
Think of this as an honor.

21
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:17,867
I'm only letting you sleep here for today because  I'm afraid Grandma's going to wake up.

22
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:22,037
You seem like a doctor today.

23
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:23,387
Go to sleep.

24
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,967
You can't even talk because you don't have any energy.

25
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,897
I should be happy when you remembered something.

26
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,657
I'm quite a bad person.

27
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,997
Don't hurt anymore, Seulbi.

28
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:09,357

29
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:31,607
I'm even taking medicine now?

30
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,687
It was definitely Senior.

31
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:30,617
Are you okay?

32
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:34,677
Yeah, I'm fine.

33
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:36,627
Let's check if you have a fever.

34
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:39,487
Don't move. Don't you dare lay a finger on my body.

35
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,447
Why are you copying what I do?

36
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:45,367
- Then does my foot work? 
 - No, nothing works.

37
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,537
Don't come.

38
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,107
What's wrong with you?

39
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,057
Then, what should I do with this?

40
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,197
What is that?  Is it mine?

41
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:58,277
Not yet. It's yours once I give it to you.

42
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:03,257
Should I throw it? It's new, so I don't care if it gets crushed.

43
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:04,817
Don't!

44
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,197
Oh, this is fascinating.

45
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:17,227
Are you really giving it to me for free?

46
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:21,697
How can anything be free? I'm confiscating it if you don't pick up when I call you.

47
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,617
You know you are really low, right?

48
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:27,767
Low? It's even lower for not having a phone.

49
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:32,087
Oh, this is what the humans use; a camera.

50
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,227
Erase it.

51
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,227
Oh, this is fun.

52
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,667
- Oh. 
 - Ugh, seriously.

53
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,837
Seriously.

54
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:41,667
I don't like taking pictures.

55
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,717
I wanted to keep it as a memory.

56
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:49,037
If I go back, I can't see you. I wanted to see it then.

57
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,937
The life to self-camera is the angle.

58
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,937
Tilt your head down and smile.

59
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,747
Smile.  Smile.

60
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,197
One. Two. Three.

61
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,847
Put it away.

62
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:31,107
It's weird. The numbers from 1 to 10 are all yours.

63
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,277
So what.

64
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:36,807
I need to put in Grandma's, Kisoo's, and my classmates' numbers, too.

65
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:40,057
- Erase it for me. 
 - You need to erase it yourself.

66
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:54,127
Wow, that... she picks another guy's number with the phone I bought her?

67
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,267
What are you so pissed about this morning?

68
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:00,357
Oh, Seulbi!

69
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:05,387
This bling-bling and sexy item is yours?

70
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:08,457
Kang Kisoo, give me your number, too.

71
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,847
Ah, if you flirt with me like that, things are going to get complicated.

72
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:12,867
I'm going to be number 1.

73
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:13,987
I already have someone there.

74
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:15,697
Really?  Then number 2.

75
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:18,617
I have that one, too. You're number 14.

76
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:20,787
Oh, wow I'm sad.

77
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,707
Let me be in the top 5. I want to be in the top 5.

78
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:26,227
You would die if your grades were in the top five, right?

79
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,047
The same goes for you, too!

80
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,417
What number is yours?

81
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,727
Lee Seulbi.

82
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:38,017
Why's it important?

83
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:40,977
What number do you guys have me as?

84
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,677
I'll do it now.

85
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,097
Are you okay?

86
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:06,127
Yeah.

87
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,097
She's going to get mad.

88
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:10,997
Let's go quickly or she'll really go crazy.

89
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:29,237
Class dismissed. Clean up, go out, and eat well.

90
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,867
- Yeah... 
 - I'll eat well!

91
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:37,327
Ah, I'm hungry.

92
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:43,047
Let's go eat lunch. You're coming, right?

93
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:45,027
You go eat.

94
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,627
Awesome! You're only going to eat that?

95
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,837
You're really going to die!

96
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:52,617
It's better to die than live being ugly.

97
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,247
Look at them.

98
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,797
You won't have anything to eat in hell either because you keep starving.

99
00:08:57,797 --> 00:09:00,317
You guys try eating just one meal a day, too.

100
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:01,727
Do you want some?

101
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:04,647
One meal per person is kind of the trend these days.   
 (T/N: she said the phrase wrong; it's one meal per day)

102
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,337
One meal per day.

103
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:12,127
My facial structure is like a cat; the type that guys like.

104
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:15,197
If I want to maintain this look, I need to eat just one meal a day.

105
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:18,527
Hey, did all the cat-facial-structured-girls freeze to death?

106
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:21,137
You have a dog-face, a dog-face.

107
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,057
What? You're the one with the dog-face.

108
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:25,587
Should I make it so that you can never eat dog food again?!

109
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,687
No need to.

110
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:31,847
I hope your diet goes well.

111
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,557
Let's go eat.

112
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:39,607
Cat?  Dog?

113
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:51,117
Humans are happiest when they eat.

114
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:52,397
It's only you.

115
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:55,797
Is being happy a bad thing? It makes your back warm and your belly full.

116
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:58,647
Rip out your back? That's a bit gory. 
  (T/N: when spoken in a dialect, "warm back" has the same pronunciation as "rip out back")

117
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:03,817
Wow... Our Seulbi. Do you want to learn Korean or eat a meal with me?

118
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:06,227
So meaningless.

119
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,497
Hey, are you sure this is anchovy soup?

120
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,697
You little picky eater.

121
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,597
It is! I checked twice.

122
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:16,087
Really?  This tastes weird.

123
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:25,337
Sungyeol, let's eat together!

124
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:31,267

Let him be. You need to eat with good people...

125
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:34,267
I agree with you on that. You go and eat somewhere else.

126
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,697
Welcome.

127
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:40,787
This feeling of a feeling that something bad is going to happen. I don't like it.

128
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:43,937
But what's a cat-face and a dog-face? 
  (T/N: referring to facial structure)

129
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,567
Is a cat-face more appealing to male humans?

130
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,077
Why? Are you curious as to what kind of face structure you have?

131
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:50,797
Yeah.

132
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,807
Here is the food tray (bab-sang) , right? 
  (T/N: wordplay - tray and facial structure has the same ending sound)

133
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,787
Your face is horrid  (jin-sang). 
  (T/N: wordplay - horrid and facial structure has the same ending sound)

134
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,187
Hey, I know what that means.

135
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:02,227
If mine is crazy-structured, then are you a psycho?

136
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,177
How dare you say I'm a psycho?

137
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:08,167
If you're a horrid-face, then I'm a sculpture-face.

138
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:15,097
Why are you being like this? It's not like I said anything wrong.

139
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:17,957
Kisoo!  Kang Kisoo!

140
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:20,387
Hey, Kang Kisoo!

141
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,657
Teacher, aren't you eating?

142
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:25,807
You always ate well, why aren't you eating today?

143
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:38,997
Grade 2, Class 3 students are noisy even when they eat.

144
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,247
You need to chat while eating

145
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,547
to maintain your social—

146
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:50,527
The only thing going around will be those rice pieces.

147
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:53,667
Sorry!

148
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:58,527
Teacher! Do you want to end things with me on a bad note?

149
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:03,657
Well, people say bad note friendships are frie-friendships, too, so...

150
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,667
Teacher... Teacher, are you okay?

151
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,257
I'm getting up first.

152
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:30,437
Why am I like this?

153
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,107
Hello!

154
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,447
My Woohyun is...

155
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,917
Hold on. We're almost there.

156
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:27,027

157
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,907
No way, really,

158
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,957
are you my Woohyun?

159
00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:00,587
Are you really my Woohyun?

160
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:07,767
 Woohyun, where are you?

161
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,057
Ah, Woohyun...

162
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,607
Is our baby okay?

163
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:18,057
My goodness, I told you to eat only after checking the food menu!

164
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:22,587
Why did you have to receive all the unlucky traits?

165
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,587
Receive? From who?

166
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:30,597
Woohyun's mom couldn't touch a single type of seafood.

167
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:34,887
Our school teacher also came in here with the same condition as Woohyun.

168
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:39,147
Really? There's someone else like that?

169
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,707
Where did she go?

170
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:58,107
My goodness, oh... Are you back to your senses, Woohyun?

171
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:04,717
If it tasted weird, you shouldn't have eaten it. What is this?

172
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,777
I'm okay.

173
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,237
What about the restaurant, Ms. Gong?

174
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:11,057
You don't need to worry about the restaurant.

175
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,697
Are you really okay?

176
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:14,107
You surprised me!

177
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:17,947
"You surprised me!" I was more in shock.

178
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:21,377
Let's go.  I hate being in the hospital.

179
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,117
Here.

180
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:13,607
I was surprised.

181
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,587
I'm sorry I surprised you.

182
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:19,007
I'm such a terrible husband.

183
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,477
I don't know anything about you.

184
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:25,817
It's because I didn't tell you.

185
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,457
I can just be careful.

186
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:31,577
If there's something else I don't know, tell me.

187
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:34,477
I'll know in advance so you won't have to be hurt.

188
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,627
Honey,

189
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:43,737
should we move?

190
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:47,367
Move? Why are you suddenly talking about moving?

191
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:50,037
You said it's nice and close to school here.

192
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:53,507
That's right.

193
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:55,767
You're cute.

194
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,787
Rest a little.

195
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:19,447
Because the test is the day after tomorrow, Grandma sighed.

196
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:27,077
So what? Grandmas take deep breaths because their lungs are weak.

197
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,997
So let's quickly study.

198
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:32,717
Hey, I just left the hospital.

199
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:36,697
- Did you just forget? 
 - Oh, right.

200
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:39,437
But is there anything else you can't eat aside from crabs?

201
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:42,347
- Why? 
 - I'll eat it all

202
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:44,227
so then you wouldn't be able to eat it.

203
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,737
Of course, you would be like that.

204
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,537
Don't hurt again.

205
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:52,377
I don't think hurting is a good thing.

206
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:01,127
But you didn't answer me. What number am I on your phone?

207
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:03,757
Why would I save your phone number?

208
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:07,557
You low kindergartner. Just go in and study when you hurt.

209
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,597
Aah! I can't hear you.

210
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:12,197
I can't hear the crazy pervert's nagging.

211
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:16,037
Come in in five minutes or you'll be in trouble.

212
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:18,357
She seriously...

213
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,697
You're number 1, number 1.

214
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:49,737
Choose quickly. 1, 2, 3!

215
00:18:55,897 --> 00:19:00,427
Do you think that if you press both, two will come out? You're dumb.

216
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:04,277
This feeling that you won't be able to do anything yourself.

217
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:13,377
But I have this feeling where I'll succeed next time.

218
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,997
I'm worried.

219
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:26,597
Our Woohyun is good at this kind of stuff. So cool.

220
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:29,227
How nice would it be if you could also study?

221
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:33,337
If I could study well, would girls leave me alone?

222
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:37,857
So that's why girls don't leave Sungyeol alone.

223
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,457
What? Why are you talking about Sungyeol here?

224
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,427
Are they really cousins?

225
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:45,747
She's flirting, right?

226
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:48,907
She just doesn't need to mess with my Sungyeol.

227
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:55,847
Is your body okay? I was so worried.

228
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:59,867
But can you eat anything like this?

229
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,927
Yeah.

230
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:06,777
With our Woohyun,

231
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:10,737
you went to the hospital. Thanks.

232
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:14,447
Go. I said go!

233
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,187
The couple is talking together, should we leave them?

234
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:26,567
I printed out the pre-test questions at school. Do you want to see them together?

235
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,697
I'm leaving first.

236
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:31,637
Woo-Woohyun!

237
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,257
I need a detailed approach.

238
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,007
I'm going.

239
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,677
Aww, no goal.

240
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:44,087
Another ten bucks.

241
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,687
No goal. Another ten bucks.

242
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,557
I'm going.

243
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:58,337
Hey, last one.

244
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,307
I'm throwing it well.

245
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:06,117
Strike!

246
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,927
Lee Seulbi, you seem to have a lot of money.

247
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,227
You want to join in, too?

248
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,907
If you throw it like this, does money come out?

249
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:20,787
Hey, you play really funny.

250
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:24,007
Lee Seulbi, go out into the hall with Chunsik.

251
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:37,297
You should stop. I think that would be better for you.

252
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:43,377
Do you see me as a beggar!

253
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,457
It must be nice to be you.

254
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,537
Why?

255
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,807
You live with Woohyun.

256
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:24,247
Do you still see me as that loser from before?

257
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:27,037
You weren't as bad as you are now.

258
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,987
At least, before, I wanted to help you.

259
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:33,727
Did anyone ask for your help?

260
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,827
Why don't you just leave me to die?

261
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:39,227
I know, right? I should have left you to die.

262
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:42,187
It's the same as living as trash anyway.

263
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:54,817
Hey, you got caught Jaeseok!

264
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,667
Come here.

265
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,477
Come here.

266
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:09,267
What's your relationship with him? It seemed serious.

267
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:12,297
What are you curious about?  Is being nosy your hobby?

268
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:15,037
Nosy? Who?

269
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:19,237
Me? I couldn't help but see.

270
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:21,837
Choi Jaeseok doesn't bother you.

271
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:23,187
It's that he can't touch me.

272
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,007
Are trying to act cool again?

273
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:28,107
Are you a butter prince?  (T/N: greasy)

274
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,967
What's wrong with your hand?

275
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:40,987
Don't mind Seulbi. I can deal with it myself.

276
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:46,267
It doesn't seem like you can.

277
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:50,027
That little...

278
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:55,377
Okay, go in straight. Straight, straight.

279
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:57,437
Stop!

280
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:06,707
Jaeseok, do you think a locker is more expensive, or you?

281
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:11,877
I'm not sure. Even if it's broken, my parent's are paying,

282
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:14,977
so wouldn't I be more expensive?

283
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,547
Brat. Throw that shit out of your mouth!

284
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:20,597
Why is your mouth so dirty?

285
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:23,057
Hold on.

286
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:25,977
Hello? Ah, yes.

287
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:28,617
Yes, I'll give it to him.

288
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:33,177
Geez...

289
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:37,117
Hello? Who?

290
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:38,747
CEO Lee?

291
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:41,347
Yes, CEO Lee. Yes, yes.

292
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,927
Yes, I'll be up soon.

293
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:47,837
Hey, Seokhoon, come here.

294
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:52,367
Give this to the math teacher.

295
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,617
Yes.

296
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,887
I can go, too. Right?

297
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:01,107
If you get caught one more time wandering around,

298
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:04,197
I'm going to sew your left and right feet together!

299
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:06,117
Go.

300
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:17,297
 Your tutor is waiting for you at the cafe. At least go there and sit.

301
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:43,767

302
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,707
Give it back.

303
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:04,917
Hey, you should share something good.

304
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,927
I said give it back.

305
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:08,647
How scary.

306
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:11,907
The always second place is first place when it comes to confidence.

307
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:18,057
Well, you need to do at least this much to win over Hwang Sungyeol.

308
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:19,767
Right?

309
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:26,617
Let me raise my rank with your help.

310
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,647
Exactly from your head.

311
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:36,387
Got it?

312
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:44,857
I usually don't do things like studying for tests.

313
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:47,657
Is it because it is annoying like swimming?

314
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:51,317
Hey, you take tests with your usual skill.

315
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:54,667
That's for kids who have skill.

316
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,137
You have to at least strike some lightning—

317
00:26:56,137 --> 00:27:00,657
You'll get struck by lightning while trying to play with it!

318
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,417
Let me do that, too.

319
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,917
Chew up the bubble gum. Extract all the sweet juice.

320
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:23,347
Roll it up well with your tongue, roundly.

321
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:28,087
Then the gum and you become one.

322
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:30,217
Concentrate.

323
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:37,337
Stick your tongue out and blow a little.

324
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:51,517
That's hard... and my tongue just hurts.

325
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:57,977
- You know... 
 - You know...

326
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,947
- What? 
 - You tell me first.

327
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,487
No, you go first.

328
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:10,147
Are you... close with Yena?

329
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,827
Are you a couple?

330
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:16,897
Couple? Do you even know what couple means?

331
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:20,967
Then, do you even know the spelling for couple?

332
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:23,967
You're being jealous right now, right?

333
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,447
Me? Why?

334
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:29,227
I don't even know how to do that!

335
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:31,927
I can tell you're jealous just by looking at you.

336
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:34,897
I guess something happened to your head because you suddenly studied a lot.

337
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,447
Since you're changing the subject, it's even more suspicious.

338
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:42,397
- So what did you want to tell me? 
 - Me?

339
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:44,537
I forgot.

340
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,237
There's a reason why you can't study!

341
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:52,427
You're stupid!

342
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,907
Hey! You!

343
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,387
I'm the one being jealous.

344
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,037
Oh. Come and sit.

345
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,667
Oh my!

346
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,417
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

347
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,417
It's good, thanks to you.

348
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:18,767
There isn't even one bit of crab in here.

349
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,977
Sungyeol! Let's eat together.

350
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:22,227
I don't want to.

351
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,837
- That brat, hey. 
 - Sungyeol.

352
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:28,127
You need to at least eat out of consideration for me.

353
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:32,437
And today's your test. You have to eat and do well!

354
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,937
I have a test so I can't eat that and get indigestion.

355
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:37,927
Sungyeol! Your dad was thinking of you and made this so—

356
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:40,547
If he was thinking of me,

357
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,097
he shouldn't have broken up with my mom.

358
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:47,097
You never made ramen for Mom.

359
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,697
Sungyeol.

360
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,397
What's wrong?

361
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:21,037
Why are you shooting a horror movie in the morning?

362
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:23,607
Grandma was sick all night.

363
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:27,057
I need to at least cut this before I leave to help Grandma.

364
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:29,107
Grandma?

365
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:32,727
Yeah. She was sick all night and she just fell asleep.

366
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:49,367
I'm telling you my know-hows especially because it's so dirty.

367
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:53,037
If you wear it, you won't cry as much, so do it with the helmet.

368
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:57,177
These are tears, right.  What humans do when they are sad or happy?

369
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,557
You and your humans again.

370
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,587
It's sweat from your eyes.

371
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:04,167
Sweat from my eyes?

372
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,737
Did you commit a crime? Why are you so surprised?

373
00:31:15,737 --> 00:31:18,357
Ms. Gong, I was about to drop my heart.

374
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:21,197
I was more surprised, you rascal.

375
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:25,347
Ms. Gong, I thought you were hurting somewhere. Are you all right?

376
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:27,367
Do you wish that your grandmother was sick?

377
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,037
No!

378
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:32,427
I don't want Ms. Gong to be hurting until I die.

379
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:38,567
Oh, how scary. Does that make sense?

380
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:42,457
You were studying until it got late yesterday, when did you wake up?

381
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:44,167
Come out. I'll do it.

382
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,497
Grandma, go in.

383
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:50,337
Old people get hurt more if they don't use their bodies.

384
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:53,827
Don't worry, and just do your tests well.

385
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:57,957
Was Woohyun worth teaching?

386
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,037
Woohyun went to elementary school, right?

387
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:01,827
You really!

388
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:04,937
But why can't he understand Korean?

389
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:09,487
Just try failing your tests! I won't leave you two alone.

390
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,767
Grandma!

391
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:15,107
Aren't you going to come here?!

392
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:44,917

393
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:51,267
Are you a horse rider? Are you going to be riding horses?

394
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:55,687
Where's your uniform! And you're not going to button up your shirt?

395
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:57,907
Close it properly.

396
00:32:57,907 --> 00:33:00,547
And you guys. You shortened it a lot.

397
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,507
Are you doing short-track?

398
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:05,107
Wear your ties then!

399
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:08,267
And why are you here? Huh?

400
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:11,907
You don't know the reason? Why are you putting oil in your hair, oil?

401
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,717
Are you a rice cake? Huh?

402
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:18,437
Oh yeah. You!  You!

403
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,567
Ow, ow... The freedom of your two feet,

404
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:25,607
doesn't mean the ones up here but down here, do you understand?

405
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:26,577
- Do you understand?! 
 - Yes!

406
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:27,897
- Go! 
 - Yes!

407
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:31,437
I'm going lightly on you today because there's a test. Hurry up and go!

408
00:33:31,437 --> 00:33:33,237
Scurry up there!

409
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:37,907
Oh, all right. Seokhoon.

410
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:39,847
Oh, this is important.

411
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:42,977
Do well on the test. Fighting!

412
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:58,567
Let's talk for a moment.

413
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:11,457
Hey, Brother.

414
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,227
Did you pull an all-nighter?

415
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:19,187
You prepared, right?

416
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:22,347
But isn't this a little...?

417
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:26,787
If I tell you to give it to me, then just do it.

418
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:32,357
Why?  Did I scratch your self-esteem?

419
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:36,967
If you want to at least keep your pride,

420
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:39,537
then pass it over, bastard.

421
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:42,147
I got it.

422
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,887
I said it's not!

423
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:52,497
Good morning.

424
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,527
Take your test well, my baby.

425
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:24,877
You really.

426
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:28,327
Who said you can chew gum during a test? Aren't you going to spit it out?

427
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,017
Are you nervous?

428
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:37,487
No, I'm not even nervous.

429
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:40,127
Don't be anxious.

430
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:44,497
Do your best on solving the ones you know and for the ones you don't, just guess.

431
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:48,157
The pre-test came out and I studied. Then I should get 100%.

432
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:50,597
What do I do if there's nothing I don't know?

433
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:52,527
That overflowing confidence with no proof.

434
00:35:57,157 --> 00:36:02,407
They study really hard. It's the first time I'm seeing this.

435
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:05,937
If you don't know, you should get it wrong. So petty.

436
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:08,717
You can get it wrong. I'm going to get it right.

437
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:14,587
Everyone put your books away.

438
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:49,457
Ah, Teacher...

439
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:08,547
Since when was the percentage in this drink the formula for squaring?

440
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,297
The people who just got caught will be overlooked because it's before the test has begun.

441
00:37:15,347 --> 00:37:18,787
But anyone who is caught from now on will receive a zero.

442
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:22,427
If you get a zero, you have to give up on your chances of going to Seoul University.

443
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,357
You all know this better than I do, right?

444
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,467
 Yes.

445
00:37:29,787 --> 00:37:31,567
Pass it back.

446
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:37,727
Leave your OMR card on the right side of your desk.

447
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:41,607
Only the papers with the stamps on them that I put will be acknowledged, all right?

448
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:43,667
 Yes.

449
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:02,327
Teacher, I need another card.

450
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,577
You passed it back, right?

451
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,687
There.

452
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:49,747
I need another card.

453
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:41,747
Pass! Next question.

454
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:52,257
Choi Jaeseok, put your hands on top of your head.

455
00:39:57,777 --> 00:39:59,967
I said put your hands on top of your head.

456
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:05,847
Who is it?

457
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:08,847
What do you mean?

458
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:11,427
Who is the person who gave this to you?

459
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,997
It's mine.

460
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:21,227
From now on, anyone whose eyes I catch will be punished for cheating.

461
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,777
I'll ask you again.

462
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,517
Who was it?

463
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:36,057
Hwang Sungyeol.

464
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,657
What do you mean our kids cheated?

465
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,517
Hwang Sungyeol. Choi Jaeseok.

466
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:55,497
Why did you do it, Sungyeol?

467
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:59,257
I'm not sure. Sungyeol isn't acknowledging it.

468
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:02,457
It was Jaeseok who had two OMR cards.

469
00:41:02,457 --> 00:41:05,367
I said I got it from Hwang Sungyeol.

470
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:14,017
Jaeseok, why don't you come and talk with me?

471
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:26,437
Follow me.

472
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:34,457

473
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:42,107
He's definitely not someone who would do that.

474
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,487
I think something went wrong, right?

475
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:47,047
I was looking at someone else's card, too.

476
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:50,017
Wow, Choi Jaeseok saved me.

477
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:59,237
I need to go somewhere. I'll be back soon.

478
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:00,667
Let's go together.

479
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:02,587
Kiaoo take Seulbi and go first.

480
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:03,227
Hey!

481
00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:12,177
Why do you keep getting into this kind of situation?

482
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:15,577
Usually "It wasn't you, right?" is first.

483
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,657
Has Jaeseok ever bothered you?

484
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:21,597
Hey, tell me honestly, so I can understand what's going on.

485
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:24,717
Don't try to help me, just do your job well.

486
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:31,687
Are you doing this on purpose?

487
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:35,197
If that's the truth, you will get a zero.

488
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:36,137
It doesn't matter.

489
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,567
You!

490
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,587
You are really dumber than I thought.

491
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:44,877
I didn't think you would ruin your life just to go against me.

492
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:47,917
I won't ruin my life just because of one zero,

493
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,487
that thought is only present because you're my teacher, too.

494
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,437
Since the moment you appeared in front of me,

495
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,387
even if I got a 100% or got first out of my class,

496
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:58,707
I was not happy.

497
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:03,137
Your parents will come.

498
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:06,847
Your father will be very disappointed.

499
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:23,607
Teacher.

500
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:29,087
Sungyeol didn't do it. I saw it.

501
00:43:29,577 --> 00:43:32,397
There was something between Seokhoon and Jaeseok.

502
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,587
What is it then?

503
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:42,397
You saw Seokhoon pass the answers to Jaeseok?

504
00:43:42,397 --> 00:43:45,667
No, I didn't see him, but...

505
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,267
but Sungyeol does not have a reason to do it.

506
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,207
Are you friends with Sungyeol?

507
00:43:54,317 --> 00:43:55,867
No.

508
00:43:56,827 --> 00:43:58,807
Then why?

509
00:43:58,817 --> 00:44:01,397
It's unfair.

510
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:07,187
If you try to turn in evidence, it can become unfair for you, too.

511
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:13,397
He hurt his hand so he used his left hand to write.

512
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:16,077
He hurt his hand?

513
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:17,387
When? How much?

514
00:44:17,387 --> 00:44:21,337
I will find evidence that it wasn't Sungyeol. Please wait for a while.

515
00:44:21,337 --> 00:44:22,967
Shin Woohyun!

516
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,847
Is your stomach okay?

517
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:35,147
Do you frequently get allergic reactions?

518
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:37,597
Yes, a little bit.

519
00:44:37,617 --> 00:44:39,477
I'm all right.

520
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:43,927
Carry around some prescription medicine with you.

521
00:44:43,977 --> 00:44:47,527
If it's an emergency, at least take some cold medicine.

522
00:44:47,537 --> 00:44:49,317
Yes.

523
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:51,217
Thank you.

524
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:56,727
Have you been well?

525
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,377
Is cheating the only thing you can come up with?

526
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:37,947
You dare rub crap on my face?  (T/N: reputation)

527
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:41,457
You told me to get my grades up or you'd take me off our family registry.

528
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:44,677
If you were really my son, you wouldn't have had to cheat in the first place.

529
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:48,507
Even if you did, you wouldn't have gotten caught.

530
00:45:48,507 --> 00:45:52,597
Don't open your mouth, just keep it shut.

531
00:45:53,177 --> 00:45:56,217
There will be another time for that.

532
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:59,857
I got an appointment for a DNA test.

533
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:03,197
Because I have no evidence that you're my son.

534
00:46:09,217 --> 00:46:10,857
Father!

535
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:26,887
What kind of a scary father-son relationship is that?

536
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:43,017
 Call me. Call me. Please ~

537
00:46:52,027 --> 00:46:56,647
 When you're tired and angry, eating is the best! Let's stay strong by eating spicy rice cake!

538
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:05,347

539
00:47:08,957 --> 00:47:11,137
The spiciest one.

540
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,987
Sungyeol!

541
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:18,147
How many texts did you send?

542
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:21,327
Sorry, I was worried, so...

543
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:23,577
You were worried?

544
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:27,417
Hold on a moment! I'm going to bring you the spicy rice cakes that make you happy.

545
00:47:45,357 --> 00:47:47,437
Eat a lot and gain strength.

546
00:47:53,357 --> 00:47:57,877
It's for real. You'll gain strength! Your heart will get hot.

547
00:47:57,897 --> 00:48:02,087
Actually, not hot... Your heart will...

548
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,727
Go pitter-patter.

549
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:07,987
Right, pitter-patter.

550
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:13,017
Don't worry. I know you didn't do that.

551
00:48:13,897 --> 00:48:15,357
How do you know?

552
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:18,617
The you I know, lets people borrow his umbrella when it rains...

553
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,457
and ats with people when they are hungry...

554
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:23,227
and makes people smile when they are feeling down.

555
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:25,257
Am I really that kind of person?

556
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,207
You don't think you are mistaken?

557
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:30,577
I believe you. Woohyun also believes you.

558
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:32,947
Where are Grandma and Woohyun?

559
00:48:32,947 --> 00:48:37,157
Grandmother went up to rest for a bit and Woohyun...

560
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:40,407
he's been ignoring me for a while.

561
00:48:43,227 --> 00:48:45,157
Get up.

562
00:48:46,987 --> 00:48:49,747
Why are you listening to another person's family conversation?

563
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:54,297
You are really bad.

564
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:56,067
Go tell the teacher.

565
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:57,547
That it wasn't Hwang Sungyeol.

566
00:48:57,547 --> 00:49:01,037
I'll say it now, "It was not Hwang Sungyeol." Should I record it for you?

567
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,747
Go tell that it was your and Seokhoon's doing.

568
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:05,477
This is my warning to you.

569
00:49:05,477 --> 00:49:08,077
Warning? From you to me?

570
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:11,317
Wow, this is really touching.

571
00:49:19,487 --> 00:49:23,557
Who's calling?

572
00:49:29,057 --> 00:49:30,887
Hello?

573
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:34,407
Where are you? Where is Woohyun?

574
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:40,167
Lee Seulbi... Woohyun and I are playing well at the playground.

575
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:43,887
You know it, too.  It's going to get real fun right now.

576
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:46,007
No, don't come!

577
00:49:52,017 --> 00:49:53,497
What's the matter?

578
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:56,277
I think Woohyun is in danger.

579
00:49:56,277 --> 00:50:00,397
 ♫ It feels like I’m living in a dream every day these days ♫

580
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,627
  ♫ I’m still not used to this kind of life ♫

581
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:07,457
 ♫ When I’m with you ♫

582
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:12,587
 ♫ the stars twinkle even during the day ♫

583
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:17,247
  ♫ I don’t want to meet anyone else but you ♫

584
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:21,417
  ♫ Without you, I don’t want to do anything ♫

585
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:24,407
 ♫ Even when I’m with my friends ♫

586
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:28,267
 ♫ I’m always thinking about you ♫

587
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:32,297
  ♫ You’re too much for me ♫

588
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:36,477
  ♫ You’re too good for me ♫

589
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:41,757
  ♫ Anyone can see you’re beautiful. 
Everyone wants you ♫

590
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:45,927
 ♫ I can’t believe you’re my girl ♫

591
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:46,877
 Do you like it?

592
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,327
 It's for Woohyun.

593
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:51,597
 I'm sorry, Woohyun.

594
00:50:51,597 --> 00:50:55,227
 Sungyeol and I are fate...

595
00:50:55,227 --> 00:50:58,027
 Just don't get close to Woohyun.

596
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,627
 Are you okay?

597
00:50:59,627 --> 00:51:02,517
 Why is it unlucky if I become a human?

598
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,387
 You hurt others and you don't feel anything?

599
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:07,487
 It feels really weird right here.

600
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:09,497
 Do you like Woohyun?

601
00:51:09,507 --> 00:51:12,107
 I think you'll need to come with me.
