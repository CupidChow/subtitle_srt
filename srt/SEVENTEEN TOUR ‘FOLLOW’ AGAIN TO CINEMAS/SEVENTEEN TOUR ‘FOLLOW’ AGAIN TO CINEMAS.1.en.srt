1
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:43,476
Uh, we were filled
with so much excitement

2
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:47,714
while preparing for this concert.

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,216
We were curious
about how CARATs would react.

4
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,787
Being able to hold a concert

5
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:59,025
in a venue as big as this
is really, really all thanks to you.

6
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,529
Being here brings up so many memories.

7
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,264
Can you believe it?

8
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:05,865
We're at Sangam, Sangam.

9
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,272
It's difficult to put it into words.

10
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,075
There was a time when we wondered

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,911
if we could even fill
a small section over there

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,549
and we'd have to look really hard
to find where our fans were.

13
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,518
One, two, three, fighting!

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,721
I can't believe it.
It's suddenly hitting me.

15
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,956
- Hey.
- Am I overreacting?

16
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,326
- No, but it really feels different.
- It's different from the Asiad Stadium.

17
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,962
Wow, SEVENTEEN are really at Sangam.

18
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,164
- We're here.
- We were here for Dream Concert...

19
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,165
- That's right.
- Dream Concert...

20
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,267
- Our fans only filled up two rows.
- Yes...

21
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,670
We could have never imagined it.

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,340
That we'd fill this entire venue
by ourselves.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,743
It's such an honor

24
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,447
to have created the music we've shared
with you over the last ten years.

25
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,101
Let's go!

26
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,427
Let's go!

27
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,007
Let's go!

28
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,042
Let's go!

29
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,552
Let's go!

30
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,163
Go!

31
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,049
A-yo, South Korea!

32
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,484
Are you ready?

33
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,588
Make some noise!

34
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,693
Let's go!

35
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,350
Say what?

36
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,239
Say what?

37
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,618
Come on!

38
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,726
Let's go!

39
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,901
South Korea!

40
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,636
Let's go!

41
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,749
Say what?

42
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,424
South Korea, put your hands up!

43
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,128
Everybody put your hands up!

44
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,568
Put your hands up!

45
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,000
Everybody put your hands up!

46
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,675
South Korea, put your hands up!

47
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,284
Put your hands up!

48
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,724
Put your hands up!

49
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,236
Are you guys ready to rock with us?

50
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,105
Because we're ready to "Rock with you."

51
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,979
Everybody make some noise!

52
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,418
Let's go!

53
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,124
One! Two!

54
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,959
One, two, three, let's go!

55
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,704
- All together!
- Let's go!

56
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,974
Let's go!

57
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,177
Let's go!

58
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,037
Let's go!

59
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,835
One! Two! Three! Go!

60
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,371
Go!

61
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,550
Let's go!

62
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,667
Let's get our youthful hearts
pumping, shall we?

63
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,270
One, two, three, four, all together!

64
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,404
Let's go!

65
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,840
One, two! One, two, three, go!

66
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,083
Let's leave no regrets behind!

67
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,127
Let's go!

68
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,798
All together!

69
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,025
CARATs, all together!

70
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:48,466
This moment shared with CARATs
is what youth is all about!

71
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,486
I saw their "Super" stage on M Countdown
and WOOZI looked so cool...

72
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,022
There's nothing better
than a group who does great on stage.

73
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,591
I think they are light to us.

74
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,792
- Yes.
-  Yes.

75
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,162
I spent a lot of time
preparing for college entrances

76
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:22,200
and SEVENTEEN's songs
helped me get through that time.

77
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,202
I watched a video of them dancing
and became a fan.

78
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,738
I think
their dance movements are very sleek.

79
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,509
I became a fan
after watching HOSHI dance

80
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,744
and dancing along with him.

81
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,445
SEVENTEEN, we love you!

82
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,615
SEVENTEEN, we love you!

83
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,018
My wife seems to be much happier

84
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,619
after starting to like SEVENTEEN,

85
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,688
so my life has gotten much better.
I'm very happy.

86
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,257
I became a fan
after watching Killing Voice.

87
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,659
I became a fan
watching their live performances.

88
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,461
What drew me in
was their music.

89
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,898
Music, the performance,
the vocals, the rapping...

90
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,485
Members, "BEAUTIFUL."

91
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,554
DINO, SEUNGKWAN, "BEAUTIFUL."

92
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,370
Want to check the sound system first?

93
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,039
- We'll do the sound check--
- Do the sound check.

94
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,454
Is a movie being made?

95
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,255
- Is this footage being used for the movie?
- Yes.

96
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,423
Please make it look cool.

97
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,904
I think it's so cool
how they keep working hard

98
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,706
even as they approach their tenth year.

99
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:15,780
You can really see how each member
has grown so much.

100
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,482
We've seen this concert
many times now.

101
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,649
I don't get bored of it.

102
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:27,525
You can really see that
they continue to grow and improve for us.

103
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,728
I'm grateful that they give it their all
for every stage.

104
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,544
Welcome to Follow festival.

105
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,615
SEVENTEEN Right Here!

106
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,818
Everyone, please get up from your seats!

107
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,419
Stand up!

108
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,788
Stand up!

109
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,825
Let's go!

110
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,094
Ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,696
- Welcome to Follow...
-  ...festival!

112
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,499
Are you all ready to have fun?

113
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,870
There's never been
a concert like this before.

114
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,273
Is this a festival or a concert?

115
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,110
'FOLLOW' AGAIN is back,
sounding grander than ever.

116
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,213
The greatest show you'll ever see on Earth

117
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,415
will begin now!

118
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,953
Let's go!

119
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,207
It's our last day, so have fun with us!
Let's go!

120
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,358
Let's go!

121
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,269
VERNON, let's go!

122
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,607
The Maknaez!

123
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,212
97z!

124
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,784
Let's go!

125
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,222
95z!

126
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,496
Let loose and dance!

127
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,998
We can't lose today either!

128
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,701
One last time, make it fantastic!

129
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,339
Let us introduce ourselves once again.

130
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,042
- Welcome to Follow...
-  ...festival!

131
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,445
With things heating up,
I think it's time for an energy check.

132
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,981
Say, "Ho ho!"

133
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,282
-  Ho ho!
-  Ho ho!

134
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,484
Say, "Oh, yeah!"

135
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,952
-  Oh, yeah!
-  Oh, yeah!

136
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,186
Say, "'FOLLOW' AGAIN!"

137
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,488
'FOLLOW' AGAIN!

138
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,990
Everybody make some noise!

139
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,020
Thank you, Follow show!

140
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,160
It's DK time!

141
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,995
DK time is back!

142
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,930
Let's let loose and go crazy!

143
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,566
DK time goes left and right.

144
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,234
Left, right.

145
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,936
Water strider, let's go!

146
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,739
Left, left.

147
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,309
Right, right.

00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,944

00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,114
Left, right.

151
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,649
Left, right, left, right.

152
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,819
It's JEONGHAN time!

153
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,868
- Everyone! It's S.COUPS time!
- Let's go.

154
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,774
Let's go!

155
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,821
Show time!

00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,865
Go DINO! Go DINO! Go DINO!

00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,253
CARATs, all together!

Everybody put your hands up!

00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,422
Let's go!

162
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,195
Follow! Follow!

Come on!

165
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,687
We love you.

166
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,155
Let's go!

00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,768
Let's go!

Thank you!

169
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,326
Hey CARATs, you guys are so...

170
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,294
"BEAUTIFUL"!

171
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,336
Everyone put your hands up!

172
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,019
- Our CARATs are...

173

00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,007
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

184
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,276
- SEUNGKWAN, why don't we go one more time?
- Sounds good!

185
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,244
Let's just go for it!

186
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,345
Why not?

187
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,247
- Our CARATs are...
-  "BEAUTIFUL!"

188
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,553
Say!

189
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,693
Say!

190
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:36,980
Everyone!

191
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:41,151
You are our gods of music!

192
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,487
Let's go!

193
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,256
Everybody make some noise!

194
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,405
Everybody say!

195
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,108
Everybody one more time
let me hear you say...

196
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,906
All together!

197
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,043
Let's go!

198
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,493
Let's go!

199
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,308
Let's go!

200
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,768
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

201
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,477
Say what?

202
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,180
One more time,
one more time, one more time!

203
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,485
Say what?

204
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,921
Louder, louder, louder, louder!

205
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,827
Okay, South Korea!

206
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,896
Everybody jump!

207
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,204
We love you!

208
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,626
Are you all ready?

209
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,231
Put your hands up!

210
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,107
Let's go!

211
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,016
I love you, too.

212
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,729
Let's go!

213
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,017
SEVENTEEN Right Here!

214
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,174
Go!

215
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,921
Let's go!

216
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,963
Let's go!

217
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,456
South Korea!
Are you ready to sing along with us?

218
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,497
Everybody say!

219
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,101
One more time, one more time!

220
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,772
Everybody say!

221
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,810
One more time, one more time!

222
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,247
Everybody say!

223
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,652
One more time, one more time!

224
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,756
Everybody say!

225
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,761
Okay, let's go!

226
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,477
SEVENTEEN, let's go!

227
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,014
SEVENTEEN! SEVENTEEN!

228
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,220
Encore!

229
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,127
Are you ready...

230
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,230
- With confidence.
- Are you ready to enjoy the encore?

231
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,937
The volume and intensity
of your cheers will...

232
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,573
determine the length of this encore.

233
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,175
Okay!

234
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,143
Do you get what we're saying?

235
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,079
Then, let's get going.

236
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,581
Are you ready?

237
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,551
Make some noise.

238
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,053
-  Oh!
- Okay.

239
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,855
Wow, that charisma.

240
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,657
I think we're good. I think we're good.

241
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,258
- Then...
- Let's get going.

242
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,260
- Wait.
- To the center here.

243
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,762
We have to stand in the center.

244
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,697
Okay, let's go.

245
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,365
DINO, nice sunglasses.

246
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,667
Thanks, MINGYU.

247
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,136
Today is...

248
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,338
- S.COUPS!
- Let's go, our leader.

249
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,473
Our second day has ended,

250
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,642
but we still have an encore to enjoy.

251
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,511
CARATs, have fun with us.

252
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,812
I love you, my members.

253
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:12,481
- You've worked hard these last ten years.
-  Let's go!

254
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,625
Please stand up!

255
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,683
SEVENTEEN, let's go!

256
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,606
Everybody, jump!

257
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:52,641
Right, left, center, jump!

258
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,634
Right now.

259
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,870
- Right now is the time.
- Right now.

260
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,005
Right now.

261
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,641
Right now.

262
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,211
Right now, I'm running to you.

263
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,549
Right now!

264
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,619
I'm running to you.

265
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,290
JOSHUA.

266
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,268
- Let's go, CARATs.
- Jump!

267
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,277
One, two! One, two, three, four!

268
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,273
One, two! One, two, three, four!

269
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:18,781
Scream as loud as you can!

270
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,171
We love you!

271
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,944
You're so lovely.

272
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,659
'FOLLOW' AGAIN in Sangam.

273
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:11,433
Thank you so much for always
making our dreams come true like this.

274
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:15,037
From the moment I became a trainee,

275
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:19,808
I've now dedicated
almost half of my life to being an idol.

276
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:25,814
I want to thank
my fellow members and CARATs

277
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:29,018
for being with me for half of my life.

278
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,487
I really wanted to take
this opportunity to say that.

279
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:39,461
Never forget
that each and every one of you is

280
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,197
precious and deserving of love.

281
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:46,302
I will also do my best to be someone
who gives you more of that love.

282
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:54,643
Wow... Can you believe it?

283
01:11:54,643 --> 01:12:01,083
Holding a concert in Sangam
for two days like this...

284
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:04,453
Our past selves

285
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:09,291
could have never imagined it,
but it came true, thanks to CARATs.

286
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:15,331
This has been so amazing and meaningful.

287
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:22,004
There are moments when I'm left in awe.

288
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:27,543
Being able to hold a concert
in such a big venue

289
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,578
used to be unimaginable.

290
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,515
I remember how I used to think,

291
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,919
"Will we ever be able to fill

292
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:40,823
a big venue like this with just our fans?

293
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,358
I don't think we will."

294
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:47,863
But we never stopped
and continued to work hard

295
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,632
and now, thanks to CARATs,

296
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,937
our unrealistic dream
has become a reality.

297
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,940
I could have never imagined this.

298
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,844
I never dared to imagine
that we could fill a space like this.

299
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,380
We always just focused on doing our best.

300
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,849
That's how we've lived our lives,

301
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,150
and that has led us here.

302
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:13,989
Each and every one of you
is so precious to us.

303
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:19,661
I will work even harder
so we can stay together until the end.

304
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:22,965
We held concerts in March,

305
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,933
and we're holding concerts in April.

306
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,236
I've loved being able to
hold concerts every month.

307
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,173
I wish we could hold 12 concerts a year.

308
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:34,109
Exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly.

309
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,715
Being singers who don't

310
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:43,318
dwell on records is nice and all,

311
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:49,224
but if we keep records in mind

312
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:54,963
as we keep consistently moving forward
and see our dreams come true one by one...

313
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:01,170
wouldn't that raise our self-esteem
and raise yours as well?

314
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:09,244
We will continue to be a group
that keeps moving forward.

315
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:16,218
Taking breaks is good, of course,
but I prefer it when we keep going

316
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:22,024
and bringing you stages
that get better and better every time.

317
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:25,327
There will be
much more ahead in the future,

318
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:29,865
so please keep watching over us.
Thank you.

319
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,202
I gave it my all yesterday

320
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,637
so I woke up this morning
and didn't feel fully recovered.

321
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:40,275
So, during our rehearsal, I thought,
"Today's concert is going to be tough."

322
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,145
But when the concert started
and I saw CARATs,

323
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:47,316
I immediately felt better
and had so much fun today.

324
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,521
DK, CARATs are ready.

325
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:59,127
CARATs! Stay with us forever
and let's grow old together!

326
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,085
Everybody say!

327
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:01,790
Put your hands up!

328
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,802
Everybody say!

329
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,367
Put your hands up!

330
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,723
All together!

331
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,169
Thank you, everybody!

332
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:04,005
- Together!
- Thank you!

333
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,015
Yes.

334
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:19,321
Throughout today's concert,

335
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:26,094
I was able to feel once again
just how much you all love us.

336
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,664
It really warmed my heart.

337
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:34,703
For making someone ordinary like me
become someone special,

338
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:38,039
thank you so much, CARATs.

339
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,312
I saw a banner that said,

340
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:50,252
"DK, I will love you with no regrets."

341
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:54,956
I feel like CARATs
really raise our self-esteem.

342
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,029
You know... If I'm honest,

343
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:05,000
I may be a very ordinary person...

344
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:12,007
but so many people say
that I give them courage

345
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:15,277
and help them find hopes and dreams.

346
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:20,515
I promise to be
a better person in the future

347
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,285
for you all...

348
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:33,028
I will work harder to be
a better person for you.

349
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:40,936
I want to work harder
and bring you many more hopes and dreams.

350
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:47,175
And thank you for giving me
so much love over the last two days.

351
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:53,248
Thank you so much for raising
my confidence and self-esteem.

352
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,217
Thank you so much for today.

353
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:56,651
Doahae!

354
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:04,526
Uh, there's so much I want to say.

355
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,828
I want to speak well,

356
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,633
so my heart is racing right now.

357
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:17,606
When the decision was made

358
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:23,745
that I wouldn't be participating
in last year's Seoul concerts,

359
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,951
the others told me,
"SEUNGKWAN, rest well."

360
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:34,322
They said things like,
"Don't think about anything and rest."

361
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:39,694
I remember watching the concert last year

362
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:41,696
and seeing CARATs sharing so much love

363
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:45,567
and the members repaying CARATs
by working hard on stage.

364
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,204
I was able to rest well while also feeling
a greater sense of responsibility.

365
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,674
When we were singing "Cheers to youth,"

366
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:55,377
I saw a flower petal float past me.

367
01:21:56,144 --> 01:22:01,950
You know how you sometimes find yourself
putting meaning into something so small?

368
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:08,356
I thought about if...

369
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,093
Moonbin had heard this song,

370
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:15,330
he would have told me,
"Hey, SEUNGKWAN, this song is so good."

371
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:34,616
He would show up
to every one of our concerts.

372
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:41,089
It's certainly a difficult emotion
to process, but still,

373
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:48,029
I promised myself to do my best
to share my love with you.

374
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:55,070
And to my fellow members...

375
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,755
...who are always beside me
and giving me strength

376
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:20,195
and to all of our staff who helped
the release of "Dandelion" come true...

377
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,897
thank you so much.

378
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,037
I know so well

379
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,307
what kind of person I am to you.

380
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:37,078
So I promise to do my best
to live to the fullest.

381
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,813
Thank you so much.

382
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:47,622
It's such an honor to be holding
a concert at the Sangam World Cup Stadium.

383
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,691
Life isn't always
a straight path that goes up.

384
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,761
Even if we find ourselves
on a downward path one day,

385
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,829
even if the waves subside,

386
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,464
even if it's not a big venue like this,

387
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,267
even if it's a small venue,

388
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,504
I hope CARATs and the members
can gather again

389
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:04,005
and have fun like we did today.

390
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,174
This is a historic moment.

391
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,542
That's right.

392
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,910
Even if our popularity falls,

393
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,545
- we will stay together for a long time.
- So true!

394
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,414
- Before that, let's rock this stage.
- Yes.

395
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:13,314
One, two, three.

396
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:14,449
Fighting!

397
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:20,388
The Sangam World Cup Stadium
is located in Mapo,

398
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:23,258
and I'm originally from here.

399
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,896
I got a text from my mother,

400
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:33,501
and she said that it was so cool
seeing us hold a concert here.

401
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:38,506
Thank you so much for making SEVENTEEN
sons our parents can be proud of.

402
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,281
Huh?

403
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:48,616
Is that you, Fe Turin?

404
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:52,687
You called?

405
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,158
Fe Turin has so many fans.

406
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,461
That's right. Chunsunie, make some noise!

407
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,731
Is your fandom name Chunsunie?

408
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,100
- Yes, yes.
- Chunsunie...

409
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:06,935
Yes, yes.

410
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,038
If I'm being honest,

411
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,508
I have some regrets
about "DINO and the Guitar."

412
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,611
- Yes, yes, I understand.
- We'll give you one more chance!

413
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,746
- I really could have done better.
- Wait, then!

414
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:21,149
- Do your encore comments freestyle.
- Yes.

415
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:22,784
Freestyle your closing comments.

416
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,386
Wait, Kitae, are you ready
with the guitar?

417
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,023
Okay, since DINO said
he has regrets about it...

418
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:30,592
Hey, move to the center.

419
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:33,194
...we'll give him more time
for his closing remarks

420
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,562
to do "DINO and the Guitar."

421
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:35,663
- Take your time.
- This is new.

422
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,699
Please bring down the lifts
when he starts singing.

423
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,701
Instrumental, please!

424
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,302
Encore comments.

425
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,205
- Lift down.
- What's the theme, DINO?

426
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:45,673
So new, so new.

Sing louder!

455

Everyone, please stand up.

456
01:29:58,626 --> 01:29:59,827
Stand up!

457
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,597
-  Let's go.
- That was good.

458
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:03,898
It's time for...

459
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,299
infinite...

460
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:07,034
"VERY NICE." Let's go.

461
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:09,337
- VERY...
-  NICE!

462
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,708
Everybody jump!

463
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:27,748
Let's go!

464
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:47,101
Everybody jump!

465
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,590
Make some noise!

466
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,234
Okay! Okay!

467
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:57,772
Okay! Everybody jump!

468
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,231
Nope, we're going to keep going. VERY...

469
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,499
NICE!

470
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:38,946
- Okay!
- Okay!

471
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,815
Everybody jump!

472
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:52,960
Okay! Okay!

473
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:55,563
Okay!

474
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:56,964
Everybody jump!

475
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:18,386
Wow, that was amazing.

476
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,855
Why don't we have all our CARATs
on the ground floor

477
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:23,057
and our CARATs on the second
to fifth floors sing together?

478
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:24,125
- That sounds great.
- All together?

479
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,526
I want all of us to gather our strength.

480
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:28,629
- All together, SEVENTEEN in the front.
- They're so loud today.

481
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:30,765
- Let's all sing it together.
- Okay, okay, let's do that.

482
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:32,533
Five, six, seven, eight.

483
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,772
What?

484
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:40,675
Say what?

485
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,947
Come on, come on!

486
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,417
Okay!

487
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,921
All right! All right!

488
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,492
Okay! Everybody jump!

489
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,581
- That was cool, that was cool.
- They're doing great.

490
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:23,584
- We heard CARATs singing earlier, right?
- Yes.

491
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,420
I don't think they have any plans
to go home tonight.

492
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:29,824
- Let's just go for it. VERY...
- NICE!

493
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:37,198
Let's keep jumping!

494
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:39,867
Have fun, have fun!

495
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,171
- Okay!
- Okay!

496
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:46,407
Everybody jump!

497
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:51,946
One last time! Fe Turin!

498
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,748
Everybody jump!

499
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,069
So good.

500
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:17,037
Nice! So great at dancing!

501
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:18,305
Today is freestyle day.

502
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:20,541
There's something I want to see.

503
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:23,110
I want to see everybody
put their cameras down

504
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:26,413
- and jump together with us.
- Yes.

505
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:29,250
Yes, let's all have fun together.

506
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,620
Let's shake up the world together!

507
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,357
There is no end for us.

508
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:39,360
Shake it up. Don't try to stop us!

509
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,462
- VERY...
- NICE!

510
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:45,299
Let's go!

511
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:48,035
Okay!

512
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:50,337
Let's go!

513
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:53,207
Jump, jump!

514
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:55,976
CARATs on the fifth floor!

515
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:57,878
Everybody jump! Let's go!

516
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:23,037
Left side!

517
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:25,272
- Center!
- Everybody, jump!

518
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:48,462
Wow, CARATs are really great at jumping.

519
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:50,598
- Nice, nice.
- Let's head back now.

520
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:52,466
- Let's head in.
- In Sangam...

521
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:54,034
- Guys...
- We had so much fun.

522
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,769
It's because my stomach hurts now.
My stomach--

523
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:56,704
Let's head back now.

524
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:57,605
Let's go.

525
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,674
Thank you so much for today, CARATs!

526
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:02,343
"Thank you"?

527
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,446
They're making a movie
out of today's show,

528
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:06,981
so we need to do this for the cameras.

529
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:09,550
Let's move a little to the left
so we're centered correctly.

530
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,018
- We're good now.
- Okay, okay.

531
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:13,254
Wow, this is perfect for the movie.

532
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:16,457
Until now, this has been SEVENTEEN

533
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:18,792
filling Sangam to the brim.

534
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,028
- Say the name!
-  SEVENTEEN!

535
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:22,062
Thank you.

536
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:24,398
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

537
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:40,514
Yes, and so--

538
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:43,384
