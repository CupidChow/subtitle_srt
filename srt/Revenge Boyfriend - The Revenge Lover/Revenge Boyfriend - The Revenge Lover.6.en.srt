00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:02,496
I love you.

2
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:03,869
I love you too.

3
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:08,095
- In two weeks, you'll be relocated to Osaka.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:13,323
It might be orchestrated by my mother
just to separate us.

5
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,484
I'm Yugo Kato from the same team as you.

6
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:17,226
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,213
Pleased to meet you.

8
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:33,821
Why are you here all of a sudden?

9
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,810
You know why.

10
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:42,591
Did you set up Maika's transfer?

11
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,529
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,532
Please don't act like you don't know anything.

13
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:51,589
When I wasn't around,
I heard from Akiyama that you met her.

14
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:55,572
I got a hunch after he told me what happened.

15
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:59,662
It can't be a coincidence that she got transferred
right when I wasn't around.

16
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:07,033
I think when she heard that she could
work on a new project, she left you behind.

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,753
I wonder how long it will last when you are apart.

18
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,389
Hattori, good evening.

19
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,284
Good evening.

20
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,817
I'm sorry. Did I catch you at the wrong time?

21
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,939
Oh, no, it's fine.
[Shun Calling]

22

It's okay.

00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,121
[I will call you later.]

24
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,535
But...

25
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:00,776
Actually, it was my boyfriend.

26
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:02,858
It'll probably take a while.

27
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,171
Ah, I see.

28
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:07,634
- Sorry.
- No worries.

29
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:14,443
Is a long-distance relationship lonely?

30
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:19,154
Well, sometimes I feel lonely.

31
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:23,025
But now, I'm trying to focus on my job.

32
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:26,318
Do you like dessert?

33
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,002
Oh, yes, I like it very much.

34
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,095
There's a delicious cake shop nearby.

35
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:33,580
Their Baumkuchen is exquisite.

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,957
Really?

37
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:37,756
I'll buy some next time.

38
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:41,374
I remember there was a good Baumkuchen shop
near the headquarters.

39
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,231
I like that one too.

40
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,899
I know. I often went there to buy dessert.

41
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,219
Do you have a sweet tooth?

42
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,348
President, it's time for the meeting.

43
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,106
Right, I'll go now.

44
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,271
Sorry, the number you have just called
is unavailable.

45
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,045
I'd like to coordinate with
the marketing department

46
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:37,644
and create a story that conveys the appeal,
and vision of this service more strongly.

47
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:40,087
We should move forward together
to craft a narrative.

48
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:45,057
We should discuss this with Mr. Taylor in LA.

49
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,936
We should think about
expanding the development team.

50
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:54,116
Excuse me, I would like to discuss
how to share space utilization.

51
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:57,702
Indeed, we might be able to
host events for inbound tourism.

52
00:03:57,702 --> 00:04:01,509
Oh, the weekday occupancy rate is dropping.
We should discuss it too.

53
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,792
The check-out...

54
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:08,817
I couldn't understand half of the content.

55
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:12,176
It was completely useless.

56
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,848
Hi there.

57
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,639
Are you okay?

58
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:22,394
I apologize for this earlier.

59
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:28,525
You just transferred here, so, don't worry.

60
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:30,995
But...

61
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:34,198
If you have any problems, please feel free to ask.

62
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:37,903
Okay.

63
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,653
- See you.
- I'm leaving first.

64
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,511
See you.

[Episode 6]

67
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,006
Hi.

68
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:51,107
Hi there.

69
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:53,883
Here.

70
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,230
- What's this?
- You're doing great.

71
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,407
Don't stress yourself too much.

72
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,369
Thank you very much.

73
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,880
There's something I'd like to ask.

74
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,458
Yes?

75
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:12,752
It's about the work flow.

76
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:17,222
I haven't quite figured out
the strengths of each department yet.

77
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,457
The weekday operational rate
has been evidently declining.

78
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:22,853
You can see this data in these materials.

79
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:27,898
How about a weekday-only plan for business guests?

80
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,947
We could extend the check-out time until 2 p.m.,

81
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:36,089
or utilize the currently unused space
by turning it into a working space.

82
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,447
I see.

83
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,396
Enhancing the loyalty program is effective,

84
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:47,300
but we need a different approach
to attracting weekday customers.

85
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,052
Good luck with your work!

86
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,615
Do I have to go to Tokyo to give the presentation?

87
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:25,382
You put forward the proposal.

88
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:27,231
It was well-received internally.

89
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,914
We want to propose it to our clients as well.

90
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:33,084
It's a great opportunity
and we want you to finish it.

91
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:39,925
But it's not fully prepared enough
to present it outside yet.

92
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:45,215
The business trip is next week,
so there's time to refine it.

93
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:49,021
That's right.

94
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:52,301
You're a part of such a big project.

Please don't waste this chance.

96
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:05,116
Yes, I'll try my best.

97
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:15,711
First, let's review the previous proposal.

- Good work today.
- See you.

00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,927
Okay, I'm off too.

101
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:51,329
Great, I think you compiled it well.

102
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,961
Really?

103
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:59,024
It's thanks to your advice.

and do your best for the presentation.

No problem, I'm just going home now.

Why are you going home so late?

Let me see if I can get you back to headquarters.

113
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:34,117
No, it's okay.

114
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:38,089
I want to finish the work I've been assigned.

115
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,711
I got it.

116
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,585
You're strong-minded, Maika.

117
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:50,339
Everyone at the branch is very kind, and
the environment is nice, so I think I can do it.

118
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,632
When can we meet each other?

119
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:56,628
I want to go there,
but I can't seem to find the time.

120
00:09:56,628 --> 00:10:00,861
Next week, I'm going to be in Tokyo
for a presentation.

121
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,575
Really?

122
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,193
Will you be staying here?

123
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,240
I have to be back the same day.

124
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,535
I see.

125
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,334
We won't be able to meet leisurely soon.

126
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,960
That's right.

127
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,713
I'll work hard and look forward to seeing you.

128
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,078
Yeah.

00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:33,387
Do you miss me?

130
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,075
Huh?

131
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:37,478
Well, it hasn't been the same for me.

132
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,856
I'm feeling down because of the long distance.

133
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,798
You do?

134
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:50,447
I want to see you too.

135
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,261
I want to see you right now.

I'm missing you.

138
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:09,573
Oh, hello there.

139
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:12,426
I met a colleague who helped me before.

140
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:15,515
I'm always getting support from him.

141
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,082
He is a team leader too.

142
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:21,994
He has helped me a lot.

143
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,857
I see.

144
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,955
Shall we go home together?

145
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,685
Oh, sure.

146
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:31,344
Huh? Going home together?

147
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,494
I live close to Mr. Kato.

148
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,791
I see.

149
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,587
I'll call you again when I get home.

150
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,510
Okay.

151
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,421
- The Tsutenkaku Tower...
- Do you know it?

152
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,413
Yes. I visited it when I came on a trip before.

153
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:08,304
Oh, did you just watch it from afar?
Or you went up?

154
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:11,057
- Yes, I did go up.
- Wow, really?

155
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:14,163
- Yes.
- There are also skewered cutlets.

156
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:16,356
Wow, I want to eat skewered cutlets!

157
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:18,758
Skewered cutlets, and then...

158
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:20,205
Oh, wait.

159
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:24,510
Here. I bought it during lunch break.

160
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,364
I was planning to give it to you tomorrow, but...

161
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:28,797
Huh?

162
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,359
Oh, it's a thank-you for the energy drink.

163
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:36,160
Thank you for always being considerate,
and helping me with overtime work.

164
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,847
Hope you like it.

165
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:46,976
Thanks to you,
I feel like I've been doing a bit better.

166
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,200
You must be tired, so please take a good rest.

167
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
Have a good night.

168
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,698
Good night.

169
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,240
Hello.

170
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,731
Yes.

171
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:32,402
It's going smoothly.

172
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:37,907
Please don't worry. I will handle Maika properly.

173
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,609
President?

174
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:50,379
Here you go.

175
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:05,103
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the system

176
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:09,130
to improve the efficiency
of the overall operation.

177
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,716
After introducing this system,

178
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:16,981
the cost will be decreased by 30%
compared to the conventional one.

179
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:21,833
It improves not only working efficiency,
but also information management.

180
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,550
Thank you for today.

181
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,633
Thank you. I appreciate your time.

182
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,960
That's an excellent proposal.
We'll consider it positively.

183
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,926
I will contact you later.

184
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:33,979
Yes, thank you.

185
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:36,049
Thank you.

186
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,205
Good job.

187
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:54,471
Thank you.

188
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,785
Let's go.

189
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:57,236
Sure.

190
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:01,923
Yes, it finished successfully.

191
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:05,900
I have a good feeling about it.

192
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,034
I will return home with Mr. Kato.
[Satori's schedule for the 12th]

193
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,698
[10 AM Kijima Trading meeting
12:30 PM Crescendo Hotel Inspection]

194
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:15,130
Yes. I will send a report
when I go to the office tomorrow.

195
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,132
Kato.

196
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:21,061
I've already sent a report.

197
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:24,669
Great job. How about we go to have lunch?

198
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:25,756
Okay.

199
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,308
Watch out!

200
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:36,738
S-Sorry.

201
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:38,768
Are you okay?

202
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,405
I'm fine.

203
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,991
Shall we go?

204
00:15:43,598 --> 00:15:45,079
Okay.

205
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,939
Well, as a reward for your hard work,
let me treat you to a meal.

206
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,266
Oh, thank you.

207
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:07,508
Excuse me, could you wait for a moment
before we go in?

208
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,268
- Huh?
- I'll be back soon.

209
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,403
Sorry to keep you waiting.

210
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,491
Earlier, your wrist seemed injured.

211
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,785
You went all the way to get these?

212
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:33,291
Yeah, it was my fault.

213
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,044
You're making it a big deal.

214
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:39,369
But it did hurt a little.

215
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:41,053
Thank you.

216
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:42,576
I knew it.

217
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:44,802
Please let me have a look.

218
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,418
- It's alright.
- Show me your wrist, please.

219
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,514
It's okay.

220
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:52,828
As I expected, it's swollen.

221
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:57,858
If the swelling doesn't go down with the
cold compress, please go to the hospital.

222
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:00,551
I'm fine, it's not a big deal.

223
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:03,321
I get used to the pain quickly.

224
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:11,162
No matter what kind of pain, once you're
used to it, you become numb and feel nothing.

225
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,040
So don't worry.

226
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:23,091
Don't say that you'll get used to the pain.

227
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,807
When you have someone who can take care of it
right by you, there's no need to endure it.

228
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,662
What's the plan after this?

229
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,695
There is a meeting in Daikanyama at 4 PM.

230
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,018
After that...

231
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:46,490
- Hattori.
- Yes?

232
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,761
There's something under your eyes.

233
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:50,788
Huh, what is it?

234
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:54,087
Please close your eyes for a moment.

235
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:56,958
Okay, thank you.

236
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:06,384
What are you doing?

237
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:09,804
Shun?

238
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:14,274
I mentioned him before.

239
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:15,976
He's been helping me at my new location.

240
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:18,881
This is Mr. Kato, my team leader.

241
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:23,174
Well, I believe you might already know,
this is Shun Satori.

242
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:26,486
My boyfriend.

243
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,072
What?

244
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:31,460
Your boyfriend is the president?

245
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,132
Yes.

246
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,429
President Satori, nice to meet you.

247
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,253
No need for greetings.

248
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:41,232
I'm asking about what happened.

249
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:46,136
Well, since the presentation meeting has ended,
I thought we could have lunch.

250
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:47,564
That's not it.

251
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:51,434
I'm asking what you did to Maika just now.

252
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,627
What do you mean?

253
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,978
There was something on Hattori's face.

254
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:58,853
So, I was just trying to remove it.

255
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,815
Did I perhaps cause a misunderstanding?

256
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:08,167
There's nothing you need to worry about.

257
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,073
Please be assured.

258
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,857
He's right.

259
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:14,786
Nothing is going on.

260
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,752
I see.

261
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:26,256
It seems I was mistaken.

262
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,216
Maika, come here for a bit.

263
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,721
Sure.

264
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:42,021
Nothing happened?

265
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,524
Of course.

266
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,032
Shun.

267
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,663
There isn't anything going on.

268
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,588
Shun.

269
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:11,676
I only love you.

270
00:20:13,823 --> 00:20:15,237
Okay.

271
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:22,436
I'm sorry. I became a bit anxious
because of this long distance.

272
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:27,820
Shun?

273
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,180
Yes?

274
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,319
I should be back soon.

275
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,280
Mr. Kato is waiting.

276
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:38,327
Don't mention his name.

277
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:58,300
You've taken quite a long time.

278
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:03,502
Anyway, quickly make them break up.

279
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:06,941
Because of that woman, the engagement is ruined.

280
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:12,427
If you keep hesitating,
you're going to miss out on the reward.

281
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:16,220
Try your best quickly and make them break up.

282
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:23,577
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

283
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:26,853
No. Is everything alright?

284
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,240
Huh?

285
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,814
It seems that I caused some confusion.

286
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:35,284
Oh, it's fine.

287
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:37,470
It has been cleared up.

288
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:39,377
That's great.

289
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:48,731
Yes, and I saw a new side of Shun, and I'm glad.

290
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:55,602
Please just ignore that.

291
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,215
I'm sorry.

292
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,608
Is the pain still lingering?

293
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:17,093
Huh? No, I'm fine now.

294
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:19,393
That's a relief.

295
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:21,714
By the way, the lunch was delicious.

296
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:23,891
Thank you for the meal.

297
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:29,900
What are you...

298
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,621
Hattori, are you really sure you want to
continue your relationship with him in the future?

299
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:44,089
I've heard that the president
receives many marriage proposals.

300
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:49,416
The president's personal life
greatly impacts those around him.

301
00:22:50,157 --> 00:22:53,129
He is a president and an heir.

302
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:56,009
He has too many responsibilities.

303
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:02,793
Hattori, I don't want you to get hurt
because of him.

304
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:09,354
So, I think it's better to choose someone
who can protect you.

305
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,067
Someone like me.

306
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:16,313
What?

307
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,285
Didn't you notice?

308
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:25,245
From the first time we met,
I've been interested in you.

309
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:31,250
Tell me, can't you see me in that way?

310
00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:38,967
I want you to choose me,
not the president.

311
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:48,750
She's a very important person to me.

312
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,839
I don't think that it's any difficult for you
to win over such an ordinary woman.

313
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,602
Can't you let me have at least one thing?

314
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,475
I'm sorry for getting you involved in this.

315
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:59,312
I get it. I'll break up with Shun.
