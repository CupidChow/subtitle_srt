1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,148
- Let's end our fake relationship today.
- What?

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:07,522
So, you are the reason
Shun stopped listening to me?

3
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:11,053
Could you please respect Shun's feelings?

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,040
You must know your place.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,691
What can I do for Shun?

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:19,244
There are things you can do, Hattori.

7
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:25,408
Shun!

8
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:32,331
I found you!

9
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:41,340
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:45,074
Because...

11
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:53,394
I was afraid that you'd leave again
just like you did back then.

12
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,316
Maika...

13
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,115
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:15,124
When we first met,
I immediately recognized you.

15
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:23,421
The memory of being rejected by you just
rushed back, and I thought about getting revenge.

16
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,634
I purposely got closer to you for it.

17
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,014
Shun.

18
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,916
But...

19
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:38,891
I thought all I had for you was hate.

20
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,664
I was wrong.

21
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:44,271
When I saw you again,

22
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:49,311
I clearly remembered
why I was attracted to you in high school.

23
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,738
Maika, can I borrow your notes?

24
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:53,181
- Sure.
- Awesome! Thank you!

25
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:57,249
You were cheerful, and kind.

26
00:01:57,913 --> 00:02:02,379
You treated everyone equally,
and you always maintained integrity.

27
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:08,177
You haven't changed even a bit.

28
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,598
You are as wonderful as ever.

29
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:20,064
You saved me once again.

30
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,567
Thank you.

31
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:32,493
I'm sorry for involving you
in my personal problems.

32
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,502
Here.

33
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:50,802
I'm sorry for returning it so late.

34
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,720
This...

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,479
You know...

36
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:06,234
You saved me.

37
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:16,328
When we became friends,
every day was fun.

38
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:21,789
I was excited to meet you,
and read more and more books with you.

39
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:22,942
Hattori...

40
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:24,661
And then...

41
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,338
I love you.

42
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:29,258
I was so happy when you told me how you felt.

43
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,346
But...

44
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:44,511
at that time,
I didn't have confidence in myself.

45
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:52,519
I thought that I wasn't worthy of you.

46
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,035
That's why...

47
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:03,167
I couldn't bring myself to go and meet you.

48
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:08,088
Even now, I don't think I'm worthy.

49
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,093
But...

50
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:24,999
I...

51
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:30,711
I still love you.

52
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,788
Shun?

53
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,832
When you said we were not a good match...

54
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,837
I thought you were talking about me.

55
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,465
What?

56
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,942
I love you.

57
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:47,549
This moment feels like a dream...

58
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:52,276
to have you in my arms.

59
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,376
Thank you for coming back...

60
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:13,213
into my life again.

61
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:28,979
Maika.

62
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,249
Shun.

63
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,072
I love you.

64
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,287
I love you too.

65
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:40,602
[Episode 5]

66
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:44,052
I'm doing it again.

67
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:46,594
I just keep remembering it all over again.

68
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:49,322
Maika, are you ready?

69
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,805
Yes.

70
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,908
Yeah. You're looking cute today.

71
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:16,465
Since we're here,
why don't we explore our old town together?

72
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,395
Really?

73
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:20,173
You think we can go now?

74
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:27,879
Is there an elementary school around here?

75
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,576
Oh, it's ahead.

76
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,273
I graduated from that school.

77
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,759
Really?

78
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:39,171
So, is your home nearby?

79
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,747
Yes, it is.

80
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:45,574
- My home...
- Maika?

81
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,220
Mom.

82
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,994
- Huh?
- Maika, why are you here?

83
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:02,025
Uh, well...

84
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,883
Who is he?

85
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,055
Nice to meet you, I'm dating Maika.

86
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,869
I'm Shun Satori.

87
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:13,228
Dating?

88
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:17,772
Pardon me, but kind of job do you do?

89
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,654
I work at the same company as Maika.

90
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,941
BirdLeft.

91
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,326
What? The president?

92
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:34,493
That's amazing, Maika.

93
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:38,701
You've found a stable man! In that case,
both your dad and I fully support you!

94
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,765
Mom.

95
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,969
Your last boyfriend
was just an ordinary employee.

96
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,933
I was worried about you before.

97
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,380
But I feel relieved now.

98
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,273
You are clever, Maika.

99
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:51,886
Mom, can you stop saying that?

100
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,568
Since you're here, why don't you come to our home?

101
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:59,102
We'd love to hear about your work,
and your plans for the future.

102
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:01,070
Uh, well, I mean...

103
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:08,944
Uh, actually, we're here for work,
and we must return to the company right away.

104
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,790
Oh, I see.

105
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,960
Yes. I'll come another day.

106
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,261
Is that so? What a pity.

107
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:20,037
We'll take our leave now.

108
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,686
Let's go.

109
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,555
Don't let him go, Maika.

110
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm so sorry about my mom,
She is so blatant sometimes.

111
00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:42,315
My mom has always judged people...

112
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,112
by their status or reputation.

113
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,827
When I stayed with her,
I felt suffocated every single day.

114
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,791
We are both in the same boat.

115
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,555
What?

116
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,285
Nothing.

117
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:10,135
Your mother is just worried about you.

118
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,128
Maybe you're right.

119
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:22,022
I know it's her way of showing love, but...

120
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:42,751
Right now, I am happy to be here with you.

121
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,380
Me too.

122
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,677
Let's stay together forever.

123
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,880
Yes.

124
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:05,241
So, are you officially in a relationship now?

125
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:10,153
Yeah. Now I feel like I can work even harder.

126
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:18,655
I can see you're much more calm and relaxed now.

127
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,981
Huh?

128
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,165
It's because of Ms. Hattori, right?

129
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,772
Did I look stern before?

130
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,558
Yes.

131
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:33,801
But I'm glad to see you happy.

132
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,643
Oh, it's about time.

133
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:44,558
Is the development material
for Hoshikawa Resort ready?

134
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,011
Yes.

135
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:49,901
Just in case,
I also gathered the real estate data.

136
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,137
Oh, right.

137
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,743
Ms. Mitsuko sent this to you.

138
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,406
Matchmaking photos?

139
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:09,833
Yes, she came here,
and brought these photos a few days ago.

140
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,089
About Ms. Hattori,
I don't believe Ms. Mitsuko will do nothing.

141
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,361
It might be best to be cautious.

142
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,773
Don't worry.

143
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,989
I will protect her.

144
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:35,867
- It's over.
- You finished it? Amazing!

145
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:40,934
Yes, but we need to gather
Kumai Consulting's project data today.

146
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:44,308
You're enthusiastic. Did something good happen?

147
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:47,036
Oh no, I just want to do my best.

148
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:51,202
That's reassuring.
Then please present it at the next meeting.

149
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:52,922
Sure.

150
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:56,259
Oh, it's about time.

151
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:04,312
Would you like to have dinner at home tonight?

152
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,744
Are you ready?

153
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,480
Oh, yes.

154
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,943
[Sure.]

155
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,328
Come on in.

156
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,500
Sorry for being late.

157
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,301
The meeting ran longer.

158
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,404
You didn't have to hurry so much.

159
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,511
I finished work early today.

160
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:38,218
But I wanted to meet you soon.

161
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,848
Really? Thank you.

162
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:50,557
Wow, this is amazing! It looks delicious.

163
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,820
You've prepared everything so perfectly.

164
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,054
Next time, I'll help you.

165
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:04,285
It's fine, you can do it in your spare time.

166
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:09,189
Here. Taste it.

167
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,782
Oh, thank you.

168
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:14,243
And this. Taste it.

169
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:19,551
Jeez... Shun, you're spoiling me too much.

170
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:24,583
Well, next time it will be my turn.

171
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,822
Maybe over the weekend,
we'll have dinner at your house.

172
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:31,298
Sure. What would you like to eat?

173
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,941
Let's see.

174
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,325
Excuse me, I have to take it.

175
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,229
What's up?

176
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:53,334
President, I'm sorry to disturb you
during your break.

177
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:55,869
Is there anything wrong?

178
00:15:55,869 --> 00:16:00,248
We have received a message
from the North American branch.

179
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:08,391
Did anything happen?

180
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:15,321
I'll have to go to New York
on a business trip tomorrow.

181
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:18,458
What? Tomorrow?

182
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,844
There's a problem with the contract,

183
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:24,574
and if we don't solve it right away,
the deal might fall through.

184
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,454
I'll have to stay there for at least two weeks.

185
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:33,124
I see.

186
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,719
Sorry, I can't be with you this weekend.

187
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,978
I'll miss you.

188
00:16:55,412 --> 00:17:01,193
But, I'll use that time
to improve my cooking skills.

189
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,452
Thank you.

190
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,539
I'm looking forward to it.

191
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,050
The Board has sent us a letter.

192
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,440
I apologize for the sudden notice.

193
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,958
You'll handle the Smart Hotel project
from the initial stages.

194
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:36,020
In two weeks, you'll be relocated to Osaka.

195
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,097
Yes, sir.

196
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:45,029
In two weeks, I'll be in Osaka.

197
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:51,801
In two weeks? That's quite sudden.

198
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,536
Yeah.

199
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:58,543
But isn't it a good thing?
You will have a chance to manage a big project.

200
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:01,004
Yes.

201
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:08,386
But... why do you think they chose me?

202
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,712
Maybe someone recognized your talent?

203
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,617
Be confident.

204
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:21,483
I'm happy about the challenge at work, but...

205
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:25,531
Being in a long-distance relationship with Shun...

206
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,154
And...

207
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,988
I'll be in Osaka

208
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,942
before Shun arrives back from New York.
[I've been transferred to the Osaka office.]

209
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:53,565
What the...

210
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,104
What's wrong?

211
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,105
Did you know that
Maika had been transferred to Osaka?

212
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,005
Osaka?

213
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:04,317
I'm sorry, I was not aware of that.

214
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,143
Something feels off...

215
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,743
This business trip came up so suddenly.

216
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,472
Hello.

217
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:26,549
Sorry, I wasn't aware of your transfer.

218
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:32,846
It might be orchestrated by my mother
just to separate us.

219
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,930
Is that so?

220
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,970
I'll check when I get back to Japan.

221
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,511
I'll try to get you back to headquarters
as soon as possible.

222
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,164
So...

223
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:49,336
Don't worry, it's fine.

224
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:51,151
Huh?

225
00:19:51,151 --> 00:20:01,706
If it's your mother's instructions,
I want to manage this project to the end.

226
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,818
Maika.

227
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:06,242
I want to achieve results properly.

228
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:09,674
I want to be acknowledged by your mother.

229
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,748
And...

230
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:18,057
I want to become a woman more worthy of you.

231
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,632
Well...

232
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,108
For me, you're already worthy enough.

233
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,444
But...

234
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:37,993
Yeah, if you want, I'll support you completely.

235
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:40,912
Thank you.

236
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:46,723
But promise me, you won't push yourself.

237
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,128
I promise.

238
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,641
I came from the Tokyo headquarters.

239
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,475
My name is Maika Hattori.

240
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:04,268
I hope to know you all,

241
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:07,660
and quickly catch up with the project
in order for things to proceed smoothly.

242
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,354
Thank you for your support.

243
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,237
Welcome aboard!

244
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:28,920
I hope I can fit in soon.

245
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:31,996
[You do not have permission to access this file]

246
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:38,066
[You do not have permission to access this file]

247
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,512
Huh?

248
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:42,421
This system is different from the main office.

249
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,491
What should I do?

250
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:47,191
- Hattori.
- Yes?

251
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,874
Is there anything you need help with?

252
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:56,445
Um, well... Where should I enter these numbers?

253
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:59,718
Right. I will help you with that.

254
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,423
So, this is how you open it.

255
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,789
And make entries.

256
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:08,785
Thank you.

257
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,054
- And you are...
- I'm Yugo Kato from the same team as you.

258
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:13,707
Nice to meet you.

259
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,726
Nice to meet you too.

260
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:19,713
The operation of that system is
quite different from headquarters, right?

261
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,188
Huh?

262
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:23,938
I worked at headquarters a few years ago.

263
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:27,110
I've been in Kansai since the transfer.

264
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,598
I see.

265
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,028
Initially, it's challenging
because things are different.

266
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,774
Let's try to work together. Don't be too nervous.

267
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:38,011
Yes. Thank you in advance.

268
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:43,141
And there are great restaurants
worth trying around here.

269
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,890
Feel free to ask me if you want to try any.

270
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,307
Okay.

271
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:49,311
Well, well.

272
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:53,296
Hattori, that's the part
where you should have jumped in.

273
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:58,318
Oh, I see.

274
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,861
Just kidding. I'm Asaka.

275
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:02,368
Nice to meet you.

276
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:03,881
Pleased to meet you.

277
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,787
If there's anything you don't understand,
feel free to ask.

278
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:08,602
- Yes. Thank you.
- Alrighty.

279
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:14,455
Are you any less nervous now?

280
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:17,081
Yes. A little.

281
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,114
Thanks to you, I feel relaxed.

282
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,381
Hattori, can I have a word with you?

283
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,805
Sure.

284
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,208
Do you have some time later?

285
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,699
Yes, sure.

286
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,136
If you have any problems, please feel free to ask.

287
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,876
Being apart from each other...

288
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:52,362
I wonder how long it will last.

289
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:56,763
When you have someone you can rely on
right by you, there's no need to hold back.

290
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:59,229
I want you to choose me, not the president.
