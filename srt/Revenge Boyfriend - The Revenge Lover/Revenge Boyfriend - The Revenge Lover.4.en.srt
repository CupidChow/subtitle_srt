1
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:04,972
Why don't we become a real couple?

2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:08,338
Please, don't joke about this.

3
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:12,181
We aren't a good match.

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,667
What should I do to make you notice me?

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:19,494
We'll have dinner with Kotone's family on Sunday.

6
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:22,405
- I'm not going.
- I'm not interested in your intentions.

7
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,402
I'm sorry. I'm late.

8
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:25,684
Shun.

9
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:30,223
Could we possibly pretend
this whole conversation never happened?

10
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:34,251
There is another woman I have my heart set on.

11
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:45,873
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

12
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:48,266
I'm fine.

13
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,893
Are you okay?

14
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:35,168
Um... Never mind.
[Episode 4]

15
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:38,133
No, it's not. It might leave a stain.
[Episode 4]

16
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,961
No, but...

17
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:42,912
Let's swap clothes.

18
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,306
Huh?

19
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,605
We can use this room. Okay?

20
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,578
No, uh, wait a minute.

21
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:58,629
Please, stop doing that.

22
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:00,337
Why?

23
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:08,630
Sorry to ask this, but...
Do you work here?

24
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,779
No, it's my first time here.

25
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,939
Did you come to visit someone?

26
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,981
I've always wanted to visit Shun's company.

27
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:21,567
Shun?

28
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:25,247
Are you President Satori's friend?

29
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:28,655
Friend... Yes, you can say that.

30
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,310
But I am not an ordinary friend.

31
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:39,737
We couldn't talk yesterday,
so I came here, perhaps I can meet him.

32
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:44,006
Dinner with parents is always a big deal,
isn't it?

33
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:49,370
Dinner with parents...

34
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:56,314
If I may ask, why do you
refuse the marriage proposal?

35
00:02:56,314 --> 00:03:01,940
Well, I'm not planning to get married right now.

36
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:09,101
Even when I tried to tell her honestly,
she couldn't seem to accept it

37
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,545
apparently because she was raised
in a sheltered environment.

38
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:14,406
I guess, you are...

39
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:17,207
Do you know me?

40
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,780
Yes.

41
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,390
I heard you're the President's fiancée.

42
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,037
Did you hear about me from Shun?

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,633
I'm delighted! So, he talks about me.

44
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:32,941
He even shares such personal topics with you.

45
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:39,227
Meeting Shun's close friend like this,
it's quite a coincidence.

46
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:43,947
I seldom get a chance to talk to someone
from the company.

47
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:48,913
So, I'd love to hear about Shun and you, Maika.

48
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:52,240
How do you know my name?

49
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:00,957
President.

50
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:05,278
I've never worked before.

51
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,590
So, I've always admired company life.

52
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:13,433
Tell me, what kind of president is he?

53
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:17,613
It must be nice to work here
and casually meet him every day.

54
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:19,453
I feel a bit envious.

55
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:24,398
But, if we're married,
we could stay together all day.

56
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:27,493
What should I do?

57
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:30,185
I can't ignore her altogether.

58
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:33,658
What I can do for Shun is...

59
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:35,200
Actually...

60
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:40,914
I'm dating Shun.

61
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:46,529
We might get married in the future.

62
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:51,467
I heard him say that
he's going to call off the engagement.

63
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,307
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:03,573
That's not true.

65
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:07,374

[Soleil Detective Agency]

67
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:19,348
I've investigated his friends, his work
connections, even his family background and past.

68
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:23,965
You know, he has a policy of
not having a specific partner.

69
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:28,315
Maybe that's why he's hesitant about marrying me.

70
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:31,923
And you are just a convenient option for him.

71
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,761
Maika, you poor thing.

72
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,808

Shun!

74
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,962
Did she do anything to you?

75
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,531
No.

76
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:04,720
Kotone, what exactly is going on here?

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,022
I told you I wanted to meet you,
but you won't see me.

78
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:11,687
So I thought, I'd get closer to someone close to
you, and maybe then you might come to see me.

79
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:15,884
Don't you realize it would backfire on you?

80
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,929
Please stop getting the people around me
involved in this.

Please never do something like this again.

But I'm your fiancée.

I believe I declined this relation the other day.

85

86
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:47,190
And I know, you love me too.

You. What do you love about Shun?

88
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:02,459
His face? His status? His abilities?

89
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,937
Do you also love his entire past life?

90
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:10,814

Ah, didn't see you there.

00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,286
- Sorry, sorry.
- They're bullying him again.

104
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,405
Kagaya doesn't resist. He's an easy target, right?

105
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:48,286

Yeah.

108
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:57,776
Kagaya was quiet in class.

109
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:01,408
He was often teased by the boys because of that.

110
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,052
It's okay, Hattori.

111
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:08,843
You won't get anything by doing me any kindness.

112
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:14,622
No matter how tough the situation was,
he always thought about others more than himself.

113
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,315
It's not about gain or loss.

114
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:20,677
It's just that I couldn't ignore
what was going on.

115

Wow, you're reading such a difficult book.

116
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,368
I only read novels.

117
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,855
Oh, do you like novels?

118
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:38,063
Hattori, maybe you will enjoy this book.

119
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:41,812
- Thanks! I'll read it.
- We both liked reading.

120
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:47,042
We started lending books to each other,
and began having conversations.

121
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:55,853
When I was with him, I felt very calm and relaxed,
and it seemed like we truly connected.

122
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:06,239
Shun made my heart feel at ease just like before,
because he is Kagaya.

123
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:11,301

00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:19,961
Yes.

127
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,513
What should I do to make you notice me?

128
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,477
Shun.

129
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,647

130
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:46,363
So, Shun did recognize me?

131
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:48,641
Parting ways with Kagaya
was sudden and unexpected.

00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,075

How is it? Is it interesting?

134
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,559
Yeah. Oh, hey.
Can I keep it a little longer?

135
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,027
Of course.

139
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:42,979
Tomorrow at five,
I'll be waiting in the usual park.

140
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:49,068
I appreciated Kagaya's feelings.

141
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,815
You have to choose your friends carefully.

142
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:09,634
Being friends with such a low status boy
isn't going to benefit you.

143
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:13,324
That kid obviously looks unimpressive.

144
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:16,182
Do you think he's bullied at school?

145
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,271
It seems like he doesn't have a father.

146
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:23,468
From now on, you need to
let me know about your friends.

147
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,387
It's for your own good.

148
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:31,427
Speaking about someone that way
was just terrible.

149
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,190
I thought it was unforgivable.

150
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,137
Now, let's have dinner.

151
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:40,169
But the worst person was me.

152
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:47,919
When someone important to me was insulted,
I couldn't say a single word back.

153
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:54,194
I couldn't go to that park.

154
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,403
I thought Kagaya would be deeply hurt

180
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:17,819
I can't possibly take revenge.

181
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:23,241
In the end, it just made things worse.

182
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:28,715
Maika!

183
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,181
President?

184
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,561
It was a fake relationship,

185
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:40,953
and all that kindness
might have been to deceive others.

186
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:43,057
President.

187
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,678
But...

188
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,669
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you.

189
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,395
Shun literally saved me...

190
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,524
both back then and now.

191
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:01,153
I need to...

192
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,411
Come in.

193
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:24,259
Excuse me.

194
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,029
Is the president available?

195
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,687
He is on vacation for a while starting today.

196
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,418
I see.

197
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:40,047
Is it urgent?

198
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:43,938
No, I'll wait until he comes back.

199
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,653
Akiyama! Do you still not know where Shun is?

200
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:49,452
Ms. Mitsuko.

201
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:55,647
Why is he taking it easy
at such an important time?

202
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,670
Especially when the engagement
has been called off.

203
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:06,068
Anyway, when Shun gets back,
make sure he comes to see me right away.

204
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,554
I'll arrange another matchmaking.

205
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:14,526
Do you know how much effort
I have to put into setting up a match?

206
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,771
He's totally useless.

207
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,089
Shun is working hard for the company.

208
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,742
Shun?

209
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,941
Who is this girl?

210
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,888
Just a regular employee, right?

211
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,592
Yes.

212
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:38,851
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself.

213
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,617
I am Maika Hattori
from the Sales Planning Department.

214
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:48,658
So, you are the reason
Shun stopped listening to me?

215
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:59,939
Could you please respect his feelings?

216
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:04,148
There's not much to talk about.

217
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:09,216
Shun's marriage significantly impacts
the future of the company.

218
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:12,631
Do you understand the importance of this?

219
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,863
You're just an employee.

220
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,748
You carry different responsibilities.

221
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,465
You must know your place.

222
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,562
I'll head back to arrange another match.

223
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,598
Make sure you give me an update.

224
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:43,796
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:47,695
I didn't mean to be pushy.

226
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,155
It's not your fault.

227
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:54,798
The president's relationship with Ms. Mitsuko
has troubled him for years.

228
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,538
I'm glad to know you're on his side.

229
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,545
Just tell me.

230
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:10,509
What can I do for Shun?

231
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:15,014
Shun has helped me so much.

232
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,993
I'd hate to see it...

233
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:23,015
if his worries remain unresolved at the end...

234
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:29,612
and I can't be helpful at all.

235
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:34,658
There are things you can do.

236
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:37,161
Huh?

237
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:41,569
He seemed to be quite preoccupied
with something lately.

238
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:46,856
Maybe you can get him to open up.

239
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,262
Where is he?

240
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:50,584
I don't know where he is.

241
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:55,593
But right now, I think he's trying to
free himself from past entanglements.

242
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,015
That's why he went away.

243
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,060
Past entanglements?

244
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:11,821
He has always cared about you.

245
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,153
I don't want to feel the same regret as before.

246
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:29,213
I hate not being able to express my true feelings.

247
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:52,261
In this town, I hardly had any good memories.

248
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:06,125
All this time, I thought I'd have to
live with a heavy, oppressed heart.

249
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,211
Until that day...

250
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:12,006
Kagaya!

251
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,629
Are you okay?

252
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:21,224
You changed my world.

253
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:27,939
I loved you.

254
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,654
I wanted to cherish our time together.

255
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,991
But...

256
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:48,250
In the end, it's all just wishful thinking.

257
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,861
It's just worthless to hold a grudge.

258
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,091
I need to let go of the past.

259
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:04,100
This time, I have to put an end to it.

260
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,773
Shun!

261
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:17,696
I found you!

262
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:34,448
I'm happy to be with you like this.

263
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:36,521
I don't believe Ms. Mitsuko will do nothing.

264
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:38,200
I will protect her.

265
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,580
Maika, you are quite clever.

266
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,732
When I'm with my mother, I feel suffocated.

267
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:47,096
You saved me once again.

268
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,378
I love you.

269
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:49,637
Me too.

270
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,497
Do you know Maika is getting transferred to Osaka?

271
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,410
I'm Yugo Kato from the same team.

272
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,642
Nice to meet you.

273
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,373
It might be orchestrated by my mother.

274
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,822
Something feels off.
