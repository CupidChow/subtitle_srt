1
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:04,943
Let's go on a date.

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:07,865
We should strengthen our partnership.

3
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:11,774
Huh? Wait...

4
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:14,121
Seat belt.

5
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:18,172
It's delicious.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,051
I'm glad.

7
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,728
Huh?

8
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:25,136
Things are getting interesting.

9
00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:27,235
Was it you? Did you send that email?

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,471
Is this revenge? Answer me!

11
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,540
This company doesn't need someone like you.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,463
And never try to approach her again.

13
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:43,831
I did it for revenge.

14
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,228
Who are you taking revenge on?

15
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:55,996
Revenge on Maika Hattori...

16
00:00:57,178 --> 00:01:02,253
Do you have any past conflicts with her?

17
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:08,159
It seems she doesn't remember you.

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,957
It's obvious that she doesn't remember me.

19
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:14,384
You know how I used to be, right?

20
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:16,283
Yeah.

21
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:24,274
Even the last name, the nickname,
and appearance...

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,879
Everything about me has changed.

23
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:47,180
I only had good grades as my strength.

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,509
I was at the bottom of the school hierarchy.

25
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,345
I lived with my mom, who worked at a snack bar.

26
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:01,661
Just eat whatever you want.

27
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:04,398
She didn't care about me.

28
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:13,490
Both at school and at home,
I just lived with bated breath.

29
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:21,440
Didn't see you there, sorry.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,844
You really fell down.

31
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,017
That's so lame. Be careful.

32
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:27,738
Let's go.

33
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,688
That's when...

34
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,890
Kagaya.

35
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,109
Are you okay?

36
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:40,482
My classmate, Maika Hattori,
started talking to me.

37
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:45,280
It's terrible. They ran into you.

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,758
I'm fine, Hattori.

39
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:54,673
You won't get anything
by doing me any kindness.

40
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:58,603
It's not about gain or loss.

41
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:02,097
It's just that I couldn't ignore
what was going on.

42
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,375
Wow, you're reading such a difficult book.

43
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,899
I only read novels.

44
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:17,930
Oh, do you like novels?

45
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,951
Your hand is hurt.

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,100
Here. Use this.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,713
No, thank you.

48
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,134
You can't just ignore it, you're bleeding.

49
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,650
Here.

50
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,678
- Thank you.
- Maika, what are you doing?

51
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,542
- I'm going home.
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,836
See you tomorrow.

53
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,011
I knew it was a long shot.

54
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:00,364
And yet...

55
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:07,546
I fell hopelessly in love.

Huh? What's this?

65
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:01,466
It's the most interesting thing
I've read recently.

66
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:07,389
You like reading novels, so...

67
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:11,435
Thank you. I'll read it.

68
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,046
Okay.

Here you go.

70
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,726
The ending of this book was amazing, right?

71
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,559
I totally didn't see it coming.

72
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:35,338
Have you read this author's debut work?

73
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:37,622
No, I haven't.

74
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:40,354
Shall I get it to you next time?
I'm sure you'll love it.

75
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,969
Yeah, I'd love to read it!

76
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,489
Okay, I'll bring it tomorrow!

77
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:46,349
Thanks.

78
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,036
I'm really looking forward to it.

79
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:52,104
We shared a hobby of reading.

80
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:54,288
We became good friends.

81
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,481
It felt like our hearts were connected.

82
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:04,596
And then, I ended up dreaming foolish dreams.

83
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:11,728
Hattori, I love you.

84
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,628
Huh?

85
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:29,512
Tomorrow, at 5 o'clock,
I'll be waiting in the usual park.

86
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,055
Kagaya.

87
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:36,419
I want to hear your answer.

88
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,783
Okay.

89
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,113
But...

00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,681

[Maika Hattori]

[Subject: I'm sorry]

93
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,494
[I'm sorry. We aren't a good match.]

94
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,198
Finally, I understood.

95
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:35,195
In the end, she was just like the others.

96
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:43,311
Like all the other classmates,
she looked down on me.

97
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,805
Soon after, my mom decided to remarry.

98
00:07:55,201 --> 00:08:00,170
I transferred schools,
and we had no contact with each other.

99
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:03,025
But...

100
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,818
Did she really not recognize you?

101
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,364
Yeah.

102
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:14,090
I changed my name, and surely, she wouldn't

103
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,401
think her president was that introverted guy.

104
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,778
I heard that the main reason
President Satori remarried your mom

105
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:24,528
was to welcome you as his inheritor
because of your intelligence.

106
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:26,975
Yeah.

107
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:36,931
With no children, he accepted me,
academically gifted, as his son.

108
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:40,402
I'm glad you came.

109
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:48,081
That's why on that day,
I vowed to live up to his expectations.

110
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,387
Nice to meet you.

111
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,876
I dedicated myself to studying
to become the inheritor,

112
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:00,370
and by the time I entered university,

113
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,220
I was no longer the person I used to be.

114
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:09,902
I became the president.

115
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,631
What society calls a success.

116
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,495
And yet...

117
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,604
Meeting her again made me feel the humiliation
I had forgotten all over again.

118
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:33,362
Because I needed a pawn to break
the engagement arranged by my parents,

119
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:36,298
I turned to Maika Hattori.

120
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:39,329
I suggested we pretend to be a couple.

121
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,670
To rewrite a painful past?

122
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,749
Is that what you want?

123
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:54,425
People, after all,
only judge others by appearance.

124
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,766
Maika Hattori is the same.

125
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:07,907
Huh?

126
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,040
What's wrong?

127
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,827
Oh, it's nothing.

128
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:16,904
My vision is just a bit blurry.

129
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,902
Are you getting enough sleep?

130
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:22,650
With all the overtime, maybe you're just tired.

131
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,581
Huh? Are you okay?

132
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:29,507
I'm okay, just let me finish this first...

133
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:32,530
No, go to the clinic quickly.

134
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:36,056
Come on, hurry up.

135
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:37,869
Okay.

136
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,221
Maika!

137
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,283
President?

138
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,263
You've a fever.

139
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,273
- Let's get to the hospital immediately.
- No, I'll take her myself.

140
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:20,826
Reschedule all my appointments.

141
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:22,597
But President...

142
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,417
You're awake.

143
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,305
Where am I?

144
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:56,793
Oh, it's my apartment.

145
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,526
I was worried when you suddenly collapsed.

146
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:02,907
What? Oh no.

147
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,657
How about your work?

148
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,153
It's fine.

149
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,965
More importantly, how are you feeling?

150
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:16,841
I feel I'm completely back to normal.

151
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,945
That's good to hear.

152
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:21,390
The IV is working.

153
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:34,018
It looks like your fever has gone down too.

154
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,202
I'm sorry about all this.

155
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:39,657
Maybe you should eat something.

156
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:44,012
I have made porridge.

157
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,368
Huh?

158
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:56,108
Here.

159
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,443
Thank you.

160
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:02,922
Thank you for making it for me.

161
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,499
Sure.

162
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,511
It's delicious.

163
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,260
That's great.

164
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:30,850
I really appreciate your kindness.

165
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,479
I am so fortunate.

166
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,859
You flatter me too much.

167
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,238
Let me feed you.

168
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,832
What?

169
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:00,386
Come on.

170
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:04,478
What? Oh no, no! That's...

171
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:08,657
It's fine. Open your mouth. There you go.

172
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:11,165
I can't do it.

173
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:18,873
Sorry, I'm being too informal.

174
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,173
Why're you saying sorry?

175
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,490
We are a couple.

176
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:32,203
You could touch me more.

177
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:39,794
The couple thing... it's fake after all.

178
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,564
We have to draw clear boundaries.

179
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,077
Then...

180
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:59,288
Why don't we become a real couple?

181
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,858
Huh?

182
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:12,376
Please, don't joke about this.

183
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:16,873
We aren't a good match.

184
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:20,695
[I'm sorry. We aren't a good match.]

185
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,210
What should I do?

186
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,726
What should I do to make you notice me?

187
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,314
Shun.

188
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:52,992
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,727
Last night...

190
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,882
What happened to Shun?

191
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,837
He had such a serious look in his eyes.

192
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:17,366
What should I do to make you notice me?

193
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:22,036
Was he serious, or just joking?

194
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:24,173
Hey. Are you feeling better?

195
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:27,646
Yes, I'm completely back to normal.

196
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:30,779
Oh, that's a relief, but...

197
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,201
Is it true the president carried you
to the hospital yesterday?

198
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:39,382
Oh, well, I have got a fever,
so, I don't remember much.

199
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,409
But it seems he was kind to me.

200
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,460
Really?

201
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,989
Did something happen between the two of you?

202
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,741
Oh, no, nothing.

203
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,834
That's what I thought.

204
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:58,457
But he acts like a prince to everyone.

205
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:02,645
Maybe he'd have carried me like that
if I had a fever too.

206
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:16,405
Yeah. He can't be serious.

207
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:20,819
Shun and I don't match.

208
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm just here to help him call off
his engagement,

209
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,240
as his fake girlfriend.

210
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,259
But...

211
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,566
But...

212
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:44,812
even if I'm just a fake girlfriend...

213
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:52,795
he saved me from crisis several times.

214
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:05,293
Pretend to be my girlfriend,
and let's get revenge on those two.

215
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:10,066
No... Do you not want to get back at them?

216
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:14,275
Is this revenge? Answer me!

217
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:19,852
Don't you dare come in between...

218
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:23,840
It's all thanks to Shun that I've been able

219
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,830
to come to work like a normal girl.

220
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,143
I'm sorry for causing you pain.

221
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,943
Maika!

222
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:35,154
President?

223
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,489
You've a fever.

224
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:42,261
- Let's go to the hospital immediately.
- No, I'll take her myself.

225
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:54,640
Just for that, I have to be grateful.

226
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,671
The factory visit yesterday afternoon
was handled by an agent.

227
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,230
Mr. Jones is on his way to Japan,
the dinner with him has been moved to Friday.

228
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,430
Got it. I'm sorry about that.

229
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:15,405
If I don't do that much,
I can't make her take me seriously.

230
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:18,954
Is that all you're trying to do?

231
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:19,987
What do you mean?

232
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:25,523
Aren't you unknowingly
holding onto your feelings for her?

233
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,069
That's ridiculous.

234
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,220
Come in.

235
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,601
Excuse me, President, you have a visitor.

236
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,539
Got it.

237
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,956
Shun, long time no see.

238
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:51,840
- Mom, why are you here?
- You never answer my calls,

239
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,929
even though I told you it's important.

240
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,596
Well...

241
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,625
Excuse me.

242
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:07,382
We'll have dinner with Kotone's family on Sunday.

243
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:12,595
I've already told you, I'm not going.

244
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,930
That's something unacceptable, don't you think?

245
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:22,230
You know what this engagement means to us,
don't you?

246
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,474
Mom.

247
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:31,807
Up until now,
I've always lived my life according to your will.

248
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:37,912
But I want to decide things by myself now.

249
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:44,044
I'm not interested in your intentions.

250
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:49,284
Do you remember who helped you get this position?

251
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:56,598
You need to behave more like a president.

252
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,713
Consider what should be prioritized
for the company.

253
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:03,939
If you think calmly, you'll understand.

254
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:13,746
Make sure not to be rude to them.

255
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:15,950
Understood.

256
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:44,854
Shun is late, isn't he?

257
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,510
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,283
I reminded him not to be impolite, but...

259
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,723
He has just been appointed as the president.

260
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:59,420
I'm sure it must be difficult to manage time.

261
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,540
Let's wait a little longer.

262
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,340
I apologize.

263
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:08,086
Let me try calling him again.

264
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,945
I apologize for being late.

265
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,456
Shun.

266
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:18,066
Everyone has been waiting for you.

267
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,140
What's going on? Take a seat quickly.

268
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:27,598
Could we possibly pretend that
this whole conversation never happened?

269
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,149
Shun.

270
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:36,588
There is another woman I have my heart set on.

271
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,687
What are you saying?

272
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,620
Please excuse me.

273
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,912
Wait, Shun!

274
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,344
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

275
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,779
Yeah, I'm okay.

276
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,453
Are you alright?

277
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,128
Excuse me.

278
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:35,298
Ah, yes, I'm fine.

279
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:47,661
I'm dating Shun.

280
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,481
You're just a convenient option for him.

281
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,471
So, you are the reason Shun stops listening to me?

282
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:56,979
I think he's leaving
to be free from past entanglements.

283
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,993
Let's end our fake relationship today.
