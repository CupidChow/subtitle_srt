00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:04,013
[Final Episode]

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:08,391
I'll tell Shun
that I want to break up with him.

3
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:33,421
Why do you go to such a great extent?

4
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,209
You don't want to break up.

5
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,578
You know...

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,974
my relationship with my mom has never been great.

7
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:58,565
I felt unhappy at home.

8
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:03,445
I felt suffocated all the time.

9
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:10,410
So, maybe it's my ego...

10
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,321
that I don't want Shun to suffer.

11
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:23,507
I don't want him to go through
the same family issues as I did.

12
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,472
You're in pain too, aren't you?

13
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:33,176
Huh?

14
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,756
Previously...

15
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,511
You mentioned this.

16
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:45,779
That you stop feeling pain
once you get used to it.

17
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,496
I can't begin to understand
how much you must've suffered...

18
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:00,085
before arriving at this opinion.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,386
You had a sibling to support you,
yet you couldn't be together.

20
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,716
Because if you had...

21
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,275
your life would've been less painful.

22
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,237
Why?

23
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:32,409
Why are you crying over us?

24
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:35,954
Because the reason you got separated...

25
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,877
wasn't your fault.

26
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:49,092
If things had gone the other way...

27
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:55,010
you could have relied on each other...

28
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,812
and lived together.

29
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:08,004
When I was having a hard time,

30
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:15,134
I often thought about how great it would be
to have a sibling to talk to at times.

31
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:20,415
So, I want to help you if you're in trouble.

32
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,335
Because we're family.

33
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:33,637
I often think that...

34
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:43,898
we can't change the past,
but time is all connected.

35
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:50,321
Right now,
it's just a continuation of that past.

36
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,272
So...

37
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,664
if you feel lonely...

38
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:06,462
like me...

39
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:13,843
it's in your hands to change it.

40
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:21,351
Do you think I can do it?

41
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,355
Of course, you can.

42
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,995
Honestly, I can't win against you.

43
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:43,790
Huh?

44
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:51,250
I've grown weary
of hating the people around me.

45
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,902
Hello?

46
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,382
Thank you.

47
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm really happy to get the opportunity
to work with you all.

48
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,277
After coming here,
I realized that I love this job more than ever.

49
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:29,524
Aww, now you're saying that!

50
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,755
Don't leave us!

51
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,513
Thank you for everything.

52
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:43,433
Take care of yourself when you get back.

53
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,770
Sure.

54
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,326
President, could you check these documents?

55
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:56,013
How do I look today?

56
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,795
What do you mean?

57
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:04,783
You look as handsome as always.

58
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,331
Good.

59
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,702
Maika!

60
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:16,257
Shun.

61
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,027
Welcome back.

62
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,696
Glad to be back.

63
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:47,494
I got a message from Kato.

64
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,989
He's going to back out of my mother's plan.

65
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:55,569
That's great.

66
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,946
All because you changed his mind.

67
00:06:57,946 --> 00:07:01,511
No. I did nothing.

68
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:12,439
As long as you're here,
I feel like I can overcome anything.

69
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,973
Will you stay by my side
for the rest of our lives?

70
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,259
Of course.

71
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,414
Good morning.

72
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:14,397
Good morning.

73
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:18,099
Do you have time this weekend?

74
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:22,300
I want to properly introduce you to my parents.

75
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:26,680
Okay.

76
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,152
Where's Dad?

77
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,660
He's not coming.

78
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,793
What?

79
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:41,737
I told him he didn't need to come.

80
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,391
Why did you decide on your own?

81
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:50,704
It's ridiculous to waste
his valuable time on this.

82
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:56,260
You should also act like a president.

83
00:08:56,874 --> 00:09:02,257
If you think about what should be
prioritized for the company, you'll understand.

84
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:07,012
Marriage isn't about you alone.

85
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,943
You can go to any extent
for the company, right?

86
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,503
You asked Yugo to get close to Maika, right?

87
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:23,469
Oh, so you know it.

88
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:25,232
Did she tell you?

89
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,507
No, I investigated it myself.

90
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,449
You investigated it, huh?

91
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:34,108
It's because he was acting all sketchy.

92
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,958
He's been useless anyway.

93
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,801
Excuse me.

94
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,631
How can you say something like that?

95
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:49,881
Can't you see how much Kato was suffering
when he was trying to help with your plan?

96
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,640
Outsiders should not interfere.

97
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,381
Shun and Yugo are my children.

98
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,567
They should listen to me.

99
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:05,763
No matter what you do to stop us,
I'm going to spend my life with Maika.

100
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:07,887
I only love Maika.

101
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,106
I can't allow that.

102
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:12,199
I will make Shun happy.

103
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,525
Don't talk nonsense.

104
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:18,965
I'm telling you, you can't be a partner for Shun!

105
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:22,879
Mom! Are you okay?

106
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:26,575
I'm sorry for being late.

107
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,000
Dad.

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,538
What are you doing here?

109
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:34,085
I felt something would happen,
so I came to check myself.

110
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,618
Maika, I'm sorry for my wife's behavior.

111
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:38,444
Are you hurt?

112
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:39,938
No.

113
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:42,861
Please don't be intimidated by Mitsuko.

114
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:46,800
You are a good girl, and you are perfect for Shun.

115
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,403
Are you serious?

116
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,965
The future of the company is at stake.

117
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:57,430
After marrying me,
you've lost sight of something important.

118
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,367
- What?
- The fact is that you're worried

119
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,883
about your pride, not the company's future.

120
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:09,092
Before interfering in company matters,
try to be a mother to your sons for once.

121
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:24,149
I want to introduce
someone important to both of you.

122
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:30,614
Maika Hattori is the one I love.

123
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:37,024
How can you think of marriage
based on just a fleeting emotion?

124
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:41,617
A girl from such a non-privileged family is
not suitable to be a company president's wife!

125
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,681
Enough!

126
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,878
How much more will you hurt your sons?

127
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,174
You're the one who needs to leave!

128
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,514
Until you rethink and properly apologize to Shun,
don't show me your face.

129
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:03,431
Maika, you'll catch a cold like that.

130
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,421
Shun.

131
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:07,150
I'll prepare some clothes for you.

132
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,282
Wait a minute.

133
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:20,337
Do you know how much I've done for you?

134
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:23,249
You should thank me at least!

135
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:32,467
No matter how hard it was, I bit the bullet.

136
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,576
I have done everything for you.

137
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:43,396
All of you should care about my happiness!

138
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:56,984
Come in.

139
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,827
Excuse me.

140
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,654
Shun.

141
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,771
Any word from your mother?

142
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,511
No.

143
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:10,750
She hasn't returned home yet.

144
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,551
It's been a week.

145
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,551
President, we have found Ms. Mitsuko.

146
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,504
She's staying in one of our hotels.

147
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,022
I see, thank you.

148
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:32,397
I think she doesn't have anywhere else to go.

149
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:34,905
You should go and bring her home.

150
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:47,625
I always wanted to get revenge on her.

151
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,572
Shun.

152
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:58,219
No matter how badly she treated you,
you couldn't abandon her.

153
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,891
That's because she is truly irreplaceable to you.

154
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,930
What do you want?

155
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,544
We just want to talk to you.

156
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:37,095
We can't move forward like this.

157
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:43,639
See, I got Castella. You used to love it, right?

158
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:46,216
Shall we all have some?

159
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,420
Thank you.

160
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,907
Huh?

161
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,916
Thanks for coming here today.

162
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:15,899
If it were just me,
I think it would have ended in an argument.

163
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,966
I feel the same way.

164
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:23,888
Hattori told me that time is connected.

165
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:29,477
I was reminded of something obvious.

166
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:35,483
It's all up to me
to change the equation with my family.

167
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,487
I see.

168
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:45,410
It feels great that the three of us could meet.

169
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,124
Thank you.

170
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:49,622
Yeah.

171
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,133
I'm back.

172
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:03,444
Hi.

173
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:07,098
The three of us talked about various things
at leisure.

174
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,852
That's great.

175
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,066
Finally, we can plan our wedding.

176
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:26,034
About that...

177
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:34,711
Oh? Is it just you?

178
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,943
Where's the president?

179
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:39,005
Shun isn't here.

180
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,816
He said he'd come back here.

181
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:47,723
I assumed you'd come with him,
and announce your engagement.

182
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:52,268
About that...

183
00:16:54,245 --> 00:17:01,068
I think we'll live without
the formality of marriage for a while.

184
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:05,228
- What?
- Of course, I'll be with Shun forever.

185
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:06,677
What are you saying?

186
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:09,314
What if you miss the timing
and delay your marriage?

187
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:13,665
A woman only truly understands happiness
after she's married.

188
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:21,130
For so long,
I've been bound by those words of yours.

189
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,081
But now I've realized.

190
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:29,465
Life doesn't just revolve around marriage.

191
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,339
What do you mean?

192
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:37,189
We might choose
to get married eventually.

193
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,846
But...

194
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:44,661
we will come to that decision on our own.

195
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:47,051
What nonsense.

196
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:49,906
What about the president's attitude?

197
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:56,374
Mom, I didn't choose the president.

198
00:17:57,155 --> 00:18:00,336
I chose a person named Shun Satori.

199
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,882
Do you remember?

200
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,541
I was close with a boy during my student days.

201
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:12,073
His name was Kagaya.

202
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:13,683
Huh?

203
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:19,605
You threw away Kagaya's book,

204
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:27,024
and said such hurtful things about him
that I don't even want to repeat.

205
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,392
He was my first love.

206
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,392
Why bring up something unrelated now?

207
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,607
Satori Shun.

208
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,303
He is Kagaya.

209
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,943
What?

210
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:41,449
I'm glad to reunite with Shun.

211
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,798
I truly feel happy about it.

212
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,152
That's all I wanted to convey.

213
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:57,393
If you listen to my words, you can be happy.

214
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,981
Mom.

215
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:07,320
I am very happy right now.

216
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:31,177
Miss, it's going to get dark soon.

217
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,726
Shun, what are you doing here?

218
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:40,779
I got a call from your mother.

219
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,577
Please, take care of Maika.

220
00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:46,692
Of course.

221
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:54,951
She's sensitive just like me, so, I'm worried.

222
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,745
My mom...

223
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:03,249
Did she say I resemble her?

224
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:04,794
Yes.

225
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:11,426
What? We don't resemble each other at all.

226
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:21,394
Maybe it's the habit of deeply caring
about people important to you, no matter what.

227
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,893
Your mother got married early and she was happy.

228
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:33,530
So, she probably wanted you to live the same way.

229
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:40,894
But she realized that it is a burden for you.

230
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:49,881
That's why she called me,
and asked me to take care of you.

231
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,271
It's painful when people you care about
don't understand you.

232
00:20:56,271 --> 00:21:03,394
But if you try to understand each other,
the gap might become smaller.

233
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,651
That's true.

234
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,592
Shun.

235
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:19,076
Yes?

236
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:23,164
Thank you for being so understanding.

237
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,044
I really appreciate it.

238
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,260
Marriage isn't something to rush into.

239
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:39,430
Let's take our time to prepare it.

240
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:45,270
After all, we have plenty of time.

241
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,066
That's right.

242
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:06,666
It's been 12 years since that day.

243
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:10,753
I ended up relying on you again.

244
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:18,386
Even 12 years from now,
I'm going to be there for you.

245
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:22,557
Thank you.

246
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:25,271
Me too.

247
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,938
I want to be there for you forever.

248
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,151
Yeah.

249
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,152
Shun.

250
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:48,290
Yes?

251
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:56,799
I love you more than before.

252
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,471
Me too.
