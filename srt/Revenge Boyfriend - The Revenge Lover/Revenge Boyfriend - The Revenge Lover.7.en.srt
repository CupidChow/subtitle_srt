1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,300
Didn't you notice?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,016
From the first time we met,
I've been interested in you.

3
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:13,604
I want you to choose me,
not the president.

4
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:17,108
I'm serious about you.

5
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,137
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:24,316
I won't rush you for an answer.

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,576
I'm prepared for this to take a long time.

8
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:32,644
Well then, see you tomorrow.

9
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:57,064
President.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,786
So, that's what it is.

11
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:18,662
[Inspection Report]

12
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:25,676
Have you finished?

13
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,304
Yes.

14
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,284
I'm done too, I can take you home.

15
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:36,562
Oh, no, thank you.

16
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,329
Perhaps, are you being conscious of me?

17
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,495
Not really, it's not like that.

18
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,161
Then what is it?

19
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,915
It's just like what you said.

20
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,420
Shun has a lot to deal with.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,886
That's why I want to support him.

22
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:11,993
I want to be stronger.

23
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:15,601
I want to work even harder.

24
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,526
So...

25
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:22,274
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:29,000
I will never change my mind.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,201
Honestly, I'm envious,
so much that I hate it.

00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,567
[Shun Calling]

29
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,127
Hey!

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,973
President, Hattori is busy right now.

31
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:48,967
What are you doing without asking permission?

32
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,807
I won't give him anything anymore.

33
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:58,972
You belong to me.

34
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,898
Ah, wait, Kato!

35
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,066
Please let go!

36
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,735
What are you doing?

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,616
Are you okay?

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,221
Shun, what are you doing here?

39
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,164
I'll explain later.

40
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,922
Do you know what you're doing?

41
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:34,837
I know, you're doing what my mother asked.

42
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:40,561
But I can't forgive you for that.

43
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,108
What do you mean?

44
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,047
I was worried.

45
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,284
So, I looked into him.

46
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,664
I found abundant evidence
linking him to my mother.

47
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:08,631
My mother used him to try to break us apart.

48
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,461
He is getting close to you for that purpose.

49
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:19,099
Not because he likes you.

50
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:28,568
Kato, is it true?

51
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:38,202
So, you found everything out.

52
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,207
I thought I could end this quickly.

53
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:51,965
Hattori, you had your guard up quite well,
and I had to put in more effort than I expected.

54
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,368
Why would you do such a thing?

55
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:59,640
Because I despise him.

56
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:14,298
Even though we share the same blood, you live
so comfortably, being favored in everything.

57
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:16,364
What do you mean?

58
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:23,455
You and I have the same mother.

59
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,588
We are half-siblings.

60
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,570
That's impossible.
[Episode 7]

61
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,784
I've never heard that I have a brother.

62
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,910
Of course, you haven't.

63
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,518
I was abandoned by our mother.

64
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:28,862
Abandoned?

65
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:31,314
I was sent to a welfare home.

66
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:37,445
When I was three years old,
she married another man.

67
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,744
I guess that man was your father.

68
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,456
You probably don't remember.

69
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:50,196
But...

70
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:55,255
I met you once before.

71
00:06:55,901 --> 00:07:01,762
I found Mom's new address
at the welfare home by chance.

72
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:06,058
I had a strong desire to see her.

73
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:11,647
One day, I went to visit her by myself.

74
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:19,029
I believed that someday my mom will come
and take me back home.

75
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:26,787
But after she sent me to the welfare home,
she never looked back at me.

76
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:28,747
Come on, quickly.

77
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:31,632
Mom.

78
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:36,240
Honestly, I remember her facial expression.

79
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,232
- Yugo?
- I realized in just one look that she was Mom.

80
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:41,843
Mom.

81
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,975
Mom, who's that boy?

82
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,579
Who knows?

83
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,853
Maybe he is lost.

84
00:07:56,298 --> 00:08:01,196
Boy, there's a police box
straight down that road.

85
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,762
If you're lost, you should go there.

86
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,159
Come on, Shun, let's go.

87
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:12,124
At that time, I clearly realized that...

88
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,212
I had been abandoned.

89
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:21,098
Then I understand you even less.

90
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:25,138
- You hated our mother. Why did you help her?
- Initially,

91
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,836
I had no intention of helping.

92
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:33,686
I didn't know where you were
after I saw you back then.

93
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:41,737
A few months ago,
I suddenly got a call from her.

94
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,921
Long time no see, Yugo.

95
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,371
I'm happy to see that you're doing well.

96
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:57,193
You still remember my name.

97
00:08:57,193 --> 00:09:00,399
Of course I remembered.

98
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,133
I'm glad you're doing so well for yourself.

99
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,375
Really?

100
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:13,428
Thanks to the people at the welfare home,
I've grown up well.

101
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,359
I know.

102
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:19,008
You are working at our company.

103
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:23,945
And you've even been recognized
as a top employee.

104
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:27,157
Your company?

105
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,507
Yeah, don't you know about it?

106
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:36,667
I remarried the chairman of Satori Holdings
about ten years ago.

107
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:45,984
So, the president, Shun Satori...

108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,554
He's that kid I saw.

109
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:56,064
I'm truly sorry.

110
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,632
I have made you feel lonely.

111
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,800
But there was no other way.

112
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,445
I was young and had no money,
and I was struggling to survive.

113
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:10,909
It doesn't matter anymore.

114
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:14,005
Is that why you called me here?

115
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,164
No, of course not.

116
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:22,796
Actually, I want to ask for your help
with something.

117
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,675
For what?

118
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:30,922
It's about your brother.

119
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,977
He's been caught up with an outrageous woman.

120
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,309
Shun is the company president.

121
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,735
And yet, this woman has no sense of her place.

122
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:45,378
She lured my son, turning him into a fool.

123
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,310
I won't let him marry a woman like her.

124
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,118
Shun has so many better marriage prospects.

125
00:10:56,808 --> 00:11:00,701
So, what do you expect me to do?

126
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:05,605
You know, you are handsome.

127
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:10,093
It seems you're popular among the female staff.

128
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:21,048
I don't think that it's any difficult for you
to win over such an ordinary woman.

129
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:33,825
I thought she ignored me before,
but now I know she's just using me.

130
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:40,351
Instead, I thought I should use her, too.

131
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,251
So, I accepted it.

132
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:51,802
First, I approached you
because she told me to.

133
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:56,974
But, now it's different.

134
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:02,103
I'm serious about you.

135
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:05,598
Stay away from her.

136
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:15,212
You have everything,
can't you let me have at least one thing?

137
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:21,021
If that one thing is Maika,
you can forget about it.

138
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:23,917
We don't know that yet.

139
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,174
I'm sorry for today.

140
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:38,445
Hattori, see you tomorrow.

141
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:08,128
Shun, have some coffee.

142
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,344
Thank you.

143
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,974
Are you okay?

144
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,390
Yeah.

145
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:28,606
But I'm a bit confused.

146
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:34,403
I never imagined that I had a brother.

147
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:41,036
Why did my mother keep it a secret?

148
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:55,216
What was she even thinking about
abandoning her child, and using him years later?

149
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:03,892
He could've been peaceful on his own, but
now his life has been upside down because of me.

150
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,315
Shun.

151
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,652
I know she is a selfish person.

152
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,519
Even so...

153
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:23,745
she raised me.

154
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,545
Yet I've been working my ass off
just to repay her and my stepfather.

155
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,098
I'm sorry for getting you involved in this.

156
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,614
I'm okay.

157
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:57,738
I just need to figure a few things out
to think about how to handle it.

158
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:12,502
Please don't try to deal with it all by yourself.

159
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,803
I'm always here for you...
no matter how hard things get.

160
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,143
Thank you.

161
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,677
It's done!

162
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:00,385
Where should we go for lunch?

163
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:01,845
Where shall we go?

164
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,061
Let's go together, Hattori.

165
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:06,677
- Sure.
- Alright, let's go!

166
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:12,173
- Spicy noodles set.
- Kato, you've suffered for a long time.

167
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:18,068
But, Shun, who knows the truth,
has been struggling too.

168
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:22,246
What should I do?

169
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:25,617
What can I do?

170
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:32,206
Excuse me.

171
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:38,910
I'm sorry you had to come.

172
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,967
How can I decline
when the president himself calls?

173
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,888
I did a DNA test.

174
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:54,145
You're my brother for sure.

175
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,860
You're efficient, aren't you?

176
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:08,409
I also went to the welfare home.

177
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:21,381
Are you helping out Mother because you wanted
to help the welfare home where you grew up?

178
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:30,640
I don't think that it's any difficult for you
to win over such an ordinary woman.

179
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,872
I refuse.

180
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:37,021
I'm earning enough. I don't need to do
something like this for money.

181
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:41,305
Yugo.

182
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:48,700
Are you sure you're happy
with things enough for yourself?

183
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,183
Huh?

184
00:17:53,428 --> 00:18:04,424
Do you know the welfare home will be
demolished because of operating difficulties?

185
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:14,190
If this is true, please let me help.

186
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,520
You've fallen hard for her, haven't you?

187
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,783
You are the president.

188
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:23,526
You must have plenty of options.

189
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,511
Why specifically choose Hattori?

190
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:41,044
She's been the sole reason that I can stand strong
when unexpected things happen.

191
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:48,426
She's a very important person to me.

192
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,351
Can't fight blood, huh?

193
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,453
Huh?

194
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,568
She is also someone important to me.

195
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:14,452
So, I can't accept your proposal.

196
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:19,915
I've decided that I won't hold back anymore.

197
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,669
I'm going to take everything I want.

198
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:26,941
Just wait a moment.

199
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,841
Brother!

200
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,875
When I was having a hard time,

201
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:41,864
I often thought about how great it would be
to have a sibling to talk to at times.

202
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,528
Now I know you are my brother,
I'm genuinely happy.

203
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,535
So, I want to help you if you're in trouble.

204
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,374
Because we are family.

205
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,699
Kato.

206
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,828
Hattori.

207
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,867
Hi.

208
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,383
I'm relieved.

209
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:57,318
I thought you might not come back today.

210
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:01,141
Are you waiting for me?

211
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:07,106
Yes, I wanted to say something to you.

212
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,449
What do you want to say?

213
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,934
I really want...

214
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,772
Shun...

215
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,208
and you...

216
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:31,589
to stop suffering anymore.

217
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:35,623
You two are family.

218
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:41,671
You two shouldn't have any conflicts.

219
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,564
Is there any way for the two of you to reconcile?

220
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:58,766
So, I already suggested a solution.

221
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:05,915
Even if I step aside,
my mom won't approve of you.

222
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,665
She'll try to interfere again.

223
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:15,090
And every time she does,
the president will be in trouble.

224
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,639
By trying to hold onto your feelings...

225
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:27,311
you will make many people unhappy.

226
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,071
If you truly care about him,
please show your determination.

227
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,116
Shun.

228
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:46,926
Pretend to be my girlfriend,
and get revenge on the two of them.

229
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:50,918
- Huh?
- At first, it was for revenge.

230
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:53,868
We became fake lovers.

231
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:56,212
- But...
- Answer me!

232
00:22:56,212 --> 00:22:59,679
He helped me a lot when I was struggling.

233
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,836
You saved me yet again.

234
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:06,434
Thank you.

235
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:09,623
I love you.

236
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:12,272
Finally, our feelings were mutual.

237
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:16,040
- But...
- You must know your place.

238
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,739
Stay away from her.

239
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:22,825
Now, what can I do for Shun?

240
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:30,916
Let me lighten his burden,
even just a little bit.

241
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,546
I get it.

242
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,219
I'll break up with Shun.

243
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:48,927
Thank you for being so understanding.

244
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,999
If you listen to me, you will be happy.

245
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,842
Why are you crying over us?

246
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:59,318
I am very happy right now.
