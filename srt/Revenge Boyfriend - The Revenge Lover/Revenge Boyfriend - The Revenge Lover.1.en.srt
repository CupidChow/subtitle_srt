Do you know what my dream is?

4
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:27,790
I want to live in a house and
have a dog like this when I grow up.

5
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,749
Why are you alone?

6
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:30,884
Huh?

7
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:33,628
Why don't you draw the person
you're going to marry?

8
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:37,468
And maybe you can make the house bigger.

9
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:45,230
Remember, Maika, a woman's happiness
is decided by her marriage.

10
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,628
You will be unhappy
if you take longer to get married.

11
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,967
So, find a good person while in your twenties.

12
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:53,026
You absolutely must not let him get away.

13
00:01:53,026 --> 00:02:01,218
I met your dad in my twenties
and I truly felt happy when you were born.

14
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:03,506
It really was for the best.

15
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:09,640
I remembered the things my mother
would often say to me since I was a child,

16
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,474

20
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:41,448
Good morning, Maika.

Are you sure about staying in tonight?

23
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,638
Yeah, I want to spend some relaxing time.

24
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,224
Got it.

25
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:04,609
Today is our third anniversary, and I'm
expecting a proposal from Narimitsu tonight.

26
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,754
What do you want to eat tonight?

27
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,771
Why don't you decide?

28
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,256
Only if it isn't too much trouble.

29
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,292
Okay!

30
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,806
Maika!

31

Have you been tired recently?

32

Why do you ask?

Your skin seems pale. The moisture...
It seems like your skin is missing moisture.

Really, no way!

35

Does it look rough?

36
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,661
What should I do? It's a special day.

37
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,540
A special day?

38
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,038
It's not exactly special,
but it's more like a little anniversary.

39
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,419
An anniversary? What kind of anniversary?

40
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,020
I'm really curious! Please tell me!

41
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,873
Well, break time is over.

That's my favorite.

Of course, it's our anniversary.

48
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,832
It'll take a bit longer to simmer.

49
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,870
That's fine.

Nope, weird solicitations keep coming.

do you remember what you said?

Huh? What did I say?

59
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:19,266
You said we'd think about getting married
after around three years of dating.

60
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:22,417
Oh, did I say that?

61

- Not today.
- Why not?

Then I'll answer it. Hand it over.

Seriously, stop it.
She hasn't found out about us yet.

It's better to find someone more stable,
but there's no one willing to marry you.

172

It's the only alternative. What can we do?

There was also plenty of meat.

180

181
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:29,828
The meat was hard, and it was a little bland.

182
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,604
- You...
- But it was the first time

183
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:41,279
I had home-cooked food in that house,
so it was refreshing.

184
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,261
I can't cook, so I always eat out, you know.

185
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,604
Huh, what? What's wrong?

186
00:18:56,604 --> 00:19:00,236
Miss Hattori suddenly got angry.

187
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:04,945
I was just talking about dinner.

188
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,121
Are you okay?

189
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,542
Did something happen?

190
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,449
I'm sorry.

191
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,269
Are you okay?

192
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:55,854
Yes.

193
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:57,748
It's nothing.

194
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,293
It can't be nothing.

195
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:07,754
President!

196
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:09,719
I'm sorry!

197
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,980
Did something happen with that girl from earlier?

198
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,944
Uh, no.

199
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:41,146
Actually, a colleague of mine...

200
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:44,045
I didn't know he was two-timing me.

201
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:48,966
I feel like such a fool.

202
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:02,855
You don't have to force a smile
when you're hurt.

203
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:21,336
I'm sorry.

204
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,563
You want revenge?

205
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:48,358
What?

206
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:56,513
Pretend to be my girlfriend,
and get revenge on the two of them.

207
00:21:56,513 --> 00:22:01,872
No... Do you want to get back at them?

208
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:21,225
Fake relationship?

209
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:27,064
To get back at the guy who cheated on you,
I think I'm perfect for the job.

210
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:29,442
But...

211
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:37,366
Of course,
I want cooperation from you in return.

212
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:42,621
Cooperation?

213
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,646
I have a fiancée chosen by my parents,
and I want to get away from her.

214
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:04,352
So, I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend,
and I want to call off the engagement.

215
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,340
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

216
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,297
That's reassuring.

217
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:22,769
What are you doing?

218
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,878
Are you envious because I'm happy?

219
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:28,557
What do you like about Maika Hattori?

220
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,429
Keep this between us, okay?

221
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,489
Are those two dating?

222
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,089
You're a bad liar.

223
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,542
Aren't we partners?

224
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,100
Is this revenge? Answer me!

225
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,360
Just go away right now.

226
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,373
I won't allow you to get anywhere
near her anymore.

227
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:45,184
President?

228
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,878
You're calling me that again.

229
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:54,319
If you call me President again, I'll kiss you.

230
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,474
Who are you taking revenge on?
