1
00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:03,329
Remember, Maika.

2
00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:07,041
A woman's happiness is decided
by her marriage.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:12,811
You said we'd think about getting married
after around three years of dating.

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,234
You found out. So, I don't need to hide anymore.

5
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,711
Let's just break up.

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:23,333
Starting today, I'll be the president of BirdLeft.

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,934
I'm Shun Satori.

8
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,723
Akiyama. I need you to look into something later.

9
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:31,106
It's personal.

10
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:33,904
By the way, thanks for the beef stew.

11
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,579
It was delicious.

12
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,826
You...

13
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:42,343
Did something happen with that girl from earlier?

14
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,099
Actually, a colleague of mine...

15
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:47,830
I didn't know he was two-timing me.

16
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:53,115
I feel like such a fool.

17
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:58,868
Pretend to be my girlfriend,
and get revenge on the two of them.

18
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:04,112
No... Do you want to get back at them?

19
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:07,609
Fake relationship?

20
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:12,900
To get back at the guy who cheated on you,
I think I'm perfect for the job.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,047
But...

22
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:18,448
Of course, I want cooperation from you in return.

23
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:22,084
Cooperation?

24
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:30,119
I have a fiancée chosen by my parents,
and I want to get away from her.

25
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,086
So, I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend,
and I want to call off the engagement.

26
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:41,513
But revenge...

27
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:52,782
Certainly, being cheated on
was shocking and hurtful.

28
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,830
Don't you have any regrets?

29
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,198
No. I have no regrets.

30
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,712
But...

31
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,940
I...

32
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,334
I'm really pissed at those two.

33
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,062
Well, what are you waiting for?

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,737
I need to think about it for a bit.

35
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,817
That ring...

36
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,385
That's right! I'm engaged.

37
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,429
Wow! Congratulations!

38
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:54,184
I had no idea you were dating Narimitsu.

39
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,669
He's the ace of the sales department.
You found a great match for yourself.

40
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:01,581
- Are you going to have a wedding ceremony?
- Yes. I'm researching venues,

41
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,520
so if you know any good places, let me know.

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,044
It's surprising that Hayashida and Matoba
are together.

43
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:10,050
Did you know?

44
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,838
- No.
- Is that so?

45
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,327
President.

46
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:31,552
I accept your offer from earlier.

47
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:22,581
[Episode 2]

48
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:25,559
The president really is amazing.

49
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:29,151
He looks just perfect and handsome.

50
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,864
I will check immediately.

51
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,039
Please wait a moment.

52
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:53,759
The amount is wrong again.

53
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,267
Thank you very much for your patience.

54
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,799
I apologize for the inconvenience.

55
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:04,674
There was an error in this estimate.

56
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,779
You ignored me earlier.

57
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,621
President.

58
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,971
We made eye contact in the lobby.

59
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:15,762
Oh, is that so?

60
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,890
I didn't notice.

61
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:21,662
You're a bad liar, do you know that?

62
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:27,398
How can I just casually greet you
with other employees around?

63
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:29,836
Aren't we partners now?

64
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:34,113
We're boss and employee in here, though.

65
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:37,607
I'll come pick you up at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

66
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:40,507
What, tomorrow?

67
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,728
Let's go on a date.

68
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,849
We should strengthen our partnership.

69
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,822
D-Date?

70
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,707
How did I get into this situation?

71
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,846
Maika, sorry to keep you waiting.

72
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:24,933
Good morning.

73
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,815
Come on.

74
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,901
Thank you.

75
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:53,078
Uh, w-wait.

76
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,807
Seat belt.

77
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:58,008
Oh.

78
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,551
Were you expecting something?

79
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:04,902
N-Not at all.

80
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,852
Oh, what a pity.

81
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:15,300
- President.
- That's not allowed.

82
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:18,654
Call me by my name.

83
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,740
How can I?

84
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,709
Shun.

85
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:37,239
Yes, Maika?

86
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,292
It's just about lunchtime.

87
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:48,297
French, Italian, traditional Japanese...

88
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,015
Do you have a preference?

89
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,354
No.

90
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,055
Let's eat what you want, Maika.

91
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,278
What's your ideal date meal?

92
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:04,137
An ideal date...

93
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:05,700
Yeah.

94
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:10,568
Well, I...

95
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:18,751
I prefer to relax, and cook something at home
rather than eat out.

96
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,748
Oh, sorry.

97
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:29,472
Well... that's my idea of a perfect date, but...

98
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:34,062
I like both French and Japanese cuisine.
I can't choose one.

99
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,860
Let's go.

100
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:09,697
I'm at the president's house.

101
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:12,003
Are you perhaps feeling nervous?

102
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,209
Oh, no.

103
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,324
Be comfortable. I'll make it right away.

104
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,691
I'll help too.

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,160
It's just a simple pasta.

106
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,784
It's perfect.

107
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:41,050
You cook, don't you?

108
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,757
I've been cooking a lot since I was a child.

109
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:49,065
I thought maybe the maid did the cooking.

110
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,817
There is no such person.

111
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,102
I always cooked and ate alone.

112
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,512
Be careful, it's hot.

113
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,895
It's delicious.

114
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,748
I'm glad.

115
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:37,614
It's the first time I've had
such scrumptious pasta.

116
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:40,422
I'll take that as a compliment.

117
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:48,863
Actually, I was nervous,
and hadn't eat anything since morning.

118
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:52,387
Then, do you want to eat my portion?

119
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:55,422
No, no. I'm good, thank you.

120
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,080
All right.

121
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:00,382
Pre...

122
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,268
Shun.

123
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,281
Yes?

124
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:09,431
If I may ask,
why do you refuse the marriage proposal?

125
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:10,944
Huh?

126
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:17,392
I mean, why do you need to pretend to
have a lover to break off your engagement?

127
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,035
How should I say it?

128
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,845
I wonder if you dislike her that much.

129
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:35,565
Well, I'm not planning to get married right now.

130
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,972
Even when I tried to tell her honestly,

131
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:44,974
she couldn't seem to accept it apparently
because she was raised in a sheltered environment.

132
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:48,589
I see.

133
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:55,163
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

134
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,087
That's reassuring.

135
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,259
Let's eat.

136
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,812
Okay.

137
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,507
Huh?

138
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,454
Stay still.

139
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:31,924
It's beautiful.

140
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,761
Do you like it?

141
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,462
Oh... erm...

142
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:42,936
We're just pretending to be lovers, why are you...

143
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:47,195
No more asking that question.

144
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:49,968
But...

145
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,325
P-president?

146
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:03,444
You're calling me that again.

147
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,294
Maybe you need a penalty
every time you say it.

148
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,801
If you call me President again,
I'll kiss you.

149
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,555
I'll be careful.

150
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:28,156
- Can I come to your place today?
- How about we grab a meal first?

151
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,820
Sure.

152
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,644
Good morning, Hattori.

153
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,198
Huh? Are you alone?

154
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:41,985
Good morning, Maika.

155
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:43,578
Good morning.

156
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:45,409
Huh?

157
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,751
President, we have a company.

158
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:50,541
Oh, sorry.

159
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,173
Please keep our relationship a secret
from the other employees, okay?

160
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:05,088
What? Are those two dating?

161
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,770
Who knows?

162
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,015
Hattori, what I saw earlier...

163
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:31,190
Hayashida, the quote amount you prepared
was incorrect.

164
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,254
I've corrected it.

165
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:41,470
I'm going to the meeting now.

166
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,525
Yes, this is BirdLeft.

167
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,984
Thank you for your continued support.

168
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,163
Sorry, Hattori is not at her desk right now.

169
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,693
Is it about the change
of today's meeting location?

170
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:20,071
If that's the case,
I can take the message for her.

171
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:21,319
Understood.

172
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,185
Thank you for passing the message.

173
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:29,715
I can't verify the meeting scheduled for 2 p.m.

174
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:33,106
But I was sure about it.

175
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,285
Hello.

176
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:44,412
I'm currently at your reception, but...

177
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,529
Hey.

178
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:55,405
Is it true that you skipped an important meeting?

179
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:59,286
I wasn't informed about the change in location.

180
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:02,506
They said they told another employee.

181
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,839
Another employee? Who?

182
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,680
Well, it wasn't the right time to ask.

183
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,483
Yeah, I understand.

184
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,620
It's better not to dwell on it too much.

185
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,939
Okay.

186
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,855
Huh?

187
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:19,555
What's wrong?

188
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:23,364
I can't find the documents I prepared
before going out.

189
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:37,449
What are you doing?

190
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,193
Huh? Is it something important?

191
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:42,939
It's important paperwork with handwritten notes.

192
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:46,643
Sorry, I thought it was unnecessary.

193
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:52,763
Hayashida, while I was away,
did you take a phone message?

194
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,938
What do you mean?

195
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:05,353
I know you might not like me, but mixing
personal and professional matters is wrong.

196
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,899
Try not to inconvenience your work
and others around you.

197
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:16,333
Mixing personal and professional matters.

198
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:19,654
I see.

199
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:23,716
Are you jealous because I'm happy?

200
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:26,552
Hey, isn't that a bit harsh?

201
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,991
Huh? What is this?

202
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,921
Seriously? I got it too.

203
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,581
Is it a mass email?

204
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:38,481
Hey, listen to this.

205
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,318
Things are getting interesting.

206
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:49,021
Narimitsu is going to marry Hayashida, right?

207
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:52,093
So, these are pictures of his fling with someone?

208
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:54,205
What is going on?

209
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:59,710
What is this?

210
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,258
Hi, everyone.

211
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,624
You jerk! What is going on?

212
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,674
How many people are you involved with?

213
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,134
- Huh?
- Don't mess with me!

214
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,412
I've seen everything.
Give me a proper explanation!

215
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:21,171
- What do you mean?
- What have you done?

216
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,424
What are you talking about?

217
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:25,381
- I saw them all!
- Wow, drama in the office.

218
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:31,506
Hey. Was it you? Did you send that email?

219
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,252
- There's no way I did it.
- Hang on.

220
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:38,374
The fact that your photo was missing
means it could only be you!

221
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,132
Is this revenge? Answer me!

222
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:51,429
Don't you dare come in between...

223
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:01,147
Instead of worrying about others,
why don't you first reflect on your own actions?

224
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:07,437
I also received that internal email.

225
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,686
So, I thought I'd talk to you directly.

226
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:15,098
But it seems there's no need to ask.

227
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,886
President.

228
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,460
Earlier, we received a call
from the president of Ogino Trading.

229
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,898
I can't believe you'd even get involved with
the daughter of the client company's president.

230
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:33,262
He wishes to reconsider future cooperation.

231
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:43,432
Because of you, our company seems
to have suffered a significant loss.

232
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:51,519
Matoba, this company
doesn't need someone like you.

233
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,828
And never try to approach her again.

234
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:02,542
Leave immediately.

235
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:16,551
Both of them submitted their resignation letters.

236
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:21,561
Well, after all that chaos,
it's hard for them to stay.

237
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:34,407
I ended up telling you some things
you didn't need to know.

238
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:39,329
So the email was from you, right?

239
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:46,502
I considered other ways,
but I thought that would hit the hardest.

240
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,493
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:57,819
I'm sorry that his actions
caused trouble for the company.

242
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,993
It's okay.

243
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:04,187
I knew he was involved
with the president's daughter.

244
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,690
I haven't informed him.

245
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:11,885
- Then...
- I solved it with Akiyama.

246
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:17,659
That makes me feel a bit relieved.

247
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:23,330
I never imagined he was
such an irresponsible person.

248
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,406
I'm glad to know the truth.

249
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:31,756
But...

250
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,654
for three years...

251
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,723
what was I thinking being with him?

252
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:47,688
I thought we were in love with each other.

253
00:22:00,294 --> 00:22:03,370
I'm sorry for causing you pain.

254
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,532
When I'm with you...

255
00:22:28,077 --> 00:22:30,189
I feel safe.

256
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:50,563
Thank you for gathering
evidence of their infidelity so quickly.

257
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,002
Not at all.

258
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:54,756
President.

259
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,745
What do you like about Maika Hattori?

260
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,960
Like about her...

261
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,644
Is that what you think?

262
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:14,942
It's not because I found her appealing.

263
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:21,323
I did it for revenge.

264
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:26,871
Who are you taking revenge on?

265
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:41,010
Revenge on Maika Hattori.

266
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:47,562
Maika!

267
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:50,684
Do you know who helped you get this position?

268
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:54,376
Meeting her again made me feel
the humiliation I had forgotten all over again.

269
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:57,183
Even if I say partner, it's a fake one.

270
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,354
What should I do to make you notice me?
