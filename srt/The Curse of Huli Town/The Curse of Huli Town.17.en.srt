1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,399
Kun

2
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,519
If you miss Juan, just go see her.

3
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,359
Kun

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
Did anything actually happen between you two that night?

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
Don't listen to Widow Li's nonsense.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,359
Nothing happened at all.

7
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,159
Don't overthink it.

8
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:38,920
Alright.

9
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,039
Oh, right.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,960
Last time I asked you to look into

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,880
that business with Hu San's darn mother.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,640
How did it go?

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,640
I asked around.

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,200
Doctor Huang told me

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,119
she's fine.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,039
He said last time Yang Nan was almost dead,

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,159
but he managed to save him.

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,880
He told me Yang Nan's chest

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,200
has a big scar.

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,240
A scar.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,399
It's really scary.

22
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,239
Butler Hu, what brings you here?

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,560
Officer Hu

24
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,959
Our master requests your presence.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,719
It seems you didn't understand what I said.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,079
Master Hu,

27
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,840
do you mean

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,040
you want me to stop investigating Li Zhenzu?

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,920
The man is already dead.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,079
The dead are gone.

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,079
Even if you learn the truth about some things,

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
what difference does it make?

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,879
Master Hu,

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,280
you're wrong.

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,719
Everyone needs the truth.

36
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,439
If it's because of this action,

37
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,319
I can't agree to your request.

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,319
I'm a police officer.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,400
It's my duty to uncover the truth.

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
If the Li family wants revenge because of this,

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,040
then let them come after me.

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,319
But what about Juan'er?

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm worried Juan'er will get dragged into this.

44
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,719
If you insist on going against the Li family,

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
then I will never let you have Juan'er.

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,000
Grandpa,

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,080
are you trying to make me die of anger?

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Brother Xiaokun

49
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,159
How about you

50
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,360
Li Zhenzu is Li Xingzong's lifeblood.

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,360
Now that something has happened to him,

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,520
what if you take your anger out on others?

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,479
Do you want all the men of Huli Town,

54
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,840
young and old, to suffer as well?

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,759
Besides, he promised me

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,759
that after the seventh day of Li Zhenzu's death,

57
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,439
he would immediately take his whole family and leave Huli Town

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
and never come back.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
To avoid further complications,

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,240
you shouldn't

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,319
stubbornly keep investigating them.

62
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,639
I want you to take Juan'er

63
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,000
and go hide somewhere for a while.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Master Hu

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,080
Please give me a little more time to think.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
You've made up your mind.

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Since I was a child, I wanted to be a policeman.

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,800
When I was young, I thought policemen were impressive.

70
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,360
When I grew up, my thoughts changed.

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,639
I wanted to catch all the bad guys.

72
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,840
A policeman must enforce the law impartially.

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,919
There can be no favoritism.

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,280
If something is wrong, it must be corrected.

75
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,319
I have to give the court an explanation.

76
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,240
And give justice to those who died unjustly.

77
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,879
Juan'er

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,120
Don't blame me.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
I'm not worthy of you.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
Don't look for me again.

81
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,199
You should go.

82
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,599
Do you like me?

83
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,400
I know you like me.

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,439
I like you too.

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,639
I've made up my mind.

86
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
I'm not leaving.

87
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,599
If you're not afraid, then I'm not afraid either.

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,479
The Li family has done so many wrong things.

89
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,680
They should be punished.

90
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,840
I support you.

91
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,439
But your grandfather...

92
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,039
Grandpa loves me the most.

93
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,840
I'll go beg him.

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,919
He'll definitely agree to my request.

95
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,120
It's quite lively here.

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,600
Officer Zhao.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,399
You've grown taller again.

98
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,959
Officer Zhao.

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,319
Is there something you need?

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,480
Here at your place...

101
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,399
Is there someone named Li Xingzong?

102
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes.

103
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,680
He reported you.

104
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,759
The chief sent me to investigate this matter.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
Officer Zhao.

106
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
This isn't true, is it?

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,639
You must have made a mistake.

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,079
Brother Xiaokun wouldn't do that.

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,399
Brother Xiaokun, don't worry yet.

110
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,399
I'll go find Grandpa first.

111
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:16,879
Juan'er.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,839
Officer Zhao.

113
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,120
Let's go.

114
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,720
Officer Zhao.

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,759
Dad

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,399
I just don't get it

117
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,240
Here, we're like kings

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,879
Why do we have to go to the provincial capital?

119
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Besides

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Isn't Zhenzu's grave still here?

121
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,160
Dad, what are you really afraid of?

122
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Shut up

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
Didn't I tell you before

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
to help me keep an eye on Zhenzu

125
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,120
and not cause trouble?

126
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,199
If things hadn't gotten out of hand

127
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,279
would we have to leave?

128
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,279
Do you even know who Master Hu is?

129
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,839
Who is he?

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
Fine, let's just go

131
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,879
I really can't bear to leave you

132
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,360
Master Hu, don't worry

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll come visit you whenever I get the chance

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,120
Alright, alright

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,839
Master, Master Li is here

136
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,959
He's here to say goodbye

137
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,439
Quick, invite him in

138
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,399
Yes

139
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,639
Master

140
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,759
I'll let you get back to your work

141
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,759
I'll be going now

142
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,319
Then I won't keep you

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,079
Dad

144
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,279
Everything is packed.

145
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
There aren't many days left before we say goodbye.

146
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
Let me bow to you.

147
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,680
What's the point of bowing?

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,519
If bowing could make you stay,

149
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,079
could it?

150
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,240
Juan'er

151
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
Can't you not marry Hu Zhengkun?

152
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,279
Zuer is just like that.

153
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,839
If he has a son,

154
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,519
make sure to raise him well.

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,680
Don't let him be ignorant like his father.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,879
I understand.

157
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,759
Dad

158
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,080
Slow down.

159
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,759
If you break it, I'll skin you.

160
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,000
I've got Zu'er's memorial tablet ready.

161
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,519
Got it.

162
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,840
Dad.

163
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,759
Your nose...

164
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,600
What's wrong?

165
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,120
You...

166
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
Nose...

167
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,759
Nose...

168
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,639
A bug...

169
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,559
Are you alright, sir?
