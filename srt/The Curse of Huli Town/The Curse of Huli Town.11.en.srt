1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,280
Xiao Yang,

2
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,719
Even though Da Niu is considered crazy,

3
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,519
crazy people often tell the truth.

4
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,440
So, who did he see?

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,559
Who exactly killed her?

6
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,640
Or did she fall to her death herself?

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,759
I can't figure it out.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,399
The Li father and son are no good.

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,320
They took the crazy woman back with them.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,759
There must be some plot.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Logically, it should have been Li Zhenzu who got into trouble.

12
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,920
But it turned out to be Li Xingzong instead.

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,439
I don't know either.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
But...

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Master Ruyin insists it has nothing to do with the Blood Fox.

16
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,200
It's one thing to curse the Li father and son,

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,400
but why curse Master Hu?

18
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,840
And put him at the top of the list.

19
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,560
She and Master Hu—

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,319
do they have some kind of grudge?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,359
How many people can even write these days?

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,719
Could a crazy person have actually gone to school?

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,719
Kun,

24
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,359
why don't you believe in the Blood Fox?

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,719
I just don't believe it.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,599
Here, take this.

27
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm not eating anymore.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,959
I'm saving it for my dad.

29
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,959
If you really want to be good to your dad,

30
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,079
then grow up quickly,

31
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,599
and earn lots and lots of money,

32
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,000
so you can buy your dad good food.

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,719
How about that?

34
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,280
Okay.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,359
Son.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Dad.

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
Dad, you're back!

38
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,920
You...

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,319
Brother Shitou

40
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,680
Let's talk.

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,400
No matter how you ask, my answer is the same.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
The kid really hasn't gone out.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,000
But if you're talking about murder,

44
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,159
that's possible.

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
She wanted to kill Li Xingzong.

46
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,120
So how did Li Zhenzu end up dead?

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,319
That, I don't know.

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,240
Is there anything else?

49
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,439
No, that's all.

50
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,400
Thank you for your hard work.

51
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,240
I'll head out first.

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,919
Wait a moment.

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,000
Did Master Hu help you in the past?

54
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,280
Yes.

55
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
I ran into bandits when I came here.

56
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,879
If Master Hu hadn't come to save me,

57
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,960
I would've been dead long ago.

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll be honest with you.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
I came here

60
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,879
to prevent the Li father and son

61
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,199
from framing Master Hu.

62
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,240
Brother Shitou,

63
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,400
I know Master Hu has helped you too.

64
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,960
You don't want Master Hu to be framed either, right?

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll say it again.

66
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,039
The kid really didn't go out that night.

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Even if I wanted the Li father and son dead,

68
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,960
I wouldn't lie against my conscience.

69
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,919
But...

70
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,680
Li Xingzong,

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,039
he wanted to know why that crazy woman

72
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,080
attacked Master Hu.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,919
He had bad intentions.

74
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,120
Everyone in town knows

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,439
Li Xingzong wants to ruin Master Hu.

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Li Zhenzu,

77
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,680
that woman wanted to kill Li Xingzong.

78
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,840
Li Zhenzu chased after her and killed her.

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
Then he came back and pretended to be asleep.

80
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
No, no, that's not right.

81
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,479
If Li Zhenzu really killed her,

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,280
then how do you explain the wooden plank?

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Was he cursing himself?

84
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,800
Maybe he was trying to create confusion.

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,319
Or divert attention.

86
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,360
It's all possible.

87
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,479
You don't know him.

88
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,879
He's not that smart. Impossible.

89
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,480
Who could it be, then?

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,439
This person

91
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,759
with the Hu family and the Li family

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,480
has some deep grudge against them.

93
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,279
Is it possible to think of it this way?

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,560
The Hu family and the Li family

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
are they connected in any way?

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,959
Are you saying the Hu family has something to hide?

97
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,959
And Li Xingzong knows about it and helps them keep it secret?

98
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,680
He even helped them kill that woman?

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,439
I didn't say that.

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
You said it.

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,839
Who is it?

102
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,399
Xiu'er, is that you? Are you back?

103
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,439
Xiu'er

104
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,439
Who is it?

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,879
Brother-in-law

106
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,040
Come on, come on

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,839
Brother-in-law

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Come here

109
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,279
Oh my gosh

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Brother-in-law is here, come quickly!

111
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,040
Alright, alright

112
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,279
Xiu'er, you're too much!

113
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,759
Wait a minute, wait a minute

114
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,839
Let me have a sip of water

115
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,879
Brother-in-law, you're back

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,720
Brother-in-law

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,439
Darn it, Old Wang

118
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,839
The vegetables have gone up in price again

119
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
Life is getting impossible

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,439
Xiu'er

121
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,959
Xiu'er

122
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,439
This darn girl

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
The sun is already high in the sky

124
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,120
Why aren't you up yet?

125
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,399
This family can't go on like this

126
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,639
There's been a murder!

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,519
What should we do now?

128
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,120
How could this happen?

129
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,680
Xiu'er

130
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,399
Wake up, Xiu'er.

131
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:16,959
Xiu'er's mother is awake.

132
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,439
Xiu'er

133
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,319
Xiu'er's mother

134
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,120
Don't move, Xiu'er's mother.

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,079
Calm down.

136
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,759
Xiu'er's mother

137
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,360
Xiu'er's mother, please accept our condolences.

138
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,759
Xiao Kun, Xiao Kun

139
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,240
It's all because of that jerk Li Zhenzu.

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
He ruined her.

141
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,600
Go arrest him!

142
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,680
Ma'am, please calm down.

143
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Listen to me.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,399
If it really was Li Zhenzu,

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,839
I'll go arrest him right now.

146
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,680
He insisted on coming to my house two days in a row.

147
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,079
Does that count as evidence?

148
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
He slept with Xiu'er and then killed her.

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Does this count as evidence?

150
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,959
He thinks I don't know.

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,839
But I saw everything.

152
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
Go catch him, quickly!

153
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh, my Xiu'er!

154
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,680
Xiu'er!

155
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,319
Xiu'er's mother, please accept my condolences.

156
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,199
What are you doing? What are you doing?

157
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,000
Come out.

158
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,199
Are you crazy? Are you trying to rebel?

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
Everyone, get out.

160
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,199
What are you doing, rebelling?

161
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,759
What do you want to do?

162
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,839
Put down the weapon.

163
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,439
Put it down.

164
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,720
Xiao Kun, have I been too lenient with you?

165
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,920
Again and again.

166
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,759
Aren't you done yet?

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hurry, catch them!

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,959
Catch them!

169
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
You old woman!

170
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,879
Go after whoever did the killing.

171
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,920
Why are you coming after me?

172
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,079
Li Zhenzu, you're truly inhuman.

173
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,519
My daughter was pregnant with your child.

174
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,759
And you still killed her.

175
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,079
Did you hear that, Li Zhenzu?

176
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm going to fight you to the end.

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
Did you hear that?

178
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,759
What are you doing?

179
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,800
What are you doing?

180
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,959
Calm down, step aside.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,199
Li Zhenzu, Xiu'er's mother saw everything.

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,040
What else do you have to say?

183
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,040
Nonsense.

184
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,759
Let me tell you.

185
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,399
I didn't even go out last night.

186
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
They can all vouch for me.

187
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,800
That's right.

188
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,399
Isn't that so?

189
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,279
We can all testify.

190
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,639
A life for a life.

191
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,639
If someone can prove you went out,

192
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
you're done for.

193
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,120
Who can prove it?

194
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,680
Who?

195
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,800
Who can prove it?

196
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
No one can prove it, right?

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,720
Then it wasn't my son who did it.

198
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,560
That's right.

199
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,639
It was the Blood Fox.

200
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,319
Everyone knows that.

201
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,439
My Li family only has this one heir.

202
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
Yes, he's not very promising.

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,199
He only has two daughters.

204
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
But he got Xiu'er pregnant.

205
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,600
Doctor Huang also checked her pulse.

206
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,519
He said it's a boy.

207
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,040
I also promised Xiu'er

208
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
that as long as she gives birth to the child,

209
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
I would let Zhenzu marry her.

210
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,040
Xiao Kun, this is the heir of the Li family.

211
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,519
He went crazy and tried to kill her.

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
He's nothing but a beast.

213
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,680
What did you say?

214
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,480
Hit her.

215
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,279
Stop!

216
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:24,959
I'll testify.

217
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,519
Get out of my way.

218
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,040
Don't move.

219
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,879
That night, Li Zhenzu went out.

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,519
Liar!

221
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,279
It was him.

222
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
My daughter.
