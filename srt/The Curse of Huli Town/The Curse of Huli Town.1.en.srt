1
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,960
This is Huli Town.

2
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,399
It used to be called Fox Town years ago.

3
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,559
Legend has it that a hundred years ago,

4
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,039
a blood fox cast a curse here.

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,239
All the townspeople, in a single night,

6
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,079
died under mysterious circumstances.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
Later, a wandering monk passed by.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,960
He battled the blood fox for three days and nights.

9
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,520
Only then did he subdue and seal it.

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,520
After a hundred years,

11
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,600
this place has now become a land of prosperity.

12
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,240
Because the town's residents

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,000
are mainly from the Hu and Li families,

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,799
Fox Town

15
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,359
was renamed Huli Town.

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,200
Master Ruyin,

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,000
Huli Town is just ahead.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,560
We'll part ways here.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
Amitabha.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,640
Thank you, Steward Wang, for your care along the way.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
Master Ruyin,

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,680
You're too kind.

23
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,079
You cured my young master's weakness.

24
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,359
That alone is a great deed.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,079
Escorting you part of the way was only right.

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,040
It's what I should have done.

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,159
Amitabha.

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,639
Daniu

29
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,000
Daniu

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Daniu

31
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,800
Where are you?

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Kun

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,319
Kun

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,479
How is it?

35
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,280
Did you find him?

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,960
No.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,479
There's not even a shadow of anyone.

38
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,599
What are you good at, anyway?

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Let me tell you,

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
Daniu went out with a machete.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,280
When his madness acts up, he doesn't recognize anyone.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
If he hurts someone,

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,840
it would be a serious dereliction of our duty.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,639
Do you understand?

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,039
Hurt someone?

46
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,599
I think at most he could only

47
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,120
injure a stray cat or two.

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Kun

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm just lamenting how unlucky we are.

50
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,719
All these years,

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,280
the two of us as police officers in Huli Town,

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,159
haven't even caught a single thief.

53
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,400
Enough, stop with the nonsense.

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,039
Let's keep looking.

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,840
Daniu

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,199
Shasha

57
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,120
Kun

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,319
Daniu

59
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,199
Over there.

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Come on, let's go.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,560
Daniu, why are you hanging a paper figure here?

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,160
Lian'er is already dead.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,399
This isn't Lian'er.

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Lian'er isn't dead.

65
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,800
Daniu.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,759
Don't come over. Stay away from her.

67
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,079
Calm down.

68
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,399
He's gone mad now.

69
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,480
He doesn't recognize who you are.

70
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,199
Daniu, it's me, Zhengkun.

71
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,000
Look into my eyes.

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
Daniu.

73
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,079
Kun-ge.

74
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,199
It's okay now.

75
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,920
Daniu.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,480
It's okay now.

77
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,319
Lian'er is dead.

78
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,000
It's fine, let's go home.

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Kun-ge.

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,040
Juan'er is in danger.

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,920
What?

82
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,879
Juan'er is in danger.

83
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,279
Blood Fox.

84
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,560
Blood Fox.

85
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Daniu.

86
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,439
Kill.

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,079
Kill.

88
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,959
Great, he's gone crazy again.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm about to go crazy too.

90
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,160
Stop talking nonsense.

91
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,040
Chase him.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,759
Daniu.

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,480
How can you run so fast?

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,000
Kun-ge.

95
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,519
Where is this place?

96
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,079
Blood Fox.

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,839
Blood Fox.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,199
It's Blood Fox.

99
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,519
What Blood Fox?

100
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,319
Let's go take a look.

101
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,199
Kill

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,639
Kill

103
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,879
Juan'er

104
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,160
Juan'er

105
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,199
Wake up

106
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,480
Xiao Yang,

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
you're going to the provincial capital to handle something for me this time.

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
It's a lot of trouble for you.

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Not at all.

110
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm just

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,879
running some errands for the family.

112
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,279
Besides, Master,

113
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
you saved my life.

114
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,439
So I really can't accept your thanks.

115
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,199
Also, Master,

116
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,680
I might have to leave.

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
You're leaving?

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,279
I still have many important things

119
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,959
that I haven't finished.

120
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,120
So...

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,680
Oh.

122
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,079
Alright then.

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,720
You're different from the people of Huli Town.

124
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Anyone can see you have great ambitions.

125
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
You saved my life.

126
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
I, Yang Nan, am not someone who forgets kindness.

127
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,160
Master Hu,

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,079
please don't worry.

129
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,959
Once I've finished what I need to do,

130
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,680
I'll definitely come back to see you and Juan'er.

131
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,920
Go ahead, I won't force you to stay.

132
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,959
Master, Master!

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,159
Hu Quan.

134
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,519
Master.

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,080
Go and invite Doctor Huang.

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,360
Remember, don't tell him anything else.

137
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,480
Just bring him here, that's all.

138
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,480
Yes.

139
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,080
Blood Fox.

140
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,600
Blood Fox.
