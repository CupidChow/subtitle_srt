1
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,600
Me

2
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,519
Are you crazy?

3
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,320
I'll beat you to death.

4
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,199
Say that you killed that crazy woman and Xiu'er.

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,679
I didn't kill them.

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,640
The Blood Fox did it.

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,880
Speak.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,719
If you have the guts, kill me.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,439
I'll talk, I'll talk!

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,320
Talk.

11
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,600
I didn't kill those two.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,280
It was my father, that old man.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,880
He forced me to do it.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,119
Your father?

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,439
Why?

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,759
I don't know.

17
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,920
I know, I know!

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,920
That person...

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,399
That crazy woman

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,640
told my father

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,079
that Master Hu was a human trafficker when he was young.

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,719
Xiu'er overheard this.

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,719
So the two of them had to die.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
My father had to keep Master Hu's secret.

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,400
Your father had to keep Master Hu's secret?

26
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,640
What's the relationship between your family and the Hu family?

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,560
I don't know.

28
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,439
He didn't tell me.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,319
I really don't know.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,640
He really didn't tell me about this.

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,120
Xiu'er

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,079
How was Xiu'er killed?

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,560
I wanted her to die in a strange way.

34
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,959
So I drugged her.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,920
What kind of drug?

36
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,359
And the man on the mountain, you drugged him too, right?

37
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,799
You even know that?

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,200
They died the same way.

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,640
Both had a smile on their lips.

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,040
Is it that hard to guess?

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,359
Fine.

42
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,879
I fell into your hands today.

43
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,599
I have only one request.

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Make it quick for me.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,840
Let me tell you.

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
That man was actually a kidnapper.

47
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,319
That night, he drugged Hu Juan.

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,719
Hu San'er and I cornered him on the mountain.

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,639
Stop! Stop!

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,319
Stop!

51
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,879
Still running? Stop!

52
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,840
Stop!

53
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,879
Stop!

54
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,240
Stop!

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,960
Stop right there.

56
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,280
Spare me, spare me! Let's see you try to run!

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
Try running again!

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,400
Spare me, spare me!

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Just do as you're told.

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
What is this thing?

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,599
Move again and—

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,560
What is this thing?

63
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,240
What is it used for?

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,719
Speak.

65
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,800
I'll talk.

66
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll talk.

67
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,159
This is a kind of drug.

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,680
If you put it on someone's face,

69
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,080
it will make them lose their senses.

70
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,919
They'll do whatever you tell them to.

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,759
It works that well?

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,960
Brother Zu,

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
this is a real treasure.

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,159
With this, you can do whatever you want.

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,319
What about Juan?

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,599
Is there any more?

77
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:13,919
No, that's all.

78
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,400
There's only this one.

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
You didn't listen, did you?

80
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,400
The recipe.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,879
Hurry up.

82
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,360
I'll give it.

83
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,360
Juan, I'm coming!

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
I don't know

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,639
if this

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
really works that well.

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,919
Let's try it.

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,080
Try it.

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you doing?

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,719
Go!

91
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,599
What are you doing?

92
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,759
Brother Zu, this drug really works!

93
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,039
This is so much fun.

94
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,560
Get up.

95
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,120
Are you pretending to be dead with me, kid?

96
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,000
He's not breathing.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,040
So Hu Juan was also drugged with this?

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Hu Juan.

99
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,240
I'll talk, I'll talk!

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,680
You know too.

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,959
That little flirt Hu Juan...

102
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,920
I've had my eye on her for a long time.

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,600
I was actually planning...

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,959
to drug her too.

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,000
That night at the abandoned temple...

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,399
I almost succeeded.

107
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
But that lunatic Da Niu...

108
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,319
ruined everything.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,879
What the hell?

110
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,399
What?

111
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,160
Juan'er.

112
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,240
No.

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,399
Not in the mountains.

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,519
Let me take you inside.

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,439
Let's go.

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
Juan'er.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Juan'er, Juan'er, I'm coming.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
These little feet...

119
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,199
What the hell?

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,720
What the hell?

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,360
Who is it?

122
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,360
Get lost!

123
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,279
Sorry, Juan'er.

124
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,560
He scared me off.

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Next time...

126
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,560
I

127
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,920
Everything I said is true.

128
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,800
This was just an accident.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,360
When I found her on the mountain that night,

130
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,279
she was already unconscious.

131
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,279
It had nothing to do with me.

132
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,319
After that, I lost interest.

133
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,680
So I went to Wang Xiaohua's house.

134
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,759
After all, I needed to vent my frustration.

135
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,519
So Hu San was your doing too?

136
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,319
Hu San

137
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,879
Yes, it was me, it was me.

138
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
I poisoned Hu San.

139
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,079
That bastard

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,680
ate my food and drank my wine,

141
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,279
and even used Hu Juan's matter to threaten me.

142
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,120
He told me that if I didn't give him money,

143
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,959
he would tell Master Hu.

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
Later, I found out

145
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,480
that after I left that night,

146
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,120
he went in.

147
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,560
So he had to die.

148
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,920
I took advantage of his carelessness and drugged him too.

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,360
He went to kill Zhou Dafa, then committed suicide.

150
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,680
Young Master Li, what a clever scheme.

151
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,040
You said that everyone who knew about this

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,399
is already dead.

153
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,560
What did Zhou Dafa and Hu Xiaoyun know?

154
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,879
Did I say?

155
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,079
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

156
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,399
Because they knew about me preparing the medicine.

157
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,800
That day, after I got the medicine from the herbal shop,

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Here.

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,600
Is my medicine ready?

160
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,720
It's ready, it's ready.

161
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,759
Yun'er

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,839
Did you miss me?

163
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,879
Brother Zu

164
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,199
Have you two made up your minds?

165
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,360
Think about it.

166
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,879
If you've decided,

167
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,600
then keep your mouths shut.

168
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,800
Did you hear me?

169
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,079
Understood, understood, Brother Zu.

170
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,639
That's more like it.

171
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,439
But Brother Zu,

172
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,199
there's still something I want to say.

173
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,559
About this medicine,

174
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,960
try to take as little as possible.

175
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't need you to tell me that.

176
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,919
This prescription was given by the county doctor.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
Don't talk nonsense for no reason.

178
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,399
You'll ruin our young master's reputation.

179
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,639
Do you still want to live?

180
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,039
Yes, yes, yes.

181
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,559
We promise not to let anyone else know.

182
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,879
Brother Zu

183
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,159
Look how scared this little girl is.

184
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,399
Let me plead for her.

185
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,200
Alright.

186
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll do it for your sake.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,559
Yun'er

188
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,759
Don't be afraid.

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,919
Your brother cares about you.

190
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,039
Let's go.

191
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,039
You're afraid they'll leak information.

192
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,960
So you killed them to silence them.

193
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,600
Boss,

194
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,039
If Hu San'er hadn't threatened me,

195
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,559
he wouldn't have had to die.

196
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,960
I really had no choice.

197
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,720
So, do you want me to let you go?

198
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,279
Can you?

199
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,519
Sure.

200
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,120
Alright then.

201
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
As long as you let me go,

202
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,399
I'll do whatever you want.

203
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,039
Just name your price.

204
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,919
Then act in a play with me.

205
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,120
Act in a play?
