1
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,039
Juan'er

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,839
Juan'er

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,719
Please open the door.

4
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,920
I know you're inside.

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,960
Please leave, Brother Xiaokun.

6
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm not worthy of you anymore.

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,359
What are you saying?

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,479
Don't you understand how I feel?

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
But...

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm not worthy of you anymore.

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,399
Juan'er

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,039
I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,960
I didn't protect you before.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,359
But I hope

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,479
that you'll be by my side for the rest of my life.

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,039
I swear

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,679
no one will ever bully you again.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,600
Everything will get better.

19
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,600
I will find out the truth.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
And give you justice.

21
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,200
I don't care if they're human

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,280
or some blood fox.

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,000
This jade pendant was given to me by my mother.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,480
It's meant to keep me safe.

25
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,879
Now I'm giving it to you.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,319
Promise me, Juan'er.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,560
From now on,

28
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,159
don't do anything foolish again.

29
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,239
I'm leaving now.

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,840
I'll come see you tomorrow.

31
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,879
Aunt Hu said it herself.

32
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,920
You all heard it with your own ears.

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,159
How could it be fake?

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,359
What should we do?

35
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:43,959
Nothing to do.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Just wait and see.

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,359
Who knows who the next unlucky one will be.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,560
Hu Xiaoyun

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,599
Hu Xiaoyun

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,680
She’s forgotten the past.

41
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,159
Three women were harmed by that blood fox.

42
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,280
This time,

43
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,680
didn’t Hu San try to assault Hu Xiaoyun in public?

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,879
That’s a seductive fox.

45
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,120
If someone ruins its plans,

46
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
would it just let it go?

47
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,599
This Hu Xiaoyun,

48
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,599
sooner or later,

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,799
if you put it that way,

50
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,360
then Juan’er

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,680
really was harmed by the blood fox.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Don’t talk nonsense.

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Did you hear?

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Juan’er tried to hang herself out of despair.

55
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,759
Luckily, someone found her in time.

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,199
Thank heavens.

57
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,759
Thank heavens.

58
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,479
Juan’er can’t have anything else happen to her.

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,639
Who is Juan’er?

60
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,159
She’s Master Hu’s beloved.

61
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,000
If something happens to Juan’er again,

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
what will Master Hu do?

63
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,360
Exactly.

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,599
Tell me,

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,439
is there any way to kill the blood fox?

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,199
What about you?

67
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,879
You’re just worrying for nothing.

68
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,520
The priest will hold a ritual tomorrow.

69
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,080
He’s a highly respected monk by Master Hu.

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,919
His skills

71
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,000
must be impressive.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
How powerful can a fox spirit really be?

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,199
It was subdued over a hundred years ago.

74
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,560
This time, it definitely can’t escape.

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,719
I heard

76
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,800
they’re even going to build a temple.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,039
The Li family

78
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,599
has spent a lot of money.

79
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
Now that's a real change of heart.

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,479
Is the Li family really that good?

81
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,560
It's only because of Master Hu.

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,800
They just want to please Master Hu.

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,120
If you ask me, it's all thanks to the Hu family.

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,560
Otherwise, the Li family...

85
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,439
The Li family...

86
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,960
Xiaoyun,

87
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't cry, your health is more important.

88
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,039
That's right.

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,159
The dead can't come back to life.

90
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,039
You still need to take care of yourself.

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,759
Exactly, as the old saying goes,

92
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,159
If the old man doesn't die,

93
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,719
the new one won't come.

94
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,520
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

95
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,479
There's nothing else.

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
Take this medicine and you'll be fine.

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,840
Thank you, Doctor Huang.

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
Doctor Huang,

99
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,280
This Li Zhenzu,

100
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,879
does he have feelings for Hu Xiaoyun?

101
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,520
He doesn't fancy Hu Xiaoyun.

102
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,199
How old is Hu Xiaoyun anyway?

103
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,639
That guy only likes young girls.

104
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,039
Like their Xiuer.

105
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,159
I heard she's already pregnant with his child.

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
Move aside, move aside!

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,520
Move!

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,520
Young master.

109
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,719
Move!

110
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,599
It's him again.

111
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,319
Go.

112
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,560
What are you doing?

113
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,800
Yun

114
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Brother

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm here to apologize to you.

116
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,120
Yun

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,079
About this matter,

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,480
although it has nothing to do with me,

119
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
but that bastard Hu San

120
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,040
is with me.

121
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,519
So I didn't keep an eye on him.

122
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,560
I am responsible.

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Let me make this clear,

124
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,199
from today on,

125
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,839
I'll look after Hu Xiaoyun.

126
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,560
If anyone bullies her from now on,

127
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,720
it's the same as bullying me.

128
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,759
Young master, you're so righteous.

129
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,279
Don't cry.

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,720
I understand. I won't say a word, even if it kills me.

131
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,079
As long as you know.

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,000
If anything happens in the future, tell me.

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,560
In Huli Town, there's nothing the Li family can't handle.

134
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,199
Why are you here?

135
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,720
Why are you everywhere?

136
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,800
What are you doing here?

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
He came to get some medicine.

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,519
I'm helping him with his health.

139
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,480
Help his health, my foot.

140
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,399
Let me tell you something.

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,040
You're an outsider.

142
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,959
Stop wandering around in my Hu Li Town.

143
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,480
If you make me angry,

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
even that old man Hu can't protect you.

145
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,120
Got it?

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Is that so?

147
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Master Hu.

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,439
Master Hu.

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,680
Let's see what he does now that Master Hu is here.

150
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,439
Master Hu.

151
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,199
I want to see

152
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,079
if I can protect him or not.

153
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,399
I can protect him.

154
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,199
I just misspoke.

155
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,680
No.

156
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,759
You misheard.

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,319
I'm getting old,

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,959
but my ears aren't deaf.

159
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,279
Usually,

160
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,680
you Li family boys just cause minor trouble.

161
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,879
You do some ridiculous things.

162
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,240
I only let it go

163
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,279
for the sake of your old man Li.

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,160
I turn a blind eye.

165
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,199
But let me tell you,

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,639
Hu Li Town won't tolerate you stirring up trouble.

167
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,839
If your Li family can't control you,

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,240
the Hu family will.

169
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,879
And even if the Hu family can't,

170
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,040
there's still the law.

171
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Shut up.

172
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,240
Master Hu, what are you saying?

173
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,680
Even if we don't consider the relationship between our families,

174
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,759
for Juan's sake,

175
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,040
I still wouldn't dare make you angry.

176
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,680
Master Hu,

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
don't you agree?

178
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,920
You'd better think carefully.

179
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,279
Even if you didn't do those things,

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,920
Hu San was always following you.

181
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,079
So you can't escape responsibility.

182
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,399
Once I get to the bottom of everything,

183
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,959
I'll settle the score with you.

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
Master Hu,

185
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm really being wronged here.

186
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,439
It's true that Hu San was with me,

187
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
but he was killed by the Blood Fox.

188
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,680
And the Blood Fox isn't with me.

189
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,319
Master Hu,

190
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,199
I heard they found the person who hurt Juan.

191
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,560
It was also done by the Blood Fox.

192
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,959
Things haven't been peaceful lately, Master Hu.

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,879
My father told me to go home early.

194
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
He doesn't want me staying out too long.

195
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,759
Master Hu, I'll be leaving now.

196
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Would you like an apple?

197
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,319
I understand, I understand.

198
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:15,959
Hua,

199
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,160
take this.

200
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,920
You're crazy.

201
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,480
Wait for me.

202
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,040
Go.

203
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,480
Young master,

204
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,160
When did you two start getting close?

205
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,800
Don't talk nonsense.

206
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,759
Master Hu

207
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,519
The time has come.

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,959
Following the master's orders.

209
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,079
All those born in the year of the Tiger or Ox,

210
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,240
widows,

211
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,319
thirteen, twenty-three,

212
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,399
thirty-three,

213
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,360
forty-three, and fifty-three-year-old women,

214
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,800
turn around and avoid.

215
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,200
You’re still acting flirty even here.

216
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,159
I have every right to be flirty.

217
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,399
I’m a real widow.

218
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,279
Unlike you.

219
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,039
You’re a fake widow.

220
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,720
Today, our Hu family excels at banishing evil spirits.

221
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
Driving away dark forces,

222
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,399
reassuring the people,

223
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,360
upholding justice,

224
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,559
and protecting

225
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,080
the peace of our land.

226
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,159
Master Hu

227
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,159
Sister

228
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,240
Sister

229
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,440
What’s going on?

230
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Someone’s gone missing.
