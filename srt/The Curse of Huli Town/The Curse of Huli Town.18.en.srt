1
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,000
Master

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,320
Let’s stop here.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,199
I’ll head off now.

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,160
Alright.

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,760
Be careful on your way.

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,519
I will.

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,120
Brother Yang

8
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,119
Let me walk you part of the way.

9
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,159
Thank you, Brother Hu.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Brother Yang Nan

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,880
I don’t want you to leave.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,039
Something’s wrong!

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,320
Master Hu is in trouble!

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,119
Something’s wrong!

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,719
Master Li, he...

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,920
What happened? Tell me quickly!

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,119
Master Li’s stomach is full of worms.

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,920
They’re crawling out of his nose and eyes nonstop.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
It’s terrifying.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,240
Master! Grandpa!

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,000
Master Hu

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,880
Grandpa

23
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,119
Master, the medicine is ready.

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,719
Doctor Huang

25
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,520
Will this medicine work?

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,799
Can it get rid of the worms?

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,039
This deworming medicine has been passed down in my family.

28
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,200
Take three doses in a row.

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,200
Master Li will surely recover.

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,400
That’s good.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,879
Xingzong

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,560
Xingzong, are you alright?

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,519
Come.

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Master, what's going on?

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,760
Even Doctor Huang can't do anything about it.

36
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,480
Did you all hear?

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,879
Those worms came out from his ears, nose, and mouth,

38
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,799
and even flowed out of his eyes.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,159
And nothing happened to him.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,599
After doing so many bad things, he still wants to get away.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,120
He can't leave now.

42
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,879
Let them wait.

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,519
Heaven is watching them.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
Sooner or later, they'll be taken away.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,640
I think it was the blood fox who did it.

46
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,840
Don't talk nonsense.

47
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,200
You better believe it.

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,200
Think about how long our Huli Town has been peaceful.

49
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,760
Think about all those strange things.

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,480
When did it all start?

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,280
It started when that dead body was found on the mountain.

52
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,120
That's right.

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,159
After the dead body was found on the mountain,

54
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,280
Juan'er had an accident.

55
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,960
Then it was Dafa.

56
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,680
Hu San'er.

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,240
Xiu'er.

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
Then there was Hu Xiaoyun.

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,520
And Xiaohua.

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,479
Blood fox.

61
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Blood fox.

62
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,719
Please.

63
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,039
Master Hu, the Taoist master has arrived.

64
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,240
Thank you for coming, Taoist master.

65
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,479
No trouble at all.

66
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,000
This is bad.

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,719
There's a demonic aura here.

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,439
Wind, come.

69
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,319
The wind has connected me to the demon.

70
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,840
Let me go and talk to it.

71
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,080
This is bad. The demon isn't obeying.

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,879
Come.

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
Let's begin the ritual.

74
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,039
Master, please.

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,039
Qian Yuan Heng Li Zhen.

76
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,080
Dui Ze Ying Xiong Bing.

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,800
Yin and Yang, Eight Trigrams, aid your disciple.

78
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,080
By the power of the law, act swiftly!

79
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,120
Demon!

80
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,759
Watch how I destroy you.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Demon, where do you think you're going?

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,560
I didn't expect this demon

83
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,240
to have cultivated for seven hundred years.

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
If it hadn't encountered me,

85
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,240
after forty-nine days,

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,639
no one in Huli Town, young or old, would have survived.

87
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,480
Master Daoist,

88
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,560
then...

89
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,879
what about now?

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,920
Don't worry.

91
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,680
I've already destroyed its egg.

92
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,879
The demon's egg.

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,240
Boundless Heavenly Lord!

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
There's a ghost!

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,720
There's a ghost!

96
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,759
Stay away!

97
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,040
Stay away!

98
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,800
There's a ghost!

99
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,600
Father, Father

100
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,959
Master

101
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,720
Master

102
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,800
What's wrong, Father?

103
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,160
Hurry, go get someone! Go get help!

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,639
Someone, come quickly! Come here!

105
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,560
Father!

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,319
Be gentle, you all.

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Careful.

108
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,560
Greetings, Master.

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Take him out and find a place to bury him.

110
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,600
No, no, no, no, no!

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Don't bury him, Master!

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,160
He went mad on his own.

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
He killed himself.

114
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,680
What does this have to do with me, a humble Taoist?

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
You still dare to argue?

116
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,639
Are you going to talk or not?

117
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,920
No, I'll talk, I'll talk!

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,199
He was cursed with a Nanyang insect spell.

119
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,319
I heard people say that in Nanyang,

120
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,519
there is a kind of witchcraft

121
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,319
specifically for cursing people.

122
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,439
Actually, I saw it as soon as I came in.

123
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
But except for the one who cast the spell,

124
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
no one can save him.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
He was doomed to die anyway.

126
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,120
Even if I pretended to do magic, he would still die.

127
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,079
Isn't that right?

128
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,439
Get up, let's go.

129
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,720
Master can't be buried!

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,519
Master!

131
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,079
Master can't be buried!

132
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,199
Master!

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
Child, what's going on with you?

134
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,759
I'm already two months pregnant.

135
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
But Zhenzu is already gone.

136
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,120
Good child.

137
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,800
Have the baby.

138
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,879
So the Li family will have an heir.

139
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,079
From now on,

140
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,240
I, Hu Changshan,

141
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,920
will be your greatest support.

142
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,800
This...

143
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
Butler Hu

144
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,959
Go back, Master said he's fine.

145
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
He appreciates everyone's concern.

146
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,399
Then please tell Master Hu,

147
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,360
we're all very concerned about his health.

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,680
Yes.

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,279
Tell him to take good care of himself.

150
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,120
That's right, that's right.

151
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,399
Master Hu is the backbone of our Huli Town.

152
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,480
He's such a good man.

153
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,800
If anything happens to him,

154
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,959
what will we do?

155
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,959
Exactly, that's right.

156
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,000
You know, Master Hu is really something.

157
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,160
Everyone in the old Li family is already gone.

158
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,800
Why get so worked up about it?

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah.

160
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,199
Right?

161
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,439
It'd be better if they were all really gone.

162
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,560
We could buy more firecrackers,

163
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,800
and celebrate even more.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,279
Yes, celebrate.

165
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,800
He got the message.

166
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,759
Please, go back.

167
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
Then, this...

168
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,279
No need, just go back.

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,279
Then please help take care of Master Hu for us.

170
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,959
We'll be leaving now.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,439
We'll be leaving now.

172
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,319
Let's go.
