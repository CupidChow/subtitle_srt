1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,160
She actually did something like this.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Something strange has happened again in Huli Town.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,960
What do you think is going on?

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,440
Master Hu,

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,480
How did Daniu go mad in the first place?

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,760
And why did he start killing cats?

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,679
Speaking of Daniu,

8
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,039
that case is still unsolved, isn't it?

9
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,679
It was probably about two years ago.

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,880
Daniu and a girl named Li Lian

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,799
got engaged.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,079
Li Lian was very beautiful.

13
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,759
Many men were pursuing her.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,600
But she only liked Daniu.

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,240
One day,

16
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,200
Li Lian went to her sister's house in Geng Village.

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,560
On her way back, people saw her on the road.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,400
But she never made it home, even late at night.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,239
So Daniu went out to look for her.

20
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,879
Lian'er!

21
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,280
Lian'er!

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,359
Lian'er!

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,760
Who did this?

24
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,280
I will avenge you.

25
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,400
It was the Blood Fox.

26
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,280
Daniu, he killed cats.

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,840
But in his mind, he was killing the Blood Fox.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,120
He was avenging Li Lian.

29
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,519
He's truly a pitiful man.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
What about Li Lian?

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,519
Did they ever find out how she died?

32
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,639
Li Lian must have run into a bad person.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
She was killed.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
She ran into a bad person.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,919
It must have been Li Zhenzu.

36
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,280
Who else in Huli Town could it be besides him?

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,199
Many people say the same thing.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
But there's no evidence.

39
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,319
Master Hu

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,639
Then I'll be leaving now.

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,479
Please rest early.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,479
Alright.

43
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,039
Speak.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,919
Master.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
This was found by Wang Xiaohua

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,680
next to the well where she died.

47
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,080
Take it somewhere secluded

48
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,479
and get rid of it.

49
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,560
Yes.

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,120
Also,

51
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,120
those who know Young Master Zhenzu's secret

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,240
include Hu Xiaoyun

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,560
and Hui Niang.

54
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,560
I need to go back.

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,360
After we get our revenge,

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,360
I'll take you to see the best doctor in the world.

57
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,319
They'll definitely cure your illness.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I haven't seen you in so long,

59
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,199
and you've grown so much.

60
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,560
Back then in Nanyang,

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,759
if you hadn't taken care of me,

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,599
I probably would have died there.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Since that time,

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,159
I swore in my heart

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,439
that I would grow up quickly,

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
get taller,

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,159
and then rescue you from Nanyang.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,479
So we could come back together for revenge.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,719
We have to get rid of Hu Xiaoyun.

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,840
Otherwise, the things Zhenzu did

71
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,280
will be exposed sooner or later.

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
The villagers will find out too

73
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,960
that there was never any blood fox.

74
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,000
It all started because Zhenzu killed someone.

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
That's why the blood fox story was made up.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
To cover it up.

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
Father.

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,360
I always feel like there's another pair of eyes behind us.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,879
Watching us all the time.

80
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,759
I feel the same way.

81
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,079
That crazy woman's appearance was really suspicious.

82
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,639
This matter

83
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,279
feels like someone is weaving a big net.

84
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,240
Don't worry about Hu Xiaoyun.

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,839
I'll take care of it.

86
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,199
You can't do it yourself.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is anyone there?

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,279
Someone, come!

89
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,560
Someone, come!

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,279
What's wrong?

91
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,120
What's wrong, Master Hu?

92
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,480
Xiaoyun hanged herself.

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,399
What's going on?

94
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,399
Xiaoyun!

95
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,079
Xiaoyun, why would you do something like this?

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,079
I'm getting old.

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
My skills

98
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,519
aren't as sharp as they used to be.

99
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,959
I was really worried someone would see me.

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,439
Thinking about it now, it still scares me.

101
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,319
Oh, right.

102
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
There's one more person

103
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,720
we need to keep an eye on as well.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,079
You mean

105
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,319
What's wrong, Brother Hu?

106
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,680
Why are you in such a hurry to find me?

107
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,399
Did you miss me?

108
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,639
When do you plan to leave?

109
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,120
Officer Hu,

110
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,519
Do you really dislike me that much?

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
No.

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,199
If you can leave, do it as soon as possible.

113
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,079
If you stay, be careful.

114
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,839
Juan'er came to see me especially.

115
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,839
She said you seriously offended the Li family.

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,680
She’s afraid they might do something shady.

117
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,720
The Li family?

118
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
What did Juan'er tell you?

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
Nothing much.

120
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,000
I haven’t congratulated you yet, Brother Hu.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
Congratulations, Brother Hu.

122
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,040
When will you invite me to your wedding banquet with Juan'er?

123
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,240
What wedding banquet?

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I’ve heard all about it.

125
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,319
Last night,

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,519
nothing happened.

127
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,759
We just drank too much.

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,279
Alright.

129
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,839
I heard Master Hu had a fight with Juan'er.

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,079
Is Juan'er alright?

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,839
She said she already belongs to you.

132
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,680
Even though the old man was furious,

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,959
in my opinion,

134
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,120
it’s only a matter of time before Juan'er marries you.

135
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,480
What are you talking about?

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,399
Dad,

137
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,720
I've been thinking.

138
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,639
We can't let Yang Nan stay.

139
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,199
I suspect he's the one who kidnapped Zu'er.

140
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,199
Everything that's happened lately has been on my mind.

141
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,079
There are only two things I don't understand.

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,439
Who kidnapped Zu'er,

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,639
and who left the blood-written letter?

144
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,959
You're talking about the blood-written letter?

145
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,199
You suspect him?

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
I did save his life, after all.

147
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,720
He shouldn't curse me.

148
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,600
Could it be that he knows about our relationship?

149
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,879
No.

150
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,240
Zhenzu treats me,

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,519
and treats Juan'er that way,

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,439
unless he heard it with his own ears,

153
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,920
otherwise, who would believe it?

154
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,319
If he knew beforehand

155
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,040
that you saved him,

156
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,199
then it was all part of his ruse.

157
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,079
You're saying he approached me on purpose?

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
That can't be.

159
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,720
If I hadn't arrived in time back then,

160
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,519
he would have bled out.

161
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,360
Besides,

162
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,560
if nothing had happened to Juan'er,

163
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,519
he would have left the next day.

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Who is it?

165
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,199
Open the door.

166
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,519
I'm looking for Li Zhenzu.

167
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,439
Where is Li Zhenzu?

168
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,439
No.

169
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,160
You.

170
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,079
Li Zhenzu.

171
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,040
Come out here! What are you doing?

172
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
What kind of behavior is this?

173
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,040
Throw her out.

174
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,519
Go.

175
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,199
Leave right now.

176
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,000
You're the one who killed my son.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,839
You'd better leave.

178
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

179
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,319
You have no conscience at all.

180
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,600
My son treated you like a god.

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,519
But you treated my son worse than an animal.

182
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,439
Get out now.

183
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:26,720
Go, go!

184
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
How dare you push me!

185
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,040
My son is dead.

186
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,240
What's the point of living now?

187
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,279
The Hu family line is finished.

188
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,559
I'm going to kill you.

189
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
You're crazy! I'll kill you!

190
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,120
Get out of the way.

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
I'm going to kill you.

00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,480
Stop!

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you standing there for?

194
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
Go get Doctor Huang!

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Hey!
