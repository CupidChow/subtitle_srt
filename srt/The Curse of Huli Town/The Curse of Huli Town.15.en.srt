1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,000
The hatred in your heart

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,640
still hasn't been let go.

3
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,519
I'm already a dying man.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,760
I just can't stop worrying about Anan.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,160
Back then, he risked his life

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,359
to save me from the hell of Nanyang.

7
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,039
I owe him.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,759
Now I'm repaying him with my life.

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,640
This is the karma between him and me.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,960
Years ago, my enemy sold me to Nanyang.

11
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,119
That led me to meet Anan by chance.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,280
Now, because of Anan, I've found my enemy.

13
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,759
This is the karma between me and my enemy.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,759
I'm just worried about Anan.

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,120
That because of hatred,

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,879
he'll become someone consumed by hatred.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,439
Maybe

18
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,680
only hatred can make him let go of hatred.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,400
All these years, he hasn't been able to let go of his hatred.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,560
It's the only obsession he has in this world.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,719
Once his great revenge is fulfilled,

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,920
from then on,

23
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,480
what else will he have to hold on to?

24
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,959
Kun.

25
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,599
Kun is in trouble! Open the door, quick!

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
Kun!

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,760
Open the door! Something terrible has happened!

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,640
What happened?

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,959
Li Zhenzu is dead.

30
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,079
Li Zhenzu is dead.

31
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
Kun, look, he's smiling too.

32
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,520
Could it be the Blood Fox again?

33
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,319
Don't talk nonsense.

34
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,360
What Blood Fox?

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Zhenzu

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,800
Zhenzu

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,360
Zhenzu

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
What's wrong with you?

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,879
Zhenzu

40
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,400
Wake up!

41
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,719
Why don't you listen to your father?

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,639
Zhenzu, what are you doing, Zhenzu?

43
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,599
I'm begging you, please wake up!

44
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:34,960
Father

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
You have to avenge Zuer!

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,719
How much have you been hiding from me?

47
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,199
I...

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
The smile on Zuer's face

49
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,800
and the smile on the dead man's face on the mountain

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
What's going on with that?

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,599
Do you think you can fool me?

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes

53
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,599
The dead man on the mountain was a child kidnapper.

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,960
It was from him that I accidentally got the information.

55
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,560
He was also the one who killed the person.

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,039
Yes

57
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,840
Foolish

58
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,479
Does anyone else know about this?

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,319
Hu San'er

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,159
But he's already dead.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
I thought that if I put everything

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
on the Blood Fox

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,599
it would all be over.

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,639
But Zuer

65
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,800
still met a tragic end.

66
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,479
You suspect

67
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,400
Zuer was forcibly given drugs by someone

68
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,159
which caused heart failure and death

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
Li Qiang had me beat him half to death

70
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,840
He finally confessed

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,599
That night, Zuer

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,240
went to Wang Xiaohua's place with something

73
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
You suspect

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,120
Wang Xiaohua

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,319
Wang Xiaohua has been missing and still hasn't been found

76
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,520
It must be her

77
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,360
If she hadn't seduced Zuer

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,519
Zuer wouldn't have died

79
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,399
Enough

80
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,800
Shut up

81
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,879
It's clearly your own fault for not raising your son properly

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
You brought this on yourself

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,959
So Zuer died for nothing

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,040
Let me handle this matter

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,279
Dad

86
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,079
I think the recent events have been a bit strange

87
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,480
Especially after that crazy woman showed up

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,439
Could it be that another enemy is after us?

89
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Is that why Zuer...

90
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,120
Brother Xiaokun

91
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,879
Let's have a drink, just the two of us

92
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,920
Come on, let's drink, let's drink

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,079
Isn't this awesome?

94
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,079
Awesome.

95
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,680
Big Bull.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,160
What are you doing, Big Bull?

97
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,439
Bull, come have a drink.

98
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,040
Want to drink, Bull?

99
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,279
What Lian'er? Lian'er died a long time ago.

100
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,120
Are you stupid?

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,360
Wake up, Big Bull.

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,639
I'll go take a look.

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
Big Bull.

104
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,759
Big Bull.

105
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,639
Come drink.

106
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,399
Big Bull.

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,720
Wake up.

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,720
Wake up, Big Bull.

109
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,959
Blood Fox.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,040
Blood Fox killed someone.

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,439
Blood Fox.

112
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,160
Blood.

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Blood Fox killed someone.

114
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,839
Blood Fox killed someone.

115
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,879
Brother Xiao Kun.

116
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,439
I heard from Shuanzi.

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,959
Ever since Li Zhenzu died,

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,759
you've locked yourself at home.

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,279
If you have anything on your mind, you can tell me.

120
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,480
Why? Why did it turn out like this?

121
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,720
Brother Xiao Kun.

122
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,639
Brother Xiao Kun.

123
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,240
Brother Xiao Kun.

124
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,879
So this is what you like.

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,399
Kun

126
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,920
What are you doing?

127
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
Da Niu is dead.

128
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,720
What?

129
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,319
Da Niu is dead.

130
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,800
The Blood Fox killed again.

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,319
Yeah.

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,160
That slash was right on the neck.

133
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,120
It even looked like he did it to himself.

134
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,759
Juan

135
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,399
Stay here.

136
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I'll come get you in a bit.

137
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,560
Brother Xiao Kun

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,319
I'm scared.

139
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,560
Er Zhuang, you take her.

140
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,560
It's okay.

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,040
Brother Xiao Kun

142
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,639
Let's drink together next time.

143
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,000
Can you lock the door?

144
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,160
If you dare tell anyone, see if I don't beat you.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,000
I won't, I won't.

146
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:03,680
It's a secret.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,519
Let's go.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,480
Let's go.

149
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,040
Let's go.

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,360
No, Kun.

151
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,000
Why do you think Daniu keeps hurting himself?

152
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,000
Could it be...

153
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,759
The Blood Fox is acting up again, right?

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,399
He must be bewitched by the Blood Fox.

155
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,560
On their faces...

156
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,679
He was even smiling like that.

157
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,960
Stop talking to me about the Blood Fox.

158
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Did you all see it?

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,679
Shuanzi saw it, ask him.

160
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,039
We're talking about Daniu.

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,759
Why are you dragging me into this?

162
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,279
Until we figure out what's going on,

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
no one should jump to conclusions.

164
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,399
Did you hear me?

165
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,480
Heard you.

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,519
Go back and get some sleep.

167
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,759
Alright, alright, let's go, let's go.

168
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,039
Don't drink so much if you don't have to.

169
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,080
Okay, okay.

170
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,960
We're leaving.

171
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,759
Let's go.

172
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,279
Kun, I'm not a superstitious person.

173
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,279
But this is just too weird.

174
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,799
My whole body...

175
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,120
I've got goosebumps all over.

176
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,399
You drank too.

177
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,200
You're a young woman,

178
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,960
sneaking into a man's room in the middle of the night.

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,200
This is disgraceful and improper!

180
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,840
I like him.

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
I want to marry him.

182
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,200
How is that disgraceful?

183
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,639
You're going to be the death of me!

184
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,639
Master Hu, please don't blame Juan.

185
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,600
Calm down.

186
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,919
How can I calm down?

187
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,279
She did something like this!

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,799
You—

189
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,399
Say it.

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,519
Go on.

191
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,360
Grandpa,

192
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,399
I...

193
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,759
I'm already Xiao Kun's woman.

194
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,919
Please let me marry him.

195
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,200
You—

196
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,919
By doing this,

197
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,519
how am I supposed to face anyone?

198
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,679
I'm leaving now.

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,120
Goodbye, Brother Yang Nan.

200
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,679
You—
