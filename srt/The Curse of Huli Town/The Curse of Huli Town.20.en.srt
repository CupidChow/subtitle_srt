1
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,280
I’ve checked.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,399
Your hand is injured.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,519
The bone should be fine, right?

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,559
You hurt your bone just to avoid writing a statement.

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,079
You’re afraid I’ll have you write something to compare your handwriting.

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,039
Is that right?

7
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,320
That's right.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,880
What's written here is true.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,119
Master Hu is a scoundrel.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,159
A human trafficker.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,679
I

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,079
was sold to Southeast Asia by him.

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,359
That year was full of chaos and war.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,719
My father went out to look for me.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,759
He was never heard from again.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,759
My mother fell ill and never recovered.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,120
She died.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,239
It was the neighbors who found someone to bury her.

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,239
At that time, I swore

20
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,719
I would kill that scoundrel to avenge them.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
But who would have thought

22
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,599
he later ran away.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,239
I heard his son was beaten to death on the road.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,840
I followed the clues all the way here.

25
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,840
But I ran into bandits on the way.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,239
I was stabbed.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,879
When I woke up, I was already at the Hu residence.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,079
The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes

29
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,599
was the murderer I had been searching for all these years.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,760
He turned out to be my savior.

31
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,640
How do you know you didn't mistake him for someone else?

32
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,319
The person who destroyed your family,

33
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
could you ever forget his face?

34
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,800
He destroyed my family,

35
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,520
but also saved my life.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,719
I don't know how to face him.

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,000
Later, my wounds healed day by day.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Only then did I find out

39
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,680
that Hu Changshan is truly a living Bodhisattva.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,280
He gives out porridge and donates money.

41
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,719
He builds bridges and roads.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,120
In Huli Town, he is known as a great philanthropist.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,360
I told myself

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,199
maybe I should just let it go

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,120
I really couldn't

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
bring myself to hurt someone who had changed

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,639
Besides, my late parents

48
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,360
surely wouldn't blame me either

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
until one day

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,319
I discovered something else

51
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,479
Why should he, Hu Changshan,

52
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,520
get away with money earned at the cost of lives

53
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,719
I hate him

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
Darn it, he deserves it

55
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,120
He not only destroyed my family

56
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,039
but also Huiniang

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,639
Huiniang

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,080
is the one you called

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
the crazy woman

60
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,800
She was once a student at a school

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,240
young and full of dreams

62
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,680
but she was ruined by Hu Changshan

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,439
So all of this

64
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,280
was planned by you in advance

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
That's right

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,360
We first had Huiniang pretend to be crazy and come to town

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,080
to force Hu Changshan to give in

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,919
and tear off his mask of hypocrisy

69
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,560
But who would have thought

70
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,240
we would discover another

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,000
important secret

72
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,479
It turns out

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
the Li family and the Hu family are truly connected

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,839
We originally thought our plan

75
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,319
was flawless.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,079
We sent Huiniang to the Li family

77
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,519
to tell Li Xingzong

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,920
that Master Hu was a murderer.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,519
But who would have thought

80
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
that because of this secret

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,839
Huiniang was killed.

82
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,399
Our plan was completely ruined as well.

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,839
Later, after our investigation, we found out

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,079
Yicuomao had two sons.

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,680
The first son was killed while on the run.

86
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,079
He was Juan'er's father.

87
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,240
There was another son,

88
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,000
who was Li Xingzong.

89
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,120
He changed his name and came to Huli Town.

90
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,920
After settling down,

91
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,079
he brought Li Xingzong over.

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,240
You knew all this earlier.

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
Then why didn't you tell us sooner?

94
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,639
Would you have believed me?

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,519
Would any of you have believed me?

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,519
Young Master Yang, look, it's so late at night.

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,240
Isn't it?

98
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,399
The opera troupe

99
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,439
should just focus on performing.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,839
Alright.

101
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,800
Don't worry.

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,040
Huiniang

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,519
Huiniang

104
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,759
No, no!

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,120
How could this happen?

106
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,959
Huiniang

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,759
Don't worry about me.

108
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,199
Do what you want to do.

109
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
No, I won't seek revenge anymore.

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,279
We won't seek revenge anymore.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll take you to see a doctor.

112
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,240
We'll find the best doctor.

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Huiniang, let's go.

114
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,600
Let's go right now.

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,199
Huiniang

116
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,600
What about Li Zhenzu?

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
I killed him.

118
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,759
But Hui Niang,

119
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,000
Wang Dali, Xiu'er, and Hu San'er

120
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,439
were all killed by him.

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
So it turns out so many people were killed by Li Zhenzu.

122
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,240
When it comes down to it,

123
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,360
we should actually thank Li Zhenzu.

124
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
If it weren't for Li Zhenzu,

125
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,079
we wouldn't have thought of the Blood Fox either.

126
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,360
He threw your whole Huli Town into chaos.

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,720
Then we could quietly carry out our plan.

128
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
But who would have thought

129
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,199
we wanted to use the Blood Fox,

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,360
but Li Zhenzu and his son,

131
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,879
and Hu Changshan also thought of the Blood Fox.

132
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,839
Do you know why they wanted to repair the old temple?

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,279
Because they wanted to hide the ill-gotten gains from back then

134
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
in the old temple.

135
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,279
What about Li Xingzong?

136
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,480
Was the evil spell on him also your doing?

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,240
That's right.

138
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,240
I wanted Hu Changshan to watch the people around him

139
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,279
die one by one.

140
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,240
I wanted him to taste

141
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,079
this kind of pain.

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
You even killed Juan'er?

143
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,360
Juan'er is a good girl.

144
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,920
I would never kill her.

145
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,399
What else do you know?

146
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,000
Tell me everything.

147
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,680
Yang Nan

148
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,959
If you tell me everything,

149
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,439
things won't be so bad.

150
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,840
Maybe I can bring them to justice.

151
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
Who do you want to bring to justice?

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Yicuomao

153
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,720
Juan'er's grandfather

154
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,320
Yang Nan

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
You're underestimating me.

156
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
I told you, I'm a police officer.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,120
If you can prove that Hu Changshan is Yicuomao,

158
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
and a human trafficker,

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,559
I won't let him go.

160
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,039
Whoever breaks the law, I'll arrest them.

161
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,159
Including you.

162
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,679
You want to arrest me?

163
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,240
For using poison to harm people?

164
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,840
Shouldn't I arrest you?

165
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,240
If you arrest me,

166
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,200
how will you prove

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,879
that Yicuomao is Hu Changshan?

168
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,279
And let him keep pretending to be a good person?

169
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,399
And get away with it?

170
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,919
Hu Zhengkun

171
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
Give me a little more time.

172
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,720
Hu Changshan, to save Li Zhenzu's wife,

173
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
and her unborn child,

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,039
will definitely tell you the whole truth.

175
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,200
By then, whatever you want to do to me,

176
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,320
it's up to you.

177
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,080
No.

178
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,320
I can't agree to that.

179
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm a police officer.

180
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,919
If you break the law, I have to arrest you.

181
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
Officer Hu,

182
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,120
do you know how I usually use poison?

183
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
How?

184
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,879
I usually put the poisonous insect

185
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,679
into a teacup.

186
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,559
Just like these two cups.
