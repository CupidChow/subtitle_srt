1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,839
Officer Hu, look at this board.

2
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,320
Wasn't this done by the Blood Fox?

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,839
Yes.

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,480
Zhengkun.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,879
Don't talk nonsense.

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,280
Take a look.

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,160
What's going on?

8
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,640
Master Hu.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,280
Master Hu.

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,519
Please take a look at this.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,280
The Blood Fox demands lives.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,439
Hu Changshan, Li Xingzong, and Li Zhenzu will die miserably.

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:39,880
This...

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,359
Master Hu.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,280
Master Hu.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,960
This wooden board

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,600
was always held in this woman's hand.

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,479
Isn't this the Blood Fox's doing again?

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,799
Yeah, what should we do now?

20
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,159
Yes, this village hasn't been peaceful lately.

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,039
That's right.

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,840
Master Hu.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,439
I've already examined the body.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,159
She was clearly murdered.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,759
Master Li.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
This woman

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,880
wasn't she living in your house before?

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,400
What do you mean?

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,680
Enough.

30
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,280
Xiao Kun.

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,760
Take this woman's body to the abandoned temple first.

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,840
She's a pitiful person too.

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,079
Hu Quan.

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,920
Master.

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
Buy a coffin and cremate her.

36
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,599
Yes.

37
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,200
Master Hu.

38
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,799
This...

39
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,079
I'll take care of it right away.

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Amitabha.

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,439
Master Hu.

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,920
This matter concerning the woman

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,599
has nothing to do with the Blood Fox.

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
Master.

45
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,760
You mean

46
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,000
this is a human calamity

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,480
and not a supernatural event?

48
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,319
Forgive me, but I am unable to help.

49
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,280
She has always been taken in by the Li family.

50
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,400
A crazy outsider

51
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,120
who could she have a grudge against?

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
Could it be that the Li family wronged her?

53
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,039
But

54
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,120
why would she curse Master Hu?

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,439
We've always overlooked the most crucial question.

56
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,879
This woman is an outsider.

57
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,719
She's insane.

58
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,199
How would she know about the legend of the Blood Fox?

59
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,639
I know!

60
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,199
She must have been sent by the Blood Fox.

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
You might as well say she's a fox in disguise.

62
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,039
Then her fox tail was revealed

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,360
and someone found out.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,080
She was beaten to death.

65
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,280
That actually makes some sense.

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,879
The logic checks out.

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,479
But

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,159
how do you explain her crazy talk?

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,639
Crazy talk...

70
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,759
Maybe only a madman

71
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,120
can understand a madman's secrets.

72
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,759
Right.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
Daniu goes out every day.

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,199
Maybe he saw something.

75
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm going to find Daniu.

76
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,360
You two

77
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,120
just

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,080
go.

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,919
What that woman said

80
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,360
I don't know what it means either

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,080
But last night I had another episode and ran out

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,000
I remember it very clearly

83
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,199
It was Li Zhenzu

84
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Looks like I was right

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,599
Li Zhenzu, that bastard

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,919
He's truly despicable

87
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,599
He won't even spare a lunatic

88
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,919
Juan'er

89
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
There are some things you shouldn't hear

90
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,479
Why don't you wait outside for a bit

91
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,599
Juan'er

92
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,919
Are you okay now

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm sorry I couldn't save you

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,199
If I hadn't had that episode

95
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,280
It's all my fault

96
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,960
Daniu, don't blame yourself

97
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,759
It was all the Blood Fox's doing

98
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,919
Even if you hadn't had that episode

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,199
There was nothing you could do

100
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,439
Blood Fox

101
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,240
It wasn't the Blood Fox

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,199
It was a man

103
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,639
Was it Hu San'er

104
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,519
No

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,040
Daniu

106
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,600
Did you remember something

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,439
Kun, my head hurts so much.

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,079
The Blood Fox has come to claim a life.

109
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,879
Lian'er is dead. Lian'er...

110
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,439
Daniu.

111
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,759
Lian'er.

112
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,319
Who would understand?

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm going crazy too.

114
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,360
So what should we do now, Kun?

115
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,199
I believe what Daniu said.

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,759
Let's go find Li Zhenzu.

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,439
Brother.

118
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,920
Have you thought about Juan'er?

119
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,279
What if what happened to Juan'er wasn't done by the Blood Fox?

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,920
Then...

121
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,720
I...

122
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,639
I believe Kun.

123
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,639
But...

124
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,560
If that's the case,

125
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,439
everyone in town will know

126
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,000
that your innocence was ruined by someone.

127
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,439
Will you still be able to get married in the future?

128
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,600
If I can't get married, then I won't.

129
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,600
If I can,

130
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,839
will you marry me?

131
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,360
I will.

132
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you, Zhengkun.

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,879
Then I won't go with you all.

134
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll go home to find my grandpa first.

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,279
Remember to invite me for a drink!

136
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,279
Hu Zhengkun, you're here again.

137
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,240
Master Hu.

138
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,040
Go ahead.

139
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,839
What nonsense are you spouting this time?

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,759
Li Zhenzu.

141
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,639
You killed someone and still act like nothing happened.

142
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,040
Daniu saw everything.

143
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,920
What rubbish are you talking about now?

144
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,839
Do you dare say you didn't kill that crazy woman?

145
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,160
Of course I dare say it.

146
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Daniu fainted from fright.

147
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,399
Before he fainted, he clearly saw you.

148
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
You're framing me.

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,959
Who in the village doesn't know Daniu?

150
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,120
He's out of his mind.

151
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,720
Even a cat could spot a bleeding fox.

152
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,680
You're the only one who can make sense of what he says.

153
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,160
Besides,

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
I went to bed as soon as it got dark yesterday.

155
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,600
I never even went out.

156
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,439
Brother,

157
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,680
you're the gatekeeper here, right?

158
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,839
No.

159
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,560
Old Hu broke his leg.

160
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,839
He went home to recover, so I'm filling in for him.

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,439
Tell everyone the truth.

162
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,360
Did no one really go out last night?

163
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,399
No one went out.

164
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,160
I was at the gatehouse the whole time.

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
I didn't even dare to doze off.

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,079
You think someone has to use the gate to kill?

167
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,120
Hu Zhengkun.

168
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,079
I've given you enough respect, haven't I?

169
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,879
We've been waiting here for so long.

170
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,480
And your father can still sleep?

171
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,560
Tell him to come out.

172
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,000
Young master, something's wrong.

173
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,319
Master has fainted again.

174
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,759
Dad

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,639
Dad

176
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,879
Dad, what's wrong?

177
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,560
Dad

178
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,680
Stop crying

179
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,759
Move aside

180
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,439
Oh

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
You're awake

182
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,360
Master Hu

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,319
What happened here?

184
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,800
What do you think happened?

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,519
It hurts so much

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
It hurts so much

187
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,759
It was that woman

188
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,720
That woman tried to kill Master last night

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,399
When Master wasn't paying attention

190
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,639
She knocked Master out with a stick

191
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,720
Then she ran away

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,720
Master didn't want me to tell anyone because he was afraid you'd worry

193
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,000
He even forced himself to go to the temple

194
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,959
That woman

195
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,439
She probably thought Master Li was dead

196
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,439
She hurriedly climbed over the wall to escape

197
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,759
In her panic, she accidentally fell onto a rock

198
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,439
No one killed her

199
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,519
She hit her head on the rock and died herself

200
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
What Master Hu said makes more sense

201
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,519
The logic checks out too

202
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,799
Like hell it does

203
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
Didn't you just say

204
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,559
that Daniu saw me kill her?

205
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,919
How has she been living at your place?

206
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,440
She has food and drink here.

207
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,000
She’s quite well-behaved.

208
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,320
She even helps out with some chores around the house.

209
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,480
But I really didn’t expect her

210
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,519
This silly child

211
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,320
would try to kill you for no reason.

212
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,840
Master Li,

213
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,320
what did you do to her?

214
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,519
What do you mean by that?

215
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,600
She also tried to kill Master Hu for no reason.

216
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,679
What did Master Hu ever do to her?

217
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,519
Zhenzu,

218
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,840
Master Hu,

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
I didn’t mean anything else.

220
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,120
This kid just falsely accused me,

221
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,320
and now he’s accusing my father.

222
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,639
What are you getting at?

223
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,720
Master Li,

224
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,960
who are you, really?

225
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,000
I don’t need to spell it out, do I?

226
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
You dare say

227
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,000
you brought this lunatic into your house

228
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,159
without any ulterior motive?

229
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,159
What motive could I have?

230
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
She’s just a lunatic.

231
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,919
You have thoughts about a lunatic?

232
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,279
You—

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

234
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,639
Master Hu,

235
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
I truly respect you from the bottom of my heart.

236
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,080
I brought her back

237
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,159
hoping to do you a small favor.

238
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,240
And to earn some good karma for the Li family.

239
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,919
I’m not so sure about that.

240
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,519
She seemed pretty normal when she was with us.

241
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,639
I think

242
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,799
she was probably bewitched by that blood fox.
