1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,920
We've searched Kun's rundown house seven or eight times already.

2
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,640
There isn't a single clue.

3
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,519
How about

4
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,079
we just stop going there?

5
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,160
Juan has suffered so much injustice.

6
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,679
I will definitely find the culprit and bring them to justice.

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,920
That rundown house

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,640
must still have some corners we haven't searched.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,759
As long as it's a person,

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,840
they're bound to leave some clues.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,759
But what if

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
it's not a person?

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,320
You don't actually believe

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,520
there's such a thing as a blood fox, do you?

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,560
You can't not know

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,880
that in this whole town,

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,560
you're the only one who doesn't believe it.

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,159
Even if it really is a blood fox,

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,399
I'll still find it

20
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,200
and bring it to justice.

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,119
Kun

22
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,359
did you hear something?

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,040
Don't talk nonsense, there's no sound.

24
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,319
Kun

25
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,759
Brother Fa,

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,599
he's not here.

27
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,639
Xiaoyun,

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
hurry and get me some medicine.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,199
My stomach hurts.

30
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,759
Did you bring your prescription?

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,599
Isn't it always the same prescription?

32
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,400
Yeah.

33
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,400
You all know it.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,280
Don't worry, it's all here.

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,400
Xiaoyun is the best. Go quickly.

36
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,639
Dafa!

37
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,159
Hu San'er!

38
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,759
Dafa!

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong?

40
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,800
Look.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,560
Look at him.

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,319
Hu San'er!

43
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,039
Hu San'er!

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,599
What do you mean?

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,039
Don't do anything crazy.

46
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,719
I'm warning you.

47
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,479
What are you doing?

48
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,560
What are you trying to do?

49
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,199
The Blood Fox is back.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,319
We're all going to die.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,199
All of us will die.

52
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,159
Murder! Hu San'er killed someone!

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,599
Murder!

54
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,960
Hu San'er killed someone!

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,759
Dafa!

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,000
Dafa!

57
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,360
Dafa!

58
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,759
Help! Can someone save him?

59
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,159
Move aside, move aside! Everyone, move!

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,919
Dafa!

61
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,919
Dafa!

62
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,000
Dafa!

63
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,319
Help! Help!

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
What happened?

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,560
Who saw it?

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
I did.

67
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,639
I saw the whole thing.

68
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,279
Speak.

69
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,120
Today is the first day of the lunar month.

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
I got up earlier than usual.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,160
But as soon as I got up, my old problem acted up again.

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,399
My stomach started twisting in pain.

73
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,920
Widow Li

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm asking you about Hu San.

75
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,519
Why are you in such a hurry?

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
Don't we have to talk about these things one by one?

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Go ahead, tell me.

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,839
My stomach hurts.

79
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,040
Forget it, it's all because of my stomachache anyway.

80
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,839
I came to get some medicine.

81
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,920
I had just come in,

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
when Hu San came in too.

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,240
Hu San glared fiercely at Hu Xiaoyun.

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,120
It felt like

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,480
he wasn't human.

86
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,639
Like he was something else.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,879
Like he was possessed by a fox.

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,680
A fox?

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,040
Was it a blood fox?

90
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
Widow Li

91
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,519
It's broad daylight.

92
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,079
Don't talk nonsense.

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,079
What blood fox?

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,120
If I'm lying, may I be struck by lightning.

95
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,319
Officer Hu

96
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,720
Please help us figure something out.

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,399
If the blood fox really comes,

98
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,360
I've already said,

99
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,959
there's no such thing as a blood fox.

100
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
Everyone, don't worry.

101
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,600
Master Hu has already asked Master Ruyin

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
to perform a grand ritual for us.

103
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,319
It will be in the next few days.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,279
It will surely keep everyone safe.

105
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,959
And drive out

106
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
any local demons.

107
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
That's wonderful, that's wonderful.

108
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,879
Good, good, good.

109
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,920
Yang Nan

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,879
Why were you at the pharmacy today?

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,439
I went to get some medicine.

112
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,839
Still coughing?

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,240
Why?

114
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,680
Why what?

115
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,879
The whole town is on edge these days.

116
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,079
Hu San is possessed by the blood fox again.

117
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,040
He killed someone in public.

118
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
I just wanted to reassure everyone.

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
What's wrong with that?

120
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,360
I will get to the bottom of this.

121
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,680
I've always trusted Officer Hu's abilities.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm not just talking about this case.

123
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,519
But also about you.

124
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,360
Who are you, really?

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,120
I will find out.

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Where are you going?

127
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
To investigate the truth.

128
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
Officer Hu, do you want to come with me?

129
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,800
So you and Master Hu

130
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,199
already knew who harmed Juan'er

131
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,319
It was Hu San'er, right?

132
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,240
Yes.

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,480
At first, we all thought it was Li Zhenzu.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,199
But yesterday, someone saw

135
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,000
Li Zhenzu

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,040
went to Wang Xiaohua's house and stayed until late at night.

137
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,160
And you found Juan'er at midnight.

138
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,639
And before that,

139
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,560
someone happened to see

140
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,319
Hu San'er coming out of that abandoned house.

141
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,240
Besides, you also saw

142
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,839
that undergarment.

143
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm going to ask Master Hu for the truth.

144
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,399
Even if you arrest Master Hu and torture him,

145
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,240
he'll only tell you it was the Blood Fox.

146
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,360
Then what should we do?

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,560
Are we just going to let Hu San'er get away with it?

148
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,839
He's already dead.

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,959
But his crimes haven't been made public.

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
And what about Juan'er?

151
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,600
What about her injustice?

152
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
You still have the nerve to mention Juan'er.

153
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,399
Juan'er hanged herself yesterday, did you know?

154
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,439
What did you say?

155
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,199
Juan'er hanged herself.

156
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,879
She's not in any serious danger.

157
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Hu Zhengkun.

158
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,759
I'm telling you,

159
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,920
if you still have any sympathy for Juan'er

160
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,399
at all,

161
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,519
then don't pursue this matter any further.

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Now everyone in town thinks

163
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,279
that what happened to Juan'er was done by the Blood Fox.

164
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,839
If you go to see Master Hu now,

165
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,639
it's the same as telling everyone

166
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,879
that what happened to Juan'er was caused by a person.

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,839
What do you expect Juan'er to do then?

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,040
You'd ruin her whole life.

169
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,600
Then what do you want me to do?

170
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,079
I'm a police officer.

171
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,399
You want me to tell them

172
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,720
that the Blood Fox is behind all of this?

173
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,399
If that's the best way,

174
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,519
I don't mind if you let it go.

175
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,399
What kind of bullshit belief is that?
