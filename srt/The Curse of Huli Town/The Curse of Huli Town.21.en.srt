1
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,800
I usually put the Gu worm

2
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,679
into the teacup.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,359
Just like these two cups.

4
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,679
You didn't drink it.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,559
What about him?

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,240
Kun.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,920
Help me, I don't want to die.

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,920
You're not an irredeemable person.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,560
You couldn't do something like this.

10
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,079
I don't want to die, Kun.

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:45,960
Shuanzi.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,119
Don't be afraid.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
Really?

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,679
If the little worm doesn't respond to the antidote,

15
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,799
it will grow quickly.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,079
Little Kun.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,959
Juan, could you step out for a moment?

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,400
I need to talk to Master Hu.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,239
About what?

20
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,519
You have to keep it from me?

21
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,959
Juan, please go out first.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,840
Sit.

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,760
Don't just stand there and talk.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Master Hu.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Are you really a human trafficker?

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,599
Yang Nan isn't really called Yang Nan.

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,319
His name is a homophone for Nanyang.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,319
You sold him to Nanyang.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
Now he's come back for revenge.

30
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,200
He personally heard Li Xingzong call you "father."

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,480
He heard you order Li Xingzong

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,599
to kill the mad woman.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,560
That's why he wrote a blood oath.

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,519
He listed you, Li Xingzong, and Li Zhenzu together.

35
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,759
The Gu worms in Li Xingzong and Li Zhenzu's wife

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,319
were planted by him.

37
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,879
So you admit it.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,759
Admit what?

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
That I sold him to Nanyang?

40
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,479
That I'm a human trafficker?

41
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,080
That I'm beyond redemption?

42
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,000
Go ask the people of Huli Town,

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,319
would anyone believe that?

44
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,919
Xiaokun, you're confused.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
I don't know why he said that.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,439
Back then, I was doing business in Shanghai.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,639
It was probably an old enemy from that time.

48
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,280
An enemy is slandering me.

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,000
What does it mean to attack someone from the shadows?

50
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,039
Bring him here.

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,199
I'll confront him face to face.

52
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,520
He left.

53
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,120
How could you let him leave?

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
Li Xingzong died so tragically.

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,199
And now Li Zhenzu's wife is like this.

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,120
Do you want him to hurt more people?

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,639
Why didn't you catch him?

58
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,719
Master Hu,

59
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,639
are you really a human trafficker or not?

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,280
No, I'm not.

61
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,639
Why don't you believe my grandfather?

62
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,680
You're a human trafficker.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,759
Even he wouldn't be a human trafficker.

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,599
Let's go.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
Go, just go.

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,439
It's not that I don't believe.

67
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,800
It's what that Yang Nan said.

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,520
I won't listen.

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,639
I still have to get to the bottom of this.

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,319
Come on, let's go.

71
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,840
Grandpa,

72
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,919
is what he said true?

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Does it have something to do with the Li family?

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,919
Hu Quan

75
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,400
Master, your orders.

76
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,919
How is the matter in Nanyang going?

77
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,280
I've already sent someone to handle it.

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,719
Zhenzu's wife right now...

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,199
is not doing well.

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,879
You may go.

81
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,720
Yang Nan was right.

82
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,040
I am a human trafficker.

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,199
I've committed many evil deeds.

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,720
I've trafficked many people to Nanyang.

85
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,680
Zuer is my biological grandson.

86
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
You two are cousins.

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,920
Didn't you say you weren't?

88
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,800
Why are you admitting it now?

89
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,800
I don't want you to admit it.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,319
You said you weren't.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,959
I am.

92
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,079
Do you think I want to admit it?

93
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,079
I'd rather let your second uncle die like this

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,480
than let you know the truth.

95
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,120
Now,

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,399
I have no way out.

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Juan'er...

98
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,759
Grandpa has a favor to ask you.

99
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,839
Juan'er.

100
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,040
Don't cry.

101
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,399
It's okay, it's okay.

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,439
Don't cry.

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,920
Brother Kun

104
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,560
Grandpa admitted it.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,040
I'm the granddaughter of a bad person.

106
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,360
How can I face anyone from now on?

107
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,319
It's okay, Juan.

108
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,079
This has nothing to do with you.

109
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,000
He is him, and you are you.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
With your Brother Kun here,

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,079
there's nothing to be afraid of.

112
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,240
Brother Kun

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
Can I ask you for a favor?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Go ahead.

115
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,319
Go arrest Yang Nan.

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,120
Only he can save Li Zhenzu's wife.

117
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,000
My grandpa asked me to beg you.

118
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,759
If you don't help me,

119
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,720
my grandpa will die.

120
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,240
Juan.

121
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
Actually, your grandpa doesn't have to do this.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,839
Yang Nan broke the law.

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,160
You don't need to beg me.

124
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,319
I will go arrest him anyway.

125
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,759
You let him go, but you'll still arrest him?

126
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm begging you.

127
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,519
Grandpa.

128
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,759
Grandpa keeps his word.

129
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,040
He will definitely do what he says.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm begging you, please.

131
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,879
Grandpa will die.

132
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,279
If you don't help me,

133
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,920
my grandpa will die.

134
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,199
I'm begging you.

135
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,639
Hu Changshan

136
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,120
You old bastard, you deserve a thousand cuts.

137
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,439
Come out.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Old man, come out here!

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,319
Hu Changshan

140
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,160
What are you doing? Get out here!

141
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,399
Stop shouting. What is it now?

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,079
Ever since your daughter died,

143
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,399
you've been lashing out at everyone.

144
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,279
Don't you know what kind of person Master Hu is?

145
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,759
He's helped so many people.

146
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,040
And you dare curse even him?

147
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,639
Exactly.

148
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,879
Don't you know what kind of person that Yang Nan is?

149
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,920
You just believe whatever he says?

150
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,839
Stop believing every rumor you hear, day in and day out.

151
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,519
He's just a toad wanting to eat swan meat.

152
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,279
Master Hu wouldn't let Juan marry him.

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
He's just spouting nonsense here.

154
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,560
And you let him fool you.

155
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,199
Let's go, let's go. Yeah.

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,759
Enough, let's go.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,759
Let's go.

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,079
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

160
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,279
I never thought Brother Kun would actually...

161
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,800
You still call him Brother Kun?

162
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,079
Bastard!

163
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll make him pay.

164
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,839
Shuanzi

165
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,480
Xiu'er's mother

166
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,120
All these ungrateful people deserve to die.
