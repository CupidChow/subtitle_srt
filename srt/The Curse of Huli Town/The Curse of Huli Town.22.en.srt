1
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,079
I knew you wouldn't just leave like that.

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,039
Master Hu.

3
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,159
I underestimated you.

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,159
You're very clever.

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,399
You

6
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,240
came here to kill me.

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,240
What else?

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,479
Did you think I would let you go so easily?

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,439
Just you?

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,399
You little nobody.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,400
You've done every evil deed imaginable.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

13
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,480
My punishment is that I was too merciful.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,879
I saved you back then.

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,640
And you repaid kindness with betrayal.

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,280
Fine.

17
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,000
Then today,

18
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,879
let's settle this once and for all.

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't forget,

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,439
if you don't get the antidote,

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,439
and I die,

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,719
you won't be able to save Li Zhenzu's wife.

23
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,159
And forget about the child she's carrying.

24
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,359
You know what kind of person I am.

25
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,000
If I don't get the antidote,

26
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,560
I have a hundred ways to deal with you.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
I'll make you unable to live,

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,359
and unable to die.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,359
You finally admit it.

30
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,959
You little nobody.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,840
You killed Hu Xiaoyun.

32
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,359
Li Xingzong is your son.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,159
I did it.

34
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,079
So what can you do about it?

35
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,560
Back then, I sold you to Nanyang.

36
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,879
You survived.

37
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,959
And now,

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,120
I can still make you die by my hand.

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,039
What are you laughing at?

40
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,639
Don't move!

41
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,159
Stay still!

42
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,879
You all—

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,159
Yang—

44
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,800
So this is your real reason for coming back.

45
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,400
You're back.

46
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,080
I can let you catch me.

47
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,159
But you have to help me with one thing.

48
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,560
A tuft of hair.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,599
You know how much I want to kill you with my own hands.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,599
But if I do that,

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,039
how would I be any different from who you were back then?

52
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,960
I don't want you to die.

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,240
I want you to live and face retribution.

54
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,960
This is what you deserve.

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,840
You win.

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,199
Xiaokun.

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,879
I'm leaving Juan'er in your care.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,039
That's enough.

59
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,560
No.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,759
Master Hu

61
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,319
They

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,439
They all say you’re a human trafficker.

63
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,039
Is that true?

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,759
Butler Hu

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,759
Why are you here?

66
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,120
Did something happen to Juan'er?

67
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,199
Officer Hu

68
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Please go check on our young lady.

69
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,480
Ever since the master had an accident,

70
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,519
she's been locking herself in her room all day.

71
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,759
Juan'er

72
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,120
Juan'er

73
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,279
What's wrong?

74
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,959
Why did you save me? Just let me die.

75
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,199
No one blames you, Juan'er.

76
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,879
Everyone knows it wasn't you.

77
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,360
If anyone bullies you,

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,399
I won't let them get away with it.

79
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,079
You're not a good person either.

80
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,360
You arrested my grandpa.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,199
I'm a police officer.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Juan'er

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Juan'er

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Your grandpa cares about you the most.

86
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,759
If anything happens to you,

87
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,439
he won't rest in peace, even in death.

88
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,720
In a couple of days, I'll take you to the county town.

89
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,319
Let him know you're okay.

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,519
And tell him

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,959
we're getting married.

92
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
We'll give him a big, healthy grandson.

93
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,000
What your grandpa cares about most is the Li family line.

94
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,360
Our first son

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,519
will have the surname Li, okay?

96
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,120
He'll be overjoyed.

97
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,720
We really have to drink a bit more tonight.

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,480
Let's drink some more.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,399
The widow is all smiles.

100
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,240
Oh, stop it.

101
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,079
Beautiful.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,399
Brother Kun.

103
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,680
Are we catching rabbits or cats today?

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,959
As long as we’re not catching the blood fox, anything’s fine.

105
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,720
Let’s go.

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,160
Let’s hurry back after we finish eating.

107
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Sedan chair.

108
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,199
Look, I want to ride in a sedan chair too.

109
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,560
Watch out.
