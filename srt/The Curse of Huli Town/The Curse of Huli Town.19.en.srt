1
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,039
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,679
Grandpa, it's time for your medicine.

3
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,879
Wait a moment.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,280
Grandpa.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
What's wrong?

6
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,559
I'm fine.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,039
Sir.

8
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,079
Don't worry.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,840
You were just overly frightened.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,280
A few doses of medicine will help.

11
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,200
Doctor Huang.

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,079
Thank you for your trouble.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,759
It's nothing.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,159
Hu Quan.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,039
Sir.

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,000
Go prepare paper and brush.

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,759
And call Xiao Yang over.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,759
Yes.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,400
Why do you keep staring at me?

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,920
Do you have a grudge against Master Hu?

21
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,400
When Master Hu fainted,

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,879
I saw with my own eyes

23
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,599
that you smiled.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,920
Master Hu once saved your life.

25
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,560
Now that something so serious happened to him,

26
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,840
should you really be smiling?

27
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,680
And smiling so happily at that.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
How could that be?

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,959
You must have seen wrong.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
It's definitely possible.

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,400
I did laugh.

32
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,760
And I laughed happily.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,560
That's because the Li family father and son treat human life as worthless.

34
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,480
Li Qiang

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,480
and Hu San'er are both their subordinates.

36
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,120
You don't really think what happened to Juan'er

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,439
has nothing to do with them, do you?

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Shouldn't I laugh?

39
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,280
This is the retribution they deserve.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,239
Many things, until the day they're made public,

41
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,200
can't be defined.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,040
Whether it's Juan'er's case

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,239
or those who were killed,

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
I will get to the bottom of it all.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,959
And you,

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,719
who exactly are you?

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
I'll find out too.

48
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,639
After all we've been through,

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,199
Officer Hu still doesn't trust me.

50
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,960
Have you ever trusted me?

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,240
Brother Hu,

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
don't forget,

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,919
Li Xingzong reported you.

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,919
You're no longer a police officer.

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,080
Everyone has their own secrets.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,560
Everyone also has secrets they don't want to share.

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,000
It's fine.

58
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,280
As long as they don't break the law,

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,639
it's none of my business.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,439
But if they do break the law,

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,919
I definitely won't let them go.

62
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,039
Hu Quan

63
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,400
Master

64
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,639
Go to the provincial capital as soon as possible.

65
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,840
Print this letter as a notice.

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,199
Then

67
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,479
Take it to all the major docks in Nanyang and distribute it.

68
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,280
Tell them

69
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,599
As long as they can find the person,

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,960
I'll pay any amount of silver dollars.

71
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,400
Alright.

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
Okay, I'll take care of it right away.

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,759
Grandpa, you're just too kind.

74
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,280
Even if we can find someone to break the curse,

75
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,000
it's too far from Nanyang to here.

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,639
They probably wouldn't make it in time.

77
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,960
Juan'er

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,479
Has your brother Yang Nan

79
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,879
been staying at your house all this time?

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,759
Yes.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,719
Since Grandpa saved him,

82
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,240
he's been living at our house.

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,719
Everyone knows about this.

84
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,319
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,840
It's nothing, just asking.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,319
I really didn't expect this.

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,240
A human trafficker wanted nationwide for years

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,960
Yi Cuo Mao

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,879
was actually hiding in Hu Li Town.

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,439
I need to report this immediately.

91
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,360
But Xiao Kun,

92
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,400
before all the facts are clear,

93
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,639
you'll have to put up with some inconvenience.

94
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,000
Pretend you've been suspended for now.

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
This way,

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,959
we can ensure

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,800
the enemy is out in the open while we're in the dark.

98
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,519
I understand, Officer Zhao.

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,439
Also, I'd like you to take a look at this.

100
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,839
This is Li Zhenzu's handwriting.

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,839
But it's clearly not written by him.

102
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,720
These characters

103
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,560
just by looking at them

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,879
don't seem special at all.

105
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
Take a closer look, Officer Zhao.

106
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,279
This isn't right.

107
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,040
Xiaokun, look.

108
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,279
These two characters

109
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,279
what's special about them?

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,000
The ending strokes of these two characters

111
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,800
seem to lack strength.

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,600
Maybe the person who wrote them injured their hand.

113
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,360
Yang Nan

114
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
I remember now.

115
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,920
His hand was injured those days.

116
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,759
It seems

117
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
this Yang Nan

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,319
is very suspicious.

119
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,680
Dad

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,360
Save me, Dad!

121
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,360
Dad

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Please save me, Dad!

123
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,879
Save me!

124
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,800
Save me!

125
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,240
Save me!

126
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,839
Save me!

127
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,319
Juan'er

128
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,120
Juan'er

129
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,360
Grandpa, are you okay?

130
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
I just dreamed

131
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,040
the room was full of bugs.

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,519
Everyone was attacked by bugs.

133
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Luckily it was just a dream, it scared me to death.

134
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,319
Grandpa, are you really okay?

135
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,199
I'm fine.

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
The old master just had a nightmare.

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,519
It was just a dream.

138
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,639
Kun,

139
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,879
tell me,

140
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,240
why would a Nanyang shaman

141
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,120
put a curse on the Li family?

142
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,560
Why?

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,439
Could it be because Li Xingzong is actually the human trafficker?

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
That note was written by Li Zhenzu himself.

145
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,399
He deliberately blamed it on Master Hu.

146
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,079
Doesn't that make sense?

147
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,040
That's why someone targeted the Li family.

148
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,519
How do you know?

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Kun,

150
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,160
you...

151
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,040
Today, when

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,560
I went to find you, Officer Zhao happened to be there.

153
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,480
I accidentally overheard your conversation.

154
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,199
Don't worry,

155
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,240
I won't tell anyone about this.

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,360
It's okay, it's okay.

157
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,319
I trust you.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,959
You're my brother.

159
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,920
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

160
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,759
I'm really sorry.

161
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,279
Let's not talk about it anymore.

162
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,439
I heard that people sold to Nanyang have a really miserable life.

163
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,079
Everyone has a mark on their body.

164
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,680
They use a hot iron to brand them here.

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,439
A brand.

166
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680
What kind of brand?

167
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,120
I don't know either.

168
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,600
What's wrong?

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,439
Who did you hear that from?

170
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,000
I heard it from Widow Li.

171
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,759
A distant relative came to her house.

172
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,160
I just heard them talking about it too.

173
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,160
Why are you reacting so strongly?

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Shuanzi.

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,079
What's Brother Yang's name?

176
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,319
You keep calling him Brother Yang.

177
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,959
Everyone else calls him Xiao Yang.

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,439
Who knows what his real name is?

179
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,079
His name is Yang Nan.

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,480
Yang Nan.

181
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Yang Dong, Yang Xi, Yang Bei.

182
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,240
Is there any difference?

183
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,839
Say that again.

184
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,120
East, south, west, north.

185
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,839
Brother Kun.

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,959
Brother Hu.

187
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,560
You invited me to dinner so late.

188
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,439
What do you mean, Brother Hu?

189
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Yang Nan.

190
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:26,920
Switch it around.

191
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,199
It means Nanyang.

192
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,440
