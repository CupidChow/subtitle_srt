1
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,199
Let me tell you all

2
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,879
No matter how many times you ask, the answer will be the same

3
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,879
You want me to admit to something I didn't do

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,199
Grandma

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,679
Brother Hu

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,280
Think about Juan'er

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,320
I'll ask one last time

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,359
Will you confess or not

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,560
Xiao Kun, Xiao Kun

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,200
Don't be impulsive

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,960
About Hu Juan

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,240
It was that bastard Hu San who did it

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,200
It wasn't me

14
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:43,960
Shuanzi

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,479
No, no, no, no

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:50,719
Hu Zhengkun

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,119
What are you doing

18
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,399
Butler Hu

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,399
He won't confess unless you use force

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,439
If you use force

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,119
It's like slapping our master's face

22
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,439
He's the one who killed her

23
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,359
Yesterday, Xiu'er's mother saw it with her own eyes

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,560
Nonsense

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,760
Zhenzu

26
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,680
My master and your father are friends

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,959
For his sake

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,120
I won't make things hard for you

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,560
Tell me the truth

30
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:13,680
Xiu'er

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,519
Did you kill her or not

32
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,519
Butler Hu

33
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,879
Even a tiger won't eat its cubs

34
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,959
I'm a human, not a beast

35
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,319
Then who do you think did it

36
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,359
It wasn't a person

37
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,000
It was the Blood Fox

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,400
Dad

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,519
Dad is here

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,319
Tell us what you saw

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
Well,

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,239
last night,

43
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,640
I saw the young master coming out of Xiu's room.

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
Xiu walked him out.

45
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,439
The young master was even humming a tune.

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,840
My ears are pretty sharp.

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,079
It was around 2 a.m.

48
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,840
Why were you up and not sleeping?

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
I had an upset stomach.

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,000
I was in the bathroom all night.

51
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,599
Da Long,

52
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,280
you know the consequences if you lie.

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
I wouldn't dare lie, I wouldn't dare.

54
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,319
If I lie, may I be struck by lightning.

55
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,480
Why didn't you say this earlier?

56
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,359
You're only saying it now.

57
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,519
You don't know what kind of person Xiu's mother is.

58
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,719
She and I have a grudge.

59
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,120
If I had spoken up,

60
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,680
she would've gouged my eyes out.

61
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,280
But now someone's dead.

62
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,159
I have no choice but to testify.

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,919
Now you realize how serious this is.

64
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,280
Why didn't you come forward earlier?

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,639
Go on.

66
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,439
Alright, I'll say it then.

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,520
Last night, I had a stomachache.

68
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,439
So I squatted in the outhouse.

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,400
I kept going and going.

70
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,159
Suddenly, I heard a noise.

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
I looked up.

72
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,280
There was a blood-red fox squatting on the roof.

73
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,879
What nonsense are you talking about?

74
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,879
I'm not making it up.

75
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,360
Why didn't you say this during the day?

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,199
That master already said

77
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,439
there's no blood-red fox.

78
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,120
If I had said it,

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
I'd be responsible for spreading rumors.

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,560
I wouldn't dare take that responsibility.

81
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,479
Alright, that's enough.

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's all nonsense.

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,439
Steward Hu,

84
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,960
what do you think?

85
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
Alright, open it for me.

86
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,599
Amitabha.

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,919
After restoring the golden statue of Buddha,

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,719
don't let the incense offerings stop again.

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,639
The people's devotion to Buddha

90
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,879
is what Buddha wishes for all beings.

91
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,560
Please rest assured, Master.

92
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,479
I've traveled all over Hu Li Town.

93
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,719
I can no longer sense any demonic presence.

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,560
But I have a word of advice.

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,919
Monsters are easy to get rid of.

96
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,800
But human disasters are hard to avoid.

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
Please take care of yourselves.

98
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,599
I will take my leave now.

99
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,199
Amitabha.

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,319
Master.

101
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,399
Amitabha.

102
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,360
This was given to me by Hu Changshan.

103
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,839
You keep it for now.

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
Once I've avenged myself, I'll come find you.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,920
But Master,

106
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,279
there's something I don't understand.

107
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,600
By doing this now,

108
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,439
how are we any different from those who once harmed us?

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
And what about Huiniang?

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,439
Everything is a matter of cause and effect.

111
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,720
Back then, they planted the seeds of evil in you.

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
Now, they must bear the consequences you bring upon them.

113
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,399
This is the cycle of heaven's law.

114
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,879
But

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,360
you must remember one thing:

116
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,800
Cause and effect are determined by heaven,

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,240
but good and evil reside in the human heart.

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,639
In the end, all outcomes

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,079
are decided by your own heart.

120
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
But I can no longer turn back.

121
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,639
Dad!

122
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,680
Your trick is really amazing.

123
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,720
Calling a deer a horse.

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,319
Read more books when you have time.

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,319
So no one will notice what you're up to.

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,399
But look at you.

127
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,199
You just had to stay for so long.

128
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,560
And let that shrew find out.

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,319
It's like you've never seen a woman in your life.

130
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,040
Dad.

131
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,680
You don't know.

132
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
That show...

133
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,920
It's unforgettable.

134
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,319
She's so good at it.

135
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,040
Of course I know.

136
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,199
Be honest.

137
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,319
It's still so exciting.

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,680
It's fantastic.

139
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,879
Since your brother-in-law satisfied you,

140
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,560
you should satisfy him too.

141
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,959
How else am I supposed to satisfy him?

142
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,920
Tell your brother-in-law.

143
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
What exactly did that woman say?

144
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
Brother-in-law.

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
I really can't say.

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Your dad said,

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
if I dare to spread it,

148
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,680
he'll never let me into your house.

149
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,319
So please don't make it hard for me.

150
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,759
Why don't you ask him yourself?

151
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,959
Ask him?

152
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Come here.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,399
You little brat.

154
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,399
Have I been too easy on you?

155
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,639
Why ask him?

156
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,319
I'm asking you right now.

157
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
Do you believe I'll beat you to death?

158
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,199
I just want to get into your house.

159
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,120
Even if you beat me to death, I won't say.

160
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,399
Get into my house, huh?

161
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,959
Do you know what this is?

162
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you believe I'll kill you?

163
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,759
Speak.

164
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,240
This is your son.

165
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,959
He's the heir of your Li family.

166
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,680
You won't kill me, will you?

167
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,199
That's right.

168
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
The most beautiful sister-in-law in the world.

169
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
How could I bear to kill you?

170
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,480
Come here.

171
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,879
What a pity.

172
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
It's all fate.

173
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,000
You'd better keep a low profile lately.

174
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,759
Why?

175
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,240
You tell me why.

176
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,439
That Master Ruyin has already left.

177
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,680
Before he left,

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
he blamed all the strange things on the blood fox.

179
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,879
But he was here.

180
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,040
He performed his rituals.

181
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,720
He even told everyone in public

182
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,079
that he had already driven the blood fox away.

183
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,000
If anything happens after this,

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
he absolutely won't admit it.

185
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,000
What a phony master.

186
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,199
If you ask me,

187
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,439
he's full of tricks.

188
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,480
Today I finally understand

189
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,480
that so-called masters

190
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,759
are all fake.

191
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:21,959
Dad.

192
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,759
I almost died laughing when those people pretended to be supernatural.

193
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,560
Where did this blood fox even come from?

194
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,679
But so many people in town said they saw it.

195
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,799
What do you think is going on?

196
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,279
You can't completely dismiss this.

197
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,240
But you can't believe it all, either.

198
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,679
Who knows?

199
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,720
But so many years ago,

200
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,840
the story was told in such vivid detail.

201
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,519
It can't be completely made up, right?

202
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,399
We really have to thank Master Hu for his help today.

203
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,440
Help?

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,120
You call that helping?

205
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,440
How can you not tell right from wrong?

206
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,720
If it weren't for Master Hu,

207
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,000
at least two people would have died today.

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
And it still wouldn't be over.

209
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,600
You little brat.

210
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,960
This is my last warning: don't go near Hu Juan.

211
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,399
Did you hear me?

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,159
Dad.

213
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,759
You can't just stifle me like this.

214
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,399
I still have a wife.

215
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,759
Forget it.

216
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,879
This guy...

217
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
is so boring.

218
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,360
Forget it, I'll just sleep alone tonight.
