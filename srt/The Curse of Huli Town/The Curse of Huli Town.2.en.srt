1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,800
That's basically the situation.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,120
You didn't see anyone?

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,120
When I arrived,

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,519
only Juan'er was left there.

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,120
I'm sorry, Master Hu.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,760
This isn't your fault.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,120
If we must blame someone,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,679
it's just that Juan'er has had bad luck.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,960
Think of our Hu family,

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,079
we've done good deeds for generations.

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,159
But heaven turns a blind eye.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,640
Master Hu,

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,799
please rest assured.

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,079
I will solve this case as soon as possible.

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,159
I'll find the culprit.

16
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,600
and bring justice for Juan'er.

17
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,240
But what good will it do to find them?

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,799
What good will justice do?

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,880
Juan'er's reputation is already ruined.

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,359
I think we should end this matter here.

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,240
Juan'er is only seventeen this year.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,280
She still has a long life ahead.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
I don't want her to spend her whole life

24
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,640
carrying such a heavy burden.

25
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,319
Hu Quan.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,439
Master.

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Pass down my orders.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,079
If anyone dares to reveal a word of this,

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,799
I will not forgive them lightly.

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,959
Yes.

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Master Hu.

32
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,680
Say no more.

33
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,359
It's settled.

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,400
Master.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,879
What about Daniu?

36
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,319
Keep him locked up for now.

37
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,159
Go with Doctor Huang to get some medicine.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
Give it to him when you return.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,760
Send him back after he sobers up.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
Yes, I'll take care of it right away.

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,400
Master

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
Now that such a big thing has happened at home,

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,959
I can't feel at ease leaving right now.

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,239
Besides, after living here for so long,

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
I've long since regarded Juan'er

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,719
as my own younger sister.

47
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,040
Now that she's become like this,

48
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,599
I want to stay for now.

49
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,000
First, I can help take care of the family.

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,920
Second, I can help ease your worries.

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
That's very thoughtful of you.

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,439
Master Hu

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,439
I just heard Juan'er keep muttering

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,280
"Blood Fox, Blood Fox."

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,640
To be honest, lately in town

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,879
I've also heard this legend.

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,400
But it's just

58
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,280
a baseless folk tale.

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
No need to take it seriously.

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
It's getting late.

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,400
Everyone, get some rest.

62
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,800
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

63
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,319
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

64
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,879
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,360
Blood.

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,960
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,280
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,919
Don't move.

69
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,879
Get up.

70
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,520
Stand up.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
Turn around.

72
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,439
Brother Yang.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,079
Brother Hu.

74
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,680
You scared me to death.

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,920
What are you doing here?

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Same as you.

77
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,879
I don't believe it either.

78
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,519
There's no such thing as fox spirits or fox demons.

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,279
So I came to check it out.

80
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,759
Did you notice anything?

81
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,160
That day, were you and Shuanzi

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,319
the ones who found Juan'er in this room?

83
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,279
Yes.

84
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,160
Then that's it.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,639
What do you mean, that's it?

86
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,560
What do you mean?

87
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,439
Footprints.

88
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,079
A blood fox shouldn't leave footprints.

89
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,079
It was done by a person.

90
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Come with me to the pharmacy to get medicine later.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,199
Doctor Huang.

92
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,199
How is Juan'er?

93
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,040
Is she okay?

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
She'll be fine after taking these two doses of medicine.

95
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,439
Let's go.

96
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,000
Juan'er

97
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,079
How are you feeling?

98
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,279
Are you feeling any better?

99
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,639
I'm fine, Brother Xiaokun.

100
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,639
Yesterday...

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,759
What exactly happened?

102
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,240
Don't be afraid.

103
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm here with you.

104
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,199
Go ahead, tell me.

105
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,439
I don't know either.

106
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,160
I only remember a storyteller came to tell a story.

107
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,079
After I finished watching the show,

108
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,759
I went home alone.

109
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,079
"Please listen to the next episode..."

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,079
Then, after that,

111
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't remember anything.

112
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,279
Did you know?

113
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,399
I heard that our young lady, that night

114
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,439
had already been taken advantage of.

115
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,160
And when they found her at that time,

116
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,959
our young lady was already unconscious.

117
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,600
And even then, that happened.

118
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,160
So tell me, this Officer Hu,

119
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
has already seen our young lady's body.

120
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,920
Can he still marry our young lady in the future?

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,839
If our young lady wants to be with someone else,

122
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,920
now she's already been with someone else.

123
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,720
Can Officer Hu still be with her?

124
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,639
What a sin.

125
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,920
Our young lady is only seventeen.

126
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,720
She's at the age of a budding flower.

127
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,439
She still has a long life ahead of her.

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,879
What will she do in the future?

129
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,079
Who doesn't agree?

130
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,079
Let's go quickly.

131
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,319
If the young lady hears us...

132
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
Officer Hu

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,720
Officer Hu

134
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,680
Officer Hu

135
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,920
Officer Hu

136
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,279
Someone's dead.

137
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,279
What happened? Did someone's cat die again?

138
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,560
Someone's dead.

139
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,399
There's a dead person on the mountain.

140
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,360
Someone's dead! Someone's dead!

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,800
What?

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,519
On the mountain.

143
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,439
Someone's dead! Someone's dead!

144
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,199
Let's go, let's go!

145
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:52,680
Go!

146
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,839
Wait for me, Kun.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,160
Officer Hu

148
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,240
Today is the anniversary of my mother's death.

149
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,000
So early this morning,

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,920
I took Xiaoyun to visit my mother's grave.

151
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,600
But halfway through burning the paper money,

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720
I suddenly heard a kind of

153
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,439
a kind of sound.

154
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,600
A sound? What kind of sound?

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,079
I...

156
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,399
I can't really say.

157
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,000
It seemed like

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,839
a woman crying,

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,199
but also like a child laughing.

160
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,879
The more I listened,

161
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,800
the more anxious I felt.

162
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
So I took Xiaoyun and followed the sound.

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,279
Then I saw a dead person by the crooked-neck tree.

164
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,839
He seemed to have died with a smile.

165
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,439
Died with a smile?

166
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes.

167
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,160
I'll take you to see.

168
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,480
Sunshower

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Blood Fox

170
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,799
Human Sacrifice on the Fifteenth and First

171
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,799
Can't escape, can't hide

172
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,759
After repaying karmic debts, life comes to an end
