1
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,359
I never expected

2
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,119
the enemy you've been searching for all these years

3
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,039
would turn out to be him.

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,840
Master, you know Hu Changshan too?

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,879
I met him once a few years ago.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,599
But have you really thought this through?

7
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,920
Are you sure you want to do this?

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,959
He caused Hui Niang and me to lose our families.

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
All this resentment, this hatred, this grudge—

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
I can't let it go unavenged.

11
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,599
You've spent years searching for your enemy,

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,000
but never imagined

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,439
that now he would become your savior.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
He owed you a life,

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,040
and he has repaid it.

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,319
He did cause your family to be destroyed.

17
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,840
Now you're planning to take revenge on his family.

18
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,200
This is your karma.

19
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,239
I know, Master, you've always wanted to guide me

20
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,640
to let go of the hatred in my heart.

21
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,879
To be honest,

22
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,840
the day he saved me and brought me home,

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,040
I was truly grateful to him.

24
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,239
Especially when I woke up

25
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,200
and found out he had done so many good deeds in Hu Li Town.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,799
I did consider giving up on revenge.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
But in the end, I just can't do it.

28
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,680
But don't worry, Master.

29
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,479
I won't kill innocent people for the sake of revenge.

30
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,719
Amitabha.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
What I want

32
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,879
is to tear off his hypocritical mask in front of everyone.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
I already have a plan.

34
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,280
However,

35
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,240
I need your help.

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,080
I can help you gather information.

37
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,000
As long as you don't kill me.

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
Is Dr. Huang not here today?

39
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,000
Hu Xiaoyun

40
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,639
Hey, you there

41
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,319
Brother Zu

42
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,759
Do you have deer antler?

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
We don't have deer antler, Brother Zu.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,400
What kind of shop is this?

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,039
You don't even have deer antler.

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,080
Brother Zu, what's wrong?

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,039
I want to get a tonic.

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
You still don't know?

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,759
I've been so busy all day.

50
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,039
Prepare this medicine for me.

51
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,400
Let me take a look first, Brother Zu.

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,120
Yun

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,360
Come here.

54
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,800
Don't be shy.

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,680
Come on, come on.

56
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother Zu, about this medicine—

57
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,240
Can we prepare it?

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,719
Yes, yes, we can.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,680
Go prepare the medicine.

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,280
Hey.

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,159
Yun

62
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,800
Don't be shy.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,759
I'll come pick up the medicine later.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,400
She's shy.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,920
Wait for me.

66
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,079
Let's go.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
Astragalus and angelica

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,879
Keep your voice down

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,839
This prescription

70
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,959
is for that medicine

71
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,319
You noticed it too

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,639
Be sure not to tell anyone

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,879
Hu Xiaoyun

74
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
I meant Hu San'er

75
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,000
Hu San'er

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
What about Hu San'er?

77
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,279
I-I don't know

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
I don't know anything

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,680
Do you need anything else?

80
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,800
Oh

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,959
I'm here to get some medicine for bruises and injuries

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
Oh, okay

83
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,199
Where are you going?

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,399
Are you heading home?

85
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,800
Juan'er.

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Where are you off to?

87
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,839
Juan'er, have dinner with me tonight.

88
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,120
Juan'er, give me a chance.

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,879
Move aside.

90
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,560
Come with me, I've missed you.

91
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,519
Come with me.

92
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:32,959
You...

93
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,160
You're really pretty.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,399
Who?

95
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,120
Me.

96
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,959
Juan'er, let's go.

97
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,560
You brat.

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,079
Come here.

99
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,759
Wait a second.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,079
You go back first.

101
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,839
I'm in a good mood today.

102
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,639
I could go see Wang Xiaohua.

103
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,040
You...

104
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,920
Find me a better excuse.

105
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,240
Go tell my dad.

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,839
Don't worry, I will.

107
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,680
Like I could relax!

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,319
If my dad hits me again,

109
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,639
I'll eat you alive.

110
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,720
Get lost.

111
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,560
Brother Xiaokun.

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,800
I heard the Blood Fox is causing trouble again. Is it true?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,319
Is it true?

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,680
I don't really know either.

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,959
Juan'er, I saw everything just now.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,439
You don't need to be afraid of them.

117
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,759
But be careful from now on.

118
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,519
They're capable of anything.

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,959
You know he's capable of anything.

120
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,000
Then why did you let him go?

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,639
I know this isn't all your fault.

122
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,240
My grandpa is such a capable person,

123
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,519
even he can't do anything about him.

124
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,920
So what could you possibly do?

125
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Juan'er,

126
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,720
before we came to Hu Li Town,

127
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,279
what did your grandpa do?

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,160
Grandpa used to do big business in Shanghai.

129
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,399
He owned a really big shop.

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,439
People from all walks of life respected him.

131
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
You must have been very young then.

132
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,000
I was too young to remember anything back then.

133
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,480
Grandpa said my father died,

134
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,439
and Shanghai was in chaos.

135
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,920
So he brought me here from Shanghai.

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,519
No wonder.

137
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,000
Everyone says Master Hu has seen the world.

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,759
He's kind and knows how to get things done.

139
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,000
If it weren't for him,

140
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,079
who knows how arrogant the Li family would be.

141
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,759
I've told Grandpa so many times

142
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,879
to deal with the Li family.

143
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,759
But he always says, "The more friends you have, the more paths you have."

144
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,160
"It's better to resolve enmity than to create it."

145
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,720
As long as the Li family isn't too arrogant, just let them be.

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,439
I think Grandpa's just getting old.

147
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
He's become more cautious.

148
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,639
Juan'er, the Li family really is powerful.

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,319
Even Master Hu isn't sure he can handle them.

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,199
We'd better just keep our distance from now on.

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,759
Brother Xiaokun,

152
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
if they bully me,

153
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,160
will you help me?

154
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,279
If he breaks the law, I'll arrest him.

155
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,000
I knew you'd say that.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
Brother Xiaokun,

157
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,079
do you

158
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,279
like me?

159
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,319
Blockhead

160
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,800
Actually,

161
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,240
I like you too.

162
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,200
Li Zhenzu

163
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
Brother Zu

164
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,879
You promised to spend today with me.

165
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,600
Don't move.

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
Today is the first day of the lunar month.

167
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,679
We should be vegetarian and chant Buddha's name with a clear mind.

168
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,480
You said you'd be with me.

169
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,159
Look at the trouble that blood fox is causing in town.

170
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,639
I'm scared.

171
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,440
Besides, he's not home today.

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Today isn't appropriate.

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm leaving now.

174
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,879
Isn't it still not morning yet?

175
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,879
Oh.

176
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,519
There's still tomorrow.

177
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,919
Hmm? Isn't today the first day of the lunar month?

178
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
That's right, Brother Zu.

179
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,759
We agreed on tomorrow.

180
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,679
Why are you in such a hurry?
