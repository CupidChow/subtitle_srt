1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
How could I be so foolish?

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,719
How did I end up raising such a troublemaker like you?

3
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,000
Ma'am, please get up first.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm Zhengkun.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,799
You're the one who got my son killed.

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,159
I'll beat you to death.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,520
Beat you to death!

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,640
Your son killed someone.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,039
He even tried to rape someone else's wife.

10
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,840
And you blame others?

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,399
Who made him like this?

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,719
Who should you really be looking for?

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,520
Isn't that right?

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,119
Ma'am, think carefully.

15
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,640
Has he, in these past few days,

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,920
done anything strange?

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,719
Did he say anything to you?

18
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,439
What could he possibly say to me?

19
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,680
He hasn't even come home these days.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,239
He wouldn't care even if I died.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,480
Ever since he started following that jerk Li Zhenzu,

22
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,799
he's not even human anymore.

23
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a sin.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,560
You tell me.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
I told you, it wasn't me.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,719
Why won't you believe me?

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,799
I do believe you.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,640
Hu San'er is your subordinate.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,480
Juan'er's undergarment was found on him.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,120
He must have a lot of nerve.

31
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,519
You—

32
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:34,959
Old—

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,959
Master.

34
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,680
I wouldn't let him in.

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,400
He forced his way in.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,359
What are you doing? What are you doing?

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,519
Alright, Xiaokun.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
Wearing these ragged clothes.

39
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,959
You don't even respect the Li family anymore.

40
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,560
You're exaggerating, Master Li.

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,120
Zhou Dafa is dead.

42
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,480
Can't I investigate the case?

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,640
Investigate? Who are you investigating?

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,959
Me?

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,439
Did I kill him?

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,480
Before Hu San killed someone,

47
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,000
wasn't he with you the whole time?

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
He suddenly went crazy.

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
What does his madness have to do with me?

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
Am I his father?

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,039
Hu Zhengkun.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
You look pitiful.

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,759
Let me tell you a secret.

54
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,680
That day,

55
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,800
I was at Wang Xiaohua's place all night until dawn.

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,960
I didn't have any time to go out.

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,080
You've got the wrong person.

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,280
Wang Xiaohua.

59
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,199
So those rumors were true.

60
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,159
You.

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,039
Did you hear that?

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,400
My son wasn't with Hu San.

63
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,840
You.

64
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,639
I heard

65
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,840
you like Juan.

66
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,039
So what?

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,639
Afraid I'll steal her from you?

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,319
Do you have any evidence against me?

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,800
And you.

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,719
Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Is everything settled now?

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
If so, get lost.

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,840
It's really with Wang Xiaohua.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,719
Dad.

75
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,960
I just wanted to try.

76
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright, alright.

77
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,919
Go ahead and mess around, then.

78
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,080
Master Hu has already given his word.

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
He said he'll have you castrated.

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
If you dare touch Juan'er again,

81
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,479
you'll be finished for good.

82
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,520
Dad!

83
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,120
Why are you afraid of him?

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,680
What can that old man even do?

85
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,719
Watch your mouth.

86
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,639
After all, our family is from out of town.

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,759
Even a powerful outsider can't overpower the local boss.

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Isn't he an outsider too?

89
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,560
Still talking back?

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Go ahead, hit me.

91
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,199
Don't use that.

92
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,919
Use a knife instead.

93
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,080
Chop me up, then.

94
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,599
Come, give me a hand.

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,919
Xiuer, it's still you.

96
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,639
You...

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,639
You should learn more from Xiuer.

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,519
Could it really have been Hu San'er who did it?

99
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,959
He wouldn't dare do something like that, would he?

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,639
What do you think?

101
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,160
Someone saw, on the night Juan'er had her accident,

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
Li Zhenzu was, at midnight,

103
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
leaving Wang Xiaohua's house.

104
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,439
Is it possible he left during that time?

105
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,000
And then, before midnight,

106
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,639
returned to Wang Xiaohua's house?

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
Hu San'er is actually one of Li Zhenzu's men.

108
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,199
So Li Zhenzu deliberately left

109
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,759
Hu San'er there to set up a diversion.

110
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,360
To act as his alibi.

111
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,199
That's not impossible.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
And then there's Wang Xiaohua.

113
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,920
If we go to her,

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,439
she definitely won't tell the truth.

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,639
It might even alert them.

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,279
And make Li Zhenzu even more cautious.

117
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,439
Kun,

118
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,480
we've already asked everyone we can.

119
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
We can't just keep searching like this.

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,519
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

121
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,800
Why do I see you everywhere I go?

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,639
Where are you going?

123
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,959
Officer Hu

124
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,800
You’re not interested in me, are you?

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
No, not at all.

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,399
That’s definitely not what I mean.

127
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,480
Then why are you giving me those looks?

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
We’re just here to see you.

129
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,839
You all?

130
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,120
There are three of you.

131
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,199
I couldn’t handle that even if I wanted to.

132
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,480
What are you thinking?

133
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
We’re here to ask you some questions.

134
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,399
Oh.

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Questions, huh?

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,439
Then go ahead and ask.

137
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,839
I’m busy right now.

138
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,199
Has Hu San been here recently?

139
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,199
No.

140
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,399
That’s a quick answer.

141
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,199
Yeah.

142
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,839
What about Li Zhenzu?

143
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
He hasn’t been here in a long time.

144
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,319
He thinks the girls here are too plain.

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,199
Not as interesting as the widows outside.

146
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,439
Or the married women—they’re more exciting and know how to have fun.

147
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,360
Are you sure you don’t want to think about it again?

148
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,879
What’s there to think about?

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,639
Hu Li Town isn’t that big.

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,680
How many men are there in this town?

151
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,000
On every man’s body,

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,600
I know exactly where and what shape their birthmarks are.

153
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,040
I know them all.

154
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,800
Especially that little rascal Hu San.

155
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,439
Are you sure you’re not mistaken?

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,959
Officer Hu

157
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,319
Me, personally,

158
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,079
my best trait is my memory.

159
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,600
Just like people say,

160
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,279
Officer Hu

161
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,560
you’re still a virgin.

162
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,360
You—

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
A human life is at stake.

164
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,079
Don’t try to fool us.

165
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,879
Who is this young man?

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,000
Is this your first time at our Chunxiang House?

167
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,480
They all say,

168
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,399
that outsiders are good at chanting scriptures.

169
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,160
I wonder

170
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,319
if this outsider man will be even more useful.

171
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
That boss really scared Kun.

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,759
What are you laughing at?

173
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,680
Kun.

174
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,279
You really are...

175
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,079
What?

176
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,279
A virgin.

177
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,120
I...

178
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,839
Don't be mad.

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,600
Don't be mad.

180
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,759
Hu San really hasn't been here.

181
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,720
Judging by the madam's reaction,

182
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,240
she doesn't seem to be lying.

183
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Then it must be the Blood Fox.

184
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,279
He must have been bewitched by the Blood Fox.

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,959
Tomorrow, Master Ruyin

186
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,480
asked me to help with a big ritual.

187
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,720
We need to help the deceased pass on.

188
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,519
I still have a lot to do.

189
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,639
I'll head out first.

190
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,439
We have no leads on that body right now.

191
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,519
And it's just going to be cremated like this?

192
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,879
Who agreed to that?

193
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,720
You'll have to ask Master Hu about that.

194
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Excuse me.

195
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
Destroying the body to cover things up.

196
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,079
What do you mean, cover things up?

197
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,439
I'm slow to catch on.

198
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,720
You're just brainless.

199
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
Kun.

200
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,160
I just blurted it out.

201
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,360
He isn't going to complain to Master Hu, is he?

202
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,240
Let's go.

203
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,759
Where to?

204
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,439
To see Master Hu.

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,360
Before that Yang guy complains about you,

206
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,879
you'd better explain things first.

207
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Oh, come on.

208
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,720
As if you’re that kind-hearted.

209
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,199
I bet you're just going to see Juan.
