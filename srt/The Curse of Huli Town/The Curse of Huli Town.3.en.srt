1
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,920
He's really dead.

2
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:22,559
Wasn't he fine just a couple of days ago?

3
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,559
Don't touch him.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
How unlucky.

5
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,719
Make way, make way.

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,239
What are you doing?

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,039
Officer.

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,879
The police are handling the case.

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,519
You've all messed up the scene.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,560
Officer Hu.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,640
No one has touched the scene, right?

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,200
No.

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,119
I'm scared, boss.

14
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:38,799
It's okay.

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,039
Can't see anything from this.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,679
Creepy.

17
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,399
Kun.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,159
Are you okay? Are you okay?

19
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,759
What's your head made of? It's so hard.

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,079
Born this way, can't help it.

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,640
Kun.

22
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,359
You've been observing for so long.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,959
Did you find any clues?

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:10,959
The deceased is male.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,599
And then?

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,959
Cause of death.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,760
Unknown.

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,640
That's all.

29
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,680
There was a heavy rain last night.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,879
All the clues are gone.

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
So was it suicide,

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,120
or murder?

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,120
There are no obvious external injuries on the body.

34
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,280
We can basically rule out

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
that he had a violent conflict with someone before death.

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,599
But we can't completely rule out the possibility of homicide.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,439
So right now,

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,319
other than confirming that this person is dead,

39
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,920
we can't be sure of anything else.

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,359
There are absolutely no clues.

41
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,519
Have you heard this saying?

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,120
What saying?

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
Let the dead speak.

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,040
Let the dead speak.

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
Are you kidding me?

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,799
Isn't he dead?

47
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,560
Then have you ever seen

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,799
or heard of a dead person who can smile?

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,799
Look, he really is smiling.

50
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,120
This is too creepy.

51
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,680
Kun,

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,719
he really does seem to be smiling.

53
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,039
I read about this in a book before.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,719
Normally, after people die,

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,280
if there's still a smile on their face,

56
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,400
it's either because they saw

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,639
something extremely stimulating before death,

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,840
or

59
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,759
it's caused by a certain kind of poison.

60
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,039
I've heard of a poison

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,319
that can make people, before death, see something very happy

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
or terrifying,

63
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,439
and cause their movements

64
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,800
or facial expressions

65
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,879
to remain in strange poses or expressions.

66
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,759
Could he have been killed by this kind of poison?

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,879
Look at his hand.

68
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,280
This should be a clue he left behind.

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
His hand is pointing in a direction.

70
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,520
Let's go.

71
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,400
Let's check it out.

72
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,400
Come on, let's go take a look.

73
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,520
Kun, wait for me.

74
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,719
Let's go see, let's go see.

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Kun.

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,919
Maybe we shouldn't go any further.

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Why do I feel like it's getting colder here?

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,280
Boss, I'm a little scared.

79
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,879
How about we just go back?

80
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,360
It's fine, it's fine.

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
There are so many of us.

82
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
We're not afraid.

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Boss.

84
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,199
Kun.

85
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,280
What's that sound?

86
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,840
Boss, that's the sound.

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,280
That's the sound.

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,879
This morning,

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,840
Xiaoyun and I heard this sound.

90
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,439
That's strange.

91
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,159
The sun is so bright.

92
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,240
Why did it suddenly start raining?

93
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,400
Look, you guys.

94
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,479
Look over there.

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Kun, look quickly!

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,439
Broken

97
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
What are you doing?

98
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,600
Are you trying to kill me?

99
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,759
I don't know either, Kun.

100
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,519
W-What's going on here?

101
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,000
A sunny day, raining blood, fox spirit...

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,920
Human sacrifices on the fifteenth and the first.

103
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,800
Can't escape, can't hide.

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Once the karmic debt is paid, life ends.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,360
Once the karmic debt is paid, life ends.

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,279
Life ends.

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,920
A sunny day, raining blood, fox spirit...

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,720
Human sacrifices on the fifteenth and the first.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,000
Can't escape, can't hide.

110
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,199
You idiot, you're really clueless.

111
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,040
Look how hard you hit.

112
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,959
You really didn't hold back.

113
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,560
You won't be able to go out for ten days or half a month.

114
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,639
How are you going to face people?

115
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,600
Serves you right.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,639
What happened today is really strange.

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,279
Could it really be the blood fox?

118
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,319
Hu Xiaoyun

119
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,040
Weren't you the first to notice all this?

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,399
Why don't you tell everyone about it?

121
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,519
What exactly happened?

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,319
Is there really a blood fox curse?

123
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,079
Actually, I'm not really sure.

124
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,079
Today is my mother-in-law's death anniversary.

125
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,639
I went to visit her grave with my husband.

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Then...

127
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Father, Mother...

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,800
Your son and daughter-in-law have not been filial.

129
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,439
We couldn't come back to visit your grave.

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,680
With all this chaos and turmoil...

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
It's really hard to get by at home.

132
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
What was that sound?

133
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,680
What sound? There's nothing.

134
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,439
Don't get so jumpy.

135
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
It's such a sunny day,

136
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,519
how is it suddenly raining?

137
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,319
Why did it start raining all of a sudden?

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,639
Do you remember,

139
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,759
the two lines of that nursery rhyme we used to sing as kids?

140
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,560
What nursery rhyme?

141
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,519
Sunny day, rain of blood, foxes.

142
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,759
On the fifteenth and the first, a living sacrifice.

143
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,639
I'm a little scared.

144
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,079
Why don't we head back first?

145
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,639
Okay, let's go.

146
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,800
It's the blood fox.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
It must be the blood fox.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
A curse.

149
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,759
What should we do now?

150
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,800
If the blood fox curses us, we'll all die.

151
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,600
What blood fox?

152
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
Stop scaring yourself.

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,319
Officer Hu already said it's miasma.

154
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,759
Could it be...

155
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,279
Was it Xiaoyun and your boss Zhou

156
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,959
who got bored in the shop

157
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,360
and wanted to find some excitement in the mountains?

158
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,360
Say that again,

159
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,079
and I'll tear your mouth apart.

160
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,040
You think everyone is like you,

161
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,480
lying in bed all day thinking about that stuff.

162
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,120
I was just joking.

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,319
Why are you getting mad?

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Or maybe you weren't with your boss Zhou,

165
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
but with that dead guy instead,

166
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,160
and your boss Zhou found out,

167
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,879
so the two of them fought.

168
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,720
Exactly.

169
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
Stop talking nonsense!

170
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,439
Get out of here!

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,399
Out!

172
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,279
You're not welcome in my house.

173
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
Go, get out!

174
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,639
What are you all talking about?

175
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,439
Let me hear it.

176
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,160
Go on, say it.

177
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,319
Yun'er,

178
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,439
what are you talking about?

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,839
Tell me, will you?

180
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,639
Don't be shy.

181
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,559
How about we find a place where no one else is around?

182
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,919
Just the two of us.

183
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,279
Have a proper talk with me.

184
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,240
Talk about that dead person.

185
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,399
Did I ask you?

186
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,519
You big guy, swaying around.

187
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:44,879
Squat down.

188
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,799
Dead person.

189
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,200
You killed him, didn't you?

190
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,759
How could it be me?

191
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,639
I had no grudge against him.

192
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,480
Why would I kill him?

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
So it wasn't you.

194
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,919
It's not a holiday or festival.

195
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,480
Why go up the mountain to burn paper?

196
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,080
Speak.

197
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,039
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

198
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,879
What a coincidence.

199
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
It just happens to be your mother's death anniversary.

200
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,240
You just happen to go up the mountain.

201
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,080
You just happen to run into a dead person.

202
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,080
And it just happens that you killed him, right?

203
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,159
You can't say things like that carelessly, Brother Zu.

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
Then shut up.

205
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,240
If it doesn't concern you, don't talk nonsense.

206
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Get lost.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,679
Yun'er.

208
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,840
It's okay.

209
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,159
I'm not mad at you.

210
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,840
I have other things to do today.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,799
Another day.

212
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,960
Another day.

213
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
I'll definitely come find you.

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,799
Let's go.

215
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,440
You're here.
