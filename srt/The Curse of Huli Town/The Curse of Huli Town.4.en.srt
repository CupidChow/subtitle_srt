1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,440
Please, please, come in.

2
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,160
Master, please take a seat.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,719
Mr. Hu, after you.

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,800
The last time we parted, Master,

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,160
was already a few years ago.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,960
Today, Master, you have come to Hu Li Town.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,520
I apologize for not welcoming you properly.

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,159
Please forgive me, Master.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,679
Mr. Hu, you are too polite.

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,320
I am a wandering monk by nature.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,119
I make my home wherever I go to cultivate myself.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,880
But as for you, Mr. Hu,

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,200
even though we haven't met for years,

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,799
you are still as spirited as ever.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,960
Master.

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,560
Look,

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,079
about today's matter—

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,240
the deceased has already been placed in a coffin and put in the old temple.

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,600
You can rest assured about the ritual for the departed, Mr. Hu.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,520
But now something strange has happened in town.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,359
Rumors of the Blood Fox's curse

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
have spread throughout the whole town.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,280
Everyone is

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,079
living in fear.

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,799
Master,

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,439
could you perform a ritual for the town?

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,239
First,

28
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,359
it could suppress these evil spirits.

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,400
Second,

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,079
it could ease people's fear and anxiety.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,840
As for the ritual,

32
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,319
you can rest assured, Mr. Hu.

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,280
But I must offer a word of advice.

34
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,920
Evil spirits are but illusions.

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,640
It is time and cultivation that shape one's life.

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,159
Kun, what does that mean?

37
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,319
You ask me? How should I know?

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,079
Murder.

39
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,239
Murder.

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,439
Daniu.

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,599
Daniu.

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,560
Are you okay?

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,519
The Blood Fox killed someone. Untie him.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
Untie him! The Blood Fox killed someone.

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
It's okay now, Daniu.

47
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,280
Daniu.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
Look at me, I'm Zhengkun.

49
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,639
Brother Kun.

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,479
The Blood Fox has killed someone.

51
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,240
I'll take you home.

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,639
Your mother is waiting for you at home.

53
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,360
Come on.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,599
Butler.

55
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm taking him with me.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,319
Since last night until now,

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,479
he's caused trouble several times.

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
The master can't do anything about it either.

59
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,000
He doesn't dare let him go out.

60
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,159
The town is so chaotic right now.

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,360
He's afraid he'll get into trouble if he goes out.

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,479
Thank you for your trouble.

63
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,479
Then I'll have to trouble Officer Hu.

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,039
Let's go.

65
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,159
Sir, Young Master Yang has arrived.

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
Come, come, come.

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,879
Please, have a seat.

68
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,479
Xiao Yang,

69
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,840
you are both smart and steady.

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,599
I’ll get straight to the point.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,560
I invited you here today

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
because there’s something

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,479
I need your help with.

74
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,840
Please, Mr. Hu, just say it.

75
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,879
Last night, did you

76
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,960
go to that abandoned house?

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,159
I’m sorry, Mr. Hu.

78
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,479
I acted on my own.

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,280
It’s just that I see Juan’er

80
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,599
as my own little sister.

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,520
For something like this to happen to her,

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,080
I really...

83
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,479
I’m not blaming you.

84
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,120
I just want to ask,

85
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,080
did you find any clues?

86
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,719
Was it man-made,

87
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,560
or just a misfortune?

88
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,159
Mr. Hu, are we really just letting this go?

89
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,560
Even though I know

90
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,960
you want to protect Juan’er’s reputation,

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,919
and don’t want this to get out,

92
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,199
but there’s still Hu Zhengkun.

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
He won’t let this go easily.

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,199
He’ll definitely get to the bottom of it.

95
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,919
The reason I invited you

96
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,520
is also because of this matter.

97
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,479
I want to repair the old temple.

98
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,639
What about you?

99
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,560
I’ll be working with Master Ruyin on this.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,039
Also,

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,919
I’ll help Master Ruyin

102
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,000
hold a grand ritual in town.

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,319
But Master Hu,

104
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,120
when the blood fox was mentioned yesterday,

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,159
you said it was just a scare tactic.

106
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,039
So why are we now making such a big deal

107
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,080
about repairing this old temple

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
and holding a grand ritual?

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
Rumors are powerful.

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,199
I want

111
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,000
people to believe

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,759
that what happened to Juan’er wasn’t done by a person

113
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,680
but by an evil spirit.

114
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,680
This way,

115
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,560
everyone will sympathize with and pity Juan’er.

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,480
Juan’er’s reputation

117
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,199
can be somewhat preserved.

118
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,319
I understand.

119
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,720
Master Hu,

120
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,079
when the master said that today,

121
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,360
I noticed you seemed troubled.

122
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,759
Did you already suspect

123
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,800
that you also suspect Li Zhenzu?

124
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,439
Since we’ve come this far,

125
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,720
I won’t hide it from you.

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,720
The matter

127
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,879
goes back to a few days ago.

128
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,399
Take a look.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,959
Would you like to order something? No.

130
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,839
Get lost.

131
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,519
Juan’er.

132
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,759
Juan’er.

133
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,759
Where are you going?

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,079
Have a drink with me.

135
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,519
Juan’er.

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Don’t run.

137
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,680
Kneel down.

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,040
Juan'er.

139
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,399
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,879
She hit me.

141
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,839
Forgive my rudeness.

142
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,079
Master Hu, since there has already been such a lesson,

143
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,279
you should be even more cautious.

144
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,360
The Li family,

145
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,920
after all, is also a prominent family in town.

146
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,480
They've already admitted fault and apologized.

147
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,519
What more can you do?

148
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,639
It's better to resolve enmity than to create it.

149
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,959
If the two families really start fighting,

150
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,560
both sides will suffer.

151
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,639
No one will save face.

152
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,120
Perhaps I was too soft-hearted.

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
In the end, it still hurt Juan'er.

154
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,839
But regarding this matter,

155
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,000
I won't let it go easily.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
I've already sent people to investigate in secret.

157
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,519
Once we have solid evidence,

158
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,560
if the Li family is truly heartless,

159
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,720
the Hu family won't be bullied either.

160
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,600
Before the truth comes out,

161
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,879
I'd like to ask you to help me.

162
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,399
For now, hold Zhengkun back.

163
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,800
That child is very impulsive.

164
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,879
I'm afraid he'll act rashly

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,279
and cause more trouble.

166
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,279
Yes, Master Hu.

167
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,439
Sister, brother-in-law...

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
Is he alright?

169
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,480
Maybe you should go talk to him.

170
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,639
What is it?

171
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,680
Feeling sorry for him?

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,279
Sister.

173
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,519
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,879
Xiu'er doesn't understand.

175
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,959
Come here.

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,360
You little flirt in heat.

177
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not dead yet.

178
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,120
And you can't wait to snatch him away.

179
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
Feeling sorry for the master inside, are you?

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,399
Sister, you've misunderstood.

181
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,920
There's really nothing between me and brother-in-law.

182
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,120
If I hadn't pitied you back then,

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
and for the sake of my family,

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
since we're still somewhat related,

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,680
I wouldn't have kept you here and given you food.

186
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
Don't think I don't know about your dirty deeds.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Let me give you some advice.

188
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,439
Put away those twisted thoughts of yours.

189
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,560
Don't be so eager

190
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,079
to jump into the Li family's fire pit.

191
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,600
Be careful,

192
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,839
or not even ashes

193
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,480
will be left of you.

194
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,039
Something's wrong, Master!

195
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,639
Miss has hanged herself!

196
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,240
Someone, come quickly!
