1
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,719
How is Miss?

2
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,399
It's nothing serious. She'll be fine after a couple of days' rest.

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,359
Alright.

4
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,320
Miss's illness is of the heart.

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,719
Master.

6
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,920
We've found the person.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,240
It's Hu San.

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,399
Also, someone from the Li family sent a message.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,679
What did they say?

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,759
Li Zhenzu's leg was crippled by Li Xingzong.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,280
Father.

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,439
This is all thanks to the good son you raised.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Please calm down first.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,920
But I think,

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,319
even if he's a scoundrel,

16
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,959
you went to their house

17
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,120
and scolded him in front of so many people.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,840
He really wouldn't dare do such a thing.

19
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,000
I also know it wasn't him.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,040
But...

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,280
Someone saw

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
on the night Juan had her accident,

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,400
that this brat snuck into Hu San's room.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,359
Zhenzu has actually been quite kind-hearted since he was young.

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,879
It's all my fault.

26
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,239
I've been too busy all day to look after him.

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920
That's why he was led astray by others.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Just look at the bad crowd around him.

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,480
Drinking, gambling, and whoring.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,519
No one taught him anything good.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,400
If a child is raised but not taught, it's the father's fault.

32
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,480
You must discipline him strictly.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,760
Especially that thing of his down there.

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,200
Who is Hu San?

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
He's a bandit.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,760
If anything happens,

37
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,280
not just you,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,759
even I won't be able to protect him.

39
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,280
Sit down.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
I called you here today

41
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,479
because there's something I need to tell you.

42
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,319
Back then, my family was framed and hunted by our enemies.

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,400
We changed our names and hid here in Huli Town.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,159
Now, the situation is unstable.

45
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,560
Things are getting more chaotic outside.

46
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,120
I think, even though Huli Town is remote,

47
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,439
it's not some unassailable paradise.

48
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm planning to use the temple repairs as an opportunity

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,879
to move up our original plan.

50
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,080
Lately, rumors about the Blood Fox have been spreading wildly in town.

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
I need you to help

52
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,800
and add fuel to the fire.

53
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,599
I understand.

54
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,680
Father.

55
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,520
She's still breathing.

56
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,199
She's awake, she's awake.

57
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,680
Where did she come from?

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,360
I don't know.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,479
What did you say?

60
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,759
Blood Fox.

61
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,719
Blood Fox.

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,800
What's going on?

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
She was bewitched by the Blood Fox.

64
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,199
Heavens, please protect us.

65
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,639
Master Hu.

66
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,319
Who is it?

67
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,199
The Blood Fox has returned.

68
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,159
Look how scared she is.

69
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,159
Nonsense.

70
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,000
Daniu's gone crazy, and now you too?

71
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,439
Where did this Blood Fox come from?

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,479
I'm not making it up, it's true!

73
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,599
Stop talking.

74
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,719
Say no more.

75
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,520
Miss, don't be afraid.

76
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,639
Are you alright?

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,520
You even dare to hit Master Hu?

78
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,360
Hu Li Town can't tolerate you.

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,919
Forget it, forget it.

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,639
Don't stoop to a madman's level.

81
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,879
Master Hu, we all know you have a kind heart.

82
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,920
You want to help her.

83
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,600
But look at her.

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,480
Let me take her.

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Master Hu.

86
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,279
You have a heart of gold.

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Let me do this good deed on your behalf.

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,839
It's not like I lack food anyway.

89
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,639
What do you think?

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
Alright then.

91
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,079
I'll leave it to you.

92
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,480
Of course, of course.

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,759
It's all about doing good deeds.

94
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,879
I'm just benefiting from your kindness, Master Hu.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
Take her away.

96
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,480
What kind of person is this?

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,279
Disperse, disperse, let's go.

98
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,680
Master, nothing bad will happen, right?

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Disperse, disperse.

100
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,279
What could possibly happen?

101
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,480
She was taken back by the Li family.

102
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,839
All our plans are in chaos now.

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,720
What happened to Hu Juan was an accident.

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
She's innocent.

105
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,920
I will definitely find out the truth.

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,199
Everyone who should pay the price

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,399
will be punished doubly.

108
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,360
Sister, look.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
It's really pretty.

110
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,120
What are you doing?

111
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,240
Playing with a madwoman for no reason.

112
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,839
Do you two want to become mad yourselves?

113
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,560
Go back inside.

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Sister.

115
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,480
Go.

116
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,079
Call me "Dad."

117
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,319
Say "Dad."

118
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,519
Let go of you.

119
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,319
Witch.

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,160
How dare you hit me.

121
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,800
Stop!

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,720
So shameless.

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,000
Dad.

124
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,160
Why did you bring a lunatic to live in our house?

125
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,199
How unlucky.

126
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,160
Look at how badly I was beaten.

127
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,680
Might as well just kill her.

128
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,439
Go back to your room.
