1
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:58,914
Scan and choose your target.

2
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:04,379
Aim with precision. Be decisive.

3
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,632
That's how you get what you want.

4
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:20,060
As you gain experience, your skills grow.

5
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,772
It's simple and clear.

6
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:29,440
But life's not a claw machine.

7
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,405
It's way more complicated and difficult.

8
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,029
Where did it all go wrong?

9
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,154
Mr. Lee.

10
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,324
- Hey!
- Are you messing with me?

11
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,992
If this is your best,
you better look for a new job.

12
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:49,908
How did you get in this company?

13
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:50,951
- I knew you were trouble.
- Are you an idiot?

14
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:53,706
- Do the job you are told to do.
- Fix this by tomorrow.

15
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,415
How did it end up like this?

16
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,709
Stick it out, man. If you quit, then what?

17
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:00,425
It wasn't even your fault.

18
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:10,967
No matter how much I think...

19
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,061
I just don't get it.

20
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:35,363
They're moving in right below me.

21
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,113
Where's the dad?

22
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:38,198
Over there.

23
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,244
Look how she bosses people around.

24
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,702
Don't buy from her bakery.

25
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:45,873
There's a bakery here?

26
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,964
She's opening one.

27
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:11,316
OPENING SOON

28
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:20,200
No, I don't get food delivered.

29
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:24,202
I pick up side dishes
to have with rice at home.

30
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:29,910
Of course, I clean the place!

31
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:33,076
I wash the blankets and clear the dust,
too.

32
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,453
Why do I have to send photos?

33
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,630
Mom, don't you trust me?

34
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:50,691
She was so beautiful.

35
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:56,572
If angels were real, they'd look like her.

36
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:02,026
More perilla seeds?

37
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,573
Perilla seeds?

38
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:08,116
Sprinkling perilla seeds
is your greatest worry now?

39
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,158
You saw that beautiful,
angelic woman and thought

40
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:15,330
"Oh, I should rush back
and sprinkle perilla seeds

41
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,539
on my pork backbone soup?"

42
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:21,751
What else then? Talk to her?

43
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:24,337
Perilla seeds then.

44
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,339
Here we go.

45
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,599
You did it again.

46
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:11,510
Finally.

47
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,296
Late! I'm late!

48
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:19,473
Gotta hurry or it'll all be gone.

49
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:22,053
Who are you?

50
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:23,853
Who the hell are you?

51
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,026
- Sorry.
- How dare you touch me!

52
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:41,115
PRETTY CRAZY

53
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:21,265
They're moving in right below me.

54
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,943
She's opening a bakery.

55
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:46,590
Wow, a new bakery...

56
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,549
Here you go.

57
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,878
Do you live here?

58
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:58,758
Wh-Why do you ask?

59
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,592
We're offering an opening discount
for residents.

60
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:04,301
Building 123, Unit 1401.

61
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:06,186
Okay.

62
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:12,437
Huh? 123-1401...

63
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,022
We live right below you.

64
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,981
123-1301. We just moved in yesterday.

65
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,444
We're neighbors! Seon Ji!

66
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,317
Come here. Hurry!

67
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,453
Seon Ji! Come out here.

68
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,288
What?

69
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:32,961
This is our new neighbor.
He lives upstairs in 1401.

70
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,582
Really? Hello!

71
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:40,625
- Hello.
- Sorry for all the noise yesterday.

72
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:42,210
I'm excited to be your neighbor.

73
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:45,139
This is paid, right? Bye.

74
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,767
What the...

75
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,686
Excuse me.

76
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:56,648
Hey!

77
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,359
Hey...

78
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:15,614
I've been calling you.

79
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:16,655
Last night, I...

80
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:19,657
A gift for our grand opening.

81
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,501
What?

82
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,336
See you next time then.

83
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:56,322
I don't get it.

84
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,701
I really don't get it.

85
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:57,789
Funny how I'm out of milk now.

86
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:20,426
Let go of me! I said let go!

87
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:21,679
Hands off me!

88
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:25,020
Let go already!

89
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,685
Hey, stop!

90
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,102
Let me go!

91
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:31,687
What the hell?

92
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,397
You filthy sleazeball!

93
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,900
What do you think you're doing?

94
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,655
I'm her dad.

95
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,450
Happy now?

96
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:45,114
Who the hell are you?

97
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:48,990
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

98
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:50,917
What's your deal?

99
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,417
Who are you?

100
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,213
Lee Gil Gu. I live here in 123-1401.

101
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:03,670
Unit 123-1401…

102
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,340
Oh, you live above us.

103
00:12:06,423 --> 00:12:08,089
Yeah.

104
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:10,141
Yeah?

105
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:15,572
You knew my daughter lived below you.

106
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:17,073
You tailed her, didn't you?

107
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:20,834
No. I didn't follow her.

108
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,171
I was just getting milk and…

109
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,883
I thought she was being
attacked by a creep.

110
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:39,384
Have you seen her at night before?

111
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,593
No, never.

112
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:45,557
Tell the truth, or we're calling the cops.

113
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,851
- I have.
- Thought so.

114
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,934
I saw her in the elevator.
Thought she was possessed.

115
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:54,356
I thought she was drunk. She attacked me.

116
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,106
So, it was you, you jerk!

117
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:02,026
Stop this! Come on!

118
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:04,364
This idiot did this to my forehead.

119
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:07,283
His skull's so damn hard,
it nearly broke mine!

120
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,448
Okay, I hear you.

121
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,618
Now listen carefully. Stay away from us.

122
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,413
Act like you don't know us.
Everything you saw…

123
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:15,830
- Let go!
- All right, all right.

124
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:18,000
Forget this ever happened, or you're dead.

125
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,293
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,543
- Now get lost. Go!
- I'll crush your thick skull!

127
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:24,343
- Enough already!
- I swear I'll crush it.

128
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,647
What a relief, she's a deep sleeper.

129
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,612
Yikes!
Uncle, I thought you were away tonight.

130
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:57,240
Been somewhere nice?

131
00:13:57,323 --> 00:14:00,992
Just up the hill for spring water.

132
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:04,871
That's a nice get-up for a hike.

133
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:06,664
Where's the water then?

134
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,042
You finished it on the way back?

135
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,802
How'd you know?

136
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:17,213
I asked you to watch her,
but you already snuck out?

137
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:20,434
She almost got hit by
a car wandering alone.

138
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:24,471
But I locked the door
so it won't open from inside.

139
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,012
Maybe it's broken.

140
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,940
Broken?

141
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:32,068
Fine. Won't happen again.

142
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:39,114
Wait!

143
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,992
Sorry.

144
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,629
- Hey...
- Sorry about yesterday.

145
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:56,538
I was too flustered to apologize properly.

146
00:14:56,621 --> 00:15:01,760
No, I mean...
Aren't you pressing the button?

147
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:04,803
14th, right?

148
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,469
Thank you.

149
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:11,392
Sure.

150
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,068
This place feels so different, right?
You'll get used to it.

151
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,368
The old place had three stores nearby.

152
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:46,163
Here, I gotta cross the road. I hate that.

153
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,002
And who insisted on moving?

154
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:51,087
Do you know what it took
for me to get a place here?

155
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,380
I nearly sold my soul for it.

156
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:58,966
Your soul's worth squat.

157
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:01,800
Don't you trust my gut?

158
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,722
This area's land value will soon...

159
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:08,390
Soon what? Rise? When?

160
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:10,942
You always say that.

161
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,172
Oh no.

162
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,472
No, no, no, no, no.

163
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,438
Hey, you.

164
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:07,815
Yes?

165
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:10,444
What do you do for work?

166
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:15,372
I'm on a break right now.

167
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:20,033
Hurry up and go.

168
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:25,414
It's not much, but get well soon.

169
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,754
Honey...

170
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,798
Didn't I tell you to stay away?

171
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:38,593
I happened to be taking out the trash.

172
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:40,550
"Happened," my ass.

173
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,676
You a professional passerby?

174
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,678
Sorry.

175
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,055
Did you bring what I asked?

176
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:48,227
Let me see.

177
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,318
- Why would you need-
- Hand it over.

178
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:55,147
Let's see.

179
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,940
RESIDENT REGISTRATION COPY

180
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:58,565
You're an only child?

181
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:01,318
- No, I have an older sister.
- All right, fine.

182
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,321
RESUME

183
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,489
Sports Science major, huh?

184
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:08,199
Your mother was the head
of the women's association here?

185
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:11,452
- Yes.
- And your dad's a high school principal?

186
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:13,286
They're in the States now, with my sister.

187
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:14,495
That's fine.

188
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:16,547
She just had a baby...

189
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:21,793
Any criminal record?

190
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:25,386
No! I'm not that kind of person.

191
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:29,305
You like sports?

192
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:33,138
Not really, but I did taekwondo.

193
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,427
Taekwondo?

194
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,097
And...

195
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,689
Hapkido, kendo...

196
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:45,188
Table tennis, tennis, badminton,

197
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:48,231
soccer, basketball, volleyball,

198
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:51,216
and rowing.

199
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,112
I rowed before the army.

200
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:57,575
But you don't specialize?

201
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,868
I guess not.

202
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,661
Did you mess up and got
fired at your last job?

203
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:05,165
No, I quit.

204
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:10,878
It wasn't right for me
to the point it was hurting.

205
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:14,503
Everyone's hurting.
The whole country's hurting.

206
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,631
Move aside.

207
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,965
Hey, Mister.

208
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:20,970
Me?

209
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:23,096
You're hurting, right? How'd you get hurt?

210
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,721
From work.

211
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:28,601
See? Work hurts us all.

212
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,143
Why are you following us?

213
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:35,119
About that...

214
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:42,776
Your daughter acts so odd every time,
like a different person.

215
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,986
I got curious.

216
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:46,239
Oh yeah?

217
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:51,704
It won't happen again. I'm not a creep.

218
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,876
Sorry.

219
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,682
Chin up.

220
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,610
Look at me.

221
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:08,200
Listen to this carefully.

222
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,242
Close the curtains.

223
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:38,423
My daughter's quite
different from most people.

224
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:42,970
Hard to believe, but she is...

225
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:44,978
possessed.

226
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,975
Listen.

227
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:53,019
She's a demon. Born with one inside her.

228
00:20:53,102 --> 00:21:01,362
Every night at 2 A.M., it takes over.
Lasts about three hours.

229
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,319
You're the one they got?

230
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:04,572
Oh, no, no.

231
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,154
He's our neighbor. Nice guy.

232
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:08,740
- I'll crush your damn skull!
- He looks obedient, right?

233
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:10,577
It's just for a few days.

234
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,996
I'm not lying. You saw it yourself.

235
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,545
It's not split personality.

236
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:22,379
It's an ancient family curse.

237
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:28,092
If we don't offer up what it wants,
who knows what it'll do?

238
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:34,762
It loves moonlight.
So, it walks around at night.

239
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:40,310
Seon Ji has no idea that she's possessed.

240
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:45,781
If she finds out,
she won't be able to go on.

241
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,857
Did you hit your head, too?

242
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,443
Stop eavesdropping. Go away.

243
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,986
We are discussing a book.
Something for kids.

244
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,155
You're hurt. Go lie down.

245
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:59,326
What children's story has demons in it?

246
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,328
I'll get going.

247
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,787
Gil Gu, please. Help us.

248
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,956
Sir, I...

249
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,081
Gil Gu!

250
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:10,375
Thank you.

251
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,135
Sir?

252
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:31,319
Do I...

253
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:35,228
look like a demon to you?

254
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:38,230
No, not at all.

255
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:42,946
I'm not just any demon.
I'm a high-ranking one.

256
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:49,952
Could someone lowly like you
even see my horns or wings?

257
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,912
These wings here.

258
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:57,549
See them?

259
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,179
What's that smell?

260
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:15,103
Stinks like rotting wounds.

261
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:23,943
What are you searching for so desperately?

262
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:26,483
Sorry?

263
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:30,358
Hit the nail on the head? Feel ashamed?
Mad? Let it all out.

264
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:35,412
You humans are evil inside.
Show who you really are.

265
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,743
I don't think I can handle this.

266
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:45,330
You should take your daughter
to a specialized hospital.

267
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:56,632
She pokes at the deep stuff, right?
The things you hide away.

268
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,966
That's because she's a demon.

269
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:02,851
She loves messing with hearts.

270
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:12,937
If it's too much,
just protect her like a caregiver.

271
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,564
I'll make it worth your while.

272
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:20,860
Besides, I wouldn't trust
just anyone with my daughter.

273
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:26,371
We're neighbors, after all.
Only one wall between us.

274
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,875
You're a good man.

275
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,496
What do you do during the day?

276
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,544
Hi, I'm Lee Gil Gu. Nice to meet you.

277
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:45,763
I've heard about you. I'm Jung Seon Ji.

278
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:54,939
Hi, I'm Jung Ara.
Let's start your training.

279
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:06,274
Feels weird, right?
You'll get used to it in time.

280
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:12,111
It's a lot, I know. Trust me, I get it.

281
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,489
She really doesn't remember?

282
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:18,448
Nothing about turning into a demon.

283
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:22,750
But unlike her,
the demon remembers everything.

284
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:27,590
You still don't believe it.

285
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:32,504
How can I believe this?

286
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:37,548
Like it or not, you will.
We've never hired an outsider before.

287
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:41,675
At first, I was at a loss.

288
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:43,305
Then my quick wits came up with this plan.

289
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:45,178
What do you do for work?

290
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:48,641
I'm taking a break now.

291
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:51,143
You're jobless.

292
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:55,815
And you live upstairs. I thought, perfect.

293
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:57,232
I'll be counting on you.

294
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,611
Hello, I'm Lee Gil Gu. Nice to meet you.

295
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:04,369
I'm so happy to work here.

296
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,333
When did I say that?

297
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:13,584
I saw everything. Fool.

298
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:22,001
Is this some dumb prank?
A YouTube secret camera?

299
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:24,631
Someone filming me in hiding?

300
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:27,634
Where's the camera? See, I knew it.

301
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:29,305
Where is it?

302
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:46,364
Who do you think you are?
Who'd want to see you get punked?

303
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,153
Feel them. Touch them. Grab them.

304
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,526
What are you doing?

305
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,411
It's okay. Just hold them.

306
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,699
Go on, do it.

307
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,200
Please stop this.

308
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:01,702
She's asleep. This is between you and me.

309
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:04,379
Touch them. Feel them.

310
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,716
I think I like you.

311
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,306
Don't forget. It's a demon.
It'll try everything to break you.

312
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:28,849
If you give in,
it wins and it'll get stronger.

313
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:37,022
I really like you, Gil Gu.

314
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,483
Lies.

315
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,737
Bullshit!

316
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,323
No one falls for me that fast.

317
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,365
That's never happened.

318
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:51,210
I'm not falling for this.

319
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,004
All right.

320
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:00,627
Fonfon.

321
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,837
Welcome.

322
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,755
Welcome.

323
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:08,173
Cashier boy! See this White Fonfon Chiffon?

324
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:10,101
Only stock this from now.

325
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:12,429
And green mint chocolate...

326
00:28:12,512 --> 00:28:16,681
Don't put that out.
Even demons would freak at the taste!

327
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:20,560
What are you doing?
And why talk down to me?

328
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:21,645
- What? Jeez.
- I'm really sorry.

329
00:28:21,728 --> 00:28:23,478
She's my sister. She has mental issues.

330
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:24,479
Chop chop. Hurry up!

331
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:27,021
Is this your first day or something?

332
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,905
Move it, cashier boy!

333
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:33,120
Ugh. Seriously.

334
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:15,656
Even real demons wouldn't go that far.

335
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:19,992
I have a question.

336
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:25,036
What's a demon doing in Seon Ji's body?

337
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:35,662
Her ancestor wronged me gravely.
An unforgivable sin.

338
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:38,175
And she's bearing the punishment.

339
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:44,680
How long will it last? Forever, of course.

340
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:50,218
So, obey me completely. Otherwise...

341
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:54,020
Even I can't guarantee what I'll do to her.

342
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:59,232
No way. That's insane.

343
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:15,454
Is she kidding me?

344
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,584
What's with the cicada?

345
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:26,373
Okay, okay. You're a real demon.

346
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:30,218
I believe you. Please stop.

347
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:38,013
Cut the sample bread all the way like this.

348
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,417
What?

349
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,647
Nothing.

350
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,308
You can speak casually, too.

351
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:54,654
You do it with Ara.
It'll help us get closer.

352
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:01,700
All right. I'll do that.

353
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,535
Okay.

354
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:11,168
I have class now. See you later.

355
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:15,453
- Keep cutting.
- Got it.

356
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:16,707
Take care.

357
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,214
Okay.

358
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:25,304
You want us to get close?

359
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,347
Me, too.

360
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:00,918
That's all you got?

361
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,128
Harder.

362
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:06,670
Harder!

363
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,601
Why is she going around in circles?

364
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:31,943
Can you come another time?

365
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:45,905
Really? All sold out?
Look me in the eyes, cashier boy.

366
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:48,834
I said it's all gone.

367
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:54,036
I don't have long to live.

368
00:32:54,119 --> 00:33:01,344
Fonfon Chiffon is my only joy left in life.

369
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:06,428
Oh bless your soul!
You dare lie to me, cashier boy?

370
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:32,578
- He's a good kid.
- Checkmate!

371
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,346
What?

372
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:04,521
You can switch to this look instantly?

373
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:08,016
Only top demons can do it.

374
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,435
You look so nice. So pretty.

375
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:12,393
These curls are coming out great.

376
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:13,770
Come on, let's go.

377
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:15,895
Here. Look at these stocks.

378
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:17,947
Pick one that will go to the moon.

379
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,949
Please.

380
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:59,066
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

381
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:06,656
Come out of that body and perish!

382
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,696
I don't think so. Because I don't want to.

383
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,951
Get out, dammit!

384
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,705
That's enough.

385
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:22,426
Something like this?
That stuff's just in movies.

386
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:23,801
It won't work.

387
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:28,100
Will she stay like this
for the rest of her life?

388
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:29,725
I don't know.

389
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:33,145
Anyway, you need to be tougher with her.

390
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:34,814
Human or demon,

391
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:38,609
show weakness and they'll
walk all over you.

392
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:43,569
How do you manage that?
You dropped honorifics, too.

393
00:35:43,652 --> 00:35:49,281
She challenged me to a bet,
probably out of boredom.

394
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,957
Said she'd do me any favor if I won.

395
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:00,209
Poof!

396
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,167
What the heck?

397
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,087
She still doesn't know how she lost to me.

398
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:08,848
She hasn't asked me to bet since. Idiot.

399
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:15,640
A bet that big,
and all you did was drop honorifics?

400
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:19,100
Yeah. Why?

401
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:20,892
Want to bet?

402
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:24,979
Pick a toy. I'll win in three tries.

403
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:26,694
And if you do?

404
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:32,076
You leave her. For good.

405
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:37,906
All right, all right, fine.

406
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:46,205
Then tell me how to kick you out of her.

407
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:51,006
And I drop honorifics, too?

408
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,613
If you lose...

409
00:36:56,696 --> 00:37:02,801
I'll double the time I'm active.

410
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:06,430
That one.

411
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:08,897
No backing out.

412
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:31,995
All right. Now, please tell me.

413
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:36,499
I mean, tell me.

414
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:40,384
Tell me how to get you
out of Seon Ji's body for good.

415
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:46,379
So ugly... just like you.

416
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:47,548
Tell me.

417
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:50,759
All right, all right. I'll tell you.

418
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:52,884
Listen carefully.

419
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:55,710
Say my name and tell me
to get out of this body three times.

420
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,388
I'll leave right away.

421
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:00,227
That's all it takes?

422
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,734
Yep.

423
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:05,236
What's your name?

424
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:08,448
My name?

425
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:13,153
D...

426
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:15,071
Duh...

427
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:16,865
Don't know.

428
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:19,491
You really think I'd tell?

429
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,783
Just one letter, please?

430
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,372
NAMES OF DEMONS

MYSTERY HUNTERS FORUM:
LOOKING FOR NAMES OF DEMONS

432
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:30,558
TV SHOW: "MY BOSS, THE EXORCIST"

433
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,879
You're mine now.

434
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:43,346
I command you.
Leave that body and return to hell!

435
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,647
Back to hell!

436
00:38:56,605 --> 00:39:01,779
We're now famous for bread.
Some visit just for the pastries.

437
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:03,444
All thanks to your great recipe.

438
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:04,736
I mean it.

439
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:09,031
Want something cold to drink?
What'll you have?

440
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,325
I'm okay.

441
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:13,078
Thank you. What do you want, Gil Gu?

442
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:16,453
Iced chocolate then. Thanks.

443
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll take these boxes to the car.

444
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:19,084
Okay.

445
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:21,968
- What about you, Seon Ji?
- I'd like...

446
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,214
You okay? Gil Gu, are you hurt?

447
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,462
I'm fine.

448
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,048
I'm sorry.

449
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:30,308
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

450
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:44,808
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

451
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:52,866
Sorry.

452
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:04,870
You really like mint choco, huh?

453
00:40:04,953 --> 00:40:09,457
Someone I know detests it.

454
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:15,470
Tasted like toothpaste at first.
But I grew to like it.

455
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:20,968
Why am I so sleepy?

456
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,020
Of course you are.

457
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:27,187
Didn't sleep well?

458
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:33,602
Maybe it's the dream.
I have the same one all the time.

459
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:41,283
I wander but I'm not alone.
Something's with me.

460
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:46,656
But it's not scary. How should I put it...

461
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,290
Feels like it protects me.

462
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:56,165
Warm. Comforting. Something like that.

463
00:40:56,247 --> 00:41:01,837
Must be someone great.
Watching over you even in dreams.

464
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:03,761
It's not a person.

465
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:07,089
Feels more like a dog.

466
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:14,102
A stray that follows me. Keeps trailing me.

467
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:19,691
Can't be a dog.

468
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:24,897
A dog? A stray?

469
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,651
Must be all these resentful souls.
The water smells foul.

470
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:34,410
So many wandering around.

471
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:52,627
Sir, please don't.

472
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:56,806
Don't try to stop me. Nothing matters now.

473
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:02,676
We don't know what you're going through

474
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:03,886
but talk to us, please.

475
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:07,848
We'll hear you out.

476
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:12,111
Goodbye, cruel world.

477
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:15,062
I'm jumping for real.

478
00:42:15,145 --> 00:42:16,647
I'll do it!

479
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:19,026
Here! Over here!

480
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:21,817
Hey! Look here!

481
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:24,446
Hey! Look at me.

482
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:28,665
Down here!

483
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:48,923
Go for it!

484
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:50,131
Just jump already.

485
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:52,553
Be brave. It won't hurt.

486
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:53,595
- It'll be over fast.
- What the...

487
00:42:53,678 --> 00:42:56,221
Yes, jump! Just do it.

488
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:58,058
- What's she doing?
- Go away.

489
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,183
Jump! Jump!

490
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:01,685
- No!
- Back off!

491
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:03,102
Please don't jump!

492
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,071
Don't be brave!

493
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,607
It'll be over in a sec.

494
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,317
Just let go.

495
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:13,236
- I'm bleeding.
- Look! It's really not that hard!

496
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,288
What's wrong with her?

497
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,374
The hell?

498
00:43:20,785 --> 00:43:22,877
Seon Ji! Seon Ji!

499
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:25,627
Seon Ji!

500
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,836
Seon Ji! Seon Ji!

501
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:35,471
I can't swim!

502
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:40,432
One, two, three!

503
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:44,678
Seon Ji!

504
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:47,056
We located her.

505
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,182
Crossing north.

506
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:53,605
What? Crossing the river?

507
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:55,736
What are you saying?

508
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:34,645
Don't just watch. Save her. Please!

509
00:44:56,948 --> 00:45:02,493
This morning at 3 A.M.,
a woman in her 20s jumped off Gunho Bridge.

510
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:05,917
First time I've seen this
as a rescue worker.

511
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,290
And butterfly stroke's hard.

512
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:13,629
But her form was excellent.
I found myself cheering.

513
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:17,923
Korea's future in swimming looks bright.

514
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,676
You punk. How did Seon Ji
end up in the Han River?

515
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,886
Why?

516
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,850
She threw a fit. Sick of being stuck here.

517
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:32,017
You know the trouble I had
drying her hair and clothes?

518
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,189
I should've told you
not to get her near any waterfront.

519
00:45:35,272 --> 00:45:38,356
Did Seon Ji get trained to swim?

520
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,490
She swam till middle school.

521
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:44,227
When she quit, the head of the association
begged on his knees.

522
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,779
Said Korea lost a future gold medal.

523
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:50,575
But you, punk... I trusted you with her.

524
00:45:50,658 --> 00:45:55,707
You backstab me right after I'm discharged?

525
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,960
Well done. Really, good job.

526
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:00,419
- You're the best!
- Great job.

527
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:01,500
Gil Gu, you're awesome.

528
00:46:01,582 --> 00:46:03,428
Smile, man.

529
00:46:04,504 --> 00:46:06,508
I'll drop Dad off and go to class.

530
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,718
- Okay.
- See ya.

531
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:11,642
- Take care.
- Be safe.

532
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,839
Seon Ji's unbelievable.

533
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:21,051
Even after all that ruckus,
she isn't skipping classes.

534
00:46:21,134 --> 00:46:25,096
French class, right?
Maybe she wants to study abroad.

535
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,895
Yep.

536
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:33,359
She's eyed a baking
school in France for years.

537
00:46:34,602 --> 00:46:38,022
Uncle and I act supportive for now

538
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,899
but man,
how do we discourage her eventually?

539
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:42,743
It's like a ticking bomb.

540
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:49,783
Why are you so surprised?

541
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:52,702
What are you doing here, Gil Gu?

542
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:53,955
Huh?

543
00:46:54,038 --> 00:46:59,000
Didn't know this place existed.
Good spot for a walk.

544
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,591
Yeah.

545
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:05,921
Gil Gu.

546
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:07,006
Yeah?

547
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:10,133
What did Dad ask of you at this hour?

548
00:47:10,216 --> 00:47:17,357
Never mind. I misunderstood.

549
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,904
Aren't you sleepy?

550
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:34,743
Today's my mom's memorial day.
Maybe that's why I couldn't sleep.

551
00:47:35,573 --> 00:47:37,864
Oh.

552
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:42,710
She passed when I was eight.

553
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:48,163
I tried to forget how she suffered.

554
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:56,247
But today, I remember her smile.
And her scent when she hugged me.

555
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:02,051
Sorry. I got all gloomy.

556
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:07,433
No. If you want to talk, I'm all ears.

557
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:13,152
I'm really good at listening.
It's one of my few talents.

558
00:48:14,312 --> 00:48:15,986
Okay.

559
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:38,131
Shall we head back now?

560
00:48:40,582 --> 00:48:46,763
Since we're out, shall we go a bit farther?

561
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:08,663
So, your feelings are serious.

562
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:21,049
Put your feet down or I'll whoop your ass.

563
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:23,502
Hey.

564
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,138
Boo!

565
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:34,386
You were lying the whole time?

566
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,305
"Gil Gu, what are you doing here?"

567
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:43,153
"If you want to talk, I'm all ears.
I'm really good at listening."

568
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:49,198
I played along.
You think I can't tell you apart?

569
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:56,321
You gonna stick with her forever?
Don't you feel bad for her?

570
00:50:56,404 --> 00:50:59,616
She can't even sleep right.
She'll never study abroad.

571
00:50:59,698 --> 00:51:03,495
Can't you stop already? Please.

572
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:07,756
Oh là là! Non, je ne vais pas!

573
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:13,672
You've never seen real pity.

574
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:16,506
I told you how you can end this.

575
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:19,176
Say my name and tell me
to leave this body three times.

576
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:20,718
I'll leave right away.

577
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,759
There's no other way?

578
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:26,723
Take me on the bouncy.

579
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:29,265
You mean trampoline?

580
00:51:29,348 --> 00:51:31,142
Yeah. The bouncy.

581
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:33,442
If I take you, you'll leave?

582
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:39,109
Put your heart into making me happy.

583
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:46,698
If you do that,
I'll cut my time by that much.

584
00:51:46,781 --> 00:51:51,249
Then who knows? Maybe one day I'll vanish.

585
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:55,421
Hold on. Let me check if there's one open.

586
00:51:56,122 --> 00:51:57,788
I'll take you on the bouncy for sure.

587
00:51:57,872 --> 00:52:01,627
What else? Name it.

588
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:03,884
Bouncy…

589
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:12,850
Want to go to the beach?

590
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,515
Let's do it. Why not?

591
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:24,602
But you'll see nothing in the dark.

592
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:29,482
Then we go during the day.

593
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,406
During the day?

594
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,703
How?

595
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:46,957
I haven't been to the beach in forever.
Would've been nice with Ara.

596
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,792
How bad is her cold?

597
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:57,303
Just a light one. Wow, it's vast.

598
00:53:03,971 --> 00:53:08,189
Seon Ji, why are you crying?

599
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:13,317
Oh, what's this?

600
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:17,489
Must be the wind.

601
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:22,403
Can you take a picture of me?

602
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:25,580
One, two, three.

603
00:53:26,613 --> 00:53:30,747
Got it. Let me show you.

604
00:53:33,535 --> 00:53:36,752
Only one, huh?

605
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:50,174
Have you tried this?
Apparently they're going viral.

606
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:54,727
Mint chocolate or plain. Choose one.

607
00:54:02,058 --> 00:54:09,357
This is so nice.
Oh, I've been meaning to ask you...

608
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:13,153
It might sound weird but...

609
00:54:13,236 --> 00:54:17,163
did we ever watch a movie?

610
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:36,297
About the movies that night...
You were lying from the start, right?

611
00:54:36,379 --> 00:54:39,765
I thought you could tell us apart.
Guess not.

612
00:54:43,509 --> 00:54:48,223
Today's trip to the beach...
How much time off is that?

613
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:51,442
An hour? Two?

614
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:56,982
Five minutes. I'm being generous.

615
00:54:57,064 --> 00:55:02,533
Five? Just five minutes?

616
00:55:03,569 --> 00:55:08,323
Did I enjoy it? No.
If anyone did, it was you.

617
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:13,535
I drove for four hours. I'm wiped out.

618
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:18,298
Cut me some slack. Give me more time off.

619
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:22,750
What's wrong?

620
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:25,763
Why is everyone so dying to get rid of me?

621
00:55:27,422 --> 00:55:33,310
I said to make me happy sincerely,
not sincerely try to get rid of me.

622
00:55:40,393 --> 00:55:42,778
Did you forget who I am?

623
00:57:08,714 --> 00:57:10,716
Here.

624
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,893
Here, rinse your mouth.

625
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:24,020
Hold still.

626
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:26,904
At least dust off the dirt.

627
00:57:28,274 --> 00:57:30,823
What if you get sick?

628
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:47,046
Okay, I'll make you happy sincerely.
You keep your word.

629
00:57:47,915 --> 00:57:49,631
Here goes.

630
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:03,395
Hey! My throat!

631
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:16,654
Thank you.

632
00:58:54,303 --> 00:58:55,928
What the hell?

633
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:58,390
This is how to have fun.

634
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:00,848
How dare you! Stop now!

635
00:59:00,932 --> 00:59:02,518
- I'll show you real fun.
- Stop it! Cut it out.

636
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,734
This is way more fun.

637
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:44,761
Where are we?

638
00:59:44,845 --> 00:59:47,640
You like flowers, don't you?

639
00:59:47,723 --> 00:59:50,524
Think a demon likes this crap?

640
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:01,993
Wow. What's this?

641
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:04,402
Smile a little.

642
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:07,247
How dare you tell a demon to smile?

643
01:00:08,156 --> 01:00:12,868
I thought a top-tier demon
could do anything.

644
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:17,423
Guess posing and smiling isn't one of them.

645
01:00:18,372 --> 01:00:19,964
What?

646
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:26,048
That's good. Great! Gimme more.

647
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:30,176
Nice! Yes. Something else now.

648
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,424
No. Don't do that. Stop.

649
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,022
One, two, three.

650
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:49,698
See? Looks great. Like it?

651
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:54,364
That's not the real me. What's to like?

652
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:58,698
My true form is hundred
times more beautiful.

653
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:00,701
If you saw me, you'd go blind.

654
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:09,000
I had huge eyes, a sharp nose, horns.

655
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,968
Famous as a beautiful demon. Look!

656
01:01:16,421 --> 01:01:22,225
I'd definitely go blind.

657
01:01:25,263 --> 01:01:29,774
If you were that famous,
everyone must've known your name.

658
01:01:30,848 --> 01:01:33,486
What did they call you?

659
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,024
They called me this.

660
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:42,652
Her surname is Nigh, name is Strye.

661
01:01:42,734 --> 01:01:47,408
Nigh Strye! I command you!
Leave that body immediately!

662
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:52,703
I command you, Nigh Strye...
Leave that body at once.

663
01:01:52,787 --> 01:01:55,461
Keep going. Three times.

664
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,250
Nigh Strye...

665
01:02:00,334 --> 01:02:04,502
30 minutes, Gil Gu!

666
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:06,296
Well done, son.

667
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:12,553
You achieved something I couldn't
after buying her a hundred outfits.

668
01:02:12,636 --> 01:02:16,933
Man, I liked you from the start.

669
01:02:17,017 --> 01:02:20,600
While you're at it,
just get rid of that demon for good.

670
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:22,808
Yes, I will. I'll try.

671
01:02:22,892 --> 01:02:26,605
- Good.
- She cut down 30 minutes just for that?

672
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:29,067
She really liked the bouncy.

673
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:31,406
That's where I made the biggest cut.

674
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:36,703
Let's get rid of her for good tonight.

675
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:42,702
We'll party like crazy. Let's go wild.

676
01:02:42,785 --> 01:02:43,955
What's your name?

677
01:02:44,038 --> 01:02:45,412
Me?

678
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,250
It's bum-ba-bum, Lee Hee Bum.

679
01:02:48,334 --> 01:02:50,375
- Shall we?
- Go, go.

680
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:52,008
Let's go!

681
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,089
What's wrong with you?

682
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,841
Answer me! What eyeliner do you use?

683
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:03,100
It's Devil's Eye from Lily Brown.

684
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:06,265
Sorry. I'm sorry.

685
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:08,566
Stick close to me, okay?

686
01:03:51,549 --> 01:03:54,138
What are you doing?

687
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,229
Who might you be?

688
01:03:56,888 --> 01:03:59,901
I'm... her boyfriend.

689
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:17,013
Are you okay?

690
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:23,127
Why's your hand shaking so much?

691
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:28,022
Because my boyfriend's hand is so warm.

692
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,890
When did they get so close?

693
01:04:46,846 --> 01:04:47,881
Beats me.

694
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:53,843
Ara's quirky, but she makes friends
and boyfriends easily.

695
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:56,727
Maybe it's her honesty.

696
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,348
What about you?

697
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:02,935
Not seeing anyone?

698
01:05:03,018 --> 01:05:10,158
It takes more than just heart.
I need to say how I feel.

699
01:05:11,629 --> 01:05:14,895
I tend to overthink.

700
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:19,245
Or maybe I just lack courage.

701
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:24,211
Welcome.

702
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:45,689
How much?

703
01:05:47,683 --> 01:05:51,810
I'll get rid of it.
That thing attached to her.

704
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:53,567
What?

705
01:05:55,645 --> 01:06:00,493
Been there longer than I thought.
She doesn't know, does she?

706
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:03,995
That thing possessing her.

707
01:06:04,904 --> 01:06:09,957
I poked at it a bit and it
reacted right away.

708
01:06:17,288 --> 01:06:20,542
I saw her at a cafe
and followed her for a few days.

709
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:23,720
I just couldn't ignore it.

710
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:29,096
Don't worry. I'll get rid of it for sure.

711
01:06:30,926 --> 01:06:35,095
Consider yourself lucky I spotted it.

712
01:06:35,178 --> 01:06:39,982
I'll get on it as quickly as possible.

713
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,609
There's a misunderstanding.

714
01:06:47,649 --> 01:06:49,732
You're bad at lying, huh?

715
01:06:49,814 --> 01:06:51,491
Excuse me?

716
01:06:52,236 --> 01:06:54,953
He said he'd get rid of me, right?

717
01:06:55,948 --> 01:06:58,457
How did you know that?

718
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:03,585
How many do you think
have tried to exorcise me?

719
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:09,375
If you trust him and try something stupid,

720
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:14,261
I'll devour her.

721
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:19,716
Gil Gu, I'm heading to class.

722
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:21,926
Okay.

723
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:24,220
Hey, Seon Ji.

724
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,390
Yeah?

725
01:07:26,473 --> 01:07:28,645
Call me on your way back.

726
01:07:29,892 --> 01:07:35,404
The world's scary these days.
I'll wait at the bus stop.

727
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:40,109
Okay, I'll call you.

728
01:07:41,828 --> 01:07:44,962
Take care.

729
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:58,917
I told you, we've tried everything.

730
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,752
But they're all scammers.
Just took my money.

731
01:08:02,835 --> 01:08:05,046
That guy's probably one, too.

732
01:08:05,129 --> 01:08:10,006
We don't want to upset it,
let it lash out again.

733
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:15,020
It's best to slowly cut back its time
while keeping it in check.

734
01:08:23,685 --> 01:08:25,895
Excuse me.

735
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:32,737
I hurt my arm.
Can you help me tie my shoes?

736
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:34,910
Sure. Just a moment.

737
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,370
Thank you.

738
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:48,582
This is my favorite candy.
I want to say thank you.

739
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,259
It's really good. You should try it.

740
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,595
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

741
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,644
It's cold.

742
01:09:37,581 --> 01:09:43,460
Son, I've been meaning to tell you.

743
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:48,800
You've worked so hard.
I'm ever so grateful for you.

744
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:52,135
I'm okay. It wasn't that hard.

745
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:53,304
Have a drink.

746
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:57,056
I have to walk with Seon Ji later.

747
01:09:57,139 --> 01:09:59,440
Right.

748
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:03,229
But it's okay.

749
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:07,822
The demon can't walk long
on a night like this. Gets tired.

750
01:10:10,566 --> 01:10:15,362
I really have a good eye for people.

751
01:10:15,446 --> 01:10:20,081
When I met you, my first thought was...

752
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:24,702
Hey, Gil Gu. What is it?

753
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:26,580
Gil Gu!

754
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:28,295
Gil Gu!

755
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:31,460
He'll move fast.

756
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:34,845
I'll get on it as quickly as possible.

757
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:37,842
He'll wait for when I'm weakest.

758
01:10:37,925 --> 01:10:40,682
Nigh Strye!

759
01:10:46,472 --> 01:10:54,278
Wait, I'm feeling weak.
Like I have no strength.

760
01:10:57,148 --> 01:10:59,450
It's not even the new moon.

761
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:04,826
I'll call you.

762
01:11:10,952 --> 01:11:13,827
Gil Gu, what's going on?

763
01:11:13,911 --> 01:11:16,206
Can you check where Seon Ji is?

764
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:18,456
- Why?
- She's not answering her phone. Hurry.

765
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:22,879
What do you mean she's not answering?

766
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:26,670
What the... Why is she so far away?

767
01:11:26,753 --> 01:11:29,465
I'll bring her back.

768
01:11:29,548 --> 01:11:31,309
Hey, Gil Gu!

769
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:23,385
Welcome. That candy was good, wasn't it?

770
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:25,471
Let me go. Untie me now!

771
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:29,981
Would you let go if you were me?
After all this trouble.

772
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:37,021
I'll let it slide once, so stop.

773
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:41,068
You shouldn't have caught my eyes.

774
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:45,447
Don't be scared. It won't take long.

775
01:12:45,531 --> 01:12:47,866
You bastard, I won't let you get away!

776
01:12:47,949 --> 01:12:50,200
Untie me now!

777
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,168
I said untie me!

778
01:13:00,206 --> 01:13:01,592
You...

779
01:13:29,316 --> 01:13:35,244
I, Young Sik, the 46th descendent,
present you the second trial.

780
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:58,717
By the power vested
in our noble family by the moon,

781
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,894
I destroy you here.

782
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:34,871
Seon Ji…

783
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:36,503
Seon Ji!

784
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:44,718
You scared me. How did you get here?

785
01:14:57,097 --> 01:15:04,233
Stay still, don't interfere.
I'm helping you.

786
01:15:06,312 --> 01:15:11,284
By kidnapping her? Why go this far?

787
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,781
You wouldn't let me otherwise.

788
01:15:14,864 --> 01:15:19,284
I need a lot of practice to get stronger.

789
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:24,335
But you're fully taken
by this stray spirit.

790
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:31,048
I'm a demon. A high-ranking one.

791
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:39,549
You've been lying to him?
Calling yourself a demon?

792
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:47,482
It's fancier than stray spirit.
You're just a brat pretending.

793
01:15:54,268 --> 01:15:59,740
If I knew you were a fading spirit,
I wouldn't have gone this far.

794
01:16:07,907 --> 01:16:10,541
Ow, my head...

795
01:16:11,995 --> 01:16:15,754
I'm helping you. Why don't you get it?

796
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,254
Come at me.

797
01:16:24,337 --> 01:16:26,346
Come at me, damn it.

798
01:16:28,425 --> 01:16:29,593
Head.

799
01:16:29,675 --> 01:16:32,019
- Head?
- Head!

800
01:16:34,554 --> 01:16:36,063
Head!

801
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:39,599
You coward...

802
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:43,277
Stop faking the rant. Fight like a man.

803
01:16:43,938 --> 01:16:46,105
Come at me.

804
01:16:46,188 --> 01:16:49,608
Head! Head! Head! Head!

805
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:54,027
Stop! Stop! Stop!

806
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,246
Stop!

807
01:17:00,744 --> 01:17:01,994
Head! Head!

808
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:03,079
Head! Head!

809
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:05,463
Head! Head!

810
01:17:09,623 --> 01:17:11,260
Head!

811
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:19,723
Head!

812
01:17:23,427 --> 01:17:25,143
Seon Ji...

813
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:51,293
It's okay now. You'll never see him again.

814
01:18:04,169 --> 01:18:07,847
If you want to talk, I'm here.

815
01:18:08,508 --> 01:18:11,018
I'm really good at listening.

816
01:18:23,813 --> 01:18:28,989
It was a time when being alive was pain.

817
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:35,870
With constant droughts and plagues,
no house was without wailing.

818
01:18:37,487 --> 01:18:43,000
I lost my father and sister
and was left alone.

819
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:51,760
One day,
a famous shaman came to the village.

820
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,504
Offer life, or all will perish!

821
01:18:54,587 --> 01:18:59,598
She said we'd all die
if we didn't offer a sacrifice.

822
01:19:00,844 --> 01:19:07,729
But there was nothing
in the village to offer.

823
01:19:10,976 --> 01:19:14,779
I can't forget the look in their eyes.

824
01:19:17,358 --> 01:19:22,910
That was how I died.
I had just turned twenty.

825
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:32,169
A kind family pitied me
and buried my ashes in a jar.

826
01:19:33,827 --> 01:19:41,009
Inside that jar,
the pain and sorrow slowly faded.

827
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:47,514
I learned that after 100 years,
I could forget all and be at peace.

828
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:55,059
But 50 years later,
Seon Ji's great-grandma found me.

829
01:19:55,970 --> 01:20:01,526
Time stopped for me.
If only I waited 50 more years…

830
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:05,938
Without the jar, I had nowhere to go.

831
01:20:06,022 --> 01:20:09,318
So, I entered the first person I saw.

832
01:20:09,401 --> 01:20:12,242
It was my first time, but it wasn't hard.

833
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:18,080
I was full of rage
and had nothing to hold me back.

834
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:34,300
Even before I entered her body,
a life was already growing inside her.

835
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:39,343
Somehow, I entered that tiny body.

836
01:20:39,425 --> 01:20:44,184
I met Seon Ji's grandma Eun Hye,

837
01:20:46,179 --> 01:20:48,767
her mother Hyun Hwa,

838
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:53,237
and finally, Seon Ji.

839
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:06,066
There have been people who noticed
and approached me.

840
01:21:09,075 --> 01:21:11,657
So,
I convinced Jang Su to move around often.

841
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:13,620
This area's value will soon...

842
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:20,041
Soon what? Rise? You always say that.

843
01:21:20,124 --> 01:21:21,958
I'm sorry.

844
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:25,804
I was afraid I'd get found out
if we stayed in one place for long.

845
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:31,477
I was afraid what they'd do.

846
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:39,398
So, I acted wicked, like a real demon.

847
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:42,768
So, no one would harm me.

848
01:21:42,851 --> 01:21:45,236
All right, I believe you!

849
01:21:46,021 --> 01:21:53,495
Even at that cost,
I just wanted to be with this family.

850
01:21:57,491 --> 01:22:02,126
It was a joyful, happy time.

851
01:22:04,913 --> 01:22:08,715
But good things don't last.

852
01:22:09,373 --> 01:22:12,844
Please.

853
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:20,090
Don't stay with Seon Ji.
Come with me instead.

854
01:22:24,221 --> 01:22:26,979
I wanted to go with her.

855
01:22:31,099 --> 01:22:33,809
But it wasn't an option for me.

856
01:22:33,893 --> 01:22:37,982
I still had unfulfilled time.

857
01:22:38,065 --> 01:22:40,400
What did that guy mean earlier?

858
01:22:40,483 --> 01:22:46,579
That you'll disappear anyway.
What does that mean?

859
01:22:48,112 --> 01:22:51,077
Vanishing from the world,

860
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:56,795
to wander in eternal darkness
with painful memories.

861
01:23:01,084 --> 01:23:05,589
On my 1,000th full moon outside the jar,

862
01:23:05,672 --> 01:23:08,013
I will vanish.

863
01:23:08,838 --> 01:23:12,809
On the night the moon becomes full.

864
01:23:15,264 --> 01:23:18,898
Isn't there another way?

865
01:23:19,599 --> 01:23:24,695
Like going to a better
place or finding peace?

866
01:23:26,688 --> 01:23:32,487
Only if I can be sealed in that jar again
with true compassion

867
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:35,620
and spend the remaining 50 years.

868
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:38,759
But it's useless.

869
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:46,955
The jar is gone. No true kindness
is left for me in this world.

870
01:23:47,038 --> 01:23:53,675
I said make me happy sincerely,
not sincerely try to get rid of me.

871
01:23:55,129 --> 01:23:58,639
Once I'm gone, everything will be fine.

872
01:23:59,925 --> 01:24:02,394
Like nothing ever happened.

873
01:25:09,643 --> 01:25:13,862
She hasn't gone out in days.
Mouth shut tight.

874
01:25:15,228 --> 01:25:18,063
What happened?

875
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:20,317
What did that scammer do to her?

876
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:27,071
I'll just quietly disappear in time.
Please don't tell the family.

877
01:25:27,154 --> 01:25:29,831
I don't want to bother them anymore.

878
01:25:32,077 --> 01:25:34,126
Please.

879
01:25:34,788 --> 01:25:41,835
What I said was everything.
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

880
01:25:41,918 --> 01:25:45,179
If you say so...

881
01:25:46,798 --> 01:25:53,018
Even if I hated the demon,
it feels like Seon Ji's suffering.

882
01:25:54,344 --> 01:26:00,058
What did our ancestors do
to make her go through this?

883
01:26:00,141 --> 01:26:03,061
If only I could take her place...

884
01:26:03,144 --> 01:26:05,062
The light keeps going out.

885
01:26:05,144 --> 01:26:07,396
Mr. Jung.

886
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:12,901
Is her great-grandmother's
house still around?

887
01:26:12,983 --> 01:26:17,782
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious. Does it still exist?

888
01:26:17,866 --> 01:26:20,998
Yeah, it's still there.

889
01:26:21,683 --> 01:26:25,402
Where exactly is it?

890
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,587
Thank you.

891
01:28:11,691 --> 01:28:14,822
Shall I give you a good push
for old times' sake?

892
01:28:14,905 --> 01:28:17,449
That's enough. Let's go home.

893
01:28:17,532 --> 01:28:20,242
Already? We just got out.

894
01:28:20,326 --> 01:28:23,291
How about something else?

895
01:28:46,348 --> 01:28:48,599
TODAY'S MOON: FULL MOON

896
01:28:48,682 --> 01:28:50,204
BATTERY LOW: 0%

897
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,026
Hello?

898
01:32:21,358 --> 01:32:24,492
Can I take this Fonfon Chiffon?

899
01:32:26,879 --> 01:32:27,797
2,500 won.

900
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:34,309
Jang Su, I'm tired of this.
Get the green one instead.

901
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:45,402
Let's go.

902
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:54,370
Thank you.

903
01:32:55,947 --> 01:32:58,956
Have a good one.

904
01:33:06,536 --> 01:33:13,133
You're eating well. Changed your taste?

905
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,844
I can't get used to this.

906
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:22,809
But eating this, I have no regrets.

907
01:33:25,844 --> 01:33:32,277
You can talk casually now.
I give you permission.

908
01:33:40,148 --> 01:33:44,451
I can speak casually now?

909
01:33:47,114 --> 01:33:55,577
I never crossed the line,
afraid of what you'd do...

910
01:33:55,661 --> 01:33:58,916
But I guess it's fine now.

911
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,218
How many years has it been?

912
01:34:05,462 --> 01:34:08,054
Oh well...

913
01:34:09,173 --> 01:34:12,351
Time flies.

914
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:18,023
I used to be young, full of energy.

915
01:34:22,312 --> 01:34:26,114
It's all because of you.

916
01:35:29,322 --> 01:35:31,291
What is it?

917
01:35:34,871 --> 01:35:39,547
Jang Su, you've been good.

918
01:35:42,919 --> 01:35:50,056
This neighborhood will soon...

919
01:35:53,303 --> 01:35:55,561
Just trust me.

920
01:35:56,722 --> 01:36:01,233
You and Ara, too.

921
01:36:04,104 --> 01:36:07,736
TO THE MOON

922
01:36:13,612 --> 01:36:17,706
No word from Gil Gu yet?

923
01:36:19,603 --> 01:36:26,487
He hasn't called or answered.

924
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:30,960
Where'd he go?

925
01:36:31,043 --> 01:36:35,628
He said he's going far away.

926
01:36:35,711 --> 01:36:38,298
Hey, Gil Gu!

927
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:40,007
You little punk, not even calling.

928
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:41,925
Sorry.

929
01:36:42,008 --> 01:36:45,186
Thank God. Let's go.

930
01:36:57,981 --> 01:37:00,242
What are you playing at?

931
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:03,701
You like this place.

932
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:07,913
I've been busy. Sorry.

933
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:10,909
You wondered where I was?

934
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:14,086
Did you go nuts while you went missing?

935
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:24,178
You just have to enter this jar
and spend 50 years, right?

936
01:37:25,795 --> 01:37:29,925
Tell me I'm right.
It was so hard to find this.

937
01:37:30,008 --> 01:37:34,811
It had old kimchi in it.
About 100 years old.

938
01:37:35,681 --> 01:37:41,108
I cleaned it as best I could.
It still smells a little...

939
01:37:42,142 --> 01:37:50,857
If you go in, I'll keep it safe
for 50 years, maybe even more.

940
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:01,992
Why go this far?

941
01:38:02,075 --> 01:38:04,584
Do you pity me that much?

942
01:38:07,415 --> 01:38:09,588
Because I hate it.

943
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:16,678
I hate you disappearing like this.

944
01:38:18,172 --> 01:38:22,183
I want you to forget everything
and go to a good place.

945
01:38:27,388 --> 01:38:33,478
You turn away to hide your smile,
pretend to sleep when I'm tired,

946
01:38:33,561 --> 01:38:35,548
and water dead flowers...

947
01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:38,637
What kind of demon does that?

948
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:43,486
If you're gonna act like a demon,
do it properly.

949
01:38:43,568 --> 01:38:48,204
I want you to forget all the pain,
all the suffering

950
01:38:49,735 --> 01:38:52,869
and finally be at peace.

951
01:38:57,749 --> 01:39:03,593
You were lonely and hurt, weren't you?

952
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,474
You've been through so much.

953
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:42,378
It'll all be okay now. Don't cry.

954
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:49,958
Now, tell me your name.

955
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:53,595
Tell me your real name.

956
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:01,393
I am…

957
01:40:03,818 --> 01:40:06,374
My name is...

958
01:40:09,174 --> 01:40:11,227
Moon Yang.

959
01:40:11,309 --> 01:40:13,151
Moon Yang.

960
01:40:15,712 --> 01:40:21,932
Moon Yang.

961
01:40:24,277 --> 01:40:26,827
That's a pretty name.

962
01:40:30,574 --> 01:40:35,586
Moon Yang, are you ready?

963
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:10,199
I command you, Moon Yang.

964
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:16,664
Leave that body and enter this jar.

965
01:41:19,947 --> 01:41:23,412
I command you, Moon Yang.

966
01:41:23,495 --> 01:41:28,714
Leave that body and enter this jar.

967
01:41:47,346 --> 01:41:49,648
Give me a smile.

968
01:42:00,108 --> 01:42:02,782
I command you, Moon Yang.

969
01:42:06,545 --> 01:42:09,099
Leave that body now!

970
01:42:42,684 --> 01:42:44,438
Thank you.

971
01:42:44,522 --> 01:42:47,031
Thank you so much.

972
01:43:00,325 --> 01:43:04,163
I command you, Moon Yang.

973
01:43:04,246 --> 01:43:09,590
Leave that body and enter this jar.

974
01:43:23,246 --> 01:43:25,464
Goodbye.

975
01:43:27,554 --> 01:43:30,107
Goodbye, Moon Yang.

976
01:44:00,794 --> 01:44:02,803
Why isn't she waking up?

977
01:44:04,629 --> 01:44:06,255
- You did so well.
- Good job.

978
01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:07,715
Well done, Gil Gu.

979
01:44:07,799 --> 01:44:13,219
After Moon Yang left,
Seon Ji went abroad to study.

980
01:44:13,302 --> 01:44:15,431
Travel safe.

981
01:44:15,514 --> 01:44:17,607
- Go on.
- Take care.

982
01:44:24,077 --> 01:44:27,148
Ara opened her own little shop.

983
01:44:27,232 --> 01:44:30,157
She's doing great on her own.

984
01:44:35,611 --> 01:44:39,833
The boss left
after selling his house and the bakery.

985
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:53,845
I'm sure it wasn't just because
he made a good profit.

986
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:00,599
And me...

987
01:45:01,718 --> 01:45:04,146
I started working again.

988
01:45:05,862 --> 01:45:08,288
Doing what I do best.

989
01:45:50,642 --> 01:45:54,529
I'm okay. You think I'm still a child?

990
01:45:55,970 --> 01:46:00,857
Not right away. I gotta make a stop.

991
01:46:28,749 --> 01:46:31,251
That's for customers
spending over 10,000 won!

992
01:46:31,335 --> 01:46:33,754
I want to go to the beach, too.

993
01:46:33,837 --> 01:46:38,973
Stay home.
You're sick today. Just a little.

994
01:46:41,215 --> 01:46:43,144
I'll take the picture.

995
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:49,482
One, two, three.

996
01:46:51,559 --> 01:46:53,824
GIL GU

997
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,133
Hello?

998
01:47:30,215 --> 01:47:31,929
Gil Gu.

999
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:34,077
Seon Ji.

1000
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,253
How have you been?

1001
01:47:37,096 --> 01:47:40,230
Where are you now?
