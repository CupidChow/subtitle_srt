00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


3
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,187
Talent is the ability
to hit a target no one else can.

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,898
Genius can hit a target
no one else can see.

5
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,404
And if we say in the early 21st century,
"What is the genius target for us,

6
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,156
for our time and place?"

7
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:37,328
I would put forward that it's the ability
to stop our self-destructive behaviors

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,664
and neutralize aging.

9
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,464
You must have heard
of <i>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</i>

10
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,091
{\an8}A story where a man ages in reverse.

11
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>One man wants to achieve that feat.</i>

12
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>His name is Bryan Johnson.</i>

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,933
<i>Bryan Johnson is determined
to live forever or die trying,</i>

14
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,103
<i>and is putting his vast fortune,
and own body,</i>

15
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>on the line to achieve it.</i>

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,986
As a species,
we accept our inevitable decay,

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,863
decline, and death.

18
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,700
I want to argue
that the opposite should be true.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,372
I walked into this because
I was marching into an early grave.

20
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,460
And now, I've built an algorithm
that takes better care of me

21
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,295
than I can myself.

22
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,674
I think this is the first time
in the history of the human race

23
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,805
that it is not known
how long and how well I can live.

24
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,227
Three, two, one, action.

25
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,980
This is the man spending millions
to become 18 years old once again,

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,524
Bryan Johnson.

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>My name is Bryan Johnson.</i>

28
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>I've been spending millions of dollars
creating an anti-aging protocol.</i>

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,906
{\an8}Two dozen supplements and medicines,
exercise an hour a day,

30
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,866
plus high intensity three times a week.

31
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,745
<i>This 45-year-old millionaire
has reversed his age by five years.</i>

32
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>His doctors claim
he has the heart of a 37-year-old.</i>

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>Using his life as a science experiment
to see just how long he can live.</i>

34
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,798
<i>AKA Project Blueprint.</i>

35
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,717
{\an8}Hi, everyone. For the past three years,
we've tried to master the basics,

36
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,885
sleep, diet, exercise.

37
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:20,056
Today, we're doing the first
next level therapy, gene therapy.

38
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,643
Oh, shut up, Bryan. Fucking Bryan.

39
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,938
{\an8}Anything taken to an extreme
can potentially be harmful to the body.

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,191
<i>I don't think I particularly want
33,000 images of my bowels.</i>

41
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,319
You've got to have a bit of fun.
- When do you go raging?

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,824
{\an8}<i>Do we really believe that he went
from being old to young? I don't.</i>

43
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,202
If I had 400 million dollars,
I wouldn't be doing what you're doing.

44
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,081
{\an8}This is not an accessible method
of reversing the effects of aging.

45
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,668
This guy's in his own fucking world.
It's not really reality.

46
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,590
If you look at all the discussions
about me, many times people will say,

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,217
"This is a rich person
trying to live forever."

48
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,053
"It's going to be so awesome
when they get hit by a bus. LOL."

49
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,348
Because these are really hard ideas
to get your head around.

50
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,686
And so, to me, the only relevant
thought experiment that each of us can do

51
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,314
is, "Do we want to live tomorrow?"

52
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,482
Most of us are going to say, "Yes."

53
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,404
If we feel healthy and well,
there's always something to do tomorrow.

54
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:21,492
And so, I want people
to embrace that day to day

55
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,328
until eventually we say,

56
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,829
"Don't die."

57
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,989
This is the gym, and it's my happy place.

58
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,452
Every morning I come in here,
and I exercise for roughly an hour.

59
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,581
I do about a 35-exercise circuit.

60
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,460
Everything we do, we measure it.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,090
So we're able to see in a closed loop way,
is it working or is it not?

62
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,133
What are you finding?

63
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,552
So, I had
a whole body MRI recently,

64
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,014
and I'm in the 99th percentile for optimal

65
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,518
for both muscle and fat
across my entire body.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,729
Have you ever been
this in shape before?

67
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,356
No, never in my life.

68
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,735
It feels good.

69
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,698
Hey, Ollie.

70
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>Hello.</i>

71
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,328
Ollie, we'll do the blood draw real quick.

72
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,496
<i>Let's do it.</i>

73
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,335
Dr. Oliver Zolman and I
were connected by a friend.

74
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,796
{\an8}Oliver had spent his entire adult life

75
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,966
scouring the literature
on anti-aging science.

76
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,554
When Bryan first reached out,
he seemed a bit lost.

77
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:11,102
Whatever he was doing didn't really seem
like it was working optimally for him.

78
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,106
So I showed him my longevity level one,
two, three protocol.

79
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,152
Level one is doing
the basic stuff, diet, exercise.

80
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,697
And then each layer you go up,
it gets more sophisticated.

81
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,784
His approach was,
in order to understand human aging,

82
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,995
you needed to look at the organ level,

83
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,165
because the heart is going
to age differently than the lungs,

84
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,417
and the lungs differently than the kidney.

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,254
Previously, I would use my mind
to decide what to eat.

86
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,341
So, at the grocery store, walking down
the aisles, looking at this thing,

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,384
and that thing, and put it in the cart.

88
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,553
Zolman flipped that on its head and said,

89
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,348
"What if I asked my organs
to speak for themselves?"

90
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
What if the heart, and the liver,

91
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,685
and the lungs
could actually speak what they need?

92
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,565
And then my responsibility is to do
exactly what the body tells me to do.

93
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,694
Blueprint is Bryan doing
this level one, two, three protocol

94
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,780
to the most that it's ever been done.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,241
He's been the best guinea pig
anyone could ask for.

96
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,872
It's probably over
a hundred different things I do

97
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,377
any given day that the body
has asked for to be in its ideal state.

98
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,629
And that begins with
in the morning I wake up,

99
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,050
{\an8}I turn a specific light on in my bathroom
that gives me sun-like exposure.

100
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,885
{\an8}I take three pills.

101
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,513
{\an8}I do my body temperature
with an inner ear measurement,

102
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,932
go downstairs, start HRV therapy.

103
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,476
So, I put a little electrode
here in my ear.

104
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,895
It stimulates my autonomic nervous system,

105
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,023
trying to make my body
more parasympathetic, more chill.

106
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,443
I take 54 pills

107
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,154
with a concoction
that I call "the green giant."

108
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:50,535
I put a cap on my head for hair growth
that has 312 laser diodes.

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,580
Then I work out for an hour,
come in, eat a few pounds of vegetables.

110
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,292
I do some high-frequency electromagnetic
stimulation on my abdomen.

111
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:02,547
I do 12 minutes of near and red-light
therapy to accelerate healing.

112
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,800
I do audio therapy
for my hearing regeneration.

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,095
I have my last meals to eat
before 11:00 a.m.,

114
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,514
{\an8}34 more pills to take.

115
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,308
{\an8}There's protocols
throughout the day here and there.

116
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,519
And then my nighttime routine.

117
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,565
By doing Blueprint,
one of the key objectives

118
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,527
{\an8}is to achieve
the lowest possible biological age.

119
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,655
So just like a tree has rings,

120
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,450
we all have a signature
inside of our body of our age.

121
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,579
After doing Blueprint now for two years,

122
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,915
I've reversed my biological age 5.1 years.

123
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,502
I have 50 perfect biomarkers,

124
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,297
I have 100 biomarkers where I'm less
than my chronological age.

125
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,342
And my speed of aging is 0.69,

126
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,472
which means for every 12 months,
I age eight months.

127
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,394
In terms of how far this goes,
it's open-ended, uh, we have no idea.

128
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:04,275
But I wanna take my speed of aging
to the lowest possible number.

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,742
Step back a little bit.

130
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,160
Yeah.

131
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,205
And then
a little bit closer to the bed. Mm.

132
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,539
Yeah. Great.

133
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,793
And then you can just literally
rattle everything off.

134
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,711
Okay.

135
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,715
So, today is a very exciting day for me
because for the very first time ever,

136
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,259
after tracking my sleep for four years,

137
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,471
I achieved my first perfect month.

138
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,100
<i>So I have an average of 100%
sleep performance for 30 days.</i>

139
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,811
<i>I go to bed at 8:30 p.m.</i>

140
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,357
<i>I've averaged eight hours
and 34 minutes of sleep every night.</i>

141
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,942
<i>The body loves routine.</i>

142
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,278
So, go to bed at the exact same time
every night, no excuses.

143
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,822
Sleep is not something
that can be dismissed.

144
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:56,619
So hopefully these tips help you, that you
can start inching towards better sleep.

145
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,663
It will change everything in your life.

146
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,250
Wonderful. Okay. Good.

147
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,835
Kate, what's your role in this?

148
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,004
I don't even know how to describe it.

149
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,298
Take a stab.

150
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,134
Um...

151
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,471
I just am... I am here on the mission,

152
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,225
trying to make whatever needs to happen
happen in order to get there.

153
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,685
That's my role.

154
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,521
Kate has been with me
from the very beginning

155
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,565
- of Blueprint, yeah.
Of Blueprint?

156
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,775
How do you feel? Are you converted?

157
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,152
When I first started,
I was eating McDonald's.

158
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,072
So... philosophically converted.

159
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,494
When I first met Bryan,
I was not healthy.

160
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,206
And we started talking
about the philosophy of Blueprint.

161
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,709
And all of a sudden,
I was, like, "Okay."

162
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,628
{\an8}When I laugh about not being fit

163
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,214
{\an8}and not being able to exercise,
that kind of stuff,

164
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,593
I'm kind of laughing
in the face of my future self.

165
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
Like, I don't wanna be that person,
you know, when I'm 60

166
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,932
and I'm unable to run around or... yeah.

167
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,853
So, it was a huge wake-up call for me.

168
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,524
Now, here I am, like,
the other person behind this mission.

169
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,486
I mean, like, you could beef it up
by saying, like,

170
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,739
"Every morning,
I do the same four-hour routine."

171
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,574
"And this is what starts it off."

172
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,533
That's good.

173
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,452
When we first
started working together,

174
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,581
Bryan asked me to develop
the communication side of things.

175
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,377
His big ambition was to get Blueprint
out to the people

176
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,922
so that we can all learn
from what Blueprint is up to.

177
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,593
But it was like hitting our head
against the wall for a while

178
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,055
'cause it was just a bit
of an empty void on the Internet.

179
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,725
And then one day, I had this idea.

180
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,188
What if we published
all of his biometric data online

181
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,608
and made it a thing that people
could witness and watch?

182
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,195
The protocols, the measurements,
the recipes, the supplements,

183
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,072
we published it all on my website.

184
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,950
And this journalist I knew, Ashlee Vance,
saw this and expressed an interest

185
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,952
in doing a profile on Blueprint.

186
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,830
Bryan put
all of his stuff online.

187
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:10,002
{\an8}I was like, "This guy's somewhere
between off and, like, very interesting."

188
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,674
I went to visit him at his house
with his own home laboratory.

189
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,217
And we just kinda started talking.

190
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,720
When doctors
visit our clinic here,

191
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,306
they get pretty excited
because we have outfitted this

192
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:27,853
so that we can be a medical-grade,
uh, operation at every level.

193
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,939
I started asking him questions.

194
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,150
He's, like, "Okay, I spent
2.5 million dollars on all this stuff."

195
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,114
This was not a professional athlete who
was spending this much money on his body.

196
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,157
It was just this random tech guy.

197
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:44,078
It's just, you know, absolutely going
further than what anyone else had done.

198
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,915
And so that's when I really knew
this actually was a story.

199
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,876
I remember the day before
the article came out,

200
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,462
Kate and I were in my office,

201
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,967
and we both had this moment of crisis.

202
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,053
Like, "Oh no. Like, what have we done?"

203
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,016
One man,
he spent two million dollars

204
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,144
to effectively reboot his body.

205
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,855
{\an8}- Millionaire entrepreneur Bryan Johnson.
- Bryan Johnson.

206
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,856
Bryan Johnson.

207
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,859
{\an8}Bryan Johnson
is on a quest to live longer.

208
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:19,655
All of a sudden, every spotlight
was turned on Bryan and the project.

209
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,033
And everything we worked on
was under intense scrutiny.

210
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,454
I think his rectum went viral,
his rectal biological age.

211
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,914
There was so much online,

212
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,877
videos people were making,
and it's just kind of a blur.

213
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,879
We were inundated with interest.

214
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,133
Every single product that we published
on the Blueprint website

215
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,926
was sold out within days.

216
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,512
Nobody could get anything that we use.

217
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,557
We couldn't either. We had suppliers
calling, saying, "What is going on?"

218
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,395
It also unlocked
a colossal amount of hate.

219
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,314
{\an8}I would say he doesn't look that healthy.

220
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,150
{\an8}There's something super weird
about looking young forever.

221
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,404
He takes like 40 vitamins in the morning
and 40 more in the afternoon.

222
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,656
That seems tedious.

223
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,742
{\an8}I know.
It's like, I'd rather just die sooner.

224
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,077
{\an8}And the irony of this specifically is,

225
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,456
{\an8}you're seeking more time
when you're not even living the time

226
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,416
{\an8}- you've been given.
Yes.

227
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,503
{\an8}- And I find this so vapid and stupid.

228
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,422
I think for most people,

229
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,092
the longevity field has always
been looked at skeptically.

230
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:26,347
It's just these rich Silicon Valley types
chasing the fountain of youth.

231
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,809
Jeff Bezos threw more money
behind an obsession

232
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,977
to become among the billionaires

233
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,272
on a quest to defeat aging.

234
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,693
- Space, Internet, and now live forever.
- Yeah, they're trying... Jeez.

235
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,072
It's, like,
seen as strange and fringe.

236
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,285
It just so happens
it is a real field of science.

237
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:52,164
There are proper doctors
and scientists that look at this.

238
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,752
We're used to watching
our friends, relatives, and pets

239
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,753
age and die.

240
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,506
We think it's somehow natural
and, therefore, somehow good.

241
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,093
But I describe aging as our greatest
humanitarian challenge.

242
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,555
{\an8}Aging causes cancer.
Aging causes heart disease.

243
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,057
{\an8}Aging causes dementia.
Aging causes stroke.

244
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,643
{\an8}It makes us more susceptible
to infections, more frail.

245
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,355
And actually, if you look at causes
of death across the world today,

246
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,526
the leading killers are these diseases
like cancer, dementia, and heart disease.

247
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,989
{\an8}I think the real promise of this field
is that we have the opportunity,

248
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,577
{\an8}by targeting the biology of aging,
to delay or prevent many,

249
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,539
maybe all, of the functional declines
and diseases that go along with old age.

250
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,748
And that's huge.

251
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,626
{\an8}We're still, I would say,
at an early stage.

252
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,420
{\an8}But there's been breakthroughs.

253
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,464
{\an8}There's already a number of interventions,

254
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,550
including drugs, uh, and diets,

255
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,928
that in animal models
slow down the process of aging.

256
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,139
We have robust evidence

257
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,474
that we can extend
the lifespan of a mouse.

258
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,394
{\an8}So if you're a mouse,
we've got you covered.

259
00:14:55,394 --> 00:15:00,774
{\an8}But what that also means is that we have
a lot of things to test in humans.

260
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,526
Testing Tuesday.

261
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,236
- Good morning.
Let's get started.

262
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,907
We are experimenting,
and we are trialing out,

263
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,244
{\an8}and I think we will have a revolution
in the next coming ten years

264
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,290
{\an8}of very specific interventions
we can apply to humans

265
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,084
to then lower the biological age.

266
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,420
You could get within four millimeters.

267
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,548
- That's a lot better.
- I know, that's really great.

268
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,801
I'm benefiting from decades of progress

269
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,512
that people have made
in the world of anti-aging science.

270
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,808
And the scientific interventions
are moving forward very fast.

271
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,478
And so it has a tangible sense
of "it's here."

272
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,356
And I want people to know about it.

273
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,527
I think we light him up.
Okay.

274
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,780
I think a little more.

275
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,617
Yeah. I think I just need
a little bit of an angle

276
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,495
with your whole legs
and everything, if you can.

277
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,164
- Yeah. So we're gonna do another test.
Mm-hm.

278
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,293
Wow, that's so striking.

279
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,922
Hopefully it captures
the new zeitgeist that we're after.

280
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:09,802
Yeah, I think, um, everything looks good.
I'll just go to different heights.

281
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,848
Chin up a little bit. Yeah.

282
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,308
My poor son.

283
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,645
He comes home, and he never knows
what's gonna be happening here.

284
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,146
That's great.

285
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,275
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

286
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,407
Ahh!

287
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,741
How's Bryan as a dad?

288
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,743
- He's a pretty good dad. Yeah.

289
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:40,332
When his mother and I split,
he was with her for the past couple years.

290
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,002
{\an8}Then he decided to move across the country

291
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,045
and live with me for his senior year.

292
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,505
Ah, good job.

293
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,009
Talmage found his stride.
He's been smoking me.

294
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,094
What's your take on Blueprint?

295
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,097
When the article came out, everyone's
like, "Oh! Isn't that your dad?"

296
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,685
So I got, like, so many texts from friends
and people at school asking me about it.

297
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,937
Worth it.

298
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,441
Did people think it was cool,
or did they think you guys were weirdos?

299
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,067
- Both. Yeah.

300
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,945
Even though I've been
at my school for months,

301
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,656
people are still asking me
questions every day about it.

302
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,491
Oh no!

303
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,037
- You played so well.
- That was a good rally. That was good.

304
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,416
I've been around Bryan
since before Talmage was here.

305
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,669
I remember thinking, "How is Bryan
gonna get used to having Talmage around,

306
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,963
like, another human being
in his space every day?"

307
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,050
'Cause he's such a private,
introverted individual.

308
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,718
Um, but now, it's, like,

309
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,263
he's completely restructured
his life around Talmage being here.

310
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,685
Today is an exciting day because...

311
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,688
- How many schools did you apply to?
Fifteen.

312
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,483
How many schools
have rendered their decisions?

313
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,903
- Twelve. Not including today.
- Yeah.

314
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,488
- These are...
- So this is the last.

315
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,116
Now you're gonna have all the
information you need to make a decision

316
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,869
on what college you're gonna go to.

317
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,621
And then you're gonna leave me

318
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,956
in five months.

319
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,293
Yes.

320
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,298
I only have
150 days left with Talmage,

321
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,217
which makes me incredibly sad.

322
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,472
We should get going.
We're gonna be late.

323
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,974
There is just never enough time.

324
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,644
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

325
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,396
Thank you so much for opening your house
and showing us everything.

326
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,606
- Next challenge.
- Let's go.

327
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
- Whoa!

328
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,692
You're vegan.
- I'm vegan by choice.

329
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,028
Talmage and I eat
the exact same thing every day.

330
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,074
Every day. I've been working on splits.
We'll go do splits as we eat breakfast.

331
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,117
Okay.

332
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,995
I think if you really wanna live
the Bryan Johnson lifestyle,

333
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,164
the commitment to that is obscene.

334
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,626
I do 2,000 calories a day.
- Are you ever hungry?

335
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,044
- I'm pretty hungry.
- Okay.

336
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,672
The saddest part of my day
is the last bite.

337
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:56,510
Your entire day
revolves around this quite solitary,

338
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,762
very rigid kind of lifestyle.

339
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,598
Wait, wait, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan.
You can't see sunlight.

340
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,517
Do you go in the sun?

341
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,311
The UV index
is well below dangerous levels.

342
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,396
So we're good to go.

343
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,983
It seems sort of, like, depressing,
and what kind of life are you leading

344
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,569
if you're just giving yourself up to this?

345
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,783
<i>It's interesting because
you have this extra level of discipline.</i>

346
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:24,621
<i>But we know, for instance, about
cigarettes, that people who smoke a lot,</i>

347
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>like, if they smoke
three packs a day, on average,</i>

348
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>you'll live 11 years less
than people who don't smoke.</i>

349
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,463
So what you're saying
is almost, like, an advanced version.

350
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,466
Like, if I cut out smoking,
I'll live 11 years more than average.

351
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:40,762
If I cut out drinking, I'll live five
years more than average, and on and on.

352
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,432
Yet, people know this about smoking,
and they still smoke.

353
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,643
Mm-hm. Yeah. You're exactly right.

354
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:52,107
Our minds, which we think
are our primary tool of problem-solving,

355
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:57,029
is actually the source
of our self-destructive behaviors.

356
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,991
So, I would argue the mind is dead.

357
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,620
{\an8}What the fuck? Sorry. "The mind is dead"?

358
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,207
{\an8}And the goal is to give complete control
of your well-being over to an algorithm?

359
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,292
You know who says stuff like that?
Algorithms.

360
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,378
The first reaction
most people have is panic.

361
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,173
Like, "Well, my free will
is the only reason I exist."

362
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,259
"If I can't eat what I wanna eat,
then I have no reason to exist."

363
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,386
- It tastes like nutrition.
Yeah.

364
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,555
That's just a knee-jerk reaction.

365
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,601
It's the mind panicking because it feels
like its authority is in question.

366
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,603
- Ready?
- Ready.

367
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,690
The conscious mind is desperate
to hold on to power.

368
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,653
The catch is we can't trust our minds

369
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,782
because the way we've structured
society right now is insane.

370
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,495
<i>Every day, we eat millions
of burgers, pizzas, and French fries.</i>

371
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,915
<i>Now scientists say
we may not only be feeding ourselves,</i>

372
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,042
<i>we may be feeding an addiction.</i>

373
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:58,298
We expect people on their way
to work to pass 20 fast food places,

374
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,176
20 places selling sugary drinks.

375
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,346
We ask them to navigate
the addictiveness of social media,

376
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,181
the world's most powerful algorithms,

377
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,850
trying to get them to spend
every waking second on the algorithm...

378
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,768
<i>What?</i>

379
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,771
...navigate alcohol,
and the smoking, and binge-watching,

380
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,482
and porn,
and every other form of addiction.

381
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,735
And then we look at the individual,
and say, "Why aren't we happier?"

382
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,658
We have lost touch
with basic self-care.

383
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,911
We're inebriated. We can't see straight.

384
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,957
Even though we know
that eating the wrong kinds of foods,

385
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,543
or drinking, or smoking,
or not prioritizing sleep

386
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,796
accelerates aging, disability, even death,

387
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,339
we can't stop.

388
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,970
We're in a fight for our lives...
with ourselves.

389
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:58,900
I have found more relief
in demoting my mind

390
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,945
and elevating my body
than I have in my entire life.

391
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,741
It feels so liberating to me,

392
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:11,955
because, my entire life,
I was desperate to be free from myself.

393
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,049
From when he was young,
Bryan was a problem solver.

394
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:30,098
{\an8}When he was in junior high, he knew
that we didn't have very much money.

395
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,019
{\an8}And so there's times
like when Bryan would not eat lunch

396
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,396
and contribute his lunch money.

397
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,649
He was always coming up
with something to help the family.

398
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,527
I remember
at some point,

399
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,155
Bryan took a job at a sandwich shop.

400
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,865
But that was short-lived.

401
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,410
{\an8}Bryan said that he would
never work for anybody ever again.

402
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,538
{\an8}You know, that kind of,
"I'm gonna do it by myself."

403
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,209
- Bryan, you're a lifelong entrepreneur?
- I am.

404
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,503
What do you learn more from,
the success or the failures?

405
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,131
I never dwelled on failure.
It didn't discourage me...

406
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,134
In the beginning,
my entrepreneurial adventures

407
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,886
had little to zero success.

408
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,723
I had a baby. I couldn't pay the bills.

409
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,850
So I took the only job I could find,

410
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,353
which was selling credit card processing
door-to-door.

411
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,023
This experience got me interested
in the world of payments.

412
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,734
So I started poking around
and I saw that PayPal

413
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,488
was the dominant payment provider
that had grown up during the Internet.

414
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,659
But then once eBay had acquired them,
the development had discontinued.

415
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,330
So I started Braintree with the idea
of building modern software.

416
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,543
He had this little, tiny office.
He was working on a card table.

417
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,461
Please don't do that.
No. Please don't do that.

418
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,422
I... I don't know when he got a desk.

419
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,549
I didn't take any outside capital.

420
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,718
We were one of the fastest
growing companies in America twice.

421
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,512
We acquired Venmo in year five,

422
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,391
and we became part of
the global payments infrastructure.

423
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:59,563
All right, everybody,
let's give it up for Bryan Johnson!

424
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,233
It was so exciting.

425
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,360
So I don't think that I realized

426
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,029
that there was also that other side
that was haunting him.

427
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,992
I couldn't believe how much effort
people put into building the company.

428
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,201
It was amazing.

429
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,954
Um, staying there all night,
multiple nights in a row...

430
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,208
When I was building Braintree Venmo,
I was just grinding myself into the grave.

431
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,881
It was a social norm that an entrepreneur
would go days without sleeping.

432
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,467
And if you told that story,
people would be in awe.

433
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,887
There would be mythology about you,
like, "Amazing that they did this."

434
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,514
Now, I view this as totally foolish.

435
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,976
I would wake up the next day,
ornery and not feeling restored.

436
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,312
And then having to muster up
the strength to walk in

437
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,689
and be, like, "All right, everybody,
we're gonna work hard."

438
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,526
"And we're gonna solve all these burning
problems that are going on."

439
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,904
I was stressed out of my mind.

440
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,451
<i>Careful. Careful.</i>
<i>Careful, guys.</i>

441
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,287
<i>Careful. I'm turning this off.</i>
<i>Stop it!</i>

442
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,956
Coming home at night
and dealing with three kids,

443
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,667
I'd be exhausted and unpleasant.

444
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,962
After a guaranteed fight with the partner,

445
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:10,133
I would turn to unhealthy food
as my soothing mechanism.

446
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,176
<i>Pure sugar.</i>

447
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,472
Of course, that made things worse,
because my sleep would then suffer.

448
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,682
It would just compound upon itself.

449
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,975
I was miserable.

450
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,979
I remember one particular visit.

451
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,357
He didn't say too much.

452
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,442
But, at the end,

453
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,239
I could tell that he...
it was a really difficult time for him.

454
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,741
And when he left,
I cried.

455
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,620
Had you ever seen him that way?

456
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,748
Mm-mm. And I didn't know until then.

457
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,760
Sundays were my hardest days,
because I would go to church.

458
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,597
And everything about being there
made me dissolve.

459
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,978
Growing up in the Mormon church,
my entire family was there,

460
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,813
my entire community was there,

461
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,148
and it gave me
all the answers to existence.

462
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,194
It had stories about
what existed before this life,

463
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,739
why we are here on this earth,
what's after life,

464
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,702
but with the intensity
of what life was delivering up,

465
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,998
I felt like those answers,
the only reality I knew,

466
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,708
didn't make sense anymore.

467
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,295
I was kind of just dropped
into this nothingness.

468
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,550
I remember discussions with him
where he was having real problems

469
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,176
with the religion.

470
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:40,265
Not just like some kind
of philosophical dispute.

471
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,059
These were things
that were so integrated into him,

472
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,103
he was having physical symptoms.

473
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,524
I would come home from church.
I would lay on my bed.

474
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,693
My son, at the time,
who was seven years old,

475
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,780
he would sense something was wrong,
and he came up, and he would rub my back.

476
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,992
And I was not able to even move.

477
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,414
And the only thought that would soothe me

478
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,208
was the idea
of doing a deal with the devil

479
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,794
and ceasing to exist.

480
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,007
I didn't want an afterlife.
I didn't want this life.

481
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,260
I didn't want consciousness at all.

482
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,273
What changed?

483
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,945
My mind was like a vicious storm
telling me to literally kill myself.

484
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,409
And it became clear to me that the mind
is not a reliable source of judgement.

485
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,412
I needed a different way of being.

486
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,502
It took me several years
to rebuild myself.

487
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,631
In that time,
I sold my company, Braintree Venmo,

488
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,258
I got a divorce,
I left my born-into religion.

489
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:03,139
And, ultimately, I found strength
and liberation in doing Blueprint.

490
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:10,230
When I give my body authority, it doesn't
commit this self-destructive harm.

491
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,484
My heart doesn't deliver
these stinging insults.

492
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,445
My lungs don't do it either.
My kidney doesn't either.

493
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,866
Removing my mind has been
the best thing I've ever done in my life.

494
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:28,331
But leaving the church
fractured my life with my family.

495
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,211
When Bryan decided
to leave the church,

496
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,255
it was very heartbreaking for me.

497
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,424
And I...

498
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,261
I had to go through a process of...

499
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,723
thinking about the person he is

500
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,059
and thinking about
what he's doing with his life

501
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,562
to find peace.

502
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,858
Family is a fundamental teaching
of Mormonism.

503
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,779
And when my dad left the religion, it felt
like it was violating that teaching

504
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,949
and that we couldn't be a family anymore.

505
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,327
So I definitely, as an eight-year-old,

506
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,205
I viewed him as losing his path.

507
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,263
Yeah, this book.

508
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,974
Oh man.

509
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:32,729
I went to a... a church camp
last summer before I came out here.

510
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,649
And we had these booklets
to take notes in.

511
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,529
And while everyone else was taking notes
about, you know, feeling the spirit,

512
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,742
like, feeling, like, feeling good,
the community, scripture,

513
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,494
I was taking notes about...

514
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,622
trying to decipher everything.

515
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,919
I felt like I was in this system
and I was trying to take it apart.

516
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,049
Prior to moving to California,
I was in Mormonism.

517
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,094
But ever since I was young,
it had never really been my thing.

518
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,473
And no one in there saw me,

519
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,684
or saw the situation I was in,
I couldn't talk to anyone.

520
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:16,815
Over the years, me and my siblings
would visit my dad periodically.

521
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,942
And I started to let my dad in a bit.

522
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,862
Talmage started inquiring me of certain
things, "What about this? That?"

523
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,865
And we established
this rapport with each other

524
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,576
where we were able
to have these honest dialogues.

525
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,038
He just saw me so clearly.
He knew the situation I was in.

526
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,457
It was wild, because when I would talk,

527
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,376
he would then
articulate what I was thinking.

528
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,461
And I slowly came to the realization

529
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,423
that I wanted to get out of the religion
in any way possible.

530
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,635
After multiple attempts,

531
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,263
I eventually managed to come out here

532
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,182
and spend my last year
of high school with him.

533
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,936
I know a lot of my friends,
or people in general,

534
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,438
feel like their parents
misunderstand them.

535
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,773
Mmm.

536
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,943
And it takes some experience
to unify them.

537
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,656
So it kind of makes sense with us...
took leaving the church.

538
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,368
- And now with that shared experience...
- Mmm.

539
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,621
- ...we can connect on so many deeper levels.
- Mm-hm.

540
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,040
Me and my dad,

541
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,418
we have the best thing going on.

542
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,839
But no one agreed with it.

543
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,174
I can't think
of a single person who was like,

544
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,427
"Talmage, you should do that.
That'll be good for you."

545
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,722
It was like coming to live with Satan.

546
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,522
Should we do this?
Let's do it.

547
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,816
I increased my weight on my curls.

548
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,901
I noticed.

549
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,281
- How's my hip on this, Dad?
Let's see.

550
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,995
You can... I'm impressed
you can do that after that many.

551
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,874
Wow.

552
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,501
That's art.

553
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,213
I wish I had Talmage's legs.

554
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,967
He's kind of the perfect specimen.

555
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,598
But you've heard
that Bryan wants to become Talmage?

556
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:19,020
{\an8}Yeah, so... yeah, it's important
not to over rejuvenate,

557
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,731
{\an8}because there could be side effects.

558
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,316
Have you told that to Bryan?

559
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,652
Oh yeah, we discussed this at length.

560
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
...in the mirror.

561
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,574
Up until this point, we've been
doing things people are familiar with,

562
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,743
diet, and exercise, and sleep.

563
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,622
And it's almost like,
"Okay, what's the next level?"

564
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,503
We looked at every healthspan
and lifespan study that's ever been done,

565
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:48,341
whether it be on humans or mice, and then
ranked them according to their efficacy,

566
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,551
their ability to extend life.

567
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,972
And now we're trying to figure out
how to do them.

568
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,475
We started a human growth hormone.

569
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,604
Then so you stab this in the leg
and then you press it.

570
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,440
Some of these therapies
can be very dangerous.

571
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,443
And it's a little, teeny needle.
You can see that.

572
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:11,364
But we err on the side of,
you know, extreme caution.

573
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,326
We're doing high-frequency
measurements across the whole body.

574
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,496
So if we do start seeing side effects,
we pick them up fast

575
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,415
and try some other therapy.

576
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,211
- How many pills do you take a day?
- Today, it'll be 130.

577
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,716
- What's yours?
- Twenty-six.

578
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,220
We know that it's unrealistic
for a normal person to do this

579
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,514
wildly rigorous routine.

580
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,934
But I think what Bryan is trying to do

581
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,520
as the first prototype for Blueprint

582
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,857
is do the absolute extreme thing.

583
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,111
I absolutely acknowledge
that not everyone has the time,

584
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,197
and the resources,
and the life circumstances that can do it.

585
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,201
I'm trying to be
on the absolute outermost edge

586
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,203
of possibility for the science.

587
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,122
I'm trying to show what's possible.

588
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,460
It's pretty safe so far,
and maybe it'll work,

589
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,422
and maybe we can learn something from it,
and then take that out,

590
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,633
and everyone else can benefit
sooner rather than later.

591
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,681
Today is rapamycin day.

592
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,267
So rapamycin is a drug that people use

593
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,021
to suppress the immune system
when they're getting an organ transplant.

594
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,439
You get a new organ in the body,

595
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,900
you don't want
the immune system to reject it,

596
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,737
and so you take rapamycin
and it suppresses the immune system.

597
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,491
I take this because there's potentially
some longevity benefits.

598
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,203
It's the kind of thing in the longevity
community that people are excited about.

599
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,830
Outside the longevity community,
it's still kind of crazy.

600
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,542
Like, if you're, like,
"Yeah, I take an immune-suppressing drug,"

601
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,003
people are, "That's wacky.
Why would you ever do that?"

602
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,299
Rapamycin was a drug
that was first discovered

603
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,135
in soil bacteria
that were isolated on Easter Island.

604
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,304
But what happened in 2009

605
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:02,391
{\an8}was that a really rigorous study in mice
found that it can extend lifespan.

606
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,854
And it didn't just keep them alive longer,
it kept them healthier for longer as well.

607
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,898
And this has been demonstrated
in study after study

608
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,526
in loads of different conditions
in loads of different labs.

609
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,653
The only thing we're lacking
is human data.

610
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,492
{\an8}Honestly, I think rapamycin is probably
still the most robust candidate

611
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,661
{\an8}for something
that would affect human longevity.

612
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,788
{\an8}But they have to be used with caution

613
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,499
{\an8}because you can have bad things happen
when you take too much.

614
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,919
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13. 13.

615
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,380
Because it suppresses
the immune system role,

616
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,675
side effects can include
very dangerous bacterial infections.

617
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:39,387
Things like pneumonia,
or cellulitis, or pharyngitis.

618
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,724
To avoid negative effects,
we took a dosage

619
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,726
and measured the levels in my blood.

620
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:50,189
Two hours after taking the dose,
24, 48, 72, 96.

621
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,567
You can see if you get too high
or too low levels,

622
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,944
then adjust the dose based on that.

623
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,573
You know, with this precise
formulation, as far as we know,

624
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:03,536
we are on the most aggressive rapamycin
protocol of anyone in the industry.

625
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,208
Do you follow Bryan Johnson?
- I've met him before. Mm-hm.

626
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,335
What's your take
on what he's doing?

627
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,713
Uh...

628
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,763
Some of the interventions that he takes,
like rapamycin, they work in mice.

629
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,266
We don't know
if they would work in humans.

630
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,769
We need to have
properly designed experiments,

631
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,063
then we could make scientific conclusions.

632
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:34,442
But what Bryan's doing,
it's not a scientific approach.

633
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,070
This is the supplement,
uh, warehouse.

634
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,657
He's taking hundreds
of different interventions.

635
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:45,661
That means it's very hard to identify
which, if any, of them are working.

636
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,705
What you really need to do
is a clinical trial

637
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,082
where you get thousands of people,
not just one,

638
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,211
and you give them all the same
intervention at the same dose.

639
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:58,174
I think there's value
in these individual N-of-1 experiments

640
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,719
where people are testing
different things on themselves,

641
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,057
{\an8}but it's never going to be accepted
by the broader medical community

642
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,601
{\an8}or regulatory, um, agencies.

643
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,855
We need the more rigorous clinical trials.

644
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,274
Bryan blocked me on Twitter
because I suggested

645
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,527
that he used some of his millions
of pounds to fund a clinical trial,

646
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,571
specifically the TAME trial,

647
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,158
which wants to find out if metformin
is actually an anti-aging drug.

648
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:28,079
Bryan takes metformin, so if he wants
to know if what he's doing is of any use,

649
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,333
it'll be of value to him and the longevity
community to fund this trial.

650
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,128
But I'd guess he didn't like me telling
him how to spend his money.

651
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,005
{\an8}- Whoa!

652
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,924
That's really good!

653
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,010
What Bryan does,
I guess, brings attention to our field.

654
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,140
This would be positive, but it has
almost no contribution to science, right?

655
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,601
It's not science, it's just attention.

656
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,104
So, yeah, we're gonna be filming
some shorts.

657
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,356
We've been playing around with doing that.

658
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,192
So we're upping our social media game.

659
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,028
Yeah, we had our first victories.

660
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,532
The past two weeks, we had two
of our videos get a few million views.

661
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,534
Three, just on Instagram.

662
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,828
And one on TikTok is approaching.

663
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,290
{\an8}I get messages all the time, like, "Can I
get connected with your PR firm?"

664
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,417
-"Well, you're talking to it."

665
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,544
Like, "There's two of us."

666
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,379
- Come on, Bry guy!
I appreciate this.

667
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,714
- Let's go.

668
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,299
Is that all you got?

669
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,592
{\an8}<i>-I think you just aged a little bit.</i>

670
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,970
YouTube sent us a box.

671
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,808
"Presented to Bryan Johnson
for passing 100,000 subscribers."

672
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,147
A lot of people are clearly
very interested in anti-aging.

673
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,984
We're all aging. We'd probably like to
know how to slow it down at least a bit.

674
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,154
Bryan Johnson, if you look
at the media that he's doing himself,

675
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,781
he's clearly intending to reach
as many people as possible.

676
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,702
The real question is,
what's his motivation?

677
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,580
Today I'm going to show you
about this device I use

678
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,625
to do the equivalent
of 20,000 sit-ups in 30 minutes.

679
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,881
You sound like an infomercial.
- I was going to say, "Something's wrong."

680
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,593
If you buy right now,
the button lower right, $19.99,

681
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,012
four easy installments, free shipping.

682
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,390
Bryan Johnson
is going to die one day.

683
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,976
{\an8}Furthermore, it is my personal opinion

684
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:18,189
{\an8}that Bryan Johnson is a grifter who,
regardless of whether or not

685
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,691
{\an8}he actually believes
he's going to live forever,

686
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,861
is absolutely trying to make a quick buck

687
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,324
off of people who are terrified
of the idea of death

688
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,827
and who have more money than common sense.

689
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,289
{\an8}Okay, I got something special today.

690
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,457
What is this?

691
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,544
This is the very first
Blueprint product we have.

692
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:47,301
Bryan Johnson's Blueprint
ultra-premium extra virgin olive oil.

693
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:51,013
This is the oldest trick in the book
as far as self-help scams

694
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,265
and just plain old marketing go.

695
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:57,686
You convince people of the problem
and then sell them the solution.

696
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,773
Scene 1A, take one, A roll.

697
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,361
"Get me on your anti-aging routine
and do it fast, but make it simple."

698
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,697
That's the most common thing I hear.
How's that?

699
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,202
I think that Blueprint
is a commercial enterprise.

700
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,120
In his website,

701
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,664
every link on that Blueprint page
is an Amazon affiliate link.

702
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,334
If you click on it and buy something
on Amazon, he gets a cut of the money.

703
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,712
This whole thing I think has been
optimized as a money-making venture.

704
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,048
He's very rich,
a very talented businessman.

705
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,008
That's gonna be the way
that he looks at things.

706
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,510
<i>Smells like olive oil.</i>

707
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>I would say very similar
to most olive oils.</i>

708
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,682
A lot of the hate
we get at Blueprint is interesting

709
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,144
in that I make products available
for people to also become healthy

710
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,230
and make the life changes they want to do,
and people hate on me.

711
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,606
<i>Tastes like shit.</i>

712
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,318
I see some people on Twitter
giving him a really hard time

713
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,195
for all the merchandise.

714
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,990
{\an8}I've followed him for years,

715
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,203
{\an8}and I'm 100% convinced
this was not, like, the master plan.

716
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,791
{\an8}I remember he was trying
to do Blueprint for a couple of years,

717
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,960
{\an8}and it was this very personal quest.

718
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,713
That's a lot of volume.
Seven of these today.

719
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,466
He turned to this hardcore
health regimen

720
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,760
as the solution
to these mental health problems.

721
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,472
Yeah, I think he believes
in what he's doing.

722
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,681
It's a huge difference.

723
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,726
I imagine this is, like, emotional
for you in a sense that, like,

724
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,353
it sounds like you weren't completely
happy with your past self.

725
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,688
No.

726
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,981
Uh...

727
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,442
I feel like that person's gone.

728
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,955
Should I do this in portrait mode or...

729
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,586
You should probably get better lighting.
I have an idea.

730
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,298
Oh, I think that looks good.
- Mm.

731
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,299
Cool idea.

732
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,636
The morning rituals
that Talmage and I have together,

733
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,513
it's a big part of our lives.

734
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,805
Let's see. What do you think?

735
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,351
But soon, Talmage will be
doing this in his dorm in Chicago,

736
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,228
and I will be here by myself.

737
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,730
How do you feel
about that, Talmage?

738
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,483
Talmage is not looking at this
from fear of loss.

739
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,194
Talmage is looking at this
from an opportunity of gain,

740
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,779
and particularly a girlfriend.

741
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,989
- Potentially.

742
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,329
Can I take my pills?

743
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,330
Yes.

744
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,214
I remember
when I was going to college as well,

745
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:34,760
loss of anything in my family environment
was not even on my radar.

746
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,055
It was entirely about
all the new life experiences.

747
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,224
Yeah, I'm excited.

748
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,102
- I do view it as an opportunity for gain.

749
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,397
But there is loss too.

750
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,856
Yeah.

751
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,193
Going through this experience,

752
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,029
I guess it invites me
to have a lot more empathy for my parents

753
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,740
and what they may be going through,
like my dad.

754
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,701
If you think about him and age,

755
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,788
he said the other day he googled
what happens when you turn 70

756
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:07,209
or when you're over 70, and he said,
jokingly, "Don't do it."

757
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:11,463
Like, every morning you wake up,
and it's, like, "How am I doing?"

758
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,925
"Is there one more thing
that's broken or that hurts more?"

759
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,344
Like, I wonder what that must feel like.

760
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,274
I've always been a mental guy.

761
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,362
{\an8}I've always thought that I could honestly
think about ten things at the same time.

762
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:40,242
{\an8}But I got to the point
where I would write a paragraph

763
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,328
{\an8}that didn't make sense.

764
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,079
{\an8}That scares me to death.

765
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,499
One day
my father called panicking.

766
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:52,588
He said, "I would do anything
to continue with my mental acuity."

767
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,635
And I said, "Dad, I'm doing
this plasma therapy for myself."

768
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,138
"There are other people who are doing it
for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's."

769
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,475
I said, "if you're interested,
you can come to Texas with me,

770
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,978
and, like, I would love
to give you a liter of plasma."

771
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,981
- There it is. There's the plasma.
- All right.

772
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:15,110
There are certain
interventions that truly reverse the ages.

773
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:20,199
{\an8}For example,
this idea of young blood plasma.

774
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,745
The reversal effect
can be observed in this study

775
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,916
where researchers connect
a young mouse to an old mouse.

776
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:34,129
They literally connect
their arteries and veins,

777
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,006
so there's a blood exchange.

778
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:42,179
And you can see that young plasma
circulated through the old mouse

779
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,558
reverses the epigenetic ages
of multiple organs.

780
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:51,230
In one study we saw a reverse
of 50% in a rat.

781
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,734
Then in another study
more recently in mice, 30%.

782
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,612
When we're looking at plasma,
I guess, option one,

783
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,574
you know, sew me together with a...
...with a young human.

784
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,369
That's not practical.
So we said we can't do that one.

785
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,621
So next case,
we look at these plasma exchanges.

786
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,332
I didn't see
the vision at first,

787
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:14,545
but Bryan told me that this would be
someone doing something

788
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,922
for their loved one that mattered.

789
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,677
It was an investment in their health
by giving them some of your health.

790
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,848
So I tell Talmage, like,
"Hey, Grandpa's pumped about this."

791
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:30,310
So we start talking and, like,
we said, "What if you did it too?"

792
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,647
"You donate your plasma to me,
I will to Dad."

793
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,442
"It'll be this multi-generational thing.
What do you think?"

794
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,653
And he instantaneously said,
"Yes, I'm in."

795
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,614
We're at 34,000 feet.
We're flying to Dallas.

796
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,949
We just had some food.

797
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,868
Talmage is right behind me.

798
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,500
I need to check in to see what he's eating
to make sure his plasma's okay.

799
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,879
The plasma stuff
always sounds super creepy

800
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,798
to anyone who hears about it
for the first time.

801
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,843
But Bryan was not
the first guy to do this.

802
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:07,347
Years ago, there would be stories
about Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist,

803
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,391
one of the first investors in Facebook,

804
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,770
draining the blood
of some young healthy people.

805
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,607
I'm not sure that that's true,
but this all got out into the wild.

806
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,485
It sort of got parodied
in the show <i>Silicon Valley</i>.

807
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,862
- Everything okay?
- Uh, is Bryce your assistant?

808
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,615
No, of course not.
He's my transfusion associate.

809
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,785
Most Silicon Valley people,
if they had a blood boy,

810
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,870
they didn't want anybody to know about it,

811
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,539
but Bryan being Bryan...

812
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,416
...kind of embraced all this

813
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:39,171
and was out there parading his blood boys
around on Twitter and taking photographs.

814
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,381
You guys look awesome.

815
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,844
It did have the elements of,
like, absurdity that I thought would come

816
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:50,057
with Bryan having the whole family show up
as if you were going to a ball game,

817
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,976
except you were just
all gonna swap plasma.

818
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,732
What?
The plasma bus got decorated!

819
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,526
"Love flows from the heart."

820
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,988
I guess it's really the vein,
but this is amazing.

821
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,325
Hey, look at that.

822
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,911
That's pretty plasma.

823
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,496
So what's good about this?

824
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,706
The color is really nice.
It's pristine.

825
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,418
I'm actually honestly scared
that it's gonna be more clear than mine.

826
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,212
It'll be embarrassing.

827
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:24,174
- So I'm hoping it's good but I'm also...

828
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,926
I understand.
- It's competition.

829
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,805
I understand that. I mean this is the way
you can tell, am I a fraud or not, right?

830
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,974
- Like, "All right, haters."
- Absolutely.

831
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,143
- Yeah. "What'd you say about this?"

832
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,106
I have identified
the world's first vampire.

833
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,774
Anti-aging fanatic

834
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,194
who spends more than two million dollars
per year to retain youth

835
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,406
uses teen son as, quote, "blood boy."

836
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,200
- Bruh.
- His son needs to watch out right now.

837
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,202
His son needs to run!

838
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,121
- Oh, the <i>Daily Mail's</i> up.
- Yeah.

839
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,040
Okay. Some of the comments
of the <i>Daily Mail...</i>

840
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,878
"What a weirdo. Disgusting and satanic.
What a waste of time."

841
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,714
Oh, humanity's so great.

842
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,013
The plasma transfer blew up
on social media.

843
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:17,227
And, of course, the easy place to go is...
is vampire, blood draw, blood boy.

844
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:21,565
And the mean-spirited,
uh, instead of drawing my... my ire

845
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,818
and my absolute, uh, anger,

846
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,486
uh, really made me sad.

847
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,073
All right, Dad.
Pass the torch.

848
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,825
Let's get you a new pillow.

849
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,202
One thing people don't get,

850
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:38,040
this was an event
that transcended the trial of a therapy.

851
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,542
You know how special this is.

852
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:44,254
You know, the connection and everything,
this is just like a manifestation

853
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,257
of all that commitment, everything else.

854
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,135
Yeah, better than words.
- Better than words.

855
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,306
When you become invested
in the other person

856
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:58,310
to the point that you step up
and you share biology,

857
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,440
having that kind of intimacy
with both Bryan and with Talmage,

858
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,069
for me, it was a chance to reconcile.

859
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,740
When I was early married,

860
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,495
you would never see a more serious MFer
in Mormonism than me.

861
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,248
But the problem was it was not my life.

862
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,378
When I was younger, my father
went through some difficult times

863
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,172
with professional challenges and drugs.

864
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,968
His mom and I
separated and got a divorce.

865
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:36,431
At that time I wasn't sure whether to find
a girlfriend or have a line of coke,

866
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,351
to go to temple or go have a scotch.

867
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:44,189
When your life is so...
screwed up to that point,

868
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,942
and you have no idea
what your moral standards are,

869
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,276
it all falls apart.

870
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,782
It was like a 95% likelihood

871
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,493
that he would fall through on anything.

872
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,747
Like, pick me up from school...
help me with a homework assignment,

873
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,667
like, call me when he said he would,
it just would never happen.

874
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,504
That probably affected Bryan
the most of any of the kids.

875
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,216
He was the one
that wanted to go with his dad.

876
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,510
He's the one that waited for him.

877
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,179
I think it hurt him a lot.

878
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,394
He got arrested when I was 22.

879
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,022
And I went and saw him in jail,

880
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,567
and that was a moment for him.

881
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,319
Guess who came to see his dad?

882
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,782
And words of judgement like,
"God, Dad, clean up your act."

883
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,326
No. [voice breaks] "You can do it, Dad."

884
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,124
Did anyone else come?
- No.

885
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,588
No.

886
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,222
There we go.

887
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,058
Me being at that point,

888
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,852
and being at this point,

889
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,482
I mean, have Bryan, uh,
holding on to me, having Talmage...

890
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,986
what could be a better statement
of reconciliation?

891
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,448
Love you, Dad.
I love you.

892
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,743
What a great experience.

893
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,787
You feel the love?

894
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:26,666
It was one of the most precious
life experiences we've ever had.

895
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:32,339
It morphed into this multi-generational,

896
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,217
healing/bonding experience,

897
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,470
and was less about
the therapeutic benefit.

898
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,436
I feel like a parent and a child

899
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,730
that maybe takes different paths

900
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,733
can find a place for a good relationship.

901
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,363
But it... it has to be
a joint effort for both.

902
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,662
Why are you having
that reaction?

903
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,998
It's hard work sometimes,

904
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,334
and it's not without its heartache,

905
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,211
but it can be done.

906
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,508
Having this time with my father,

907
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,136
I reflected a lot on being a dad.

908
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,057
All right, here we go. Okay, guys.

909
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,768
- Hi, mister.
Hey, Talmage.

910
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,604
It's been one of the most painful
experiences of my life,

911
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,107
where two of my children

912
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,360
keep me at bay because I'm not part
of their religious organization.

913
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:39,865
So I feel like I missed out
on a meaningful part of their lives.

914
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,785
And it's been the most special
experience in my life

915
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,246
where one of my children
has fully embraced me.

916
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,041
I wish my other children would join me.

917
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,223
All right, Talmage, all yours.
Cool.

918
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,979
Talmage, last night

919
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,274
I did a... a phone call date

920
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,401
with somebody I met

921
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,111
on a dating app.

922
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,780
We're gonna go out on a date next week.

923
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,657
I wish her the best of luck.

924
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,243
You wish <i>her</i> the best of luck?
- Yeah.

925
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,999
Relationships
are really important,

926
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:35,795
and, you know, with Talmage leaving,
I guess I need to rebuild my life.

927
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,090
I told her why I'd be a bad idea.

928
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,551
She seemed undeterred.

929
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:47,349
Normally, when I engage with somebody
and we're contemplating being friends,

930
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:53,146
I make a list, and I say, "Here are
the ten reasons why I'm a bad idea."

931
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:58,568
"I have this protocol that is rigorous,
I'm impossibly hard to be with,

932
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,488
and, ultimately,
you're just gonna hate me."

933
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,283
And so I try to get in front of it,
and oftentimes people will laugh.

934
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,745
I'm, like, "No for real."
"This is really what's gonna happen."

935
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,789
I don't know.
Maybe it's a really bad strategy.

936
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:17,295
{\an8}Bryan deserves
to have companionship in his life,

937
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,174
{\an8}and I think
he's always struggled to find that.

938
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,929
I feel like there's a conflict
within Bryan between family Bryan,

939
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,390
the one that wants a partner,

940
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,935
wants to just, like, hang out,
you know, be around loved ones,

941
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,398
and then the ambitious Bryan,
who says, like, "Every ounce of my energy

942
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,067
needs to be dedicated
toward this mission."

943
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,997
I went on two dates
with this one woman and...

944
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,459
we... we got along fairly well,

945
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,547
but I think she basically was, like,
"You're so far outside the norms,

946
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,592
I just don't know if I... if I can
make sense of this whole thing."

947
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,845
Are you willing to change?

948
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,391
No.

949
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,479
Let's just say relationships
have never been my strength.

950
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,775
I was married at the age of 24.
I didn't have any girlfriends before that.

951
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,737
So then, when I got divorced
13 years later,

952
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,906
I had no idea
how to deal with partnership.

953
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,451
Bryan is a complicated person,

954
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:33,663
and I remember we had a conversation
with some concerns,

955
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,665
"Am I ever gonna find someone

956
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,668
that will really fit with me,"
realizing that he was quite unique.

957
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,673
I guess I just kind of stumble
through social interactions,

958
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,802
and my first girlfriend
after getting the divorce

959
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,722
has ended up in a pretty ugly lawsuit.

960
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,807
Oh, that's a cool headline.

961
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,643
"Tech mogul who spends
two million a year for 18-year-old body

962
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,229
cheated and dumped fiancée
after she got breast cancer."

963
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,773
- Lawsuit?

964
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,941
What?
- How is that a lawsuit though?

965
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,236
"Johnson had agreed to provide
lifelong financial support..."

966
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,697
Oh, this is where the lawsuit comes in.

967
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,617
"Then she got, um, breast cancer."

968
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:15,413
-"She became... a net negative..."

969
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,082
"...and a bad deal for him."

970
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:21,086
- He described her as a business term.
- Oh my God.

971
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,839
Bryan's relationship with Taryn

972
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,551
I think was a very sweet relationship
for both of them.

973
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,137
I saw how happy it made them.

974
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:35,934
And so it was surprising to me
to hear some allegations.

975
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,728
Taryn filed a lawsuit against Bryan.

976
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,940
Taryn claimed after the cancer treatment,

977
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,943
Bryan demanded that she move out
of the residence they shared.

978
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:48,613
He told her that he would
assist her with rent and expenses

979
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,408
but only if she signed
the separation agreement.

980
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,744
Almost like, "Hey, sign this NDA,
and I'll give you the money."

981
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,414
She had no independent
source of steady income.

982
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,000
She tried to resist,
but Bryan was manipulative.

983
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,087
Being labeled as this awful person
for all these things,

984
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,131
I was rattled, deeply.

985
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,760
We dated for a couple years,
and when we separated,

986
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,430
she hired one of the most
powerful law firms in the world.

987
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,267
They sent me this letter
demanding that I pay them

988
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,019
$9,000,000 that week

989
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:24,023
or they were going to make
these scandalous statements about me.

990
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,651
I felt like they were
all false allegations,

991
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,611
so I said, "I'm not doing it."

992
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,655
Okay, game face.

993
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:34,117
What is game face?
If someone were to put a game face on.

994
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,036
We were in arbitration
where everything's confidential,

995
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,915
but then the media found
the lawsuit in the California courts,

996
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,084
and published all of her allegations.

997
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,048
Facing the destruction
of my personal reputation

998
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,510
by my former girlfriend and fiancée,

999
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,306
it's hard for me
to walk into a relationship

1000
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,350
and trust that there's not
some alternative motive.

1001
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:04,647
A lot of people of course say, "Boo hoo,
your rich person problems," whatever.

1002
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,816
Okay, uh, sure.

1003
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,695
Also, it stinks because
it does create a significant barrier

1004
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:14,616
for, uh, meaningful relationships because
it just... it complicates everything.

1005
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,703
But with Talmage,

1006
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,874
our relationship is rich and dynamic.

1007
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,791
Game on.

1008
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,544
Whoo!

1009
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,129
That was amazing.

1010
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,466
Where's Talmage?
I gotta find Talmage. There he is.

1011
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,010
Yes!
Did you see the time?

1012
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,472
What is it? I beat you.
Oh no!

1013
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,391
We can run it back tomorrow.

1014
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,437
I've never
had a relationship in my life

1015
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,940
that has been this consistent,

1016
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,152
and steady, and soothing, and fun.

1017
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:55,156
It has all the characteristics
of everything I've always wanted

1018
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,282
in a best friend.

1019
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,451
- Yes!
- You're killing it.

1020
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,787
And so I think,
yeah, there's a meaningful amount

1021
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,748
of influence
that Talmage has on this project.

1022
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,583
<i>Talmage Bryan Johnson.</i>

1023
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,298
People think
I'm fearful of death. I'm not.

1024
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,342
I love life.

1025
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,555
And I love living life with Talmage.

1026
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,809
Do you worry about him
or you think he'll be good on his own?

1027
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,644
I do worry about him.

1028
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,313
Like, yeah, we're gonna
really miss each other.

1029
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,149
Happy birthday, Talmage. Yeah!

1030
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,653
Previous generations, you have kids
so that you can pass the torch.

1031
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,156
And now you have kids
so that you can journey with them.

1032
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,367
Don't Die is real.

1033
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,705
Like, I want to journey with Talmage
for some indefinite period of time.

1034
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,791
I'm serious about this.

1035
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:51,296
I really do want to have
multiple lifetimes

1036
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,382
with Talmage,
and go through all the different phases.

1037
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,802
Um, a hundred years
is not gonna be enough.

1038
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,436
- Ready? Okay.
Yeah, whenever you're ready.

1039
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,064
Hi. Today is one
of the most exciting days of Blueprint.

1040
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,192
We're gonna travel to an island
just off the coast of Honduras.

1041
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,862
And I'm going to be injected
with my first gene therapy.

1042
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,532
If you look at the age charts of humanity,

1043
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:22,493
humans have a 120-year ceiling.

1044
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:26,414
So if we wanna say we're going to punch
through this limitation of human lifespan,

1045
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,791
it's gonna be through gene therapy.

1046
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,127
Underwear, socks, shorts, shirts.

1047
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:36,090
{\an8}Gene therapy is considered, you know,
taking it as far as you can at this point.

1048
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:40,219
{\an8}So, it's kind of the extreme measure
of treating biological aging.

1049
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,931
The state of gene therapy
is that we are using it in the clinic,

1050
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,351
but we're using it for serious conditions,

1051
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,979
where we know that there is
a single gene that's causing the problem,

1052
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,483
and we can say editing this gene
in this way would be successful.

1053
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,487
The idea of using gene therapy
for aging is hugely exciting,

1054
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,280
but, today, the science isn't ready.

1055
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:04,494
In fact, there's a big risk because there
are things called "off-target effects."

1056
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,747
{\an8}This is where the gene therapy goes in
and it modifies not just the DNA

1057
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,708
{\an8}that you're trying to modify, but modifies
some other part of your genome.

1058
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,629
Many interventions
do rejuvenate cells,

1059
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:20,885
{\an8}but that incurs a risk that the cells
then turn into different cells,

1060
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,137
malignant cells, cancer cells.

1061
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,599
Gene therapy is dangerous,

1062
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,352
and we have been evaluating
various gene therapies

1063
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,646
for the past almost two years now.

1064
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:36,609
This is the only one
that had the potential lifespan extenders

1065
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:40,238
that we were looking for
that also met our safety criteria.

1066
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,366
In what Bryan's trying to do
in his journey,

1067
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,828
{\an8}is there any part of you that's nervous
for what he's trying to achieve?

1068
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,996
{\an8}Yes, yes.

1069
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:54,293
I am nervous where Bryan's going,
because me, I'm... I'm logical and smart.

1070
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:59,173
When I get to the end...
edge of the... the ledge, I stop.

1071
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,635
I'm never... I'm never taking
the next step into the abyss.

1072
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:11,018
Generally, a person would
get a gene therapy in a clinical trial,

1073
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:14,897
and the problem with clinical trials
is they are limited.

1074
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,028
Certainly there isn't gene therapy for
aging in clinical trials at this moment.

1075
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:25,158
So other than that,
you would travel for medical tourism.

1076
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,786
And one place that gene therapy
is being offered

1077
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,205
is Roatán, Honduras.

1078
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,041
There is a free zone there
called Próspera.

1079
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,920
Próspera is
a special economic zone

1080
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,008
{\an8}that the state of Honduras
has licensed with the ability

1081
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,469
{\an8}to create new business laws

1082
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,346
that are favorable to innovations

1083
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,098
like our gene therapy.

1084
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:54,270
{\an8}Here, we're able to operate
under an ethics review board

1085
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,524
{\an8}and a committee that makes sure that
we're doing everything up to standard.

1086
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:03,321
All this that you see is Próspera.
I'm on the lookout for dinosaurs.

1087
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,282
We're working on it next.

1088
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,703
We are planning
on doing trials in the United States.

1089
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,705
However, it's a thing, it takes some time,

1090
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,083
and it's not necessarily time
devoted towards laboratory work.

1091
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,588
It's more of a thing of legal issues

1092
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,715
and having lawyers
communicate on your behalf

1093
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:27,428
with a very large
and very bureaucratic regulatory agency.

1094
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,889
It's go-time.

1095
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,432
All right, this way.

1096
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:36,354
If I'm being honest,
Próspera is like a batshit crazy idea.

1097
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:40,983
It's like you just take over a little bit
of land, set up all your own rules.

1098
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:45,279
I like Mac and Walter very much.
They seem like nice guys.

1099
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,324
They didn't strike me as...
as, you know...

1100
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,786
...[laughing] 20-year PhD-type scientists.

1101
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,122
And so it was like
the first thing Bryan's done

1102
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,959
where I really was, like,
"Is this a good idea?"

1103
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,669
Hey.

1104
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,297
If there's anything
you have any questions about,

1105
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:06,676
whatever information you need,
we will do our best to provide.

1106
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,137
Any kind of diagnostic, anything,
we will do our best.

1107
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,849
I appreciate that, Walter.

1108
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,853
When me and Mac started the
company, we wanted to make a difference

1109
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,187
in people's lives.

1110
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,440
You know, we're dealt
a certain hand at our birth.

1111
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,860
We're dealt
with the genes we're... we're given.

1112
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,655
And we want to give people options.

1113
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,493
This gene therapy,
which is follistatin,

1114
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,996
has primarily been used in bodybuilding,

1115
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:39,333
where you're looking
at increased muscle mass and strength.

1116
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:43,170
{\an8}For some people, bulking up is desirable,
but generally with age,

1117
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,966
{\an8}sarcopenia, osteoporosis,
and frailty are severe problems.

1118
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,596
Our gene therapy treats that
either preventatively in young people,

1119
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,641
or in a reactive way in older people
who are already experiencing it.

1120
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,769
If you look at the mouse
lifespan studies where it was used,

1121
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:02,356
they had a 30% lifespan extension.

1122
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:06,110
So if I end up looking like
a Marvel character, all the better.

1123
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,404
Can I get some help on this?

1124
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,033
After the gene therapy, I'm not gonna
fit in this thing or maybe I'm just gonna...

1125
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,285
- Bulk up...
- I'm going to Hulk out of it.

1126
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,038
He's so confident.

1127
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,874
But I'm a little worried for him.

1128
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,794
Like, we just don't know
how his body's gonna react.

1129
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:27,048
And I would just... Yeah, I would hate
for anything to happen to him.

1130
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,345
It's important to note,

1131
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,139
any gene therapy that integrates
into your existing genome

1132
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,266
does "change your DNA."

1133
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,311
Our gene therapy does not integrate.

1134
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,563
Once you get injected,
it's not editing your DNA.

1135
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:46,317
It's just giving you an added piece
of DNA that's parallel

1136
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,820
and creates
a little export factory of follistatin.

1137
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:54,700
Most gene therapies, because they
integrate into your chromosomal DNA,

1138
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,954
once it's there, it's there,
and you can't turn it off.

1139
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,581
Our gene therapy doesn't integrate,

1140
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,376
and so we've introduced
the concept of a kill switch.

1141
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,672
It's potentially safer
because if you want to turn it off,

1142
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:11,384
there's a few methods
that we could use to make it reversible.

1143
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,096
Okay, are you ready for this?

1144
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,347
I'm ready for this.

1145
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,432
All right, let's go.

1146
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,354
Here it comes.

1147
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,191
Stings just a little bit.

1148
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,202
Jeez, I wish we could
drag this out, but that's it.

1149
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:42,289
Thanks, doc.
It was clean injections.

1150
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,457
Yeah, good.

1151
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:48,838
I am now officially
a genetically-enhanced human.

1152
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,884
When people see someone like me
doing gene therapy,

1153
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,845
many think of inequality,

1154
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,431
or they see a divide
between rich and poor.

1155
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,642
The way I think about it is,
if we can prove

1156
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:05,146
that this gene therapy
is safe and effective,

1157
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:09,275
and then, you know,
10,000 people are willing to do it,

1158
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,068
that price is going to go down.

1159
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,070
Doctor, thanks.
You're welcome.

1160
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,739
Yeah, really appreciate you.

1161
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,741
There are expensive interventions,

1162
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,910
like gene therapy, that we need to test.

1163
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,538
For academics,
it's prohibitively expensive

1164
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,623
to do the human clinical studies.

1165
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,127
And maybe longevity clinics
where people pay a lot of money

1166
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,296
are places we can at least get some data.

1167
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:34,008
So I'm not against
having clinics available.

1168
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,427
But once we find out how things work,

1169
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:40,681
we have to figure out how to scale them
and make them broadly available.

1170
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,391
I don't know if we'll live forever,

1171
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:46,437
but at least we absolutely
will buy the next guy some more time.

1172
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,354
Mm-hm.

1173
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:51,442
And I'd rather give my children more years
than I, uh, had the opportunity for.

1174
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,861
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
- So thank you for believing in us.

1175
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,571
Thank you, both of you.

1176
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,156
- Thanks, Bryan.
- Yeah.

1177
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,244
Wow. That looks
still enough to walk on.

1178
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,790
If we... If we put a camera on top,
I can walk on water here.

1179
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,585
From Homo sapiens to Homo Deus.

1180
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,714
Testing out whether the gene therapy,
if the effects have taken.

1181
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,385
Be careful, Jacob.
Don't die. No one can die.

1182
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,811
Bryan, when he was young,

1183
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,813
really lived from religion.

1184
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,439
Yeah.

1185
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,901
You know, I can remember a stage
that he went through,

1186
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:37,780
where, I mean, he literally
wanted to be like Joseph Smith.

1187
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:42,243
Joseph Smith, of course,
is the founding prophet in Mormonism.

1188
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:47,206
And I think the thing that you see
as a continuing principle with Bryan,

1189
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:53,254
he wants his life to be such that
he would stick out like a Joseph Smith.

1190
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:57,424
His reward will be when he affects change.

1191
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,261
Change to him is the aphrodisiac.

1192
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,971
It is... It is the drug.

1193
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,765
<i>Health and wellness
is a lot like religion. With the Bible...</i>

1194
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:08,686
It's not hard to make the
argument that he gave up on the church,

1195
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:13,023
had to find a new religion, and has turned
health and himself into this religion.

1196
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:16,110
And it's this very
narcissistic enterprise.

1197
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:20,156
15,000 views in three hours, 585 comments.

1198
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:24,785
Receiving attention and
having people care about what he's doing,

1199
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:27,079
I think he does care about that.

1200
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,874
But I don't actually think
it, like, undermines what he's doing,

1201
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,043
because it's so out there in the open.

1202
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:38,215
I made a statement yesterday that,
"Jesus has had 2,000 years."

1203
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,509
"I don't see any evidence of his work."

1204
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,429
-"I've done more in two years."
How'd that go?

1205
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,930
As you might expect.

1206
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:51,395
He talks about himself as being kind of
Health Jesus with a little bit of humor...

1207
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,064
...but also, I think,
quite a bit of pride.

1208
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,317
Hi, guys. Hey.

1209
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,653
He's embracing
the culty aspect of this all,

1210
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:03,073
and it only seems to be building
more and more momentum.

1211
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,743
How do you think
I appear to your friends?

1212
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,828
I think the only way
for me to understand that

1213
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:12,333
is if one of my friend's dads
was starting a cult.

1214
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,293
Mm.
- And how I'd look at that.

1215
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:18,047
I wouldn't think much of it
'cause you're doing it.

1216
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,925
Am I starting a cult?
- Yes.

1217
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,176
- Am I?
- Yeah.

1218
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,262
It's not a bad thing. It just is.

1219
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:30,142
I know Bryan's tried
to force this to be a religion.

1220
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:35,231
There's a part of me that thinks this is
almost the right religion for this moment.

1221
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:41,362
In some ways, it is like this antidote
to the way the world thinks about health.

1222
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,823
There are still serious concerns
about the nation's health care system.

1223
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,368
{\an8}The National Health Service is broken.

1224
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,496
Why is the system
letting doctors and patients down?

1225
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:55,542
The approach to health
in pretty much every developed nation

1226
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,797
{\an8}has really been centered around waiting
until people develop a disease

1227
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,091
{\an8}and then attempting to cure that disease,

1228
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,135
{\an8}but in reality,
pretty much just treating symptoms.

1229
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:09,390
One of the consequences of that
is that the prevalence of chronic disease

1230
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:12,309
has increased dramatically
over the last 50 years.

1231
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:15,896
{\an8}We think, you know, "I'll go to bed at 90
and I'll die in my sleep."

1232
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,106
{\an8}That almost never happens.

1233
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:22,653
If you go into a geriatric ward
and you see people incontinent, immobile,

1234
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:26,615
if we do look at it, if we stare this
in the face, it's particularly unpleasant.

1235
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,035
At the moment,
we are spending so much money

1236
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,329
treating very sick individuals.

1237
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:37,293
{\an8}I think we have to ask,
"Why wouldn't you invest earlier in life

1238
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:42,339
{\an8}to keep them healthy, to not having
so many people with age-related diseases?"

1239
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,011
You know, in the US, doctors
are generally paid on procedures.

1240
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:50,597
And I remember when I was at The Buck
doing research on aging,

1241
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,474
there was a large hospital chain

1242
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,060
that was thinking
about giving a donation to the research.

1243
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:59,523
{\an8}We talked about health span,
and the CEO looked at me and said,

1244
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:03,736
{\an8}"Well, if we do this, you're going
to cut our procedure rate by 60%."

1245
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,362
"Why would I do this?"

1246
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:08,490
So, we need to think about
how we really wanna focus

1247
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,200
on the health of the population.

1248
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,207
That's the most admirable part
about what Bryan is doing,

1249
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:19,835
it's the most proactive thing
you could imagine.

1250
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,129
And if the medical system was wired

1251
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,673
even just, like,
a little bit more this way,

1252
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,884
I think it'd probably
be good for the rest of us.

1253
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,889
If we can solve
this fundamental problem,

1254
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:36,977
we may walk into a future
where all of us live healthier and longer

1255
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:39,063
with the people that we care about.

1256
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,155
Three days.

1257
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,742
- That's so wild to me.
- I know, it's here.

1258
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,537
Think of it, I've been acting all tough
guy, like, "I'm going off to college."

1259
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:59,833
- But when I start to think about it, like...
- I'm defeated.

1260
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,252
- Aw, shit.

1261
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:04,671
I'll get over it. I just...
I just feel defeated.

1262
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:08,384
It's like... It's like you... you got me,
but now you're losing me again.

1263
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,719
Yeah. Yeah.

1264
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,058
Yeah.

1265
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,980
Oh, no!

1266
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,941
19-21, it's a close game, Dad.

1267
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,568
I was down, then you were down.

1268
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,321
Yeah, you came back
from a comeback. Good job.

1269
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:30,989
You too.
- Good game.

1270
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:34,827
I've always been
the Talmage whisperer.

1271
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,287
From the moment he came out of the womb,

1272
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:40,374
I was the one who could quiet him.
I'd settle him.

1273
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:44,670
And it was just my little Talmage.
And this week, he's ready to go.

1274
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,130
Hi, mister.

1275
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,550
Do you need help with anything today?

1276
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,551
No.

1277
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:56,098
My priorities...
involve stuff I do by myself.

1278
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,099
Mm-hm.

1279
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,352
With Kate's help.

1280
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,316
He's learned everything
he needs to learn from me.

1281
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:10,320
And I was just going through
the typical parental process

1282
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,740
of having, you know,
someone leave your nest.

1283
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,783
Yeah, I like it.

1284
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,076
- Cute.
- Yeah.

1285
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,839
Talmage Bryan Johnson,
ready to go.

1286
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,717
As soon as I step past this, I'm out.

1287
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,428
The voyage begins.

1288
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,976
Welcome, Talmage.
Thank you.

1289
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,909
Talmage, happy college prep day.

1290
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,830
Do we have a starting plan?
Are we going to kitchen stuff first?

1291
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,833
Are we following you around?
Are we engaged in the process?

1292
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,044
Do you know what you're going to do?

1293
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:08,837
Linens over here.

1294
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,423
Linens and a comforter.

1295
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:12,799
What's your bed size?

1296
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:14,801
Oh, so complicated.

1297
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,970
Over here, Talmage.

1298
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,225
Do you got me?
Yeah.

1299
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,146
Oh, God.

1300
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:30,609
I confess, I just about started crying
when we walked by all the little toys.

1301
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:33,737
I saw you...
Yeah, I lost my breath.

1302
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,115
Kind of goes against
your emotionless thing.

1303
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,492
Yeah. Huh.

1304
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,589
Why am I crying in Target?

1305
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,690
So much going on inside of me,
I don't even know.

1306
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,607
Mm-hm.

1307
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,195
Okay.

1308
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:17,864
Like, a blue?

1309
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:21,785
Gray? Green?

1310
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,787
I think I'm a green kind of guy.

1311
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:31,753
These past 150 days,
Talmage has been this presence in my life.

1312
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,422
I... We just love each other.

1313
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:37,259
And if we look at all the science
about... humans,

1314
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,220
that humans thrive in community,
they thrive in...

1315
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,182
in positive relationships.

1316
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,478
Yeah, it's not a good thing to be alone.

1317
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,149
So I... I.. I wouldn't be so brazen

1318
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,611
to think that I'm going to defy
what the science shows

1319
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,280
on human connection and community.

1320
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,408
Do you have a plan?
- No.

1321
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,294
Welcome to the University of Chicago.

1322
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,597
- Do you see it? Right there.

1323
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,810
- This is perfect.
We have a fan. That's nice.

1324
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,896
These are nicer than I have.

1325
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:35,317
Do you have a preference on which side
you want to expose to your skin?

1326
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,195
See, this is front face left.

1327
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,697
I feel like
it's really gonna hit

1328
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,992
once you say goodbye to me
when I'm in my dorm.

1329
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,537
Yeah, I've never felt
more understood by anyone

1330
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:49,081
than with you.

1331
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:53,168
- So, yeah, I hope you don't die.

1332
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,923
I don't know,
I just keep reflecting

1333
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,717
on all the... the things
that have happened this year.

1334
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,344
All of the life lessons.

1335
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,722
Yeah, it's gonna be hard to rival this.

1336
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,351
I love you.
- I love you too.

1337
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,233
All right, Talmage Bryan Johnson...

1338
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,445
{\an8}Second version of you.

1339
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,866
{\an8}Let's get after it.

1340
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,368
{\an8}Yep.

1341
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,125
The house is awfully quiet.

1342
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,257
I guess now it's real.

1343
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,011
It never felt real.

1344
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,431
And now it's quiet. It's just still.

1345
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,769
I wonder how he's feeling.

1346
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:55,207
Can I show you this solution?
- Yes.

1347
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,083
You wanna look at my screen?

1348
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:00,879
So, let's say you're just,
like, on the Blueprint website.

1349
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,715
You're just looking at food. There's this.

1350
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:05,342
How are you feeling today?

1351
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,762
In many ways, I don't think
I could have gone to the next stage

1352
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,515
until I got things settled with Talmage.

1353
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:14,684
I really needed him
to be in a good place at school

1354
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,603
or on his next stage of life.

1355
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:21,191
And I think he's there, so I feel
emboldened to take my next step too.

1356
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,237
{\an8}Ready, let's do this.

1357
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:31,701
Hey, what's up, friends?
Today is Don't Die hike number four.

1358
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:35,664
It was less than two months ago
that I messaged out on social media.

1359
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,541
"Hey, I'm going on a hike. Join me."

1360
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,793
And I had 11 people.

1361
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:43,129
Today, there's over 400 people.

1362
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:46,216
Oh, my goodness,
this is a lot of cars. Wow.

1363
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,221
Wait, there's more people.
This is... What? This is crazy!

1364
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:54,015
Hi, everyone!
- Hey, guys! Good morning!

1365
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,934
You look ten years younger
than last time.

1366
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,062
Big group hug in the morning.

1367
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,401
Come on in, everyone!

1368
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,446
Over time, I guess
I've gone through different stages...

1369
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,782
...of my feelings about Bryan.

1370
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:15,912
At the very beginning,
his lifestyle struck me as quite solitary.

1371
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,582
But as more people have bought into this,

1372
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:23,420
he actually seems to be creating
these friendships I never expected.

1373
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,213
Everyone, let's go up this way.

1374
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:31,094
For Bryan, I can tell
there's a lot of enjoyment from this.

1375
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:34,180
And so I think
he's kind of flipped the narrative.

1376
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:36,725
- You made it! Good job, everyone!

1377
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,852
I'll confess. This is a cult.

1378
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:43,565
- It's a sick and twisted cult...

1379
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,109
- ...to get you to go to bed on time.

1380
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:49,321
There's little bits and pieces
of that that are unnerving.

1381
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,198
But I think I see him now
almost as, like, a philosopher.

1382
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:54,492
I mean, he's sort of trying
to prove a point.

1383
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,495
It's this, like, Don't Die thing,

1384
01:21:57,495 --> 01:22:01,958
which I really thought was sort of a joke
as I saw this evolving.

1385
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,419
But there is some merit to it, I think.

1386
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:07,797
Whether you believe in Bryan
or what he's doing or not,

1387
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,799
it's an interesting question to ask

1388
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,719
if society has just taken a wrong turn.

1389
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:16,723
I think it drives some people crazy,
and it inspires others.

1390
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,767
What's up, guys? I'm Talmage.

1391
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,268
- I'm Charles.
- I'm Carly.

1392
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,562
We're hosting the Don't Die event
in Chicago.

1393
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:25,190
Don't Die in Chicago!

1394
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,108
Don't Die from Cologne.

1395
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,903
Don't Die in Dublin.
- Don't Die from Santa Fe.

1396
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,030
- In Barcelona.
- In Hong Kong.

1397
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,325
Don't die from Dubai!

1398
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:38,244
What we're talking about
is really a medical revolution.

1399
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,581
If there's an opportunity to stay healthy

1400
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:44,125
and stay functional
and see your grandkids,

1401
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,504
would you rather have that
or wait until you get Alzheimer's

1402
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:50,632
and take some drug
that slows the progression down by 30%?

1403
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,220
Aging is not inevitable.
At least it can be delayed.

1404
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,932
And you can do that right now
probably by changing your lifestyle.

1405
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:02,352
Lifestyle factors are obvious,
but it's important.

1406
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,398
From sleep quality, dietary modifications,

1407
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,859
regular exercise, and social interactions,

1408
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:13,947
we can get 10 years,
15 years of extra quality life.

1409
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,949
And that number will probably get bigger,

1410
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,535
as we develop
more effective interventions.

1411
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:22,831
You can see right there,
that fluid is mesenchymal stem cells.

1412
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,751
We haven't yet got any human
treatments that I'm happy to recommend.

1413
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:29,754
But because I know that
these treatments are being developed,

1414
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:33,258
and I think they're potentially going
to be available within our lifetimes,

1415
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,510
I'm much more excited
by following basic health advice.

1416
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,096
It means I'll hopefully
be alive and healthy long enough

1417
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:40,098
to benefit from these first treatments.

1418
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,685
What's even more exciting is that if
I benefit from those first treatments,

1419
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,645
maybe I'll live another few years longer.

1420
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,939
That then means
that gives scientists even more time

1421
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:50,442
to develop the second
or the third round of treatments.

1422
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:53,945
Of course it's going
to take time to develop interventions,

1423
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:56,740
but I'm certain that, at some point,

1424
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,659
two teenagers will have
a conversation with each other.

1425
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:03,580
They'll be looking at their history
books, and they'll be commenting,

1426
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,667
something like, "My God, people just
withered and died. Isn't that so tragic?"

1427
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:12,130
The same way as we look at,
you know, people just two lifetimes ago

1428
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,841
and not having an anesthetic
or an antibiotic.

1429
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:19,721
And, you know, we look back
and we go, "Jeez, that's horrendous." Um...

1430
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,599
When it happens, though,
is completely a product of what we do.

1431
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:26,352
How much effort, and money,
and energy we put into this,

1432
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:30,065
to create a movement
of people utterly engaged

1433
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:33,193
in keeping people healthy
as long as possible.

1434
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:37,489
Hi, everyone. I hope you guys feel
like you're among your people.

1435
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,116
Like-minded people trying not to die.

1436
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:43,661
I'm happy you came.

1437
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:44,746
I love you.

1438
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,207
Are you happy?

1439
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,001
{\an8}Never been happier in my entire life.

1440
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,170
{\an8}I don't know if I could do it.

1441
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,839
I've never seen him happier
than he is now.

1442
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:58,510
And just think about that.
When you're content with who you are,

1443
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,639
and you're engaged in a project
that is everything that you want to do,

1444
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,933
doesn't that set up as a happy place?

1445
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:11,648
To hear him say to me,
"I've never been happier in my life,"

1446
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:15,485
I think releases me from worry,

1447
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:18,613
knowing that he can go on like this.

1448
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,951
I've experienced
wanting to die intensely.

1449
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:27,247
And now I'm in a situation
where I want to live

1450
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:30,542
with everything that I am.

1451
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:46,349
And so, yeah, I really... I...
I want to continue to exist.

1452
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,019
And I don't feel any need
to justify myself.

1453
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,607
I'm a disaster
of an intelligent being, but...

1454
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,528
Hey, you know what? I'm trying my best.

1455
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:05,910
Okay. I'm gonna go
try to pick up a car.

1456
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,538
I bet you can do it.

1457
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,336
Love it.

1458
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,296
Hey.
