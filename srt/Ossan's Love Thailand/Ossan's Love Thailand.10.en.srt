1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,220
You aren’t the first boyfriend I have introduced to my family.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,720
How many boyfriends did you introduce to them?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,740
Who was the first one?

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,300
Are you jealous?

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,036
Mo!

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,734
Hello.Mom.

7
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:10,920
You look better than I thought.

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,920
You still look young and pretty.

9
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,590
Don’t call me ‘Dad’!

10
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,990
Don’t you worry about your dad’s reaction at all?

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,990
I want him to approve of me first.

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
More importantly,

13
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,890
I don’t want you to choose between me and him.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,530
I want to see a spicy dancer.

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,800
I’ll do it.

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,200
Do you want to try me?

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,050
How dare you say that to me, scumbag?

18
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,690
I’m just testing you.

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,640
I wanted to know if you would take the fault for me.

20
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,290
You passed my test.

21
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,770
Does this mean Mo can date Heng?

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,240
Yes.

23
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,320
I am the first boyfriend you introduced to your family.

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,650
Your sister told me everything.

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,070
Nonsense.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,610
Don’t believe every word she says.

27
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,240
Mom.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,930
Are you coming back home?

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,640
No.

30
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,960
I came to get my sewing kit.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,220
I need to fix my skirt.

32
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,260
I got to go.

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:22,960
Mom, wait.

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,320
Mom.

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,180
What do you need all this money for?

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,930
This is my money.

37
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,040
I can do whatever I want with it.

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,560
Mom, you raised me on a shoestring

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,210
because you saved the money for yourself, right?

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Give me my money back.

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,030
No, this is my money.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,220
Heng, you need to earn your own money.

43
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,760
I’m your mom.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
- Give me half of it. - 	No.

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,790
This is my money. Give it to me.

46
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,020
It’s mine.

47
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,760
I can buy many things with this money.

48
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,420
What are you doing?

49
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:03,490
I can buy many video games.

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,490
100 things I want to do before I die.

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,650
Use all my savings to travel around the world.

52
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,270
Mom.

53
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,140
Are you dying?

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,090
After I left home,

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,090
I went to help your aunt on her farm.

56
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,080
Last month, I had a stomachache.

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,160
I went to see a doctor and they found a tumor.

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,430
What?

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,900
Mom.

60
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,490
It might not be a cancer.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,080
The biopsy result will come out next week.

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,840
But I’m bracing myself for bad news.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,290
Heng’s grandparents all died of cancer.

64
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,820
His dad was killed in a car accident when he was going to get cancer examinations.

65
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,540
Mom, this is major.

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,900
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

67
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,530
I wanted to get the final result first.

68
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,530
I didn’t want to worry you.

69
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,260
So you’re following your bucket list.

70
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,600
2. Visit nine temples and make merits.

71
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,960
3. Visit a host blub.

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,520
Go to see a movie with Ou-noi.

73
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,210
Go to the beach with Ou-noi.

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,800
Who is Ou-noi?

75
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,800
Is he the guy you met at a host club?

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,420
It’s true.

77
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,810
You came home to get the money to pamper him, didn’t you?

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,060
No.

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,140
I also wrote things I wanted to do with you.

80
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,040
Let me see.

81
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,770
Go to see the sea of fog at Pha Pun Dao with Ou-noi.

82
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,410
Not that one.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
The other one.

84
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,220
I want to see Heng be in a relationship.

85
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,600
Yes, that one.

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,700
Can you do that for me before I die?

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,990
Meow.

88
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,790
Yes.

89
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Do you know what day today is?

90
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,820
It’s Friday.'

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,810
No.

92
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,740
It’s a Buddhist Holy Day.

93
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,310
It’s the 100th Day.

94
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Did someone die?

95
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,970
No one died.

96
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,110
Today marks the 100th day since we first met.

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,020
I forgot about that.

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,140
Since it’s our 100th day.

99
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,160
Meow, I like you.

100
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,680
Will you be my girlfriend?

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,550
Mom,

102
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,620
Mo and I, we are dating.

103
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,880
I’m ready.

104
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,340
Hold on.

105
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,000
I’m not sure if your mom will like me.

106
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,820
Why?

107
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,460
You know why.

108
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,910
Give me some time to score points with her first.

109
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,370
If she’s okay with me,

110
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,280
then we can tell her about us.

111
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,310
I get it.

112
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,020
I think if she tastes your stuffed omelet,

113
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,630
she will definitely fall for you like I did.

114
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,180
Don’t worry.

115
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,470
Mom.

116
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,190
What?

117
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,400
I’ll send Mo to help you in the kitchen.

118
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,170
No need for that.

119
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,620
Today, I already have Ou-noi as my help.

120
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,170
Hello, I’m Ou-noi.

121
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,830
Ou-noi is really a host.

122
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,020
Come here and sit down at the table.

123
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,980
Come here and sit down at the table.

124
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,860
Ou-noi cooked all the dishes.

125
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,960
Take a seat.

126
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,320
You are supposed to score points with her

127
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,510
but Ou-noi already took your role.

128
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,880
Let’s dig in.

129
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,560
It looks yummy, Mom.

130
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,630
Let’s eat.

131
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,220
Mo.

132
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,510
How did you move in with Heng?

133
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,540
He knew that I can cook.

134
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,700
So he tricked me to move in with him.

135
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,700
Mo, why did you say that?

136
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,840
Mom.

137
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,160
What?

138
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,820
I’m in a relationship.

139
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,640
Really?

140
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,470
With who?

141
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,180
Is it someone I know?

142
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,040
I’m dating…

143
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,940
I…

144
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,630
I’m dating…

145
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,480
Thua-ngok.

146
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,320
I’m dating…

147
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,200
Thua-ngok is calling again.

148
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,960
Ignore his call and turn off your phone.

149
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,450
I’m dating…

150
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,980
It’s my phone.

151
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,780
Hello.

152
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,920
Jay Fai called to tell us that our reservation is ready.

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,540
I got to go.

154
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,940
Otherwise, my reservation will be canceled.

155
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,410
Let’s go, Lily.

156
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,970
You can call me Salee.

157
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,990
No, you are as beautiful as lilies.

158
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,240
Wait, Mom.

159
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,600
What?

160
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,980
What about my partner?

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,910
You can invite her to have dinner with us this evening.

162
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,060
I want to know what kind of person…

163
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,380
agreed to date you.

164
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,820
Why did she say that?

165
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,090
I’m so stressed out that I lost my appetite.

166
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
I don’t want to eat anything.

167
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,520
Thua-ngok, why did you call me this morning?

168
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,980
I was in the middle of an important conversation.

169
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,850
I was rejected.

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,620
Huh?! You were rejected?

171
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Meow did that?

172
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,310
I asked her to be my boyfriend

173
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,560
but she said she wanted us to be like siblings.

174
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,490
I already have Chicha as my sister.

175
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,170
Is that true?

176
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,460
I saw Meow was quite crazy in love with you.

177
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,840
I was fooled by her, just like you.

178
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,440
She has been with someone all this time.

179
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,530
Thua-ngok, if she was popular with men,

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,400
she wouldn’t have chosen you.

181
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,760
Did you just look down on me?

182
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,860
No.

183
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
I’m serious.

184
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,230
Look.

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,190
Tonight?

186
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,390
Of course. I’ll see you.

187
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,860
Look.

188
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,550
When she was with me,

189
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,900
So I couldn’t hear their conversation.

190
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,790
When she is on the phone with that person,

191
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,480
she’s always smiling and giggling.

192
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,340
Look.

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
My heart is exploding into millions of pieces.

194
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,470
Thua-ngok, she is probably talking to a client.

195
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,150
There’s only one way to find out.

196
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,660
We need to follow her.

197
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,460
We?

198
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,580
You cannot use the word “We”.

199
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,740
I have an important thing to do this evening.

200
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,500
I can’t go with you, Thua-ngok.

201
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,690
Heng.

202
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,380
Heng, please help me.

203
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,950
Do you want me to get on my knees and grease your feet?

204
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,160
No, that’s my head.

205
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,330
I can’t go with you.

206
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,640
I have a very important thing to do this evening.

207
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you want me to grease your feet?

208
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,960
That’s my head.

209
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,990
Please.

210
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,520
I can’t go.

211
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,400
Look, Heng.

212
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,980
My heart is exploding.

213
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,730
Hello, Mo.

214
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,270
I’m going to get home late today.

215
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,090
I have to go somewhere with Thua-ngok.

216
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,380
Come on, Mo.

217
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
I’m so sorry.

218
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,870
Can you cover for me with my mom, Mo?

219
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,330
Heng.

220
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,870
What?

221
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,920
Please, Mo.

222
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,440
- I try to go home as soon as I can. - 	She’s leaving.

223
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,150
Come on.

224
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,500
I got to go. Please cover for me. Thank you.

225
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,060
Hurry up. We will lose her.

226
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,120
Come on. Hurry up.

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,960
Ouch.

228
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,320
Can I ask you something?

229
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,630
When you see her boyfriend,

230
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,820
What will you do?

231
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,010
I’ll do nothing.

232
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,530
I just want to see what kind of man he is

233
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,220
and if he takes good care of Meow.

234
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
That’s all I want to know.

235
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,360
Have you waited long?

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,060
Mom.

237
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,230
Huh?

238
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,290
She has a daughter?

239
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,900
Happy birthday to you

240
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,990
Happy birthday to you

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,800
Huh?

242
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:01,630
- The man Meow came to meet is my boss. - 		 Happy birthday, happy birthday

243
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,140
Happy birthday to you

244
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,230
Make a wish, sweetie.

245
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,720
Thank you, Dad.

246
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,410
He’s the father of Meow’s daughter!

247
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,550
Huh?

248
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,160
Huh?

249
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,650
Huh?

250
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,320
I’m not sure what is more shocking.

251
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
What the heck?

252
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,620
Mimi, you can go get ice cream with your mom first.

253
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,820
I’ll meet you after I pay the bill.

254
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,410
Yes.

255
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,000
Come on.

256
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,070
Check, please.

257
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,340
Come here.

258
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,830
Wait, what is this?

259
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,220
You asked Heng out even though you’re with Meow.

260
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,820
Wait, wait.

261
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,430
Calm down.

262
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,820
It’s a misunderstanding.

263
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,140
You misunderstand me.

264
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,060
Mimi is Meow’s daughter from her previous relationship.

265
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,860
Stop lying. I heard the girl call you ‘Dad’.

266
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,250
That was true.

267
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,940
I am her godfather.

268
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,940
Meow and I are single parents.

269
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,020
We’ve known each other for a long time.

270
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,480
So we always help each other.

271
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,680
I came to celebrate Mimi’s birthday as her godfather.

272
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,640
Hold on, why Meow never told us about this?

273
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,287
Hengney.

274
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,261
This is her personal life.

275
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,110
One more thing, her divorce was quite messy.

276
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,790
She doesn’t want to talk about it.

277
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,150
If she isn’t in a relationship,

278
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,150
why did she reject me?

279
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,400
(Don’t talk about it.)

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,980
She was probably afraid

281
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
you wouldn’t be okay that she has a daughter.

282
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,780
Are you…

283
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,080
okay with it?

284
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,280
Hello.

285
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,600
Where are you?

286
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,790
Your mom is about to fall asleep waiting for you.

287
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,900
I just finished my errand.

288
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,840
I’ll be home in five minutes.

289
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,540
Hurry up.

290
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,470
I got it.

291
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,580
Mom!

292
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,500
Mom, are you okay?

293
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,960
I’m okay.

294
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,420
I was going through my old stuff and this box fell down.

295
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,880
Right.

296
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
You scared me.

297
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,590
Mo, come and look at this.

298
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,170
Are these Heng’s photos?

299
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,940
Yes.

300
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,920
Wasn’t he cute?

301
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,680
I took all these pictures.

302
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,280
Wait, Mom.

303
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,770
Why he was crying in many pictures?

304
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,260
He was a crybaby.

305
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
He’s been like this since he was young.

306
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,570
So I want him to have someone to be there for him when I am gone.

307
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,470
Mo.

308
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,370
Have you ever seen Heng’s girlfriend?

309
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
You can say I have.

310
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
What kind of person she is?

311
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,960
They were friends.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,960
They have known each other for a long time.

313
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,000
But they started to date recently.

314
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,440
I think I will like his girlfriend.

315
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,450
What do you think, Mo?

316
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,000
What makes you think that?

317
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,560
I already like her because she can tolerate Heng.

318
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,430
She also helps him to become more mature.

319
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,290
I made the right decision to leave the house.

320
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,140
Oh.

321
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,110
I found it.

322
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,210
The ring his dad proposed to me with.

323
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,500
It’s time to pass it on to Heng.

324
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,500
I’m so tired.

325
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,190
Mo, I’m coming.

326
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,800
Will I make it in time?

327
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,480
Now, I finally get to meet his girlfriend.

328
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,890
Mom.

329
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,910
Can I borrow your charger?

330
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,340
Chicha, is that you?

331
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,160
Hello, Mom.

332
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,380
You are back.

333
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,800
I knew it.

334
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,640
Heng’s only close friend is Chicha.

335
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,590
If it’s you, I can rest in peace.

336
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,450
What are you talking about?

337
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,460
I’m sorry.

338
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,180
Oh.

339
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,590
Chicha, what are you doing here?

340
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,300
Heng.

341
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,300
Why don’t you take Chicha, your girlfriend…

342
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,200
inside to have dinner?

343
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,180
What?!

344
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,510
Let’s have dinner.

345
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,870
Come in, sweetie.

346
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,920
I prepared a big meal.

347
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,760
Chicha, come and have dinner with me.

348
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,480
Yes.

349
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,760
Come on.

350
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,100
(Go inside.)

351
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
Mo.

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,030
Come in.

353
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,040
What’s going on?

354
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,910
Why is Chicha my girlfriend?

355
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,910
Let’s go in.

356
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,890
What?

357
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,670
My mom tohught Chciha was my grilfriedn? (My mom thought Chicha was my girlfriend?)

358
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,960
But I think…

359
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,070
She lkoos raelly hppay wehn she fndis out. (She looks really happy when she finds out.)

360
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,410
I think we soluhd jsut paly anlog thognit. (I think we should just play along tonight.)

361
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,100
Okay?

362
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,970
No. I dno’t wnat to lie to hre. (No. I don’t want to lie to her.)

363
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,240
If yuo are too afriad to tell hre the trhut, (If you are too afraid to tell her the truth,)

364
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,850
I wlil do it. (I will do it.)

365
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,870
Yuo cna’t do taht. (You can’t do that.)

366
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,280
What’s going on?

367
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,560
We are waving mosquitos away.

368
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,620
There are so many mosquitos.

369
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Here, I cooked every dish myself.

370
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,960
Dig in.

371
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,460
Wow, it looks yummy.

372
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,890
Can I taste it?

373
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,530
Sure.

374
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,710
It’s delicious.

375
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,350
Mom.

376
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,660
Why are you crying?

377
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,440
I’m happy.

378
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,160
Even if I died of cancer right now,

379
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,510
I wouldn’t be afraid because he has you by his side.

380
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,280
Chicha, please take care of Heng for me.

381
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,400
Yes.

382
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,000
I’ll do my best to take care of him.

383
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,530
You don’t need to worry.

384
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,260
Thank you, sweetie.

385
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,980
We won’t stop until we get wasted.

386
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Mom, easy.

387
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,350
Mom, Mom, Mom.

388
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:02,800
Mom.

389
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,920
Mom, easy.

390
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,300
Wow!

391
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,380
Hold on, Mom.

392
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,390
You are sick.

393
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,090
I’m happy.

394
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,500
Can you let me drink for one day?

395
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,410
Can ask you something?

396
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,410
I have a girlfriend like her.

397
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,300
Why are you happy about it?

398
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,200
What?

399
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,240
Heng.

400
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,650
You were always complaining.

401
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,420
Every time you wanted to ask her out,

402
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,750
she already had a boyfriend.

403
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,980
When you decided to ask another girl out, you couldn’t move on from her.

404
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,590
Now, you get what you wish for.

405
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,710
Mom.

406
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,420
Mom.

407
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
You already got drunk after drinking just one beer.

408
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,020
You are talking nonsense.

409
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,310
Cheers.

410
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,680
Cha, cheers.

411
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,610
Mom, cheers.

412
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,620
What I said is true.

413
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,720
Eat a lot so you will grow bigger.

414
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,060
Eat this too.

415
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,720
My

416
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,260
Don’t only drink. You will get drunk soon.

417
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,160
Chi.

418
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,970
Thank you for today.

419
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,820
It’s not a big deal.

420
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,640
Let’s wait until her biopsy result comes out.

421
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,400
Then we can decide what to do next.

422
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,820
I’m leaving.

423
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Mo, wait.

424
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,480
Are you mad at me about that?

425
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,750
Why would I be mad at you?

426
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,590
It was all in the past, right?

427
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,960
One more thing,

428
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
this is what I chose.

429
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,340
I…

430
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
I saw you looked sad.

431
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,280
I just feel like I’m a villain.

432
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
If I was not in the picture,

433
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You would get to be with the girl you had had a crush on.

434
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:30,810
Your mom would be happy for real.

435
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,820
Mo.

436
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:02,840
You know? I don’t need to end up with a girl.

437
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,910
I could fall for a bad boy.

438
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,150
If you don’t believe me,

439
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,490
I’ll prove it to you.

440
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,980
Wait, Heng.

441
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,590
Why?

442
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,420
Your mom might see us.

443
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,960
I told you

444
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
I’m going to prove it to you.

445
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,640
Your mom probably goes through her stuff again.

446
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,580
I guess.

447
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,060
Let’s go check on her.

448
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,770
Mom.

449
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,320
Mom, what’s wrong?

450
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,420
My stomach hurts.

451
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,240
Your stomach hurts?

452
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,240
Mo, call an ambulance.

453
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,180
I got it.

454
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,560
Mom, hold on.

455
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,300
I can’t take it anymore.

456
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,000
Mom, is it that bad?

457
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,090
Mo, is the ambulance coming?

458
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,700
Wait a sec.

459
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,520
I can’t breathe.

460
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,330
Mom, stay strong.

461
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,760
Mom.

462
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,480
Heng.

463
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,690
I’m right here with you. Don’t worry. Okay?

464
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,870
I can’t breathe.

465
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,690
I can’t breathe.

466
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,420
Calm down.

467
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,610
(Emergency Room)

468
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,470
Mom.

469
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,840
Mom, stay strong.

470
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,080
Your dad’s ring.

471
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,970
This is the ring your dad proposed to me with.

472
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Give it to the one you love.

473
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,280
Mom.

474
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,300
Please wait outside.

475
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,880
She’ll be okay.

476
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,220
(How are you doing? We barely talked these days.)

477
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,080
(I’m doing fine.)

478
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,350
(I’m free tomorrow. Can I go to hang out with you after your bar is closed like we used to?)

479
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,230
(I’m sorry. I’m very busy these days.)

480
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,980
(I can’t go see you for a while.)

481
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,960
The doctor asked you to come in to hear the patient’s exam results.

482
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,660
Yes.

483
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,730
Heng, aren’t you coming?

484
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,420
No matter what her result is,

485
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I’ll tell my mom the truth.

486
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,470
Heng.

487
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,880
Is this your type?

488
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,020
Yes.

489
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,540
Isn’t he cute?

490
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,240
Yes.

491
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,760
Do you like a sweet guy?

492
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,830
They are pink. They look yummy.

493
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,940
Have you ever had pink milk?

494
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,550
Wait.

495
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,980
What is going on?

496
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,960
Her biopsy result is out.

497
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,530
It’s not a cancer.

498
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,940
Why did she have a stomachache?

499
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,690
She drank too much lime soda.

500
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,540
That was why her stomach hurt.

501
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,370
I already prescribed medicine for her.

502
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,020
She will be well enough to be discharged tomorrow.

503
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,020
Excuse me.

504
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,800
Thank you.

505
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,970
Thank you.

506
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,050
What?

507
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,390
I read on the internet that it can cure cancer.

508
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,600
No way.

509
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,680
If it was true, then no one would die of cancer.

510
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,740
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it to happen.

511
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,170
If you fall for these myths again,

512
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,720
I won’t help you.

513
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,240
I’ll let you die from stomachache.

514
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,180
I’m sorry.

515
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,120
You’re acting like a kid.

516
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,360
My little puppy.

517
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Don’t cry.

518
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,760
You’re crying like a baby.

519
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Look at it in a positive light, the drink helped me burp.

520
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,140
My baby.

521
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,420
Mom, don’t do this again.

522
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,400
It’s okay. I’m okay now.

523
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,870
It’s been almost a week.

524
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,990
I still don’t have a chance to tell my mom.

525
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,960
It’s okay. We can find a chance to tell her.

526
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,000
I think this is serious.

527
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,590
What is serious?

528
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,980
It’s Meow.

529
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,320
After she broke up with Thua-ngok,

530
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,320
she has been acting like this.

531
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,600
Why? She is working hard.

532
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,800
Usually, she barely worked.

533
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,310
She mostly spent time gossiping.

534
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,800
That’s right.

535
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,740
She started to work on the unfinished work from last year.

536
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,980
I think we need to do something about it.

537
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,980
Heng, do something.

538
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,990
Sure.

539
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,400
Girls, give your work to me. I’ll do it.

540
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,970
Give it to me.

541
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,050
I almost finished this one.

542
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,180
I don’t want to have free time.

543
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,380
Come on. Give it to me. I want to work.

544
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,380
Meow, please take a break.

545
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,870
Today, you are working harder than you have ever done in your entire life.

546
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,040
Let me work.

547
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,280
I don’t want to have racing thoughts.

548
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,470
Meow, please take a break.

549
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,860
Get out of my way.

550
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,410
I’ll get the work from the last five years to do.

551
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,810
How about this? We will go hang out tonight.

552
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,380
I found a new club.

553
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,620
I guarantee that it’s awesome.

554
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,770
Very.

555
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,240
Awesome.

556
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,730
Very.

557
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,280
Awesome.

558
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,960
Very.

559
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,430
Awesome.

560
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,460
Very.

561
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:17,920
Awesome.

562
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,880
Very.

563
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,680
Awesome.

564
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,330
Very.

565
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,440
Come in, guys.

566
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,990
Meow, this way.

567
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,740
Come this way.

568
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,980
Have a seat.

569
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,940
Make yourself comfortable.

570
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,560
I’m a regular customer here.

571
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,250
It looks different from other restaurants.

572
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,260
They are the same.

573
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,590
But here they have young men to service you.

574
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,020
Guys, come out and introduce yourself.

575
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,520
You can choose which one you want.

576
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,360
I’ll buy drinks for you.

577
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,260
I want him.

578
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,180
No.

579
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,390
He’s mine.

580
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
He’s yours?

581
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,240
Do you like a goofy guy like First?

582
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,200
No.

583
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,400
What about a cute guy like Khaotung?

584
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,170
No.

585
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,430
Mark?

586
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,190
No.

587
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,650
Ohm?

588
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,020
No.

589
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,540
Jimmy?

590
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:25,960
No.

591
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,940
What about Sea?

592
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,680
You don’t like any of them.

593
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,220
No, thanks.

594
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,380
Meow, don’t be shy.

595
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,080
Your man left you.

596
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:39,900
Now, it’s time to move on.

597
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I want to move on.

598
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,290
But he is the only man I want to be here.

599
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,940
Meow, since you said that.

600
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,860
The last host, please come out.

601
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,400
Hit me harder, hurt me deeper

602
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:11,290
I’m addicted to pain, your wish is my command

603
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,070
What are you doing here?

604
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,960
Don’t be confused, Meow.

605
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,400
Thua-ngok asked us to help throw a surprise for you here.

606
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:50,240
He didn’t stop contacting you because he didn’t like that you are a single mom.

607
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,940
Wait.

608
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,280
Did you all know?

609
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,820
Yes.

610
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,710
He got another job.

611
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,850
So he can assure you that he can take care of you.

612
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,660
Meow, although I look like Shin-chan,

613
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,620
I am serious about you.

614
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,570
Thua-noi, she won’t trust you because you’re acting like this.

615
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,700
Please let a professional do the talking.

616
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,580
Boss.

617
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,820
Meow.

618
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,720
I understand how hard it is to be both a mom and a dad to your kid.

619
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,110
But you are strong enough to choose this path.

620
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,580
You’re doing an excellent job.

621
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,830
What is harder for single parents like us

622
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,100
is to open our hearts and let someone in to take on the parent’s role with us.

623
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,700
But you already found that person.

624
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,570
I hope you will open your heart and give him a chance.

625
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,830
Don’t do it for him.

626
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,420
But do it for yourself.

627
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,580
I believe that this time,

628
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,270
you choose the right man.

629
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,230
Meow.

630
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,940
Will you marry me?

631
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,720
I promise I will do my best to take care of you and your daughter.

632
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,100
Thua, I want to tell you this.

633
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,610
Though I’m acting like a next-door neighbor,

634
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,980
I want to be next to you.

635
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,320
I asked Meow what she liked about Thua-Ngok.

636
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,460
He can’t cook.

637
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,530
He can’t sing.

638
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,600
If this was a movie,

639
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,420
he would be just a background actor.

640
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,480
Meow answered me that she wasn’t sure why she fell for him.

641
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,890
I’m kidding.

642
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,540
I think it’s because Thua sees Meow as his female lead.

643
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,920
There’s no way that she wouldn’t see him as her male lead.

644
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,530
We want to thank you for showing us

645
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,270
even though we may not be someone special,

646
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,970
we can still be a special person for someone.

647
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:40,590
Today, we prepared a small gift for you.

648
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:49,120
That is our favorite song from Thua’s album.

649
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,980
Please enjoy it.

650
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,320
That smile you always criticize

651
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,660
Saying it can't compare

652
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,000
But the more I look into your eyes

653
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,700
The more I see beauty there

654
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,740
That picture you asked me to erase

655
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,840
You told me to delete it

656
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,060
Cuz it caught you in an awkward place

657
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,980
But I saved it still, I love it

658
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,280
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

659
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:56,640
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

660
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,890
Want to see you every time I wake

661
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,110
Thank you for being someone great

662
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:05,080
Someone I’ve been searching for

663
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:09,860
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

664
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,980
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

665
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,350
No precious gift I need

666
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,520
Just stay the same like this, please

667
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,770
And this is the very best of all

668
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:28,120
My quiet world, once dull and gray

669
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,240
You came and painted it in bright shades

670
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,370
The way you ramble, the things you say

671
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,790
I could listen to you all day

672
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,140
You ask me if you look okay

673
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,120
I'll answer every time though you don't hear what I say

674
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,960
You're the sweetest of all, I can't stop smiling for sure

675
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,000
I can never ask for more

676
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,940
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

677
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,330
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

678
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,770
Want to see you every time I wake

679
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,960
Thank you for being someone great

680
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,980
Someone I’ve been searching for

681
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,380
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

682
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,990
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

683
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,120
No precious gift I need

684
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,530
Just stay the same like this, please

685
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,730
And this is the very best of all

686
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,060
It’s the very best of all

687
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,210
It’s the very best of all

688
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,080
It’s the very best of all

689
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,630
It’s the very best of all

690
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:53,800
You are the very best of all

691
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,670
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

692
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,280
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

693
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,460
Want to see you every time I wake

694
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,730
Thank you for being someone great

695
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,730
Someone I’ve been searching for

696
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:16,090
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

697
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,800
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

698
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,800
No precious gift I need

699
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:27,340
Just stay the same like this, please

700
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:32,410
And this is the very best of all

701
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,670
I’m going to tell my mom today that I am dating you.

702
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:58,450
Fine.

703
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:11,920
Mom.

704
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,560
What?

705
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,990
Can I talk to you?

706
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,950
Why?

707
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,520
What?

708
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,850
Do you want to talk to me about Chicha?

709
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,570
Huh?

710
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,840
How did you know that?

711
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,520
Do you forget who I am? I’m your mom.

712
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,740
You don’t need to rush it.

713
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,970
You should wait for me and Ou-noi to come back from our trip around the world.

714
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,440
You can hold a wedding then.

715
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,340
No, I…

716
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,380
Alright. You shouldn’t rush things.

717
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,320
I know how you feel.

718
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,760
Chicha, come here.

719
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,230
We haven’t taken a family photo together.

720
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,420
Chicha, come here and take a family photo together.

721
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,130
Come on, let’s take a family photo there.

722
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,100
Come on. This way.

723
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,100
Let’s go.

724
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,220
I still keep all his toys.

725
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,400
If he has children, he doesn’t need to spend money on toys.

726
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,120
Talking about his kids, I’m worried they will be crybabies like him

727
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,950
Dear lord,

728
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:34,330
please help his kids to be strong like their mom.

729
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,320
Chicha, do you see Mo?

730
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,550
No.

731
00:51:53,483 --> 00:51:54,550
Chicha.

732
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,440
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell my mom the truth.

733
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,396
But it’s okay.

734
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,390
She will leave soon.

735
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:14,123
Today will be the last day I ask you to be my fake girlfriend.

736
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,607
Good.

737
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:27,061
Because I’m tired of using a sweet voice when talking to you,

738
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,127
calling you my bae,

739
00:52:29,163 --> 00:52:31,709
and laughing at your stupid jokes.

740
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:37,992
What I’m sick of the most is to tell everyone I love you

741
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,749
and why.

742
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,676
Chi.

743
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,090
Chi.

744
00:52:57,563 --> 00:52:59,560
Why are you crying?

745
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:02,610
I’m not crying.

746
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,563
Yes, you are crying.

747
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,800
You asked me to pretend to be your girlfriend.

748
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:15,396
But you suddenly said you want out.

749
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,790
It means I’m rejected.

750
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,956
I’m sorry.

751
00:53:44,836 --> 00:53:46,385
I’m sorry.

752
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:15,418
Oh, dreams, in dreams, my heart feels so free

753
00:54:15,447 --> 00:54:20,472
Each time I dream, things are the way I wish them to be

754
00:54:20,516 --> 00:54:24,836
No more hiding this love I’ve locked deep within

755
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:28,218
(I want to see Heng be in a relationship.)

756
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,403
(Can you do that for me before I die?)

757
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,465
(Even if I died of cancer right now,)

758
00:54:36,494 --> 00:54:41,338
(I wouldn’t be afraid because he has you by his side.)

759
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:49,723
Not just a memory fading in time

760
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:58,341
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

761
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,127
Mom, where are you going?

762
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:14,261
I’m going to the airport.

763
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,978
Our flight is departing tonight.

764
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,680
Do you want me to go get Heng?

765
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,930
So you can say goodbye to him.

766
00:55:20,974 --> 00:55:22,385
No, it’s okay.

767
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,014
I left like this before.

768
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,214
If I see him, I won’t be able to leave him.

769
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,712
Mo.

770
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:31,200
Thank you so much.

771
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,087
Thank me for what?

772
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,320
Thank you for staying by his side.

773
00:55:38,363 --> 00:55:40,989
Now, I can travel without worrying about him.

774
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:45,250
I hope you and Heng will stay good friends forever.

775
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:50,465
Shall we go, Ou-noi?

776
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:51,992
Sure.

777
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,174
Can I link your arm?

778
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,756
Bye.

779
00:55:56,865 --> 00:55:58,160
See you, bro.

780
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,956
(The ring his dad proposed to me with.)

781
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:32,472
(It’s time to pass it on to Heng.)

782
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,610
(Your dad’s ring.)

783
00:56:36,632 --> 00:56:40,116
(Give it to the one you love.)

784
00:57:06,996 --> 00:57:09,534
Mo, what are you looking for?

785
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:10,785
Do you want me to help you?

786
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,203
Where is it?

787
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,927
Stay away.

788
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,581
Did you hide money here?

789
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,701
Let me see.

790
00:57:19,738 --> 00:57:20,596
How much did you hide?

791
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:21,614
Why do you need to hide it?

792
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,974
You hide money from me?

793
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:24,189
You can’t do that. Mo.

794
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:24,989
Tell me.

795
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,698
I told you to stay away.

796
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,418
Don’t do this.

797
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,810
Let’s break up.

798
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:11,876
Bluhh!

799
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,578
Are you kidding me?

800
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:17,090
I like this joke. It’s so funny.

801
00:58:17,229 --> 00:58:18,349
Can you do it again?

802
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,621
I’m serious.

803
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,058
What?

804
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,432
I don’t want to be with you anymore.

805
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:48,550
Mo, Mo, Mo, wait.

806
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,436
Why?

807
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,378
I’m working hard to improve myself.

808
00:58:58,414 --> 00:59:00,661
Now, I do the laundry and clean the house.

809
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,436
I help you do it.

810
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,294
Is it because of Chicha?

811
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,989
That I asked her to be my fake girlfriend.

812
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:09,978
Is it about that?

813
00:59:10,021 --> 00:59:11,498
No, it’s none of them.

814
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,112
Mo.

815
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,378
If they are not the reasons, what else can it be?

816
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,352
Is it because of my mom?

817
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,280
How about this? I’ll call to tell her that you and I…

818
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,010
It’s none of them.

819
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:36,850
It’s because it hurts.

820
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:45,650
You need to admit that we have nothing in common.

821
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,589
We will break up anyway.

822
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:50,916
I don’t want to hurt more than I already did.

823
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Mo, Mo, wait.

824
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:00,625
I love you.

825
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,978
I love you, Mo.

826
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,898
I love you.

827
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,058
I love you, Mo. Please don’t go.

828
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,425
I’m begging you.

829
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:24,189
Please.

830
01:00:24,218 --> 01:00:25,534
I’m begging you.

831
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,752
I really love you, Mo.

832
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:30,734
Mo.

833
01:00:31,483 --> 01:00:33,480
No. Don’t do this.

834
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,385
Mo, don’t do this.

835
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,556
Why?

836
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,927
Just tell me.

837
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,941
Because I don’t want to be with you anymore.

838
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,669
I don’t want to love you anymore.

839
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,581
I mean it.

840
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,600
I don’t want to love you anymore.

841
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:46,152
Mo.

842
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,403
Mo.

843
01:01:59,745 --> 01:02:05,265
Keep it hidden, locked away, locked away inside - 		Mo.

844
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:11,076
Bury it deep, where no one sees, where it can safely hide Why are you leaving me?

845
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:17,505
The secret in my heart never to be known

846
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:21,985
I keep dreaming on my own

847
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:28,560
Just a fleeting moment with you here beside me

848
01:02:28,603 --> 01:02:34,269
Even if it’s a dream, I’d stay asleep willingly

849
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:40,392
'Cause you are my sweetest dream, and I don't want to wake

850
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:44,218
Let time slip away

851
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:11,752
Oh, dreams, in dreams, my heart feels so free

852
01:03:11,796 --> 01:03:16,734
Each time I dream, things are the way I wish them to be

853
01:03:16,778 --> 01:03:23,112
No more hiding this love I’ve locked deep within

854
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:28,130
In dreams, I can tell you everything

855
01:03:28,189 --> 01:03:34,523
False awakening, I wish dreams come true

856
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:39,490
Where everything I imagine repeats anew

857
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:45,963
Not just a memory fading in time

858
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:54,676
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

859
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,556
Thua and Meow will sit here.

860
01:04:13,592 --> 01:04:16,538
The tables on this side are for the guests.

861
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,229
Let’s test microphones for our performance.

862
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,065
Here.

863
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,167
Hello, hello.

864
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:29,098
Hello.

865
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,480
Hello.

866
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:34,778
What?

867
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,978
What do I like about him?

868
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,480
It’s because…

869
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,618
When I’m with him, I get to taste delicious things every day.

870
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,509
I’m not talking about food.

871
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,323
What are you talking about?

872
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,774
You will find out on our wedding night.

873
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,112
What about you?

874
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:09,110
What do you like about me?

875
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:21,483
It’s because he’s a loser.

876
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:29,192
When things get hard, he will give up easily.

877
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,076
What?

878
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,592
I have nothing good?

879
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,781
But when it comes to us,

880
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:47,090
he’s willing to do things he has never done.

881
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:54,421
He’s willing to be someone I never thought he could be.

882
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,890
Thank you.

883
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,669
After saying that, aren’t you supposed to…

884
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,498
give a peck on my cheek now?

885
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:05,396
You told me to go back to be your old boss.

886
01:07:05,432 --> 01:07:08,210
But where is my old subordinate?

887
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,207
Boss.

888
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,665
Can you help me bring back the old Heng?

889
01:07:12,072 --> 01:07:13,660
Good morning, Hengney.

890
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:16,618
this man is Mr. Tanaka Kenta, the president of our company.

891
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:19,098
He asked me to work with him at the head office in Japan.

892
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,847
He told me I could bring an assistant with me.

893
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:24,312
You are the top salesman of our team.

894
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:26,981
Do you think I should go to Japan?

895
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:28,560
A great opportunity like this,

896
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,429
it would be stupid if you let it go.

897
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,792
Boss is so nice to you.

898
01:07:32,814 --> 01:07:34,790
Why do you still look unhappy?

899
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,163
Then how can I move on from you?

900
01:07:37,229 --> 01:07:39,985
If you don’t want to regret it,

901
01:07:40,029 --> 01:07:42,989
you should tell him these things.

902
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,669
Heng is dumb.

903
01:07:44,698 --> 01:07:47,294
If you don’t tell him, he will never know it.

904
01:07:47,323 --> 01:07:49,650
Since we are going to move to Japan together.

905
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:51,076
Will you marry me, Hengney?

906
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,978
Can you come to meet me at the park at 7 pm?

907
01:07:54,385 --> 01:07:55,396
I have something important to tell you.

908
01:07:55,425 --> 01:07:56,327
Mo.

909
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,101
Mo.
