1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,610
How can a Boomer like me compete with a young man like Mo?

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,360
You need to get up and fight.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,360
You need to defeat Mo.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,320
I knew you had a cold.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,730
Don’t try to stir things up.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,580
Heng is not that kind of person.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,140
I’ll go there and prove it.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,480
I’ll open your eyes to the truth.

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,880
Mo trusts you.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,140
But look at what you are doing.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,000
Mo, I want you to know.

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,770
If it’s you, I’m not afraid to tell the whole world about our relationship.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,730
If you’re the only one in the world who accepts me for who I am,

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,800
that’s good enough for me.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,220
Let’s go meet my parents.

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,690
Sure.

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,370
What?! Mo!

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,300
Stay still.

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,200
(Heng.)

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,680
What, Heng?

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,350
Ten, I got sick.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,500
The doctor told me to take a sick leave for three days.

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,300
I can’t go meet the client with you.

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,140
What, Mo?

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,310
Boss, my mom has an emergency doctor's appointment in Bangkok.

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,090
I need to take a leave for three days.

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,210
Okay. Get well soon.

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,570
Go take care of your mom.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,380
Don’t worry about work.

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,200
I’ll have someone cover your work.

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,210
I’ll take care of it.

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
Thank you.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,080
Mo, why can’t we tell them that we’re on a trip together?

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,030
Heng, we have many frenemies in our team.

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,940
If we told them the truth, do you think they would let us take the leave?

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,380
Follow me.

37
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,630
Don’t you overthink it?

38
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,130
You are the one who underthinks.

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,710
Since we are here,

40
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,280
should we head to my parents’ house?

41
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,830
Wait.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,170
I just got here.

43
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,980
Isn’t it too soon to meet your parents?

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,650
Why?

45
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,970
You don’t want to meet my parents?

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,280
Of course, I really want to meet them.

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,010
Before we go to see them,

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,690
can we stop by a place first?

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Fine.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,090
Let’s go, Bro.

51
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,050
(Lampang Train Station.)

52
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,650
I heard that if we come to Lampang,

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,550
we need to come here first for good luck.

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,390
Do you need good luck meeting my parents?

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,640
Yes, all my life,

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,940
I have never met my girlfriend’s parents.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,940
You are the first one.

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Really?

59
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,580
This might make you feel better.

60
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,160
You aren’t the first boyfriend I have introduced to my family.

61
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,510
That’s great.

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,660
Wait.

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
How many boyfriends did you introduce to them?

64
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,710
Who was the first one?

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,930
Was it Ten?

66
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,360
Why? Are you jealous?

67
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,970
No.

68
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,020
I’ll go back to my prayer.

69
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,750
Dear lord, please help get his parents to like me.

70
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,690
Amen.

71
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,360
We finished visiting the temple.

72
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,920
Now, it’s time to meet my family.

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Heng.

74
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,380
Heng.

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Heng.

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
Heng, what are you looking at?

77
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,450
I…

78
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,480
That.

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,810
I want to ride a horse carriage to enjoy the town.

80
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
No, I want to go home.

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,680
It’s hot and I’m tired. I want to go home.

82
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on, Mo. We’re here. We should try it.

83
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,080
No.

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,210
Please.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,170
We can hire a carriage for sightseeing and take us to your home.

86
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,020
Please, please, please.

87
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,120
Please, please, please.

88
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,850
Please, please, please.

89
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,090
Okay?

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,870
Fine.

91
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,890
Yay!

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,840
Let’s go.

93
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,406
You go first and you need to pay for it.

94
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,360
Sure, I’ll pay.

95
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,380
Let’s go.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,080
This must be my lucky day

97
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,270
That made you turn my way

98
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,170
To win your love, I played my every card

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,856
And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

100
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,970
Woohoo!

101
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,080
Don’t get over-excited.

102
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,160
Yes, you are my lucky star

103
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,790
Can we freeze this moment in time?

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,680
To win your love, I played my every card

105
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,970
Watch your steps.

106
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,040
I should be the one who says that.

107
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,500
Oh! I’m kidding. And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

108
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,240
Look, whose eggs are they?

109
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,710
I don’t know.

110
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,860
La la la la la la la la la la la la

111
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,760
La la la la la la la la la la la la

112
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,020
Look, it’s boiling.

113
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,170
And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

114
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,570
Hoo!

115
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
It’s hot.

116
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,970
I just knew that Lampang has hot springs.

117
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,810
Do you know the water is hot enough to boil eggs?

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wait.

119
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,420
Didn’t you say we would go to my home?

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
Why did we end up here?

121
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,440
You’re right.

122
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,570
Why?

123
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,600
Heng, tell me the truth.

124
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,110
You’re trying to delay us from going home, right?

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,610
You took me to learn ceramic painting,

126
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,610
play a slide, go to Mae Moh, and come here.

127
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,290
I didn’t do it.

128
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,130
I didn’t mean to delay it.

129
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,250
I just want you to get relaxed before going home.

130
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Relaxed?

131
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,090
I feel so good and relaxed.

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,450
Can we go to my house now?

133
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,680
Wait.

134
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,920
Since we are at the hot spring, we should eat onsen eggs.

135
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,950
There’s a shop selling eggs.

136
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,830
It’s around five kilometers away from here.

137
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,880
Honey, I’ll go buy them for you.

138
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,000
You don’t need to go.

139
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,340
I already bought and boiled them.

140
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,400
Boiled eggs need to be eaten with a sauce.

141
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,450
Honey, there’s a grocery shop around ten kilometers away.

142
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,990
I’ll walk there and buy it.

143
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,160
It’s okay.

144
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,420
I have both soy sauce and pepper.

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,860
Add whatever you want.

146
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,640
I forgot my boyfriend is very well-planned.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That’s right.

148
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I’ll peel the eggs for you to eat.

149
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,970
After that, we should head home.

150
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,630
Hold on.

151
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
You peel it the wrong way.

152
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,120
This is how to do it.

153
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,050
Ouch.

154
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,370
What the heck?!

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,040
I used to do this to my friends when I was young.

156
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,270
For fun.

157
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,260
Does it look like I enjoy it?

158
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,770
You seem to enjoy it.

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,540
I peel it for you. Nom nom.

160
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Nom.

161
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,560
How is it?

162
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,720
It tastes quite good.

163
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Right.

164
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,890
Today might not be as bad as I think.

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Right?

166
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,340
I’ll peel an egg for you.

167
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,110
Sure.

168
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay.

169
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,480
Lift your head and brace for my egg.

170
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,450
Swipe your hair to the sides.

171
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,760
Good.

172
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,140
Here we go.

173
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Damn.

174
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
See?

175
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,060
I knew it was going to happen.

176
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,730
Why this always happens to me?

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,170
Heng, I’m sorry.

178
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,010
I checked that the eggs were all cooked.

179
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,100
I guess I missed this one.

180
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,140
It’s okay.

181
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,110
I guess today is not my day.

182
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,870
How do I dare to go there?

183
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,870
Go where?

184
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,980
You mean go to meet my family?

185
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,890
Why?

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Don’t you want to meet my parents?

187
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,930
Yes, I really want to meet them.

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
But…

189
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,760
But it will get dark soon.

190
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,760
I don’t think we should go to see them at night.

191
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,760
We should go see them tomorrow in the morning.

192
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,680
Where are we going to stay tonight?

193
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,590
Right.

194
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,250
I found a lovely homestay near here.

195
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Shall we go?

196
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,020
Really?

197
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Yes.

198
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Shall we go?

199
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
Sure.

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Shall we go?

201
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,140
Yes. What are you waiting for?

202
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,650
Yes. Let’s go.

203
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,650
Here it is.

204
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
Hello.

205
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,470
There are two of us.

206
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,750
Do you have any room available?

207
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,250
Yes.

208
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,230
Mo!

209
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,400
Hello, Mom.

210
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,970
Hello, Mom.

211
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
What?

212
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Mom?

213
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,920
Don’t tell me that…

214
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,200
this is…

215
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,610
your home.

216
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,410
Yes.

217
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,970
What?

218
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,580
I have a bad feeling about this.

219
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,710
I’m so tired.

220
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,340
Mom, do you have anything for me to eat?

221
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Come in.

222
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,720
Can I go in?

223
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,420
Come on in.

224
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Yes.

225
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,320
Mo.

226
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Wow.

227
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,920
You prepared a big meal.

228
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,580
Why didn’t you tell me you brought a friend?

229
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,280
I would have prepared a room for him.

230
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,860
It’s okay.

231
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,880
Is he the friend you told me about?

232
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Yes.

233
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,070
You look better than I thought.

234
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,900
You still look young and pretty.

235
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,350
You’re making me blush.

236
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:12,870
Mo.

237
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,620
What?

238
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,980
Your family is very friendly.

239
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,250
Why?

240
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,500
Do you think they would look scary like the in-law's family in drama?

241
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,940
In most series, in-law-parents usually act like the last boss in a game.

242
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Stop nagging me.

243
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,490
Dad, you’re home.

244
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,000
Come and have dinner with us.

245
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,110
I thought you forgot how to come home after living in the city for so long.

246
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,010
Who is he?

247
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,610
I…I…I…

248
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I…

249
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,920
I’m Heng.

250
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,250
I…

251
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,380
He’s my boyfriend.

252
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,130
What did you say?

253
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,640
This is bad.

254
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,850
I never told you before.

255
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,750
I like men.

256
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,620
Mo, didn’t you tell me your family knew about it?

257
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,260
Please calm down, Dad.

258
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,030
Don’t call me ‘Dad’!

259
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,200
Heng, try the Sai Ua sausage.

260
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,910
I made it myself.

261
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,000
What? I also helped you.

262
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,420
You only help set the table?

263
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,970
Let’s eat.

264
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,280
Enjoy it.

265
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,560
Hold on, everyone.

266
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:32,980
It’s very delicious.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,980
Can you pay attention to what just happened?

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
Dig in.

269
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Hello?

270
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,780
Hey.

271
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,880
Hey.

272
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,110
Boss, what are you doing here?

273
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,980
What about you?

274
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,410
You said Mo’s mom came to the city.

275
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,500
So I came to visit her.

276
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,310
Right.

277
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,490
I heard that Heng is sick.

278
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,170
So I came to visit him.

279
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,240
Do you…

280
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,970
- Do you like Heng? - Do you like Mo?

281
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,730
At this point, I’ll tell you the truth.

282
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,390
Actually,

283
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,820
I was dating Mo.

284
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,420
I see.

285
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Alright.

286
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
I…

287
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
I…

288
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
I confessed my feelings to Heng.

289
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,540
But he rejected me.

290
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,210
But I won’t give up.

291
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,400
Me too.

292
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,520
I think…

293
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,500
we should go in and shoot our shot again.

294
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Boss.

295
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,130
Yes.

296
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,060
The house is dark.

297
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,460
I don’t think they are home.

298
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,760
Heng and Mo aren’t home.

299
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,770
Don’t tell anyone.

300
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,530
Mo took Heng to introduce to his family.

301
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,830
Oops.

302
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,810
I should spill the tea to others.

303
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,940
Boss, we are too late.

304
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,880
What should we do?

305
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,300
They went to meet Mo’s family.

306
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Calm down.

307
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,980
Do you know where Mo’s family lives?

308
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,490
You never thought my house would have a hot spring, did you?

309
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Not at all.

310
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,120
Don’t you worry about your dad’s reaction at all?

311
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,750
I’m begging you.

312
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,170
Why are you worried about it? Relax.

313
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,240
I told him everything I wanted to say.

314
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,390
Mo, he is your father.

315
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,970
One more thing,

316
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,960
I want him to approve of me first.

317
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,540
More importantly,

318
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,290
I don’t want you to choose between me and him.

319
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,730
You are such a gentleman.

320
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,610
I brought towels for you.

321
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Thanks.

322
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,880
Thank you, Baimon.

323
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,820
My dad may look like a tough man.

324
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,620
But he has a weak spot for persevering people.

325
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,510
Really?

326
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,340
What do I need to do?

327
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,340
If you want to know,

328
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,140
come to meet me tomorrow morning.

329
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,050
I’ll tell you how to win over my dad.

330
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,300
Are you serious?

331
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Yes.

332
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,400
Are you sure?

333
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Sure.

334
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
Okay.

335
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Okay.

336
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Oops.

337
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,770
Now, I have some hope about your dad.

338
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Good.

339
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
This is how to win over my dad.

340
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,680
Firstly, he likes hardworking people.

341
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,440
Good morning.

342
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,980
You’re up early.

343
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,970
Mon, I don’t think it’s working.

344
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,120
Are you tricking me to do the chores for you?

345
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,250
Nonsense.

346
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,130
Don’t you see that he gave you a side-eye?

347
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,460
That’s a good sign.

348
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,940
You should go clean the bathroom.

349
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,080
Clean the bathroom?

350
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Yes.

351
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,540
I’ll go after I finish here.

352
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,470
Clean over there too.

353
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,680
Here?

354
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Yes.

355
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,720
If there’s nothing unexpected, we will arrive in Lampang this evening.

356
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,520
You’re making good time.

357
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,980
I think we should make a stop to have a meal.

358
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
Huh?

359
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,970
Make a stop?

360
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,990
Yes.

361
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Ten.

362
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
You are acting like a rookie.

363
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,110
If we stop to have a meal,

364
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,630
we will waste 17.42 minutes.

365
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,720
We’d better buy something to eat in the car.

366
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,610
That’s right.

367
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,080
I forgot about that.

368
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,840
Keep this in mind.

369
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,060
Every second we are wasting,

370
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,570
we may lose them forever.

371
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
Boss.

372
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,240
I think we will be stuck here for hours.

373
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,560
(Secondly, Dad likes pleasers.)

374
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,930
Uncle.

375
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,060
Mon told me you have back pain.

376
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,610
Do you want me to give you a massage?

377
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,620
Huh?

378
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,530
Why did you get in?

379
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,620
Didn’t you say ‘Uh-huh’?

380
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,560
I said ‘Huh?’ not ‘Uh-huh’.

381
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,260
Get out.

382
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:19,900
I heard that rangers work very hard to protect our beautiful forest.

383
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,100
Please let me give you a message to repay for your hard work.

384
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,210
May all of the animals live happily and free from suffering.

385
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,680
Amen.

386
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,950
Fine.

387
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,400
Thank you, Uncle.

388
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,040
I will not disappoint you.

389
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,450
May I?

390
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,740
How is it?

391
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,440
Based on your look, I thought you were 60.

392
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,640
I’m only 52.

393
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,860
I’m sorry.

394
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,730
To be honest,

395
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,900
I want to tell you that you are amazing.

396
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,840
You do a great job of taking care of both the homestay and the forest.

397
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,250
The homestay belongs to my wife.

398
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,820
Anyway, you also did a great job in raising Mo.

399
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,700
Everyone praises that he’s talented, smart, and hardworking.

400
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,640
He must get that from you.

401
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Well said.

402
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,980
This is why…

403
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:46,160
I don’t want him to date a loser like you.

404
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,700
Your massage is terrible.

405
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,380
It’s so damn painful.

406
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Stop giving me a massage.

407
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,690
Dad.

408
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Who is your dad?

409
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,180
I’m screwed.

410
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,730
I’m so screwed.

411
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,100
Give me the money.

412
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,620
Alright.

413
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,620
Hurry up. Put it in the bag.

414
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
Don’t worry.

415
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,340
Thieves usually run away after they get the money.

416
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,380
This would take around 34.52 minutes.

417
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,180
Boss, this is not the time to worry about losing them.

418
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,560
But you are right.

419
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,620
I’m worrying about it too.

420
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,310
Shh! Keep your voice down.

421
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,656
We don’t want the thief to notice.

422
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,860
Hurry up.

423
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,450
Notice what?

424
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,770
Notice that we have called the police.

425
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Huh?

426
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
You’re so busted, bastard.

427
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,760
Who called the police?

428
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,370
This is the police.

429
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,120
The thief in the store, surrender yourself.

430
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,380
Don’t come in or I’ll shoot.

431
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,080
Calm down.

432
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,630
Let’s talk.

433
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,040
Put your weapon down.

434
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,760
We can talk.

435
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,240
The thief in the store, surrender yourself.

436
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,370
- This is the police. - Don’t come in or I’ll shoot.

437
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,300
Two hours fifteen minutes and sixteen seconds.

438
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,230
Seventeen, eighteen.

439
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,390
Boss, if things continue like this,

440
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,970
Heng will win over Mo’s family before we get there.

441
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,300
Someone needs to sacrifice themselves.

442
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,980
One of us needs to distract the thief.

443
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,680
The other will use the diversion to run away and go to Lampang to stop them.

444
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,240
But this is dangerous.

445
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,990
There’s nothing more dangerous than losing them.

446
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,010
Then…

447
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,960
I’ll distract him.

448
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,840
No, I’m your boss.

449
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,380
I should do it.

450
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,200
No, you have done so much for me.

451
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,630
Stop talking, Ten.

452
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,890
Boss.

453
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,250
Please tell Heng…

454
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,890
I want to thank him for making a widow like me smile again.

455
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,230
Although it’s been only a short time.

456
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,610
Boss.

457
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,690
Please tell him that.

458
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,170
Guys.

459
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,680
The thief has surrendered himself to the police.

460
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
What?

461
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,360
It’s resolved quite easily.

462
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,420
We wasted 2 hours 18 minutes and 14 seconds.

463
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,450
But it’s okay.

464
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,626
We can speed up in Phitsanulok.

465
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,650
Let’s go.

466
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,220
Hello. Are you alright?

467
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,870
I’m okay. Excuse me.

468
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,310
We need you to go to the police station to give your statement.

469
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,310
Can we do it later?

470
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,260
I need to go to Lampang now.

471
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,656
No, you all need to give your statement at the police station.

472
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,430
Please get in the car.

473
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,220
Hengney.

474
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,980
Mo.

475
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,790
Please cooperate with us.

476
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,600
This way.

477
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,480
Hey, don’t listen to Mon.

478
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,480
Even if you clean the whole house, my dad won’t appreciate it.

479
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,840
Answer me.

480
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,720
Do you love Mo?

481
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,010
Ye…yes.

482
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,410
Say it louder.

483
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Yes.

484
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,080
When I asked his mom out,

485
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,330
her dad told me to fight in a ring with a district boxing champion.

486
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,560
I finished the match and got permission to date her.

487
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,210
If you want to date him,

488
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,970
follow me.

489
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,220
Dad, where are you taking him?

490
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,360
Quiet.

491
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,940
This is between me and him.

492
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,070
Get in the truck.

493
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Get in the truck.

494
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,370
Yes.

495
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,320
How are you going to test me?

496
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,990
Take off your shirt.

497
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
What?!

498
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,870
Why did you tell me to do that?

499
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,180
We need to switch our clothes.

500
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,180
Take me to get some drinks.

501
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,720
My wife and kids cannot know about this.

502
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,820
Wait, Uncle.

503
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,520
You are not testing me.

504
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,930
You are sneaking out to have fun.

505
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,890
Do you want to date Mo?

506
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Yes.

507
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,960
I’ll do it.

508
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,970
Give me your shirt.

509
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,750
Take it off.

510
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,970
Yes.

511
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,850
I’ll help you.

512
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,350
Is it legal for me to wear the Ranger uniform?

513
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,750
What’s the problem?

514
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,900
My wife often wears it to the market.

515
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
But I…

516
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,620
I’ll wear it.

517
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,080
I thought you would take me to an infused spirit stand.

518
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,440
I went there but my blood pressure spiked after drinking.

519
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,150
My wife told all the stand owners not to sell drinks to me.

520
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,780
Does this mean I shouldn’t take you here?

521
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,620
It’s only a few drinks.

522
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,170
It’s okay. We won’t stay long.

523
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,420
Let’s go in.

524
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Come on.

525
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Watch the road.

526
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Come.

527
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,350
Mo.

528
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
Are you serious with him?

529
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,010
Of course.

530
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,860
He is the first man Mo introduced to us.

531
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
So…

532
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,530
Are you okay with it?

533
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,920
What are you talking about?

534
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
I’m talking about everything.

535
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
Whatever you do that makes you happy,

536
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,530
I’m fine with it.

537
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,540
Thank you, Mom.

538
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,800
Give me a hug.

539
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,020
I love you.

540
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,070
Mo.

541
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,780
Can I ask you something?

542
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,370
What do you like about Heng?

543
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,520
He’s kind of slow-witted.

544
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,070
He believes everything I say.

545
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,370
What do I like about Heng?

546
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,530
It’s because…

547
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,580
he taught me to do this.

548
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,520
Mo!

549
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,320
Mom.

550
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,530
It really hurts.

551
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,850
Sorry.

552
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,720
Do you still remember me?

553
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,240
Mom.

554
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,620
Mom.

555
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,730
Do you still remember me?

556
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,170
Mom, look what he did.

557
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,320
Ouch.

558
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,460
I’m too busy eating.

559
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,480
It hurts.

560
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,100
I’ll scold him after I finish eating.

561
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,690
(Lampang, So Lonely…)

562
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,960
I made a drink for you, Dad.

563
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,020
Who did you call Dad?

564
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,570
We are drinking together.

565
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,220
You can call me pal.

566
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,380
You can’t take it back, Pal.

567
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,820
I am just kidding.

568
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,900
Did I pass your test?

569
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,620
I have one more test for you.

570
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,330
Just tell me.

571
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,900
You can cross oceans or move mountains for you.

572
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,960
I’ll do anything.

573
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,520
Show me your dance.

574
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,710
Huh?!

575
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,560
Why did you tell me to dance?

576
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,500
I want to see a spicy dancer.

577
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,730
But it’s okay if you don’t want to do it.

578
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I’ll do it.

579
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,940
Hey, if you don’t want to dance, just sit down.

580
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,210
Go back to your seat.

581
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,890
I’ll do it. I’ll dance for you.

582
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,700
A bit more.

583
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,650
How am I doing?

584
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,590
You’re doing great, Heng.

585
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,420
Dance harder, harder.

586
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,540
You can date my son.

587
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,260
Do you mean it?

588
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,770
Yes.

589
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
Yay!

590
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,400
I’m sorry, Mate

591
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,210
Who is your mate?

592
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,230
Do you want to try me?

593
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,620
(No fighting allowed. (50,000 baht fine for violation.)

594
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,970
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.

595
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,920
Hey, wait.

596
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:31,660
I know that he rubs you in the wrong way

597
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,340
But you do the same to him.

598
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,850
Both of you rub each other in the wrong way It’s a tie.

599
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,380
Do you want an extra time for it?

600
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,920
Why are you butting in?

601
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,066
Gramps, you should stay home and feed your grandchild.

602
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,770
How dare you say that to me, scumbag?

603
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,076
Who did you call scumbag, oldhead?

604
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,450
My imaginary friend.

605
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,420
Please don’t hurt him.

606
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,290
If you want to hit him, you can take it on me.

607
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,520
Why didn’t you say it earlier?

608
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,450
Hey, stop it.

609
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,710
Shit.

610
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,110
Blood.

611
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,330
Heng, I’m bleeding.

612
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,570
Blood.

613
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,580
What should I do?

614
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Heng.

615
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,580
Dad, are you okay?

616
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
I don’t think I can drive, Dad.

617
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
Who did you call Dad?

618
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,350
You can call me pal.

619
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
It’s not time to play a joke.

620
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,320
You should sit down.

621
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,760
I feel dizzy.

622
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,400
Calm down.

623
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,870
I feel dizzy, Heng.

624
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,450
Sit down and wait here.

625
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,520
Hurry up, Heng.

626
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Wait a minute.

627
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,980
Help.

628
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,130
Help.

629
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,550
- Heng, I’m going to pass out. - Help.

630
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,550
Hengney.

631
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,770
Boss.

632
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,940
Heng.

633
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,810
Ten.

634
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,850
Hengney.

635
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,680
Boss.

636
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Heng.

637
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,680
Ten.

638
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Hengney.

639
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,510
Boss.

640
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
Hey!

641
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,180
Are you going to keep calling each other?

642
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,960
I’m bleeding to death.

643
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,530
What happened?

644
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,900
He’s injured.

645
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,530
What happened?

646
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,570
He cut his hand with a bottle.

647
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,410
Come this way.

648
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,470
Walk slowly.

649
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
I can’t walk.

650
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,940
Watch your step.

651
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,010
Okay.

652
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,320
Who will drive?

653
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,960
Me?

654
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,620
You scolded me when I ate fried food.

655
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,340
How could you sneak out to drink?

656
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,180
Honey.

657
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,470
I’m sorry.

658
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,440
I’m sorry for lying about the leave.

659
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,210
You know that lying is the one thing I hate the most.

660
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,320
I’m sorry.

661
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,950
What are you two doing in the town?

662
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,600
Right. What are we doing here, Ten?

663
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,000
Boss, what are we doing here?

664
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
We…

665
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,330
Right…

666
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,690
We are here for this.

667
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,070
We came here to take care of the hospital purchase deal.

668
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,346
The hospital wants us to represent them.

669
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,010
The hospital’s director is calling.

670
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,160
Hello, Director.

671
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,990
Wait a sec.

672
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,910
Sure.

673
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,930
Hey.

674
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,680
Hey.

675
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,630
Hey.

676
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,650
You.

677
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,490
Come here.

678
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,130
Yes.

679
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,380
Tell my wife…

680
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,980
that you were the one who wanted to the bar.

681
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,690
Yes.

682
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,500
I took him out for drinks.

683
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,980
If you want to scold someone, you can scold me.

684
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,010
I’m sorry.

685
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,700
He already turned himself in.

686
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,980
He confessed everything.

687
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,360
I’m just testing you.

688
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,330
I wanted to know if you would take the fault for me.

689
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,980
You passed my test.

690
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,610
Does this mean Mo can date Heng?

691
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,190
Yes.

692
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Wow!

693
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,720
Thank you, Dad.

694
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,680
You still cannot call me Dad.

695
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,040
Ouch.

696
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,940
Don’t try to act tough.

697
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,940
Ouch!

698
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,540
It hurts.

699
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,370
My hand is injured.

700
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,700
The wound could split open.

701
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,330
I’m sorry.

702
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,616
- Mom, calm down. - Does it hurt?

703
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,390
You did this to yourself.

704
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,120
We came all the way here to stop them.

705
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,250
Why did you choose to be a hero who helped them be together?

706
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,970
That’s right.

707
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,000
We wasted our time.

708
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,390
Why are you smiling?

709
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,200
Because Heng is smiling.

710
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,980
I can’t help smiling too.

711
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,800
Although this trip unexpectedly forces us to let them go,

712
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,260
it’s okay.

713
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,020
Nothing to worry about.

714
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,410
Heng, let’s take a plane next time.

715
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,990
This is exhausting.

716
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,320
I’ll pay for my own ticket.

717
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,970
Wait, we’ve been away for only a few days.

718
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,410
But why does the plant dry out?

719
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,690
You can go in first. I’ll water the plant.

720
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Okay.

721
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
Hey.

722
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,410
Hey.

723
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,590
Who are you?

724
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,990
Who are you?

725
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,080
I live here.

726
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,250
You live here?

727
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,270
Yes.

728
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,410
Mom.

729
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,580
When did you come back?

730
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,190
Hello, Mom.

731
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,210
What?

732
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,570
Is she your mom?

733
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,590
Is he your friend?

734
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,930
Yes.

735
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,690
Thank you

736
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,100
for taking my dad to the hospital and explaining to our boss.

737
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,850
It’s not a big deal.

738
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,280
I see your dad as mine.

739
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,120
But…

740
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,331
I haven’t scolded you for taking my dad out to drink.

741
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,428
I’m sorry about that.

742
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,742
But you also lied to me.

743
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:37,177
What did I lie to you?

744
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,434
I am the first boyfriend you introduced to your family.

745
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,725
Your sister told me everything.

746
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,680
Nonsense.

747
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,222
Don’t believe every word she says.

748
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,000
Is it true?

749
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,308
I won’t tell you.

750
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,371
Come on, Mo. Tell me.

751
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,211
Please.

752
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,805
Tell me.

753
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:10,222
Please, tell me.

754
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,720
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

755
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:22,102
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

756
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,337
Want to see you every time I wake

757
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:26,542
Thank you for being someone great

758
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:30,531
Someone I’ve been searching for

759
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,137
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

760
00:46:35,148 --> 00:46:39,594
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

761
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,982
Why did you become quiet?

762
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,605
Continue what you have to say.

763
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,594
I don’t want to talk anymore.

764
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,977
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

765
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,491
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

766
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:02,662
Want to see you every time I wake

767
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:04,891
Thank you for being someone great

768
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:08,851
Someone I’ve been searching for

769
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,622
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

770
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:17,960
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

771
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,982
No precious gift I need

772
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:24,502
Just stay the same like this, please

773
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:29,428
And this is the very best of all

774
00:47:32,502 --> 00:47:34,948
What do you need all this money for?

775
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:36,742
100 things I want to do before I die.

776
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:40,000
I want to see Heng be in a relationship.

777
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,571
Can you do that for me before I die?

778
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,982
Why don’t you take Chicha, your girlfriend…

779
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:47,988
inside to have dinner?

780
00:47:48,017 --> 00:47:48,811
Huh?!

781
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:51,285
Even if I died of cancer right now,

782
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,262
I wouldn’t be afraid because he has you by his side.

783
00:47:56,285 --> 00:47:58,840
The ring his dad proposed to me with.

784
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,840
It’s time to pass it on to Heng.

785
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,771
No matter what her result is,

786
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,988
I’ll tell my mom the truth.
