1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,786
I want to see Heng be in a relationship.

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:07,113
Can you do that for me before I die?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,393
I think if she tastes your stuffed omelet,

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,980
she will definitely fall for you like I did.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,866
My mom tohught Chciha was my grilfriedn?

6
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,360
Even if I died of cancer right now,

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,766
I wouldn’t be afraid.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,993
You asked me to pretend to be your girlfriend.

9
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,640
But you suddenly said you want out.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,033
It means I’m rejected.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,786
Let’s break up.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,146
Mo.

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:35,993
Why?

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,800
I’m working hard to improve myself.

15
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:41,360
I’ll call to tell my mom that you and I…

16
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,046
It’s none of them.

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,980
It’s because it hurts.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,700
You need to admit that we have nothing in common.

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,740
We will break up anyway.

20
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,700
I don’t want to hurt more than I already did.

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,986
I mean it.

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,720
I don’t want to love you anymore.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,320
I’m going to be late.

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,573
I’m going to be late.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,226
Good morning, Hengney.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,166
Good morning, Bossie.

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,780
(If you wonder how my life ended up like this, )

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,993
(I’ll take you back to one year ago.)

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,746
ONE YEAR AGO

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,746
(After Mo dumped me, a manly man like me quickly moved on from him.)

31
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:01,400
(I went out to meet new people.)

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,426
(I dedicated my life to work.)

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,580
(I left my painful past behind.)

34
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:10,606
Wake up.

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,353
(Jae, there was an abandoned house in my neighborhood.)

36
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,880
(A rotten smell came from the house.)

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,600
(When I walked into the house, I found a dead body on the couch.)

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,433
(At night, there was a wailing cry, )

39
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:39,326
(as if they were waiting for someone to set them free.)

40
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,513
Boss, can you grab the remote control

41
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,006
and change to a game-casting channel for me?

42
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,500
I’m not here to help you.

43
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,153
I’m here to fire you.

44
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,800
Boss.

45
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,480
Boss.

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,506
Boss, I’m Heng, your beloved brother.

47
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,620
No.

48
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,213
You told me to go back to be your old boss.

49
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,826
But where is my old subordinate?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,020
Boss.

51
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,606
Can you help me bring back the old Heng?

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,046
Please, Boss.

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Please.

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,006
Please help me bring back the old me.

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,926
Please help me one more time.

56
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:01,080
I’m begging you.

57
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:02,173
Please, Boss.

58
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,966
I’m begging you.

59
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,970
Please.

60
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,760
(After that, my boss sometimes came to give me intensive training.)

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,293
(From once a month to once a week

62
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:31,366
(and to several times a week.)

63
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,620
(Mo, Newyear, Heng, May)

64
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,650
(Nid, Ten, Mo, Newyear, Heng, May) (After Cher-aim went to study in Japan, )

65
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,893
(Boss felt lonely and decided to move in with me.)

66
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:52,633
(Heng)

67
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,500
PRESENT TIME

68
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,633
We still have some time left.

69
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,630
I’ll check the document again.

70
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,820
Are you nervous?

71
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,710
Yes.

72
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:50,020
Aren’t you nervous?

73
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,986
This is probably the biggest deal in our career.

74
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,806
Yes, I’m also nervous.

75
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,966
We can do it.

76
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,000
Mr. Tanaka is here.

77
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Hello.

78
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,340
Hello.

79
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,346
Good morning, sir.

80
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,440
We are from Okaeri Real Estate.

81
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,626
This is for you.

82
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,386
I’m Tanaka.

83
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,220
Thank you so much.

84
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,026
Thank you.

85
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:37,826
Just get to the point.

86
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,340
I have more important things to do.

87
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Okay, sir.

88
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:49,606
We have your information that you’re interested

89
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:53,560
in renting a pool villa in the city center.

90
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,466
And we’re…

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I ordered an Americano.

92
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,980
Not a Frappuccino.

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Oh.

94
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Why stop?

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,700
Keep going.

96
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,853
We prepared the list…

97
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,360
Sorry, sir.

98
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
I don’t want you to be our customer.

99
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:27,593
Heng.

100
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,726
Our company’s philosophy is that

101
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,986
we don’t just sell houses, we sell homes.

102
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,750
If we sell it to you,

103
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,153
you will ruin the happiness of the other customers.

104
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:54,726
Sorry. I will take you to the restroom. Okay?

105
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,000
Actually, this man is Mr. Tanaka Kenta,

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,000
the president of our company.

107
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,833
Hello. Konnichiwa.

108
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,886
Konnichiwa.

109
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:15,040
This is a setup.

110
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:18,060
He arranged it to test you, Heng.

111
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,000
Test me?

112
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,033
Yes.

113
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,233
Is this a hidden camera show?

114
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,146
The thing is, he asked me to work with him at the head office in Japan.

115
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,086
He told me I could bring an assistant with me.

116
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,286
You are the top salesman of our team.

117
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:38,280
He wants to know your mindset.

118
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,986
Me?

119
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,020
How about this?

120
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,893
Do you want to come to work with me in Japan?

121
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:54,906
Thank you.

122
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,333
Thank you.

123
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,680
We have another hour before the clients arrive.

124
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,973
I think…

125
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,500
we should try out the room first.

126
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,760
The clients are a couple.

127
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,169
They are tall and have large builds.

128
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:32,746
I want to make sure they won’t feel cramped when living together.

129
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,133
Why don’t you come to sit and test the couch with me?

130
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,993
Do you feel uncomfortable?

131
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,793
No.

132
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,753
I don’t feel uncomfortable.

133
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,700
It usually takes a while

134
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,186
to know how you really feel about the bed.

135
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
You’re right.

136
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,433
So…

137
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,520
Did you start packing?

138
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,953
Oh.

139
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,786
I haven’t decided if I’m going or not.

140
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,593
Why?

141
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,346
The job there offers high pay.

142
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,260
That’s true.

143
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,980
The video games there are much cheaper.

144
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,690
You are still obsessed with games?

145
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,586
I have no one to stop me.

146
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,990
Mo.

147
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,400
What?

148
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,680
Since we are testing the amenities, we should check everything.

149
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,140
Do you feel cramped?

150
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,320
No, it feels intimate.

151
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,353
Would you take it?

152
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,473
I mean the job in Japan.

153
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,560
If I go,

154
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
I will be away from everyone here.

155
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,570
Do you think I should go?

156
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,270
Yes.

157
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,000
A great opportunity like this,

158
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,386
it would be stupid if you let it go.

159
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,453
Congratulations, Hengtang.

160
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,099
You are going to work abroad.

161
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,506
Wait, wait.

162
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,793
How did you know that?

163
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,913
I didn’t tell anyone except our boss.

164
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,966
Meow knows about me more than I do.

165
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,786
That’s right.

166
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,906
I know more than this.

167
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:16,253
I know that before you leave, you will register your marriage at the Bangsai district office.

168
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,400
Then you will move to start your family in Kansai.

169
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:22,213
You will buy a Siberian Husky to raise as your pet.

170
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,853
Before you mention another “Sai”,

171
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:27,606
I’ll make it clear. Boss and I will move there for work.

172
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,886
There’s nothing between us.

173
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:30,706
What?

174
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:31,726
Huh?

175
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,650
Are you sure?

176
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,986
You have been living together for over a year.

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,913
There’s really nothing between you two?

178
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:37,606
Right.

179
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,760
Yes, he and I are not dating.

180
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,260
He just moved in with me

181
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,980
because he missed his daughter.

182
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,440
Really?

183
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:48,213
Yes.

184
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,326
Are you sure?

185
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,180
I’m sure.

186
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,113
You are not lying?

187
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,173
No, I’m not.

188
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,180
You are full of yourself.

189
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,246
Yes, I am.

190
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,440
Then I’m leaving.

191
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:56,733
Where are you going?

192
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,813
(Maria Wantana Attasethakul)

193
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,293
Please wish me luck.

194
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:57,293
Boss.

195
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,780
Yes?

196
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:01,846
Thank you for helping me with the shopping.

197
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,030
It’s not a big deal.

198
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,000
It’s my job.

199
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,466
Boss, that’s Nanon.

200
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,266
Say yes, say yes

201
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:31,320
Please just say I do Who?

202
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:32,646
He’s very famous.

203
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,746
I can sing all of his songs.

204
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:35,840
Really?

205
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:36,526
Yes.

206
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,126
Oh baby please just say I do,

207
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,973
say yes, say yes

208
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:45,660
Please just say I do

209
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,626
I can hear a bell ringing

210
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,413
when I look at you for a long time

211
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,573
The picture of us on our wedding day

212
00:17:57,606 --> 00:18:01,013
It’s getting clearer, I almost can’t wait for it

213
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,613
Today is the perfect time to tell you this, woah

214
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,360
Why are they dancing the same moves?

215
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,853
Please stay still and don’t take a peek

216
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,253
I’ll get on my knee and say this to you

217
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:21,186
I want to spend every second of the rest of my life with you

218
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,506
I can’t wait anymore as I dream about us

219
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,713
Please tell me, will you marry me?

220
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,673
Oh baby please just say I do,

221
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,720
say yes, say yes

222
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:39,346
Please say yes to me Does someone prepare this surprise?

223
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,446
It’s time

224
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:48,546
Will you say it, say it, say it baby

225
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:51,033
I think we should dance along with them.

226
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,613
Boss?

227
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Where did he go?

228
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,813
The words I’m longing to hear, please say it, uh woh oh

229
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:07,346
My hands are shaking, my heart is racing, I can’t help it, uh woh oh

230
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:14,993
Oh baby please just say I do, say yes, say yes

231
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:19,693
Please say yes to me

232
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,713
It’s time

233
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:28,546
Will you say it, say it, say it baby

234
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:33,173
Please say yes to me

235
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,233
It’s time

236
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:41,753
please just say I do, say yes, say yes

237
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:48,866
please just say I do, say it baby

238
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,353
Since we are going to move to Japan together.

239
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,860
Will you marry me, Hengney?

240
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:06,860
Boss.

241
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,610
Yes.

242
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,406
(What a freaking day is this?)

243
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,413
You said yes to his proposal?

244
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,200
If you were me, could you embarrass Nanon?

245
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,986
What he said is reasonable.

246
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,246
But marriage isn’t something you can take lightly.

247
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,293
I don’t know. I don’t want to think about it.

248
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
It gives me a headache.

249
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,440
Fine.

250
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,860
Tomorrow, I’ll tell him to cancel the wedding.

251
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:27,886
Okay?

252
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Boss.

253
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,049
Hengney, it’s great that you are here.

254
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,973
I have someone I want to introduce to you.

255
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,093
This is the team that will create our dream wedding.

256
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:39,526
They usually only work with socialites.

257
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,866
Luckily, I am well-connected.

258
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,813
This is Hengney in the flesh.

259
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:48,220
Hello.

260
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Hello.

261
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,466
Come and sit here.

262
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Come here.

263
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,150
Come on.

264
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,976
Please choose the theme for your wedding.

265
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Sure.

266
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,280
Boss, I think I don’t want…

267
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,662
You want me to pick the theme of our wedding, right?

268
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:04,980
I’m choosing it.

269
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,140
Do you like this one?

270
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
I chose this one.

271
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,413
No.

272
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
You don’t like it?

273
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,293
Okay. I’ll go with this one.

274
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:17,060
Boss, I think I…

275
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,346
You want to talk about your hairstyle now?

276
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,386
Why you’re in such a hurry?

277
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,760
But it’s okay.

278
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:25,196
Do you think what hairstyle will suit him for the wedding theme?

279
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,980
Can I not do it?

280
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:28,006
Huh?

281
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:37,906
You don’t want to do it?

282
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,886
Fine. Do what you want.

283
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:48,800
I don’t mind if you don’t want to do your hair.

284
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,780
Right? I’ll let him do what he wants.

285
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:53,813
Right

286
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,993
Please go to the next room for tailor measurement.

287
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,500
We have a dozen of staff waiting for you.

288
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:01,126
Boss, I…

289
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,193
Hurry up. We don’t have much time.

290
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:04,326
Go, Hengney.

291
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:05,153
Go.

292
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,520
- Boss. - Please take care of him.

293
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,073
I’ll assign Heng’s clients to us based on their area of residence.

294
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,466
Here is the list.

295
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,386
Okay.

296
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,500
Thank you.

297
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,226
If you want to talk about taking over his work,

298
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:30,820
we can do it at the office.

299
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,206
We don’t need to come here to talk about it.

300
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,846
I don’t want Heng to know how busy we are

301
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,526
because we have to take over his clients.

302
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,720
Are you sure?

303
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,906
Yes. If he finds out,

304
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,406
he will feel bad and refuse to go.

305
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,706
I’m talking about letting him marry our boss.

306
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,273
Why?

307
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,660
Our boss is a great guy.

308
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,980
Otherwise, Heng wouldn’t choose to marry him

309
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,966
Didn’t you tell me Heng is the type who doesn’t know how to say no?

310
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,800
Maybe he didn’t want to say yes.

311
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,953
But it has nothing to do with me.

312
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,766
Excuse me.

313
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Mo.

314
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,346
Things get this far

315
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:34,886
because you keep running away.

316
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,433
If you’re still doing this,

317
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,430
how can I move on from you?

318
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,786
Because you want him to be happy,

319
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:51,026
you chose to ignore your feelings?

320
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,566
I think…

321
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,040
this is not love.

322
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,653
You haven’t finished your work?

323
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:53,993
No. I have to clear the backlog before I go.

324
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,500
But everyone has left.

325
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:20,906
You’re right.

326
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:23,666
I should go home too.

327
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:25,433
I’ll work on it tomorrow.

328
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Hey.

329
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,153
About the wedding,

330
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
I…

331
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,900
I am happy for you.

332
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,353
Thanks.

333
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,680
I mean…

334
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,553
What do you want to say?

335
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:34,886
Are you free this evening?

336
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,433
There’s a new ramen shop open.

337
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,186
Do you want to go with me?

338
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
No.

339
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
But if you go to Thua-ngok’s bar,

340
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,720
I’ll go with you.

341
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Alright.

342
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,413
Welcome to the bachelor party.

343
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,673
Mo, did you trick me into coming here?

344
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,206
I asked him to help.

345
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:52,946
If it was someone else,

346
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,940
you would have caught on to the plan.

347
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Boss.

348
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,093
Everyone.

349
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,220
The truth is…

350
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:13,500
Surprise!

351
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,386
Cher-aim, why are you here?

352
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:19,146
I won’t miss your bachelor party for anything.

353
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,586
After my plane landed, I came straight here.

354
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,333
Thank you, sweetie.

355
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,000
Thank you.

356
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Heng, what were you saying?

357
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:32,253
I…

358
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,213
I’m very touched

359
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,006
to know how much you guys love me.

360
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,860
Come on. Take your seat.

361
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,000
Come here.

362
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,833
Go, go, go.

363
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,606
It hurts to see them together, doesn’t it?

364
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,313
What are you talking about?

365
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,100
We broke up for over a year.

366
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,866
I never dated him.

367
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,446
But it still hurts.

368
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,853
To tell you the truth,

369
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:36,300
I thought he would end up with you.

370
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
It could be,

371
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,413
if he could get over you.

372
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,913
Can I ask you something?

373
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,060
Why did you break up with him?

374
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,273
For someone like me,

375
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,120
I am used to people giving me the dirty eye.

376
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,973
For Heng,

377
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,593
I don’t want him to get the dirty eye,

378
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,293
because of me.

379
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,290
You’re acting like a hero.

380
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,946
Are you being sarcastic?

381
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,280
No.

382
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,526
I really mean what I said.

383
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:52,826
How about this?

384
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,706
Let’s compete to list Heng’s weak points.

385
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,620
Sure.

386
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,873
Heng, you are a dumbass.

387
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:10,820
Why did you agree to marry him?

388
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,740
Because you are a pushover.

389
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:23,993
That’s why you let him move in with you.

390
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,990
You know he likes you.

391
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,833
Why did you make room for him?

392
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:34,306
He’s so nice to you.

393
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,333
Why do you still look unhappy?

394
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:38,986
Then how can I move on from you?

395
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,453
If you don’t want to regret it,

396
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:54,953
you should tell him these things.

397
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,393
Heng is dumb.

398
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:04,426
If you don’t tell him, he will never know it.

399
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,753
I mean it.

400
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:14,433
Oh, dreams, in dreams, my heart feels so free

401
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,426
Each time I dream, things are the way I wish them to be

402
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:25,873
No more hiding this love I’ve locked deep within

403
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:33,900
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

404
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Alone.

405
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,790
Alone.

406
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,653
I bought a cake for you.

407
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,853
I’m leaving for Japan next month.

408
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Alone.

409
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,286
(Jae, there was an abandoned house in my neighborhood.)

410
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
What is this smell?

411
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,773
(A rotten smell came from the house.)

412
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,980
(When I walked into the house, )

413
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,673
(I found a dead body on the couch.)

414
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:15,606
Alone!

415
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,986
Alone!

416
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,320
Alone, why are you looking like this?

417
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,740
Alone.

418
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:29,300
He left me. He @&! hurt.

419
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
What?

420
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,193
Khaitong left me.

421
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:35,026
He said it hurt to be with me.

422
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,120
Hey, Alone.

423
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,353
Everywhere I look, it’s &@% of his &@!%.

424
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:45,160
You shouldn’t &%$@ this condo %&!@ me.

425
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,206
What?

426
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,073
I said everywhere I look, it’s full of his memory.

427
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,070
You shouldn’t have sold this condo to me.

428
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,626
Why are you blaming me?

429
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:55,800
Alone, calm down.

430
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:56,713
Listen to me.

431
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:57,846
You need to get up and be strong.

432
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:58,393
Come on.

433
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,073
I can’t.

434
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,660
Come on.

435
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,566
I can’t do it.

436
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:02,180
Come on.

437
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:04,966
I can’t. You &%@ not me,

438
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,120
you &@% never under&%$.

439
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:09,146
What?

440
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,920
I can’t do it. I have no strength.

441
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,920
You were not me, you would never understand.

442
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Alone.

443
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,440
Alone, pull yourself together.

444
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,713
Get up.

445
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,220
Listen to me.

446
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,506
I went through the same thing.

447
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,386
I was lying around like a dead man.

448
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:31,260
But you know if you continue like this,

449
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,333
Sometimes it feels lonely.

450
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,940
I want someone…

451
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,380
to hold me.

452
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,626
Yes, you need to get up and be strong.

453
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,080
Go, go.

454
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,600
Go, go, go.

455
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:48,346
Oh, no.

456
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:50,493
Alone, get up.

457
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:51,520
Come on.

458
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:56,370
Are you looking for a house or a condo?

459
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,726
Kaitong.

460
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,720
I broke up with Alone.

461
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
I’m here to look for a new place to live.

462
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,560
What about your condo?

463
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,833
I gave it to him and let him pay the rest.

464
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,306
I was the one who broke up with him.

465
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,993
Are you okay?

466
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,986
Calm down.

467
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,980
I’m not okay.

468
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,433
I still love him.

469
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:33,073
But I guess I don’t love him as much as his ex did.

470
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,686
His ex was better than me in every way.

471
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,306
Except for one thing,

472
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,606
I’m better looking than him.

473
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,180
I want to know how he looks.

474
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,640
Do you have a picture of him?

475
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,560
He looks a lot like you.

476
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,766
Are you teasing me?

477
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,760
This is not funny.

478
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,086
I’m not teasing you. I’m sorry.

479
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:12,340
He still can’t forget his ex.

480
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,513
So I chose to walk away from him.

481
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,540
You did the right thing.

482
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,706
I’m not running away, right?

483
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,380
Run away from what?

484
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:32,793
The pain,

485
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,666
from falling short of being the boyfriend I want to be.

486
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,306
Hey.

487
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,620
It’s better to sweat for house chores than to cry over love.

488
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,626
You’re right.

489
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:12,400
Now, I feel more energetic.

490
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:13,073
Good.

491
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:15,293
The next station is your bathroom.

492
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,900
Let’s clean it next. Okay?

493
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,320
Soon, I will be strong like you, right?

494
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:21,306
Yes.

495
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:23,046
I will forget him just like you did, right?

496
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,933
Right?

497
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,753
Right?

498
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,906
(Can you come to meet me at the park at 7 pm?)

499
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:42,800
(I have something important to tell you.)

500
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,280
(Okay.)

501
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,880
You continue to do the chores.

502
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,373
I got to go. I have something to do.

503
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,406
Where did he go?

504
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,093
- I can’t… - Alone.

505
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,520
Are you alright?

506
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:23,133
I can’t…

507
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,313
You can’t breathe?

508
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:27,140
Wait a sec. I’ll call an ambulance.

509
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,780
Is this the number?

510
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,986
(Emergency Room)

511
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,826
He had trouble breathing due to cumulative stress.

512
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:37,820
It probably caused GERD.

513
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,266
I already gave him an injection.

514
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,753
He should feel better soon.

515
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
That’s a relief.

516
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,040
Thank you.

517
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,040
Are you his family?

518
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,446
No, I was with him when it happened.

519
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,986
Can you stay with him until his family arrives?

520
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:56,980
In case there’s a medical emergency.

521
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,390
Sure.

522
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,213
Excuse me.

523
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Thank you.

524
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,793
It’s already 7 pm.

525
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,726
My phone.

526
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,940
Where is it?

527
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:34,913
(Speech for Our Wedding)

528
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,680
I would like to thank our guests

529
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:47,153
who came to congratulate me and Hengney.

530
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,533
Hengney, you forgot to sign out again.

531
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:03,646
(Can you come to meet me at the park at 7 pm?)

532
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,316
(I have something important to tell you.)

533
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,973
(Okay.)

534
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,326
(Patient: Mr. Chawinwut Nuntapiwat)

535
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Nurse.

536
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:50,373
Is his family here?

537
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:51,980
No.

538
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:53,366
Excuse me.

539
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Alone.

540
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Kaitong.

541
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,846
Hello.

542
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,473
Hello.

543
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,470
The hospital called me.

544
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,720
You didn’t tell them to call your family?

545
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
Sorry.

546
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,780
He’s the only one whose number I can remember.

547
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,873
I thought you wouldn’t come.

548
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,486
Why wouldn’t I come?

549
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,346
Your number,

550
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:36,340
I still save it as “My Boyfriend”.

551
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,066
I’m okay now.

552
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,960
Don’t leave me again.

553
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,580
Thank you, Heng, for…

554
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:02,466
He’s gone.

555
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,020
He’s gone.

556
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:16,753
Mo.

557
00:43:18,786 --> 00:43:19,786
Mo.

558
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:23,300
Mo.

559
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,366
Why did nothing go my way?

560
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,846
Why did he have to be sick today?

561
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:35,860
Why did I have to forget my phone?

562
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:37,466
Mo, you too.

563
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:39,500
Why can’t you wait for me?

564
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:42,366
I’ve been waiting for you for over a year.

565
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,026
I don’t know what you want to tell me.

566
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,846
But I want to tell you this.

567
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:03,300
I still love you.

568
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,680
Mo, do you hear me?

569
00:44:05,706 --> 00:44:08,013
I still love you.

570
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,826
Mo.

571
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,293
I heard you.

572
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,973
I still love you too.

573
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,400
That day,

574
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,420
I don’t want you to go through hardship because of me.

575
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:47,810
So I decided to let you go.

576
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:54,810
Mo.

577
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,560
If you are not happy,

578
00:44:58,366 --> 00:45:00,360
how can I be happy?

579
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
You said that to me.

580
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,973
Why did you make the decision on your own?

581
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:12,490
I asked you to meet me today.

582
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,933
Because I want to tell you…

583
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,533
I’m sorry.

584
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,553
I’m really sorry.

585
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,140
Please forgive me.

586
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:35,893
You ask me if you look okay

587
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:37,273
I'll answer every time

588
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,066
Yes.

589
00:45:38,086 --> 00:45:40,573
Though you don't hear what I say

590
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,433
You're the sweetest of all, I can't stop smiling for sure

591
00:45:43,466 --> 00:45:44,153
Come here.

592
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:48,513
I can never ask for more

593
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:53,373
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

594
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,006
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

595
00:45:58,026 --> 00:46:00,240
Want to see you every time I wake

596
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:02,353
Thank you for being someone great

597
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:03,973
Why are you crying?

598
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,540
Don’t cry.

599
00:46:05,573 --> 00:46:07,173
You’re on the verge of crying too.

600
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:08,446
I’m not crying.

601
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,120
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

602
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:14,440
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

603
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:15,473
Mo.

604
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,466
About me and our boss,

605
00:46:18,886 --> 00:46:20,880
there’s nothing between us.

606
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,446
About the wedding, it is my fault.

607
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,093
I couldn’t bring myself to say no to him.

608
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,420
Can you wait for me?

609
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,640
Tonight,

610
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,600
I’ll make everything right.

611
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,873
It’s the very best of all

612
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:01,280
It’s the very best of all

613
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,126
It’s the very best of all

614
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:10,273
You are the very best of all

615
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,346
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

616
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,760
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

617
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,960
Want to see you every time I wake

618
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,193
Thank you for being someone great

619
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:28,213
Someone I’ve been searching for

620
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,700
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

621
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:37,233
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

622
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,380
No precious gift I need

623
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,713
Just stay the same like this, please

624
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:48,693
And this is the very best of all

625
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,190
Boss.

626
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,440
(Speech for Our Wedding)

627
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,146
(First of all)

628
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,360
(I would like to thank our guests

629
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,413
(who came to congratulate me and Hengney.)

630
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
(Hengney.)

631
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:42,513
(The one year we’ve lived together is a joyful moment for me.)

632
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:50,900
(It’s the kind of joy I never thought I could have)

633
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
(No matter what tomorrow brings)

634
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,280
Boss.

635
00:49:05,313 --> 00:49:06,626
(This one year…)

636
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,273
(…will be in my heart.)

637
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
(Forever.)

638
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,540
Boss.

639
00:49:15,893 --> 00:49:16,893
Watch out.

640
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,506
Hey.

641
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,030
Heng.

642
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,220
Heng.

643
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,680
Heng.

644
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:35,713
Heng.

645
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:38,553
Help.

646
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,246
Please help me.

647
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,260
Help me.

648
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
Heng.

649
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:44,790
Heng.

650
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,550
Help.

651
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,880
Heng.

652
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,140
Heng.

653
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,613
He wasn’t hit by the van.

654
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,346
His head just hit the footpath.

655
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,780
From the initial examination, there’s nothing to worry about.

656
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,846
Thank you.

657
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,966
He is awake.

658
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,973
Where am I?

659
00:50:34,253 --> 00:50:37,793
Who are you?

660
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,790
What?

661
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,500
Bluhh!

662
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,240
Are you crazy?

663
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,630
I’m just kidding you.

664
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,220
I saw it in a movie. So I want to try it.

665
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,986
Is it the time for doing this, jerk?

666
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,940
You are all here.

667
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:08,400
There’s only Meow and Newyear at the event.

668
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,140
Will they be okay?

669
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:12,613
Event?

670
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:13,513
What event?

671
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,853
What event?

672
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:17,193
The event that I wear a mascot costume.

673
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:27,200
I lost consciousness after I tried to save Boss from a falling poll.

674
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,560
Am I right?

675
00:51:32,646 --> 00:51:34,360
Heng.

676
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,500
That event…

677
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,933
took place two years ago.

678
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,900
Bluhh!

679
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:50,780
Are you crazy, Boss?

680
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:52,820
You are kidding me, right?

681
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
Huh?

682
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,146
I think he has a concussion.

683
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,433
He lost the memories during the past two years.

684
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,140
Two years!

685
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,180
What the hell is today?

686
00:52:54,293 --> 00:52:55,293
Mo.

687
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,190
Mo.

688
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,453
Why did nothing go my way?

689
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,333
Why did he have to be sick today?

690
00:53:08,473 --> 00:53:11,233
Why did I have to forget my phone?

691
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,786
Mo, you too.

692
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,780
Why can’t you wait for me?

693
00:53:14,806 --> 00:53:17,666
I’ve been waiting for you for over a year.

694
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,133
I don’t know what you want to tell me.

695
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,546
But I want to tell you this.

696
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,293
I still love you, Mo.

697
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,766
I still love you.

698
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:47,593
Do you hear me?

699
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,420
Mo.

700
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,973
I love you too.

701
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,280
Because of the accident,

702
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:11,966
the patient lost his memories in the past two years.

703
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:14,613
Losing my memories for two years is not a big deal.

704
00:54:14,646 --> 00:54:15,093
Yes, it is.

705
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,500
What?

706
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,086
I’m so confused.

707
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,526
Did you propose to me?

708
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:22,793
I never knew that things got this far.

709
00:54:22,813 --> 00:54:26,033
I think Heng hasn’t gotten his memories back.

710
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:27,120
Heng.

711
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,933
I guess we need to compete for him again.

712
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,006
Heng.

713
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,840
Sure.

714
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,260
- Heng, I’m here. - I guarantee that this time I won’t go easy on you.

715
00:54:36,293 --> 00:54:38,260
Me neither.
