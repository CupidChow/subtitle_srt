1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:03,114
Welcome to our outing.

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:04,402
Mo, let me ask you straight.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,555
When you said you didn’t want to be my friend,

4
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:07,724
did you mean it?

5
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,445
Why don’t you want to be my friend?

6
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,497
I promise

7
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,263
that I will take you here and put a ring on you.

8
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:12,808
Boss.

9
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,614
Marry me.

10
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,013
So what’s the problem?

11
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,602
I’ve never seen him as anything else

12
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:20,900
apart from a boss.

13
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:22,801
You can’t even see him as anything else.

14
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:24,957
But you want me to see you as a friend.

15
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,400
You’re so selfish, Heng.

16
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:29,942
I’m sorry.

17
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,850
I understand now

18
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,745
that it’s impossible.

19
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,330
But I still want you as my friend.

20
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:38,017
Will you move back in with me?

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,617
This is the last time

22
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:48,197
I will do this to you.

23
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:49,629
After this,

24
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,885
you won’t see this version of me again.

25
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,905
If I think about remarrying someone,

26
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,017
would you mind it?

27
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:00,644
What?

28
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:08,185
Remarry?

29
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,444
So you have someone you like?

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,711
I…

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,700
Did you forget your promise
to love Mom forever?

32
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,437
I still love her.

33
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:21,902
But you’ll love that person too.

34
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:26,592
You will let her take Mom’s place.

35
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,491
She will throw me out of our home.

36
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:30,517
I’ll become a homeless, a school dropout,

37
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,517
a troubled kid, an addict, a criminal, a teen mom…

38
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:34,271
Wait, wait. You’re going too far.

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,527
I don’t have anyone yet.

40
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:40,548
Then why did you bring it up?

41
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,250
I…

42
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:47,548
I’m worried that you might feel lonely.

43
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:49,614
Lonely?

44
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,032
I have a sweet father like you.

45
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:02,900
I love you.

46
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,400
Always keep it in mind.

47
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:09,198
No one would throw you out.

48
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,362
I love you the most.

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,096
Dad.

50
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:10,568
Dad.

51
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:43,814
Hengney.

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,962
What did you say, Dad?

53
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:57,357
Honey?

54
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,287
Heng, Property Consultant?

55
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,333
Heng?

56
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:10,170
Why all his calls were to Heng?

57
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,848
Honey?

58
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,114
Who is it?

59
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:15,906
(After Mo moved back,)

60
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:20,300
(my house became a happy home again.)

61
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,035
Mo.

62
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:27,315
Where are you going?

63
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:28,816
I’m moving out.

64
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:29,494
Huh?

65
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,536
But you’re only back for less than a day.

66
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:32,702
Why are you moving out?

67
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:33,660
Look around.

68
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:34,896
I’ve been gone for only a short while.

69
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:35,983
But look at all the mess

70
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,549
you left all over the house.

71
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:40,942
I’ll clean it up after finishing this game.

72
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,496
Will you clean it now or will I move out now?

73
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:46,183
Mo, just give me a minute.

74
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,318
Do it now.

75
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:47,973
Fine.

76
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,866
Clean it now.

77
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,411
Don’t forget to take those balls too.

78
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:53,151
So rude of you.

79
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:55,487
They are not balls.

80
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:56,871
They are globes.

81
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,497
Why is there a hula hoop around the globe?

82
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,425
It’s not a hula hoop. It’s Saturn’s rings.

83
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:04,762
Don’t bully them.

84
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:05,979
They are cute.

85
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:08,743
- Let me see.
- Be gentle.

86
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,413
After taking a closer look at it,

87
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,653
it got this naïve looking just like you.

88
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:17,598
See? You’re falling for it, right?

89
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,136
The new version of the character is launched.

90
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,108
It’s not expensive.

91
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,448
Do you want to pitch in to buy it with me?

92
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:24,794
- Let’s pitch in.
- No.

93
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:29,977
Last month, you borrowed my money
to pay for the hotpot meal.

94
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,195
You haven’t paid me back.

95
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,717
If you don’t clean it up now,

96
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,068
I’ll take and sell them.

97
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,917
Don’t sell them, Mo. It’s hard to get them.

98
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,758
Be gentle with Mr. Saturnworld.

99
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,595
Be gentle.

100
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,200
Then you need to clean up your mess now.

101
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:45,976
I got it.

102
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:46,757
Hurry up.

103
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:48,850
I’ll clean up here.

104
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:54,619
Faster.

105
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,207
Mo, what did you hit me with?

106
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,398
My hand.

107
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,137
This is a corner unit.

108
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,348
It has a great view and
has been repainted recently.

109
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,601
It’s also fully furnished.

110
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:09,862
Miss.

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,632
What about the CAM fees?

112
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,502
Do you have a staff named Honey on your team?

113
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:24,100
Honey?

114
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:26,797
No.

115
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,564
What about Bee?

116
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:31,105
No.

117
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:35,604
Why are you asking about it?

118
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,737
I have a friend working at your company.

119
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,029
I wonder if you know her.

120
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:47,696
She probably works at another branch.

121
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:52,131
Do you like this room?

122
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,717
Or do you want to see other rooms?

123
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,853
I want to see other rooms.

124
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:59,594
But before we go to the next room,

125
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:01,605
I have a place to stop by.

126
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:33,979
Where is Heng?

127
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,202
Why are you asking me?

128
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,918
You sit next to him in the office.

129
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:41,100
I forgot you two are no longer housemates.

130
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:45,982
He went to meet a client.

131
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,414
If you have anything to give him,
you can give it to me.

132
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:53,404
I’ll see him at home later.

133
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,367
When did you move back to live with him?

134
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,657
Not long.

135
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,238
He was begging me to move back every day.

136
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,291
Can you give him this lunchbox?

137
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,198
He complained to me

138
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,354
that his meals at home were terrible.

139
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,382
Are you sure you want to leave it with me?

140
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:34,696
Miss.

141
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:38,121
We are providing residences for people.

142
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:42,257
But only for living people.

143
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:44,105
I know that.

144
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,751
I just want to stop by to visit my mom.

145
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:53,002
Wantana Attasethakul.

146
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:56,826
Why the last name sounds so familiar?

147
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,757
That’s our boss’s last name.

148
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,205
Don’t tell me that you are…

149
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:05,440
That’s right.

150
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,697
The truth is I’m your boss’s daughter.

151
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,096
Is this some kind of a sitcom?

152
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,825
Why did you take me here?

153
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,517
Before my mom died, my dad promised her

154
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,499
that he would love her forever.

155
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:29,989
After she died,

156
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:32,374
no matter how many women came into his life,

157
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,198
he has never wavered.

158
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,099
Until…

159
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:37,902
this Honey girl showed up.

160
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:39,840
Honey?

161
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:43,402
He said her name in his sleep.

162
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:45,797
I checked his phone.

163
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:50,198
The person he called the most is…

164
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:53,493
You!

165
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,097
Me?

166
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,357
I think this is a misunderstanding.

167
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:02,804
No, it’s not.

168
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:04,804
I know…

169
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:11,448
you are his closest friend.

170
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:13,201
I think you know who Honey is.

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,811
Shall I play along with her?

172
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,740
I really don’t know who Hengney…

173
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:27,499
who Honey you are talking about is….

174
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,438
Can you help me find her?

175
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,410
Can you do that for my mom?

176
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:37,800
She’s looking down at us from above.

177
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:45,682
I think we shouldn’t bother her.

178
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,376
Thank you.

179
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:50,392
Mom, he agrees to help us.

180
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:51,528
Right?

181
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:59,260
Missis, I’ll do what I can to help her.

182
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,625
Why didn’t you tell her the truth?

183
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:17,973
If he told her the truth,

184
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,574
she would find out that her dad likes men.

185
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,271
Will she be okay with it?

186
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:27,414
What’s worse is that guy is Heng.

187
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,414
I feel so bad for her.

188
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:29,960
Yes.

189
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:30,820
Why?

190
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,096
What’s wrong with me?

191
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:33,768
Nothing.

192
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,611
Did you tell Mo about it?

193
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:38,888
How could I tell him?

194
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,899
If I told him, he would say…

195
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,602
“Tell her the truth.”

196
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,011
Like this.

197
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:46,813
Like this?

198
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,290
Shit.

199
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,385
She’s calling.

200
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,275
Answer it.

201
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:01,028
Answer it?

202
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,576
Answer it and see why she’s calling you.

203
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,444
Hello.

204
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:08,634
Tomorrow?

205
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,056
Yes, I’m available.

206
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,645
Yes. See you.

207
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:15,654
Hey.

208
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:16,423
What?

209
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,600
She said she’d come to see me
at the office tomorrow.

210
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:21,980
It’s okay.

211
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,891
Take this chance to tell her

212
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:27,062
that you can no longer help her.

213
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:27,977
That’s right.

214
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:29,631
Otherwise, it’ll become a joke.

215
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,241
Thank you, Heng, for helping me find Heng.

216
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,137
He’s right.

217
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:40,734
I got another idea for my new song.

218
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,983
Thank you, Heng,

219
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,973
for shocking and disappointing me.

220
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,914
What should I do?

221
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:56,488
What could I do?

222
00:13:56,965 --> 00:14:01,802
I’m so screwed.

223
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,749
Is everyone on your team in the office today?

224
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:12,111
Yes.

225
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:16,268
I’m sure...

226
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,451
that Honey is one of them.

227
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,398
But I don’t think so.

228
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:26,871
Cher-aim, I want to help you.

229
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,642
But it’s about my boss’s personal life.

230
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,515
I can’t do it.

231
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,899
I’m sorry.

232
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,225
I forgot to think about that.

233
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:47,115
I’ll hire a private investigator.

234
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,976
Wait.

235
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,805
Why don’t we start looking

236
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,402
for someone suspicious here?

237
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,565
Here is your honey tea.

238
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:03,139
If you want anything else, please let me know.

239
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,040
Thank you, Earn.

240
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,371
This is all.

241
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:16,001
Honey.

242
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,214
Honey!

243
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:19,868
Is it her?

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,601
No. She is…

245
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:23,685
She’s married.

246
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:25,841
True.

247
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:28,342
She doesn’t look like my dad’s type.

248
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,305
Is it her?

249
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,002
It must be her.

250
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,540
Her yellow-black outfit is the colors of bees.

251
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,503
Calm down.

252
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:47,567
Yellow is a lucky color for today.

253
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:48,500
Is it her?

254
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:49,860
It must be her.

255
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,487
Look at how sweet she looks at my dad.

256
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:54,628
There’s nothing unusual between them.

257
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,100
What’s her name?

258
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,201
Her name is May.

259
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:03,517
May, the 5 th month.

260
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:06,537
It’s the best month for harvesting honey.

261
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:08,314
We found who Honey is.

262
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,564
How much did you get
in the critical thinking test?

263
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:16,408
There’s no one suspicious here.

264
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,985
You’re wasting your time.

265
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:19,902
Really?

266
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:24,075
He’s the most suspicious one here.

267
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:30,721
Since I got here, he has been eyeing us.

268
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:34,306
It’s like he’s worried that he will get caught by us.

269
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,401
What do you think?

270
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,200
But he’s a guy.

271
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:45,365
Nowadays, love is genderless.

272
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:47,644
It doesn’t make sense.

273
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,262
Why my dad is afraid to tell me?

274
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:54,317
But he has nothing connecting to Honey.

275
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:03,711
Can I see the staff list?

276
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,044
Mr. Hatainutt Nuntacharoensakul.

277
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,499
The initials of his first
and last name are H and N.

278
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,268
This is it. The real Honey is him.

279
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,614
What the hell is going on today?

280
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,868
What a crappy day!

281
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,042
I don’t think Mo is the person we’re looking for.

282
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:50,989
You should go home.

283
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:51,911
I think he is.

284
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,097
Let’s go.

285
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,798
This is my dad’s lunchbox.

286
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:21,442
This is obvious.

287
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,140
If he’s dating your dad,

288
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,266
why did he throw away the lunchbox?

289
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:29,604
To get rid of the evidence.

290
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:37,200
You are being careful but not careful enough, Mo.

291
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,530
Let’s follow him.

292
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:55,520
This is a toy mall.

293
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,247
What is he doing here?

294
00:18:58,731 --> 00:18:59,522
What are you mumbling about?

295
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,702
Let’s follow him closer.

296
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:01,506
Otherwise, we will miss him.

297
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,881
He pretended not to be interested in it.

298
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,475
But you actually got into it because of me.

299
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you two close?

300
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:27,208
No.

301
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,514
We barely know each other.

302
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,840
We only talk to each other once a year.

303
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,171
Fine.

304
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,374
I’ll watch him from here.

305
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,983
Who knows my dad might suddenly pop in.

306
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:38,813
Heng.

307
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:40,047
Yes.

308
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:41,980
You usually don’t come here on Monday.

309
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,980
I came here to run an errand.

310
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,838
I got to go now. I’ll talk to you later.

311
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:47,506
Hengheng.

312
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,106
Yes.

313
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,613
I got new stuff coming in today.

314
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:50,958
Really? Is it pretty?

315
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,410
The one you have an eye on is open for pre-order.

316
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:55,303
What are you waiting for? Let’s go.

317
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,355
Come here.

318
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,503
He’s gone. It’s your fault.

319
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,315
I’m sorry, Cher-aim.

320
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:17,014
Can I borrow 2,000 baht from you?

321
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:18,234
I want to book the pre-order.

322
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,312
Where have you been?

323
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,299
Why did you come home so late?

324
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,462
I went shopping with my friend.

325
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:08,548
How was your day?

326
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:11,360
It was okay.

327
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,103
I have something bothering me.

328
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:17,877
What is it?

329
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:28,173
Cher-aim.

330
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,811
Can you promise me

331
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:36,103
you won’t be mad if I tell you this?

332
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:40,120
Yes, I promise.

333
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,594
This Saturday…

334
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:55,635
This Saturday, I...

335
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,807
I suddenly have a meeting with a client.

336
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,850
I don’t think I can pick you up at the cram school.

337
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,290
I thought you were going to tell me about…

338
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:10,040
About?

339
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:15,962
About the diving class.

340
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:21,980
I know how tired you are.

341
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:23,718
You don’t need to take any extra classes.

342
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:25,682
You are the sweetest.

343
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,780
Why does Heng have so many packages?

344
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:52,401
You’re finally home, rascal.

345
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:54,906
Why are there so many of your packages?

346
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,047
Don’t nag me, Mo.

347
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,562
You’re doing it yourself too.

348
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:03,453
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:05,506
Mo.

350
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,804
After you left the office this evening,

351
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:09,574
where did you go?

352
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,663
I’m heating the soup.

353
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:17,502
I think it’s ready. I’ll go get it.

354
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:25,502
When he gets nervous, he looks quite cute.

355
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,890
[Cher-aim]

356
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:37,302
Cher-aim?

357
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,607
Why is she calling me?

358
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:45,914
Hello, Cher-aim.

359
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:47,866
Are you free this Saturday?

360
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:48,967
<i>This Saturday?</i>

361
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:51,291
I’m not sure. Why?

362
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:52,801
<i>I got a new lead.</i>

363
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,709
Dad has a dinner date with Honey this Saturday.

364
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,170
Are you sure?

365
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,871
<i>It might be a meeting with a client.</i>

366
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:05,700
He used heart and birthday cake emoticons
on his calendar on his phone.

367
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:08,600
I think they will celebrate a birthday together.

368
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:12,856
<i>Anyway, we will expose them this Saturday.</i>

369
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,672
Whose birthday is this Saturday?

370
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,000
Meow?

371
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,300
Whose birthday is it?

372
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:42,254
Damn.

373
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,136
It’s my birthday.

374
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:53,121
Is he throwing me a surprise birthday party?

375
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,976
No! I can’t do it.

376
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:58,100
Don’t do it, boss.

377
00:24:58,362 --> 00:24:59,386
Please don’t throw me a birthday surprise.

378
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:13,897
Hello, Boss.

379
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,912
I want to ask you about
the Sathon project client.

380
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,850
(Sathon?)

381
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:22,748
Are you free this Saturday?

382
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,487
I’m not free this Saturday.

383
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:26,417
Do you have work to do?

384
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:28,891
But it’s a weekend.

385
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:31,877
Who ordered you to work? I’ll talk to them.

386
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,115
No, I’m going to meet Newyear to play badminton.

387
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:38,634
Boss.

388
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,195
My mom living in Supanburi is sick.

389
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:44,408
Can I go visit her?

390
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:46,543
Can I take a leave on Monday?

391
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:47,576
You can take a leave on Tuesday too.

392
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:50,059
Thank you so much, Boss.

393
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:53,590
I thought you would say no and fire me.

394
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:54,768
Thank you.

395
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,903
You are so kind, generous,
respectful, and successful.

396
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:02,777
I love you. Thank you.

397
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:08,893
So…

398
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:11,303
you are free on Saturday.

399
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,697
It will be a very special day.

400
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:21,170
Yes.

401
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:42,125
Hey.

402
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:45,271
If you have something to say, just say it.

403
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,592
Stop glancing at me. It’s annoying.

404
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:49,767
Mo.

405
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:50,850
What?

406
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:53,601
Are you free this Saturday?

407
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:56,648
I…

408
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,608
I want you to make a stuffed omelet for me.

409
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:05,851
Stuffed omelet?

410
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:08,623
It’s not a big deal.

411
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,127
Why do you look so nervous?

412
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,685
After eating it, can you help me do the dishes?

413
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,906
Sure.

414
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:19,616
After doing the dishes,

415
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:21,802
can you go to have dinner with our boss for me?

416
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:22,697
Sure.

417
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:24,245
Huh?!

418
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:25,820
What!?

419
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,197
Tell her the truth.

420
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:40,582
Mo.

421
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:43,408
I knew you would say that.

422
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,194
That’s why I didn’t tell you about it.

423
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,208
But this is an emergency, Mo.

424
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:50,822
Can you help me, Mo?

425
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:52,755
Mo.

426
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,016
Mo, please help me.

427
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,505
I’m busy this Saturday.

428
00:27:58,682 --> 00:27:59,108
What will you do?

429
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,340
I’m going to play badminton with Newyear.

430
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,837
Liar!

431
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:01,717
Who are you calling a liar?

432
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:02,514
You!

433
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:03,238
Fine.

434
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:07,152
Newyear goes to visit his mom this Saturday.

435
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,429
Whether I’m free or not,

436
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,626
I’m not going to help you.

437
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,727
This is your problem.

438
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,802
You need to fix it yourself.

439
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:16,180
Mo.

440
00:28:17,514 --> 00:28:18,059
Mo.

441
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,641
What should I do?

442
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:23,029
Mo.

443
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,229
Look at this.

444
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:34,164
It’s Saturday but I have a work meeting.

445
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:35,591
It’s okay, Dad.

446
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,970
If you are busy with work,

447
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:38,165
you will earn a lot of money to spoil me.

448
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:40,737
Have a good day at work today.

449
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:41,619
Yes.

450
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,028
The elevator is here.

451
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:44,976
Okay.

452
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:45,724
I got to go.

453
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,607
- Bye.
- Bye.

454
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:51,589
Bye.

455
00:28:58,047 --> 00:28:58,801
Let’s move.

456
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:02,936
He’s left.

457
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:08,035
We need to catch them today.

458
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:30,237
We had a drama shooting earlier.

459
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,097
Can you come back to take our order later?

460
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,888
Cher-aim.

461
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:48,897
I have a stomach ache.

462
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,302
I need to go to see a doctor.

463
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:52,773
Hey, we’re already here.

464
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:53,804
Don’t get cold feet now.

465
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:54,560
Sit down.

466
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,610
I’ll come back to take your order.

467
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:08,020
See? He’s calling Mo.

468
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:14,401
Why don’t you answer the call?

469
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:16,718
It’s okay. I don’t need to.

470
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:19,401
This is strange.

471
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:21,795
Don’t tell me…

472
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,571
Did my dad send you to spy on me?

473
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,312
Nonsense.

474
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:30,299
No.

475
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:33,805
It’s a call from my client.

476
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:36,752
I’ll ignore it.

477
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:38,099
Today is my day off.

478
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:39,709
Don’t you know the work-life balance?

479
00:30:41,712 --> 00:30:42,231
Okay.

480
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,351
I’ll go to the bathroom.

481
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,118
Hello, Boss.

482
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:57,943
I don’t think I can go meet you today.

483
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,804
Hengney.

484
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:15,891
Hengney.

485
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,051
What are you doing here?

486
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:19,410
Why are you wearing a mustache?

487
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:27,407
Surprise!

488
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:28,817
Huh?

489
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,007
Surprise, Boss.

490
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:49,659
Does it hurt?

491
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:51,511
Yes.

492
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:53,322
It’s also itchy.

493
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:56,605
Hengney.

494
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:57,619
Yes.

495
00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:00,699
About our relationship,

496
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:05,872
I gave Cher-aim some hints about it.

497
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,877
What did she say?

498
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,154
I think we need to give her some time.

499
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:18,737
But I’m worried about something else.

500
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:22,146
I think she’s seeing someone.

501
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,800
Lately, she often came home late.

502
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,149
She’s always on the phone for a long time.

503
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,208
It’s probably a guy from her school.

504
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:35,973
She attends an all-girls school.

505
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,462
Oops.

506
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,460
Today is your day.

507
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:50,426
Let’s talk about you.

508
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:51,760
I’ll stop talking about my problem.

509
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:53,299
Talk about me?

510
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,634
Hey!

511
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:00,800
What are you doing there?

512
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:02,801
Come here.

513
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:10,687
Hengney.

514
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:11,651
Yes.

515
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,176
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.

516
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:18,780
Sure.

517
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,105
You can take as long as you want.

518
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,604
Watch your steps.

519
00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:44,891
What is going on?

520
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:46,023
I don’t know. Help me, Cher-aim.

521
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:47,085
He said the deal is off.

522
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:48,475
Mo suddenly has an emergency.

523
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:50,296
Cher-aim, we should leave.

524
00:33:56,148 --> 00:34:00,197
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

525
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:08,951
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

526
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:12,841
Happy…

527
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:16,053
Bir…

528
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:23,468
Where did he go?

529
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:26,411
Heng.

530
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,642
Thank you for remembering it.

531
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:02,912
Huh?

532
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,795
Heng suddenly had an emergency.

533
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,675
He asked me to receive the cake from you.

534
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:35,739
Is that so?

535
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:40,794
If you have a gift to give him,

536
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:42,524
you can give it to me.

537
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:46,201
I’ll see him at home.

538
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:48,946
It’s okay.

539
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:51,798
I’ll give it to him later.

540
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:53,552
Here.

541
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:12,127
Cher-aim, what are you doing?

542
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:14,208
Collecting evidence.

543
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:17,528
Now, Mo can’t deny it.

544
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,053
This is illegal.

545
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,205
You may get sued for it.

546
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:23,299
I know that.

547
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,225
That’s why I’m using your phone.

548
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:26,731
You’re so smart.

549
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:28,903
Is that my phone?

550
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:29,577
Yes.

551
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:33,401
I’ll show this video to him this Monday.

552
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:35,465
If he refuses to stay away from my dad,

553
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:41,688
I’ll expose, expose, expose him to everyone.

554
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:54,915
Oh.

555
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:57,211
That’s what happened.

556
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:08,644
I made up my mind.

557
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,204
I’ll delete this video.

558
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:13,770
How can you delete it?

559
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,552
She’ll scold you.

560
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:19,536
But I don’t want you to get into trouble.

561
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:24,097
You came to help me today.

562
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,960
Mo, I’m sorry for dragging you into the problem.

563
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:38,900
Fine.

564
00:37:40,112 --> 00:37:41,355
I’ll forgive you.

565
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:44,805
But you need to bow your head to apologize to me.

566
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,268
Are you serious?

567
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:48,794
Will you do it or not?

568
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:50,597
Fine. I’ll do it.

569
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:55,219
I’m sorry.

570
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:58,456
Bow lower.

571
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,696
I’m sorry.

572
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,848
Bow lower.

573
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:10,777
I’m sorry.

574
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:13,500
Here.

575
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,247
Happy G-Day.

576
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,400
You remember my birthday?

577
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:25,525
How could I forget it?

578
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:27,702
You wrote it on the calendar.

579
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,038
I would be a fool if I didn’t know it.

580
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,531
That’s true.

581
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:33,401
Can I see it?

582
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:39,299
Wow!

583
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,340
Hold on, Mo.

584
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:50,505
So you went to buy it that day, didn’t you?

585
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:53,297
What day?

586
00:38:59,365 --> 00:38:59,921
Nothing.

587
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:01,674
Forget it.

588
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,970
Can I open it now?

589
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:20,204
Shit!

590
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,041
What the heck is this?

591
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:29,848
Isn’t it Mr. Saturnworld, your favorite character?

592
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:33,832
Mo, you got scammed. This is a fake one.

593
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:35,703
Are you sure?

594
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:36,602
Let me see.

595
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:38,700
Damn.

596
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,602
I got scammed by the shop owner.

597
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:47,543
I’m sorry. I’ll go to change it tomorrow.

598
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:52,330
It’s okay.

599
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,611
I understand.

600
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,850
You are a newbie.

601
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,062
I’ll take you to the shop tomorrow.

602
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:00,097
Hmm?

603
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:03,100
I’m not going to buy a new one

604
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,654
I’m going to take you to buy it.

605
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:08,100
So you won’t get scammed.

606
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:08,851
Okay?

607
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,411
It’s kind of cute.

608
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,204
Where have you been?
Why did you come home so late?

609
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,440
I went to see a movie with my friend.

610
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:46,802
What are you doing? Why are you still up?

611
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:49,004
I…

612
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:52,419
I went to a meeting.

613
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:58,213
What kind of meeting?

614
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,201
Why do you have a cake frosting on your sleeve?

615
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:13,223
It’s good that you’re back.

616
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,157
Next time, if you’re going to
come home late, you need to call and tell me.

617
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:17,008
I’m worried about you.

618
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,200
I’ve stayed up to wait for you.

619
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:20,063
I got it.

620
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,675
Don’t worry.

621
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:23,619
I love you tons.

622
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,539
Okay. I’ll go take a shower.

623
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:37,951
You should do it too.

624
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:40,007
The weather is changing.

625
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:40,794
You might get sick.

626
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:45,739
Roger that.

627
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,764
Is there something wrong?

628
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:38,746
Didn’t you tell me to meet you on Monday?

629
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:41,776
Open it.

630
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,508
I like stuffed omelets because of you.

631
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:05,602
Because of you, I want to go to work every day.

632
00:43:07,997 --> 00:43:08,605
Wait.

633
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:10,200
What is this?

634
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,066
It’s Mo’s birthday present.

635
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,290
My dad made these origami
lucky stars and filled up the jar.

636
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:36,604
Each of them is filled with
the love my dad has for him.

637
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:44,200
Each of them also represents the good feelings

638
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:46,010
[Because of you, I want to go to work every day.]

639
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:47,401
he has for my dad.

640
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,290
[I like stuffed omelets because of you.]

641
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:09,198
He makes my dad smile again.

642
00:44:15,813 --> 00:44:17,635
Seeing them loving each other so much,

643
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,840
I have nothing to worry about.

644
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:23,100
From now on, I’ll cheer on them.

645
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:25,718
Wait.

646
00:44:26,365 --> 00:44:28,330
Why do things turn out this way?

647
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,801
Thank you for helping me all this time.

648
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,983
You are the best person I’ve ever met.

649
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,040
Excluding my dad.

650
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:44,960
No.

651
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:47,801
I’m not a good person.

652
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:48,802
Cher-aim.

653
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,362
See?

654
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:55,974
See?

655
00:44:56,684 --> 00:44:57,457
I knew it.

656
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,142
You are dating someone.

657
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,884
I told you that you can date anyone you want.

658
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,105
All I ask from you is to be honest with me.

659
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:08,247
Let me see the face of the man
who is the reason you lie to me.

660
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:09,697
What?!

661
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:11,148
Boss.

662
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,240
Heng.

663
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:19,167
Why are you here?

664
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:21,397
Surprise!

665
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:24,004
Since things already got exposed.

666
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,026
I want to talk everything out now.

667
00:45:29,091 --> 00:45:29,974
Okay. Fine.

668
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:33,048
I also have something to talk to you.

669
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:35,490
I’ll let you two talk.

670
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:37,792
No.

671
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:39,302
You need to stay.

672
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,617
I know that you have feelings for someone
and you’re hiding it from me.

673
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:47,151
So I asked Heng to help me find the person.

674
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:56,247
Cher-aim.

675
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:00,595
I’m sorry.

676
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,102
I wanted to tell you but…

677
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:07,979
it’s not easy to say it out.

678
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:09,976
Yes.

679
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:12,955
Because…

680
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,204
Because that person is a man, right?

681
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,939
Are you okay with it?

682
00:46:26,228 --> 00:46:28,647
Dad, this is 2025.

683
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:32,844
If he makes you happy, I’m okay with it.

684
00:46:42,985 --> 00:46:44,124
Thank you, sweetie.

685
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,237
Cher-aim.

686
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,094
Do you want to know…

687
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:14,982
who he is?

688
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:16,395
No.

689
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:27,401
The person I told you I want to marry is…

690
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:36,315
This person.

691
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:37,004
Huh?!

692
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:43,583
Wait.

693
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:46,598
What did you tell me your name was?

694
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:52,515
My name is Heng.

695
00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:56,955
But your dad often calls me…

696
00:47:58,155 --> 00:47:59,102
Hengney.

697
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:01,871
The real Honey.

698
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:04,201
It was you!

699
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,077
It’s not fake. It’s a real one.

700
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:21,103
Wait.

701
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,700
Are you saying that this grumpy one is real?

702
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,000
I didn’t see it in the collection photo.

703
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:26,869
Of course, it’s not in it.

704
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:29,616
It’s a rare and limited edition.

705
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,976
There are only 20 of them in the world.

706
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,450
Stop lying.

707
00:48:34,776 --> 00:48:35,801
Others might fall for your story.

708
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:37,740
Isn’t it the rare character?

709
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,342
Heng, are you selling it?

710
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,287
I’ll give you 20,000 baht for it.

711
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:42,825
20,000 baht?

712
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:44,755
Don’t cut me off.

713
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,699
Heng, I’ll give you 25,000 baht.

714
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:47,478
I’ll give you 30,000 baht.

715
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:48,442
30,000?

716
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:51,638
Wait a minute.

717
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:53,057
Is it a rare character?

718
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:54,121
You’re fooling me, right?

719
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,026
Yes.

720
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:57,232
I told you it’s real.

721
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,911
Sell it to me. I’ll give you 50,000 baht.

722
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:00,922
If you agree to sell it,

723
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:02,053
I’ll wire the money to you right away.

724
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,844
50,000 baht?

725
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:05,542
Let’s sell it.

726
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,800
Come on.

727
00:49:08,517 --> 00:49:09,205
No.

728
00:49:09,762 --> 00:49:10,863
I won’t sell it no matter how much you’ll pay me.

729
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:15,574
Because this is a birthday gift from my friend.

730
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:18,961
This is the first gift you gave me.

731
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:20,600
Am I right, Mo?

732
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:28,490
But he offers to give you 50,000 baht, Heng.

733
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,693
Why are you tempted by his offer?

734
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:32,840
No, I’m not going to sell it.

735
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:34,173
Let’s keep it.

736
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,402
Fine, if you don’t want to sell it.

737
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,102
Can I take a picture of it
to put on my shop’s wall?

738
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:41,468
Sure.

739
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:46,848
Okay.

740
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,828
Ready? One, two.

741
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:56,802
Here.

742
00:49:57,896 --> 00:49:58,602
Thank you.

743
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:02,401
Do you have a pen?

744
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:04,361
Yes, it’s behind you.

745
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:22,617
Thank you.

746
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,690
(This one is mine.)

747
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:56,894
Our boss seems to have lost his focus lately.

748
00:50:57,152 --> 00:50:59,053
Our team’s sales performance keeps dropping.

749
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:02,958
Am I the reason for our team’s disaster?

750
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:05,217
Heng is a good man.

751
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:07,355
I invited him to have lunch
with us this Saturday.

752
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,000
Will you come out and meet him?

753
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,539
We all will help you from here.

754
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,650
You have a mission to win over Cher-aim.

755
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,583
Your team’s fate depends on this mission.

756
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,401
You reject a perfect guy like him.

757
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:22,502
What kind of person are you looking for?

758
00:51:23,282 --> 00:51:27,699
I want someone I feel comfortable being with.
