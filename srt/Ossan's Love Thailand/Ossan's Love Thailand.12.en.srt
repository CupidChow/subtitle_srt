1
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:02,980
The job in Japan.

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:03,813
If I go,

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,580
I will be away from everyone here.

4
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:08,800
Since we are going to move to Japan together.

5
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:10,180
Will you marry me, Hengney?

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,113
You should go.

7
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,420
A great opportunity like this,

8
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:13,900
it would be stupid if you let it go.

9
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,653
Things get this far

10
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:17,153
because you keep running away.

11
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,900
If you’re still doing this,

12
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:20,806
how can I move on from you?

13
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,566
Heng is dumb.

14
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:25,513
If you don’t tell him, he will never know.

15
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,400
That day,

16
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,209
I don’t want you to go through hardship because of me.

17
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,980
So I decided to let you go.

18
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,126
I’m sorry.

19
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:32,446
Can you wait for me?

20
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,780
Tonight, I’ll make everything right.

21
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:36,286
Watch out.

22
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,400
I think he has a concussion.

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,553
He lost his memories from the past two years.

24
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,400
Two years!

25
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:52,190
What the hell is today?

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,820
How are you feeling?

27
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,986
Do you remember anything?

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,880
Because of the accident,

29
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:26,880
the patient lost his memories

30
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:28,880
from the past two years.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,833
Don’t worry.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,640
Losing my memories for two years

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,426
is not a big deal.

34
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:37,446
Yes, it is.

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,320
Heng, don’t you remember that I confessed my love to you?

36
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:43,793
Huh? You confessed your love to me?

37
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,333
Not only him.

38
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,373
Me too.

39
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:47,126
Huh?!

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,753
But we were friends, weren’t we?

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,613
Friends? No!

42
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,266
You held my hand and announced our relationship to everyone in the office.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,546
Wait, wait.

44
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,153
That was all in the past.

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,093
I’ve been living with Heng for over a year.

46
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,113
What?

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,300
I’m so confused.

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,306
Take it easy.

49
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,560
Don’t try to force information on him.

50
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:13,320
Give him time to slowly restore his memories.

51
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:16,280
Starting from taking him to where he lived.

52
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,860
I remember it.

53
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,550
Why?

54
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,180
Is there an important memory that happened in this room?

55
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,253
I remember it.

56
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,546
My shampoo is running low.

57
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,120
I’ll go out and buy a new one.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
If that doesn’t help,

59
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,646
you can reenact his past experiences.

60
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:13,066
I believe that one of them will help trigger his memories.

61
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:20,966
I think Heng hasn’t regained his memories.

62
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:24,973
I guess we need to compete for him again.

63
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,746
Sure.

64
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,986
This time I won’t go easy on you.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,206
Me neither.

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,993
You made a lunchbox for me to eat on the rooftop?

67
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,733
Yes, I made a stuffed omelet for you.

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Come on. Open your mouth.

69
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:59,133
Can I not eat it?

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Open your mouth.

71
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,873
I said open your mouth.

72
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,773
Boss, can’t you see that Heng is uncomfortable?

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,693
Why? Did he say that?

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
I didn’t hear anything.

75
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,193
Because you are his boss.

76
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:10,773
He’s probably too afraid to say it out.

77
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:11,880
You are jealous, aren’t you?

78
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:13,113
Because Heng chose me.

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,193
He chose me.

80
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,166
He chose me.

81
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:15,826
He chose me.

82
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:16,660
He chose me.

83
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:17,493
He chose me.

84
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,286
He chose me.

85
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:20,326
Enough! Please stop fighting.

86
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:21,353
Stay out of it!

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,973
Oh, you are hoping this will help me restore my memories, right?

88
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,500
It doesn’t.

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,313
Boss, keep going.

90
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,306
Do you remember

91
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,520
we were stuck on this rooftop together?

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,993
I was half naked like this?

93
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,873
Yes.

94
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:51,986
It doesn’t ring a bell.

95
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,813
I told my daughter

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,253
that you were the man that I loved.

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Do you remember it?

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,546
Not at all.

99
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,126
Do you remember this?

100
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,340
No.

101
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,793
Do you remember this?

102
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
No.

103
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,700
Do you remember the ride?

104
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
No.

105
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,753
Do you remember this?

106
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:17,773
No.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,240
Will you marry me, Hengney?

108
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:26,546
No.

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,326
I never knew that things got this far.

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,606
Did you propose to me?

111
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,006
Yes.

112
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,530
No.

113
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,290
No.

114
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,593
No.

115
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,986
No!

116
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,706
Hey!

117
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,060
My memories are not back.

118
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,100
I’m sorry for disappointing you.

119
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,186
It’s okay, Heng.

120
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,466
We have to apologize to you

121
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,460
for forcing too much information on you.

122
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,646
What did I answer to your proposal?

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
It’s okay.

124
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,980
You will gain your memories back one day.

125
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,793
Boss, please tell me. I want to know.

126
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,353
That…

127
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,353
You said yes to my proposal.

128
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,733
And…

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,986
our wedding,

130
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,680
it’ll take place this Sunday.

131
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,426
Boss.

132
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,473
That’s a big deal.

133
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,760
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

134
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:53,920
I don’t want to pressure you.

135
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,373
Are you sure about that?

136
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,126
Why did you bring your wedding planners here?

137
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,420
I brought them here…

138
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
just in case.

139
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,193
In case your memories are back,

140
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,646
we can proceed with our wedding.

141
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:14,986
But it’s okay.

142
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,980
Don’t worry. You don’t need to rush.

143
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:18,673
It’s okay, Heng.

144
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
How about this?

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,180
I’ll cancel the wedding.

146
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:22,746
I’m canceling the wedding.

147
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,293
It’s okay, Boss.

148
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,786
You have worked hard to prepare for the wedding.

149
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,390
It’s okay.

150
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,580
But…

151
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,640
I’ll do it.

152
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,666
Huh?!

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,573
I’ll marry you.

154
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:43,646
Hengney.

155
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,180
Thank you so much.

156
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,546
Thank you, Hengney.

157
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,306
Thank you, Hengney.

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,933
Mo, why didn’t you tell Heng?

159
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,746
That he chose you in the end.

160
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,586
What’s the point of doing that?

161
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,966
Even if I told him,

162
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,993
he wouldn’t remember it anyway.

163
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,326
But you remember it.

164
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,080
So what?

165
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,820
It doesn’t matter anymore.

166
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,553
Do you remember the last time we talked?

167
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,980
At the time,

168
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,773
I thought you were acting like a hero.

169
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,840
But I guess you weren’t a hero.

170
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,313
No hero would let his loved one end up with

171
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,310
someone he doesn’t choose to be with.

172
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,233
Mo.

173
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,980
You should reconsider it.

174
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,980
What are you looking for?

175
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,186
That beer.

176
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,353
The beer that we promised to drink together.

177
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,000
Tomorrow is my wedding day.

178
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,526
I want to celebrate my last day as a bachelor.

179
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,310
Right.

180
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,966
The truth is…

181
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,806
you already opened the beer.

182
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Really?

183
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,620
Any beers are the same.

184
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,513
They can get you drunk.

185
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,980
You’re right.

186
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,973
Last time,

187
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,173
you went first.

188
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Really?

189
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:01,966
You mean I drank it first, right?

190
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,380
Yes.

191
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,953
Last time, what were we celebrating?

192
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,320
I vaguely recall that it was something good.

193
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,160
I also vaguely recall…

194
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,580
the beer tasted better than any other day.

195
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,980
I don’t know why.

196
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,106
It’s your turn.

197
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,806
Heng.

198
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:09,826
Yes?

199
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:17,973
Mo.

200
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,700
Will you be my best man?

201
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Huh?

202
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,793
If you don’t want to do it, it’s okay.

203
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,860
I understand.

204
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,373
I know that we broke up.

205
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,893
But you know that I don’t have many friends.

206
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:44,973
Right now,

207
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:47,740
you are the only one I can think of.

208
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,340
Sure.

209
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,000
If that’s what you want.

210
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:05,660
Really?

211
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,226
Yes.

212
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,146
Are you sure?

213
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,173
Yes.

214
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,146
Thanks, bestie.

215
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,240
Just a fleeting moment with you here beside me

216
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:24,973
Even if it’s a dream, I’d stay asleep willingly

217
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:30,966
'Cause you are my sweetest dream, and I don't want to wake

218
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:34,920
Let time slip away

219
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:42,073
Oh, dreams, in dreams, my heart feels so free

220
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:47,040
Each time I dream, things are the way I wish them to be

221
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:53,513
No more hiding this love I’ve locked deep within

222
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,540
In dreams, I can tell you everything

223
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,866
False awakening, I wish dreams come true

224
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:09,926
Where everything I imagine repeats anew

225
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:16,266
Not just a memory fading in time

226
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:24,253
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

227
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:47,093
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

228
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:02,980
(Mo, Property Consultant)

229
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Thank you.

230
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:23,986
Newyear.

231
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,073
Does Mo answer his phone?

232
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,173
No.

233
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,100
I texted him several times.

234
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:31,322
But he doesn’t read my messages.

235
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,173
I’ll look around the venue to find him.

236
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,166
What’s up with him?

237
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:38,720
The ceremony will begin soon.

238
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,753
Hengney.

239
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Wow!

240
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,406
Look.

241
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,620
You look great.

242
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,206
Boss, you look great too.

243
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Really?

244
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,366
I’m so happy.

245
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Thank you.

246
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,353
Me too.

247
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,913
Okay. I’ll go out and greet our guests.

248
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,766
Come out when you are done.

249
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Yes.

250
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,060
What’s going on with you, Mo?

251
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,220
You don’t answer my calls or messages.

252
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,300
You promised me.

253
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,402
You go out and take photos in front of the venue

254
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:18,980
before you go in.

255
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:20,006
Yes.

256
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,570
Wait.

257
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,493
Aren’t you going to change your shoes?

258
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,493
I’m sorry, Ten.

259
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:43,986
How did you forget it?

260
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,500
I’m sorry.

261
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,973
I’m nervous.

262
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,266
How did you forget Mo’s feelings for you?

263
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,940
But…

264
00:19:57,973 --> 00:20:00,226
didn’t he break up with me?

265
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,266
He did that because he loved you.

266
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,946
He decided to let you go.

267
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:06,973
Because he didn’t want people to give you the dirty eye.

268
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,980
It’s okay if you forget him.

269
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:16,140
But you cannot talk to him like that.

270
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,573
Since it is your consent

271
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:11,133
to enter the Holy Matrimony,

272
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,973
please exchange your vows.

273
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,513
I, Kongdech,

274
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,466
take you, Haran, as my wedded partner,

275
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,380
in good times and in bad,

276
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,993
in sickness and in health,

277
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
until death parts us.

278
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,813
I, Haran,

279
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,720
take you, Kongdech, as my wedded partner

280
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,266
in good times and in bad,

281
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:08,626
in sickness and in health,

282
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,986
until death…

283
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,673
parts us.

284
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:27,986
You may now seal this union with a kiss.

285
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,726
(This time, I won’t lose you to anyone.)

286
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Heng.

287
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,093
When you stand before God,

288
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,606
you shouldn’t say lies.

289
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,230
If this kiss is not mine,

290
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,533
I can’t accept it either.

291
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,546
Why I…

292
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:43,633
I get it.

293
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,626
I’m sorry, Boss.

294
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,000
You don’t need to say anything.

295
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Go.

296
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Mo called me last night.

297
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,993
He told me he went home to rest.

298
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,186
How did you know that I…

299
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,593
I’ve been your boss for years.

300
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,990
How could I not know what you’re thinking?

301
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,766
Why are you still here?

302
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:26,146
No.

303
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,606
I can’t do this to you.

304
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,726
Haran!

305
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
Yes.

306
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,540
As your boss,

307
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,420
I order you to go and talk things out with Mo.

308
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Go.

309
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Yes.

310
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,253
Thank you, Boss.

311
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,766
Thank you, everyone, for joining our wedding.

312
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,633
Alright, I would like to announce that…

313
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,640
I got rejected.

314
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:13,380
From what I see, he definitely got rejected.

315
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,293
Mo, you should eat something.

316
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:45,000
Your dad is worried about you.

317
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,513
I’m sorry, Mom.

318
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:39,106
Excuse me.

319
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:43,980
Is this Mo’s homestay?

320
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,480
Heng.

321
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,506
I’m Mo’s mother.

322
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,446
That’s why I feel like

323
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,333
I have seen your kind face before.

324
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
Mom.

325
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,760
Can I see Mo?

326
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,980
Absolutely.

327
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,540
Absolutely not. Go away.

328
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,973
Do you know how much you hurt my son?

329
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,970
I’m sorry, Mom.

330
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:18,373
Please let me see Mo.

331
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:18,873
No.

332
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,166
Please, Mom.

333
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
No.

334
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,766
My son told me.

335
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,373
He doesn’t want to see you.

336
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,973
Get the hell out of here.

337
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,540
Dad.

338
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:42,766
I want to talk things out with Mo.

339
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:43,753
Please, Dad.

340
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Let me go.

341
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,053
Dad, you can shoot me if you want.

342
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:52,613
But I will not leave until I get to see Mo.

343
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,273
Sit down and wait here.

344
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,300
Help.

345
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,620
Help.

346
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,613
- I feel dizzy, Heng. - Help.

347
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,186
For me,

348
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,593
grudges must be avenged.

349
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,713
Honey.

350
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,666
Gratitude must be returned as well.

351
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:32,206
Honey.

352
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:32,993
Honey.

353
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,453
Honey.

354
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:34,473
Honey.

355
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,106
Honey.

356
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,993
Honey.

357
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,273
Honey.

358
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,726
I’ll tell you where he is.

359
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,266
The rest…

360
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,446
is up to you.

361
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,186
Thank you so much, Dad.

362
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,540
Since we are here,

363
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:27,240
if you want him to come back,

364
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,993
why don’t you pray to the divine?

365
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,566
The divine may grant your wish.

366
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,980
They are probably spending their wedding night.

367
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,453
Who knows? The wedding might be postponed.

368
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,780
I believe if we were meant to be,

369
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,993
we wouldn’t have so many obstacles.

370
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:57,440
(Heng)

371
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
See?

372
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,313
He’s definitely calling to make up with you.

373
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,700
Why are you turning off the phone?

374
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:07,786
I’m tired. I want to rest.

375
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:08,826
Can you keep it for me?

376
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,160
Yes.

377
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
That.

378
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:08,766
I want to ride a horse carriage to enjoy the town.

379
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,986
We’re here. We should try it.

380
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:10,900
No.

381
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,306
Please.

382
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:17,206
Here.

383
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:19,573
Thanks.

384
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,646
Actually,

385
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:27,260
there are many good-looking guys in Lampang.

386
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:28,853
Do you want me to help you find a date?

387
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,866
No. I’m tired. I want to rest.

388
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,853
How about the handsome guy over there?

389
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,000
He looks similar to Heng.

390
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:39,946
No.

391
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Huh?!

392
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:45,640
Please take me to Ratsada Bridge.

393
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,466
That’s Heng.

394
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,293
No way. Are you crazy?

395
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,900
Why would he be here?

396
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,900
It’s really Heng.

397
00:33:54,986 --> 00:33:55,986
Damn.

398
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,453
It’s really Heng.

399
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,060
Why is he here?

400
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:00,646
He must come to make up with you.

401
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,666
You should go to him.

402
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:04,313
Is it a good idea?

403
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,006
Yes, go.

404
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Heng.

405
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,906
Go for it.

406
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,446
Heng.

407
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,866
Mo, win him back.

408
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,826
Heng.

409
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,986
Heng.

410
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Heng.

411
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Heng.

412
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,000
Heng, I’m here.

413
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,740
(Just thinking about him,

414
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,500
(I’m already hearing his voice in my head.)

415
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:36,000
Heng.

416
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,366
Heng.

417
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,020
Heng.

418
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:45,326
Heng.

419
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,993
Heng.

420
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Get in.

421
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,273
Boss.

422
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,526
Hurry up. Get in.

423
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:18,233
Come on. Get in.

424
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:19,813
Let’s go.

425
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,520
What’s going on? I’m confused.

426
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,233
Heng dumped me.

427
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,240
He can’t forget you.

428
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,646
He came here to look for you.

429
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,246
What are you doing here?

430
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,113
I’m your boss.

431
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,926
My job is to make sure that my subordinates are happy.

432
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,286
Why are you going the extra mile for us?

433
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,973
I have been your boss for many years.

434
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,646
Why wouldn’t I know how much you two have been through?

435
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,393
Thank you, Boss.

436
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,220
Heng.

437
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,886
Heng, I’m here.

438
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,320
Heng.

439
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:22,906
Heng, I’m here.

440
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Heng.

441
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Heng.

442
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,213
What should we do, Boss?

443
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:33,220
His carriage is going further away from ours.

444
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:34,406
Heng.

445
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Heng.

446
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Heng.

447
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,126
Our carriage is too heavy.

448
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,400
We need to use the last resort.

449
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,386
What is it?

450
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:43,413
Go.

451
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Boss.

452
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,173
Go now.

453
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:47,706
Thank you.

454
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Let’s go.

455
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,706
Don’t let me down.

456
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:05,000
You can do it.

457
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,693
Heng.

458
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:42,560
Heng, I’m here.

459
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,860
Heng, I’m here.

460
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,533
Heng.

461
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:50,700
Heng, I’m here.

462
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
Heng.

463
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,273
Heng.

464
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,753
Pull over here.

465
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Here is your fare.

466
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,510
Heng.

467
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,906
Heng.

468
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,990
Heng.

469
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Heng.

470
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Heng.

471
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Heng.

472
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:36,740
Heng.

473
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Heng.

474
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Heng.

475
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,850
I’m sorry.

476
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,073
Darn it!

477
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:06,870
What the hell is today?!

478
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,473
Why did nothing go my way today?

479
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,820
I’m trying to get over you

480
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:19,866
but you suddenly showed up.

481
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:22,153
There are many outfits out there.

482
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,580
Why did I run after a man who wore a similar outfit to yours?

483
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,960
And my phone.

484
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:31,590
Why did I leave it with my sister?

485
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,006
I just want to talk to you.

486
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,873
I want to tell you I love you.

487
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:39,473
Do you hear me, Heng?

488
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,193
Do you hear me?

489
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,006
Yes, I hear you.

490
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,673
I didn’t come all the way here to watch you give up.

491
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,680
Do you think you have a right to say that?

492
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,980
Everything that happened,

493
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,360
it’s all your fault.

494
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,650
How is that my fault?

495
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,860
You acted like you were in a sad music video

496
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:37,062
and got him into the accident.

497
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:38,586
Hold on.

498
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,333
You sent a message asking to meet him

499
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:44,173
when he was getting married the next day.

500
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,426
He was getting married

501
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,613
because you were pressuring him.

502
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,220
At least,

503
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,686
I’ve never walked away from him.

504
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,353
Don’t say that.

505
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,746
This is your fault.

506
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Wait.

507
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,093
This is your fault.

508
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,200
This is your fault.

509
00:41:14,246 --> 00:41:15,113
This is your fault.

510
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:16,146
This is your fault.

511
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:16,953
This is your fault.

512
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:17,826
This is your fault.

513
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:18,993
This is your fault.

514
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,946
This is your fault.

515
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:20,666
This is your fault.

516
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,393
This is your fault.

517
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:21,940
This is your fault.

518
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,620
This is your fault.

519
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,486
This is your fault.

520
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:24,306
This is your fault.

521
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:25,000
This is your fault.

522
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,713
This is your fault.

523
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:26,330
This is your fault.

524
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,993
This is your fault.

525
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,646
This is your fault.

526
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:27,960
This is your fault.

527
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:28,973
Please stop fighting.

528
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,866
We are fellow countryfolk.

529
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:30,893
Stay out of it.

530
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:47,766
Heng.

531
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
Heng.

532
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Heng.

533
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:03,440
My job here is done.

534
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,993
Don’t let his hand go again.

535
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,810
Yes.

536
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:23,550
Do you remember everything?

537
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
No.

538
00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:30,380
I have something to ask you.

539
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,420
What is it?

540
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,300
Every time, I walk into my bathroom,

541
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,233
my heart is beating fast.

542
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,280
Is it…

543
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,360
because of you?

544
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:14,626
Can you tell me what happened?

545
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:38,326
Normally, after I kiss you,

546
00:45:38,346 --> 00:45:39,633
you have to play along.

547
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,366
“Bluhh!”

548
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,340
“Are you kidding me?”

549
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,789
But when you didn’t follow the script,

550
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:44,646
I was lost.

551
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,740
I see.

552
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:46,453
I like you.

553
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,886
Did you hear clearly that I like you?

554
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:48,980
I really like you.

555
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:51,133
But I still want you as my friend.

556
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,473
I’m so happy when I’m with you.

557
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,100
This one is mine.

558
00:45:57,126 --> 00:45:58,680
On the night we had beers together,

559
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,976
the moon was beautiful like tonight.

560
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,786
But I think tonight, it’s more beautiful.

561
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:03,420
If we are going to be together,

562
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,980
our happiness can’t be felt only by you or me.

563
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:08,200
We both need to feel happy.

564
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,000
We are dating.

565
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,900
Bluhh!

566
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,833
Are you kidding me?

567
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,153
I have to say this, right?

568
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,453
Do you remember everything?

569
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,886
You remember everything, right?

570
00:46:50,946 --> 00:46:52,360
I’m back.

571
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,993
Thank you.

572
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,586
For waiting for me.

573
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:12,966
False awakening, I wish dreams come true

574
00:47:12,993 --> 00:47:14,000
Thank you.

575
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,206
Where everything I imagine repeats anew

576
00:47:19,246 --> 00:47:25,586
Not just a memory fading in time

577
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:33,620
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

578
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,313
Boss, hello.

579
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,093
Where is Mo?

580
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,706
He went to meet a client this morning.

581
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,360
(Next station, Lumpini.)

582
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,493
(Doors will open on the left.)

583
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,420
This is like a déjà vu.

584
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Thanks.

585
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,813
(I started my first job as a real estate agent.)

586
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,880
(I never thought it would become my second home.)

587
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,873
Thank everyone for helping me all this time.

588
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:39,953
I promise I will return in three years

589
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,733
and bring the knowledge to improve our team.

590
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
Yay!

591
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,060
Let me give you a hug.

592
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,960
(This place taught me the meaning of home.)

593
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,246
(Home.)

594
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,766
(It is the place where we can be ourselves in front of others.)

595
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,900
Chicha.

596
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,180
(Home is the place where others accept our unpretty side.)

597
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,953
Losers look after themselves.

598
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,986
But I don’t think I lost,

599
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,973
even though it ended this way.

600
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:51,060
All that time,

601
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,500
there were a lot of good memories.

602
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,733
Do you think how long it’ll take for us to get over them?

603
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,313
I don’t know.

604
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,333
But one day, I will be able to laugh it off

605
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,720
when talking about it.

606
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,126
Let’s try together.

607
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,070
Crap.

608
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,406
Are you kidding me?

609
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,993
(Home is the place where we are allowed to be weak.)

610
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:44,240
(Home is also the place that helps us become stronger.)

611
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,146
In the end,

612
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,153
no matter how far we go,

613
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,613
we all will come back home one day.

614
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,450
Hey.

615
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,846
Who are you talking to?

616
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,980
I’m practicing my lines.

617
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,446
When I go to Japan,

618
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:12,440
I can introduce myself smoothly.

619
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,753
Okay.

620
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:18,286
I almost forgot that my boyfriend is moving to Japan for work.

621
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:21,980
Look where he took me on our last date.

622
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:25,840
Why don’t you tell me to do Tai Chi exercise with those elderly?

623
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,220
Mo.

624
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,646
A horse carriage, a rooftop, and a rollercoaster,

625
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,346
we went through all of these together.

626
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,700
Can we have a normal date?

627
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,006
You’re right.

628
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:41,606
It’s good to take it easy.

629
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Hey.

630
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,073
Help me, Mo.

631
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,993
Stop.

632
00:51:46,026 --> 00:51:47,026
The thief stole my bag.

633
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,506
Stop right there.

634
00:51:49,793 --> 00:51:50,800
Stop.

635
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,486
Stop.

636
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,606
Stop right there.

637
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,600
Hey.

638
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,333
Stop.

639
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,693
Stop right there.

640
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,713
Hey, Stop.

641
00:52:01,753 --> 00:52:02,753
Stop.

642
00:52:30,586 --> 00:52:33,866
From the day I first opened my eyes

643
00:52:33,906 --> 00:52:37,006
Since I was born, there's only you on my mind

644
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:40,340
The one who turns and sees my worth

645
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:43,820
You’re the only one for me on this earth

646
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:47,080
I’ve been dreaming of that picture

647
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:50,213
Where our love lasts forever and ever

648
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:53,653
I see your face every night before I sleep

649
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,520
When I don't see you, it will hurt deep

650
00:52:57,566 --> 00:53:03,646
It’s gotta be you, I swear it’s true

651
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,233
I’ll love you forever, never make you blue

652
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:10,326
Please wait a little, a minute or two

653
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:13,366
That's why I'm calling dibs on you

654
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,813
Promise me, no one else you'll give your heart to

655
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,973
Just a little more time, don’t go out of view

656
00:53:20,006 --> 00:53:23,466
I'll get you the biggest gift, that's what I'll do

657
00:53:23,513 --> 00:53:26,800
But until then, can I call dibs on you?

658
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:30,173
I won't keep you waiting long, please don't be cruel

659
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:36,180
I’ve got a golden ring ready just for you

660
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:39,346
Until then, let me call dibs on you

661
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,766
Wanna hear my promise today?

662
00:53:43,793 --> 00:53:47,186
That my heart’s with you, it won’t drift away

663
00:53:47,213 --> 00:53:50,320
When I call, love is the only word I'll say

664
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:54,253
I won't leave you lonely, not even a single day

665
00:53:54,293 --> 00:54:00,233
It’s gotta be you, I swear it’s true

666
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,880
I’ll love you forever, never make you blue

667
00:54:03,926 --> 00:54:06,780
Please wait a little, a minute or two

668
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,993
That's why I'm calling dibs on you

669
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,500
Promise me, no one else you'll give your heart to

670
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:16,613
Just a little more time, don’t go out of view

671
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:20,153
I'll get you the biggest gift, that's what I'll do

672
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,460
But until then, can I call dibs on you?

673
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,800
I won't keep you waiting long, please don't be cruel

674
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,893
I’ve got a golden ring ready just for you

675
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,326
Until then, let me call dibs on you

676
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:41,053
Hooooooo hew

677
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:42,926
I’ve called dibs, let this be known

678
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,566
Got this golden ring, will you take it home?

679
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:46,049
I want you to be my one and lonely

680
00:54:46,073 --> 00:54:49,366
No one else, this heart is yours only

681
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,186
If you reciprocate this love

682
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:52,853
It won't be long, not much

683
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,596
I give you the ring to symbolize as such

684
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,666
People will witness my one true love

685
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,530
Hooooooo hew

686
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,480
That's why I'm calling dibs on you

687
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,653
Promise me, no one else you'll give your heart to

688
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:09,946
Just a little more time, don’t go out of view

689
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,286
I'll get you the biggest gift, that's what I'll do

690
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,766
But until then, can I call dibs on you?

691
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,100
I won't keep you waiting long, please don't be cruel

692
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:26,320
I’ve got a golden ring ready just for you

693
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,893
Until then, let me call dibs on you

694
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,546
We’ve asked for a lot of help from you.

695
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,246
I’m sorry.

696
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,993
It’s good that you know that.

697
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,010
Mo.

698
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,780
Where is it?

699
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,266
I keep it for you.

700
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,400
I’m worried that he might forget it.

701
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,946
Thank you, Boss.

702
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Mo.

703
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,233
If this was a rom-com,

704
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,193
the ring would not be in the box.

705
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,153
This time,

706
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,386
I resized the ring.

707
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,546
This ring,

708
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,133
it’s yours.

709
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,333
This is just an engagement.

710
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,760
When I come back from Japan,

711
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,006
I’ll throw you a big wedding.

712
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,713
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

713
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:04,710
Kiss him.

714
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,793
Kiss him.

715
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,646
Kiss him.

716
00:58:07,673 --> 00:58:09,953
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him. Want to see you every time I wake

717
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:11,862
Thank you for being someone great Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

718
00:58:11,886 --> 00:58:15,753
Someone I’ve been searching for

719
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,226
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

720
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:24,833
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

721
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,080
No precious gift I need

722
00:58:27,113 --> 00:58:31,353
Just stay the same like this, please

723
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:35,973
And this is the very best of all

724
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:48,953
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

725
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,240
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

726
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:55,446
Want to see you every time I wake

727
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,673
Thank you for being someone great

728
00:58:57,693 --> 00:58:59,880
Someone I’ve been searching for

729
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:00,913
Hug me.

730
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,573
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

731
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:10,733
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

732
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,953
No precious gift I need

733
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:17,220
Just stay the same like this, please

734
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:22,466
And this is the very best of all

735
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,820
Why the bag is so small?

736
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,633
I should have bought a bigger bag.

737
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,553
Even if you bought a bigger bag,

738
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,906
it wouldn’t be big enough.

739
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:39,189
Look at all the stuff you bring with you.

740
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:42,580
Why are you taking them with you?

741
00:59:42,606 --> 00:59:43,900
You’re taking all of them away?

742
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:49,220
I’m worried it will feel alone if I only take one of them.

743
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,240
Give it to me.

744
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,160
Living with me, they won’t feel lonely.

745
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,660
And…

746
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,613
when you are there,

747
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,006
don’t forget to call me every day.

748
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:07,169
Always carry your phone with you.

749
01:00:07,193 --> 01:00:08,040
Don’t turn off your phone.

750
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,973
Don’t ignore my call.

751
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,286
Always answer my messages.

752
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,906
Don’t give your number to anyone.

753
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,646
Why don’t you continue?

754
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,946
I can’t hold back anymore.

755
01:01:07,973 --> 01:01:08,973
Mo.

756
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,540
Are you going to do it here?

757
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:12,706
Yes.

758
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,480
Don’t do it here.

759
01:01:14,513 --> 01:01:15,513
Let’s do it here.

760
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,973
Kiss me.

761
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,100
Do you think you’re the only one who is holding back?

762
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,880
Bring it on.

763
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,486
Stop it.

764
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,593
Hey.

765
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,530
Again?

766
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,120
No. (The End)
