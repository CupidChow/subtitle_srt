1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,710
I think we should keep our relationship…

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,150
I know what I need to do.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,160
I get it.

4
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,100
I don’t know how to tell them either.

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,576
The colors of your outfits are matching.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,920
Did you pick the colors together?

7
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,770
No.

8
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,120
In my opinion, Heng is slow-witted.

9
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,146
If you don’t tell him how you feel, he will never know it.

10
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,720
I’m dating Mo.

11
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,940
Are you okay with dating me?

12
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,840
If you don’t want to tell anyone about us, it’s okay.

13
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,500
Being your boyfriend is not something

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,930
I would be embarrassed about.

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,950
We are dating.

16
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,720
Ouch!

17
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,210
Come here.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,250
Heng, what the hell are you doing?

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,250
Our team’s reputation is ruined.

20
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,370
Forget about that.

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,100
I want to know if you two are really dating.

22
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,390
Yes, Meow.

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,420
We are dating.

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,510
No! Are you crazy?

25
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,740
He’s just pulling your leg.

26
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,840
What?!

27
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,299
I pulled a prank on him the other day.

28
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,890
So he did this to get back at me.

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,960
Your prank went too far.

30
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,930
Excuse me. I need to get back to work.

31
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,800
Wait, Mo.

32
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,610
Everyone, it’s not a joke. I mean what I said.

33
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,790
Do you think we don’t know?

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
You like Mo.

35
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,910
You try to ask him out.

36
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,960
But Mo rejects you.

37
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,530
This is why you did this.

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,270
No, no.

39
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,140
You are so devious, devious, devious.

40
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
Why no one believes…

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Meow.

42
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,080
That’s right. You’re cunning.

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,026
- Newyear, I’m not joking. - I don’t believe you.

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,440
Ten, please help me.

45
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,660
I’m not joking.

46
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,876
- I don’t believe you. - You’re cunning.

47
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,130
Newyear. Meow. Ten.

48
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,530
Hey! I’m serious. I’m not joking!

49
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,530
Mo.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,110
Mo, wait.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,220
I’m all wet.

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,720
I’ll go take a shower.

53
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,770
Mo.

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,940
Why did you tell them that?

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,790
I…

56
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,480
I’m okay if you’re going to tell everyone about us.

57
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,950
But before you did that,

58
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,390
you should have asked me first.

59
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,670
You suddenly announced it in the middle of an online meeting with the head office.

60
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,910
I’m not okay with it.

61
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,460
I see.

62
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,580
I’m sorry.

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,850
I saw you feel insecure about us.

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,850
I just wanted to make you feel better.

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Mo.

66
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,120
I want you to know.

67
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,730
If it’s you, I’m not afraid to tell the whole world about our relationship.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,700
Me too.

69
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,660
If you’re the only one in the world who accepts me for who I am,

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,950
that’s good enough for me.

71
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,740
It’s okay.

72
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,790
Let’s start again.

73
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,370
Let’s take a shower.

74
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,470
I mean I need to take a shower.

75
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,980
My face is all wet.

76
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,970
Heng, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.

77
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,970
Mo.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Mo.

79
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,370
Mo.

80
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,960
Wake up.

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,680
Mo.

82
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,970
- Yeah, I’m up. - Mo, get up.

83
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,570
Come on.

84
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,620
Are you alright?

85
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,600
Are you sick?

86
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,990
Mo, you’re burning up.

87
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,450
I think you should take a sick leave today.

88
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,960
I’ll go make you a rice soup.

89
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,020
Wait.

90
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,390
I think you should order delivery.

91
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,670
It’s okay.

92
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,660
Now, you’re my boyfriend.

93
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,050
Don’t feel bad to ask for my help.

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,660
I’ll make rice soup for you.

95
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,480
I didn’t feel bad to ask for your help.

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,200
The last time you made fried rice,

97
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,970
you forgot to put rice in it.

98
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,210
This time, I’ll put rice in first. Okay?

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,650
Don’t forget to put water in it.

100
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,240
Trust me. I’m Chef Heng.

101
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,930
I’ll create a delicious dish for you.

102
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,730
Don’t forget to put pork in it.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Got it.

104
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,290
Did I add salt?

105
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,220
If I did, I would have remembered.

106
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,480
Here.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Pork.

108
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,200
Did I add salt?

109
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
If I did, I would have remembered.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,800
Here.

111
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,930
Luckily, I remember.

112
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,050
If I forgot to add salt, the soup would be bland.

113
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,420
Dad.

114
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,700
Why aren’t you getting ready for work?

115
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,050
You will be late.

116
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
I don’t want to go to work today.

117
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,730
Aim.

118
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,890
Can you call in sick to my boss?

119
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,960
You are the boss in your office.

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,020
Didn’t you say you’ve moved on from Heng?

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,590
Why are you depressed like this?

122
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Huh?

123
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,400
I thought Heng didn’t like men.

124
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,070
So I decided to forget him.

125
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,970
But I found out that Heng likes Mo.

126
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,370
Now, I feel like I still have some hope.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,650
Then why are you curling up in bed like a sick dog?

128
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,460
Come to think of it.

129
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,970
How can a Boomer like me

130
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,260
compete with a young man like Mo?

131
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,480
What are you saying?

132
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,830
You are handsome like a top star.

133
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,310
You are a Boomer. So what?

134
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,940
You are such a daddy.

135
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,310
You are saying this.

136
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,340
Does it mean you approve of Heng?

137
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,510
No.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I hate seeing you losing to him.

139
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,720
You need to get up and fight.

140
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,900
You need to defeat Mo.

141
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,970
No one is better than my dad.

142
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,490
Come on.

143
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,800
Get up and take a shower.

144
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,800
You need to fight back.

145
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,970
Come on.

146
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,330
Get in, Uncle.

147
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,850
Uncle?

148
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,870
I mean Dad.

149
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,650
Mo, you’re here.

150
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,960
That’s good. I’m about to take it to you.

151
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,950
It’s okay.

152
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,750
I was worried that you would cause a fire and I would be trapped upstairs.

153
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,960
Don’t underestimate me.

154
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,150
Look at my result.

155
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,740
Wow. It looks good.

156
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
Here.

157
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,370
How is it?

158
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
It’s delicious.

159
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,760
How did you make it?

160
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,150
It’s so easy.

161
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,990
I picked up my phone and ordered a delivery.

162
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,940
The rice soup I made was salty.

163
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,870
It was probably because the rice was old.

164
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,540
I don’t think the rice was the problem.

165
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,620
Thank you anyway for trying to cook for me.

166
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,410
Let’s get back to your meal.

167
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,500
Taste it.

168
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,300
I’ll feed you.

169
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,226
What would you do if I weren’t here? This must be my lucky day

170
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,960
That made you turn my way

171
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,600
I can eat it myself.

172
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,320
To win your love, I played my every card

173
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,250
I got to go to work now.

174
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,320
I’ll rush home after work.

175
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,430
Yes, you are my lucky star

176
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,480
You look great now.

177
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,980
Can we freeze this moment in time?

178
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,600
To win your love, I played my every card

179
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,170
Damn. I forgot.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Forgot what?

181
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,390
I forgot to kiss my boyfriend before leaving for work.

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,990
Heng, you forgot to clean up!

183
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,280
Kongdech, you don’t look older at all.

184
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,610
Look.

185
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,360
You look so fly from any angle.

186
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,960
Your style is so dope.

187
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,740
Your career is on point right now.

188
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,300
No need to be afraid.

189
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,980
May I come in?

190
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,460
Sure.

191
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,220
Boss, Mo is taking a leave today.

192
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,400
I’m going to assign Heng to take care of Mo’s client today.

193
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Sure.

194
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,280
No problem.

195
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,970
Heng will do a good job.

196
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,370
NBD. DW.

197
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,950
What did you say?

198
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,540
No big deal. Don’t worry.

199
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
You’re so lame.

200
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,720
I think I heard my mom use the slang before.

201
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,330
Boss.

202
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,780
There’s a small problem.

203
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,090
The house that Heng’s client wants is rumored to be haunted.

204
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Huh?

205
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,430
A haunted house?

206
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,910
Anyone who moves into the house never lasts more than one night.

207
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,840
The client proposed this.

208
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,740
If we can stay overnight in the house,

209
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,170
he will buy it.

210
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,430
Ten, why do we need to do that?

211
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,840
Why don’t we hire a shaman to do it?

212
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,730
The client is a shaman but he’s scared.

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,530
No need to be sacred.

214
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,530
There’s nothing to be afraid of.

215
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,610
Don’t worry, Heng.

216
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
I’ll go with you.

217
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:58,190
I’ll show you that ghost is just a humbug.

218
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,780
What does ‘a humbug’ mean?

219
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
It means a hoax.

220
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,580
I heard my dad use the word.

221
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,000
Ten.

222
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,510
I’m scared of ghosts.

223
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,980
What do I do, Aim?

224
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,960
I’m afraid of ghosts.

225
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,230
A haunted house?

226
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,450
This must be his plan to spend a night with you.

227
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,740
You’re overthinking.

228
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,740
Boss has moved on from me.

229
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,980
How do you know that?

230
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,720
It’s better to be cautious in this kind of situation.

231
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,490
Let me see what you’re packing for the sleepover.

232
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,530
Go sit there.

233
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,730
Sit down.

234
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,160
I got it.

235
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
What?

236
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,550
Perfume?

237
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,360
Why are you bringing a perfume?

238
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,860
I’ll use it.

239
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,860
Are you going to wear perfume for him?

240
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,770
Leave it out.

241
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,040
Why is it so thin?

242
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,160
It’s my nightwear.

243
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,476
Are you going to wear this to seduce him?

244
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,590
It’s as thin as tissue.

245
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,800
Leave it here.

246
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,720
Sorry. I accidentally put it in my bag.

247
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,860
You can take it back.

248
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,430
Wear this when you go to bed.

249
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,340
Don’t forget to tell Boss that it’s my T-shirt.

250
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,080
What are you doing?

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,450
So it will have my scent on it.

252
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,270
Honey, don’t worry.

253
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,700
I’m just testing the haunted house.

254
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,490
It’s not like I’m going on a date with Boss.

255
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Don’t overthink.

256
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Smile.

257
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Zip up.

258
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,980
Go back to your seat.

259
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,130
I’ll check the other things you are bringing with you.

260
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,640
That’s all I’ll bring.

261
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,330
That’s my pants.

262
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,010
Do you want to check my underwear too?

263
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,330
You feel so jealous that you get sick.

264
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,970
Who allows you to talk?

265
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,240
Don’t bring the holy water.

266
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,330
A perfume is more essential.

267
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,340
Take it with you.

268
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,340
Let me see your nightwear.

269
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,720
Why is it so covered up?

270
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,940
Leave it here.

271
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,020
You should take this one.

272
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,490
It’s more revealing.

273
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,810
You need to show off your assets.

274
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,970
Aim.

275
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,770
You’re too young to say this kind of thing.

276
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Do you want to date Heng?

277
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,790
Yes.

278
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,930
If you do, you need to listen to me.

279
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,919
Should I bring the cross?

280
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
In case the ghost in the house is a vampire.

281
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,970
Dad, stop worrying about the ghost.

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
The only thing you should be worried about is losing Heng.

283
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,460
Leave it at home.

284
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,460
These are wireless earbuds.

285
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,940
I’ll tell you what you need to do tonight to win over Heng.

286
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,970
Okay?

287
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,020
That’s wicked, sweetie.

288
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,760
The first thing you need to do.

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Stop saying those slang.

290
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,500
It’s so cringe.

291
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,970
Cringe? What does it mean?

292
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,950
Dad, did you bring shorts?

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,500
No.

294
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,540
You need to have them when spending a night with a man.

295
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,430
Why do you come home so early?

296
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Ten.

297
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,910
I knew you had a cold.

298
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,690
So I bought porridge for you.

299
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,410
Thank you.

300
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,990
Can I go in?

301
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Huh?

302
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,670
I’ll put the porridge into a bowl for you.

303
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,610
Here is your beer.

304
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,650
Miss, I know that you are heartbroken

305
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,970
But when you drink here,

306
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,980
you need to pay for your drinks.

307
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,700
My bar will go bankrupt because of you.

308
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,770
It was my fault.

309
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,300
I realized my feelings too late.

310
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,250
It was only one week late.

311
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,790
Heng, why didn’t you wait for me?

312
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,320
Maybe if Heng knows how you feel,

313
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,730
he might change his mind.

314
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,180
Do you want me to call him?

315
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,870
No.

316
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,480
A girl like me doesn’t need a guy like him.

317
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,390
If I look at my phone, I’ll see messages from a bunch of guys.

318
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,650
The first guy I see walking into the bar,

319
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,650
I’ll ask him out.

320
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,910
I’ll wait and see.

321
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,890
Oh my gosh.

322
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,600
He’s freaking handsome.

323
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,140
Chicha, you hit the jackpot.

324
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,940
You visit me on the day that my house is a total mess.

325
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,460
You should rest. I’ll clean it up for you.

326
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,300
It’s okay.

327
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,520
I feel much better now.

328
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,050
My face is red because the weather is hot.

329
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,210
It’s not because I’m sick.

330
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
I mean it.

331
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,560
I wasn’t looking.

332
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,120
It’s not because I’m sick.

333
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,350
It’s because I wasn’t looking.

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,410
I’ll put the trash out.

335
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,290
Sit down.

336
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,330
Come here.

337
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,530
I’ll get the porridge for you.

338
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,920
I don’t want it to be spilled because someone isn’t looking.

339
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,520
What time is it?

340
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,940
7.15 pm.

341
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,590
I mean, what time are you going to ask me out?

342
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,930
I’ve been waiting for a while.

343
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,460
Handsome, the beer is on me.

344
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,780
After you finish it, please leave.

345
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,190
You are heartbroken…

346
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,660
because Heng announced his relationship with Mo, right?

347
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,000
Nonsense.

348
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,060
Why would I be heartbroken because of a guy like him?

349
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,190
Chicha.

350
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,710
When you are with me,

351
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,180
you don’t need to be shy.

352
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,009
You can tell me everything.

353
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,020
I can be your support system. You can tell me everything.

354
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:14,020
I can be your support system.

355
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,250
Really?

356
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,420
I came here bracing myself to be lectured by you.

357
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,950
I won’t respond.

358
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,970
Heng, you rascal. Why didn’t you wait for me?

359
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,170
I was only a bit late.

360
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,960
Hey, you’re hurting my hands.

361
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,600
If you want my sister to be your girlfriend, then you need to endure this.

362
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,720
I’ll endure it.

363
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,970
Is this…

364
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,250
the haunted house?

365
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,860
It’s so dank.

366
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,350
Good, Dad. Now, you sound like a Gen Z.

367
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,490
It’s rather spooky than dank.

368
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,650
Don’t be sacred.

369
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,580
This is your chance to show Heng that you are brave and dependable.

370
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,530
The dogs are probably hungry.

371
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:13,970
Don’t worry about it.

372
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,960
Good boy, yum-yum. Yum-yum, good boy.

373
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,990
Good boy…

374
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,960
It has unique vibes.

375
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,140
Overall, it looks glam.

376
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,440
Pretty interesting taste.

377
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,790
The house is old.

378
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,970
So it’s not goated.

379
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,180
What?! What?! What?!

380
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,190
What is that?

381
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,940
It’s my phone ringtone.

382
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,670
Boss.

383
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,020
Excuse me. I need to answer this call.

384
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,950
Hello, Mo.

385
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,670
Yes, I arrived at the house.

386
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,750
Don’t worry.

387
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,950
Okay.

388
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,300
Why didn’t you turn on silent mode?

389
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,420
Will you turn on silent mode?

390
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,880
I already did.

391
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Huh?

392
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,590
Where does this loud music come from?

393
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,020
Boss.

394
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,540
I think we should leave.

395
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,910
Dad, don’t be scared.

396
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,746
This is your chance to score points with him.

397
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,790
Repeat what I say.

398
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,840
Hey!

399
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,830
Hey.

400
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,240
You, evil spirit.

401
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
You…

402
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,690
Huh?

403
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,960
Say it.

404
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,090
Hey! You, evil spirit.

405
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,090
Where the hell are you hiding?

406
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,470
Where the hell are you hiding?

407
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,000
Come out and possess me if you dare.

408
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,710
Come out and possess me if you dare.

409
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,740
I don’t think we should mess with it.

410
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,440
Boss.

411
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,180
The music is turned off.

412
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,970
You are awesome.

413
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,560
See? Mother is mothering.

414
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,650
Let’s put our stuff in the room.

415
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Yes.

416
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,760
Boss, wait up.

417
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,970
Be careful. It’s hot.

418
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:34,130
It’s okay. I can eat it myself.

419
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,290
Don’t be stubborn.

420
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,160
Can you let me take care of you?

421
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,960
You took care of me.

422
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,390
But…

423
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,590
that was all in the past.

424
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,330
But I still remember the first day we worked together at the Chiang Mai branch.

425
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,376
Don’t be overconfident just because you wrap up your first deal.

426
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,826
Next time, you will handle a client by yourself.

427
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,190
I won’t help you anymore.

428
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Yes.

429
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,030
Hey! The thief stole his bag.

430
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,650
What are you looking at? Help me.

431
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,240
Yes. Stop right there.

432
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,060
Hey.

433
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,090
Stop.

434
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,100
Hey!

435
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,950
Mo, I mean help me get up.

436
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Mo!

437
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,060
You didn’t fall that hard.

438
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,050
I didn’t think your injury would be this serious.

439
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,120
The doctor said if someone helped me get up,

440
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,750
it wouldn’t have been this bad.

441
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,970
I’m sorry.

442
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,090
How about this?

443
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,990
I’ll make it up to you by writing you a well-wishing message.

444
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,970
The pen runs out of ink

445
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,820
(Get well in no t)

446
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,970
I was going to write “Get will in no time.”

447
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,980
But it turns out to be “Get will in no t.”

448
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,400
It sounds like a curse.

449
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,460
I’d better remove it.

450
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,310
I don’t think it’s removable.

451
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,240
Forget it.

452
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,970
No, I’ll try again.

453
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,730
Wait, wait.

454
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,720
It hurts.

455
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,930
Hang in there.

456
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,770
Mo. Mo.

457
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,560
Mo.

458
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,780
- Ouch! - Hold on.

459
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,930
Ouch. Mo.

460
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,600
- What are you doing? It hurts. - Hang in there.

461
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,970
Mo.

462
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
- Hang in there. - I ended up getting a fractured bone.

463
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,980
It took six months to recover.

464
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,630
But it was worth it.

465
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,980
Because you took care of me and we fell in love.

466
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,960
But when I look back,

467
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:45,200
I’m not sure if it was love or guilt-conscious.

468
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,690
Come here.

469
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,250
What are you doing?

470
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,170
Stop resisting.

471
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,350
Done.

472
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,460
Thank you.

473
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,450
Here.

474
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,310
If you have time,

475
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,490
can you text my mom sometimes?

476
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,490
She said she missed you.

477
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,050
Do you want some water?

478
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,790
It’s ok…

479
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,170
The atmosphere is good.

480
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,750
My outfit looks good.

481
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,850
But he is…

482
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
turned off.

483
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Hengney.

484
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,470
Why are you so covered up?

485
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,730
This is Mo’s clothes.

486
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,130
He chose it for me.

487
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,100
Your top is so thin. You might feel cold.

488
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,950
Bummer.

489
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,930
What could I do when he totally kills the mood?

490
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,420
We’ve gotten to this point.

491
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,640
You have nothing to lose.

492
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,490
It’s time for checkmate.

493
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,130
I feel sleepy.

494
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,750
I’m so sleepy.

495
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,860
Come on, Hengney.

496
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Let’s go to bed.

497
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,870
Hey.

498
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,780
What are you doing there?

499
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
My mom told me I shouldn’t sleep in the same bed as my boss.

500
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,440
Good night, Boss.

501
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,650
Let it out.

502
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,400
Let it all out.

503
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,550
Don’t hold it back.

504
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,920
Don’t hold it in.

505
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,490
Let it out.

506
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,960
You’re back?

507
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,990
Yes.

508
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,860
Eat it.

509
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,130
Before it gets cold.

510
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,640
It’s delicious.

511
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,390
Where did you order it from?

512
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,920
I just picked up my phone…

513
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,730
and called Boss.

514
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Huh?!

515
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,660
Boss?

516
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,170
After we spent the night together,

517
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,960
Hengney now knows what the real deal looks like.

518
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,600
From now on, the three of us will live together.

519
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Mo,

520
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,670
Boss,

521
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
And…

522
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,220
Hengney.

523
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,730
Huh?!

524
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,360
What the hell is this?!

525
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,440
Did you have a nightmare?

526
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,370
Yes.

527
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
What?

528
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Wait.

529
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,620
Ten, why are you still here?

530
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,700
I was about to leave but I saw that your house is so messy.

531
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,360
Heng never helps you clean up, does he?

532
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,840
He helps sometimes.

533
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,320
He helps make a mess.

534
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,120
His toy boxes are everywhere.

535
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,110
Ten.

536
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,180
You don’t need to do it.

537
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,650
I’ll do it later.

538
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
It’s okay.

539
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I finished vacuuming the floor.

540
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,960
All I have left to do is this.

541
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,890
Boss, did you turn on the television?

542
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
No.

543
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,970
It’s probably nothing.

544
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,700
The television is probably malfunctioning.

545
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,000
Hengney.

546
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,050
Yes.

547
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,420
Find the remote control and turn it off.

548
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Yes.

549
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,710
Cher-aim.

550
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,880
I think the ghost has just messed with me.

551
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,150
Aim, sweetie.

552
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,970
I found it.

553
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Huh?

554
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,230
That’s a relief.

555
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,440
We should…

556
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,870
go back to sleep.

557
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Yes.

558
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,950
We’re screwed.

559
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,240
I think the remote control is broken.

560
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,810
I’ll unplug the TV.

561
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,850
Okay.

562
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Boss!

563
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,330
The power cable is not connected.

564
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,510
This is a real shock.

565
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Boss.

566
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,970
This house is really haunted.

567
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,600
I told you.

568
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Ghosts don’t exist.

569
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,880
Look.

570
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,270
Damn ghost! Come out and show yourself.

571
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,570
Stop fooling around.

572
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,920
Reveal yourself.

573
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,720
Come out.

574
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,980
I’ll hit you.

575
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,560
A life for a life.

576
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,430
Wow.

577
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,370
You are superb.

578
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,620
No one is braver than my boss.

579
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,440
Who did you call Boss?

580
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,150
Boss.

581
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,570
Who did you call Boss?

582
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,370
Why do you look different?

583
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,960
Guess who I am.

584
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,740
This is obvious.

585
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,890
He is being possessed.

586
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,580
Help me.

587
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,490
Help.

588
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,870
I’m being haunted.

589
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,170
Help.

590
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,340
If you are not my boss,

591
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,820
then who are you?

592
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,600
I’m the owner of this house.

593
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,060
But in the land’s deed,

594
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,229
the house belongs to a bank.

595
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,600
I don’t care.

596
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,130
I fell in love with my chauffeur.

597
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,410
But he eloped with my housemaid.

598
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,840
I died of a broken heart in this house.

599
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,950
Wait.

600
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,780
Why does the story sound familiar?

601
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,330
What do you want from me?

602
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,736
I can find a client to rent your house.

603
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,060
I don’t want money.

604
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,960
I want you to do something for me.

605
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,320
Do what?

606
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,480
If you want me to sacrifice my life for my boss,

607
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,810
I can do it.

608
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,950
I got to where I am today because of him.

609
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,740
Kiss me.

610
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,950
Huh?!

611
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,300
I want to know how it feels to kiss my subordinate.

612
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,220
I’ll leave for the next world.

613
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,270
I’ll leave this house alone.

614
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,580
Jeez.

615
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,610
Why doesn’t he answer my call?

616
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,530
Maybe…

617
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,460
There’s something going on between them.

618
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,990
Why are you still here?

619
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,510
I was about to leave.

620
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,330
But I saw the fan. I couldn’t help it.

621
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,070
So I disassembled and cleaned it.

622
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
Huh?

623
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,000
Are you worried about Heng spending the night with our boss?

624
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
No.

625
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,640
I…

626
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,800
I called to ask him…

627
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,870
if he took my T-shirt. I can’t find it.

628
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,570
Mo.

629
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,540
I know that you are dating Heng.

630
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,990
If you know that,

631
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,980
why did you come here?

632
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Because I’m worried about you.

633
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,380
You don’t need to worry about me.

634
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,250
I’m fine.

635
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,910
I’m not talking about your illness.

636
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,550
You know what I mean.

637
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
Heng is different from us.

638
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,580
Can he introduce you to his family like I did?

639
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,890
Even if that’s the case,

640
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,960
I am happy with the way things are.

641
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,960
Are you sure?

642
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,570
At least, I’d never ignored your calls.

643
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,250
Look at him.

644
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,880
You two aren’t dating for long.

645
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,230
He starts to show his true color.

646
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,890
Who knows what he and our boss are doing right now?

647
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,780
Don’t try to stir things up.

648
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,350
Heng is not that kind of person.

649
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,680
You say that because you love him.

650
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,640
I’ll go there and prove it.

651
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,180
I’ll open your eyes to the truth.

652
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,480
Hey, Ten.

653
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,580
Give the fan blades back to me.

654
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,780
Ten.

655
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,970
I already gave you some time to decide.

656
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,480
Will you kiss me or not?

657
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,300
Is there anything else you want?

658
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,976
I’ll make merit and dedicate it to you.

659
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,970
You will never understand how a heartbroken man like me feels.

660
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,440
I heard that many people want to be with you.

661
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,180
Even the owner of this body,

662
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
he also likes you.

663
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,710
It was all in the past.

664
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,930
I really look up to him.

665
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
I don’t care.

666
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,280
Kiss me.

667
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:32,970
Then I’ll leave his body.

668
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,020
Fine.

669
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,950
If that will save my boss’s life,

670
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,120
I will do it.

671
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,990
I can’t do it.

672
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,010
Why?

673
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,960
If it’s not a kiss out of love, I can’t do it.

674
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,490
If you refuse to kiss me, then I’ll kiss you.

675
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,890
Help me.

676
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,460
Help me.

677
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,640
See? I knew it.

678
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,960
Mo trusts you.

679
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,216
But look at what you are doing.

680
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
Ten, help me.

681
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,280
Our boss is being possessed.

682
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,560
The spirit told me to kiss him.

683
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,080
Save your lies to fool someone else.

684
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,200
Do you think I’m stupid?

685
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,220
You too, Boss.

686
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,240
You are not a kid anymore.

687
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,480
Why are you doing this?

688
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,900
What the freaking day is this?

689
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,910
My dream has come true.

690
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,350
This is how it feels to kiss my employee.

691
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,970
Now I can rest in peace.

692
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,560
Boss.

693
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,140
Boss.

694
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,740
Ten, help me.

695
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:17,830
Ten.

696
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,640
Boss.

697
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,690
Boss.

698
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,880
Ten.

699
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,510
What are you doing here?

700
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,090
It might sound unbelievable.

701
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,680
Earlier,

702
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,000
you were possessed by the ghost.

703
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,020
Huh?

704
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,340
Are you serious, Hengney?

705
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,120
Yes, I’m telling you the truth.

706
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,320
But let’s forget it.

707
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,980
We are now safe.

708
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,640
NBD. DW.

709
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,980
Why do my lips hurt?

710
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,490
You’re up.

711
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,460
Taste this.

712
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,350
I made it myself. I didn’t order delivery.

713
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,970
Is this really you?

714
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
Ouch!

715
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,240
What are you doing?

716
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,560
Don’t try to change the subject.

717
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,890
What were you doing last night?

718
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,550
I was testing the haunted house for our client.

719
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,760
Why didn’t you answer my call?

720
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,290
Don’t tell me that you didn’t know I called.

721
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,740
I told you not to turn on silent mode.

722
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,260
Did you…

723
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,220
I’m sorry.

724
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,220
I didn’t do anything I shouldn’t.

725
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,350
I swear.

726
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,500
I got it.

727
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,800
You didn’t have to do this.

728
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,390
Hey.

729
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,830
Wait.

730
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,465
Why does the house look so clean?

731
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,880
Did you…

732
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:02,960
clean it by yourself?

733
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,980
Or…

734
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,370
I’m hungry.

735
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,301
Let’s eat.

736
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:34,960
I’ll tell you what happened later. Okay?

737
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,330
Sure.

738
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:40,127
Dig in.

739
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:41,672
Be careful. It’s hot.

740
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,225
Can I sleep in your room?

741
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,334
Why?

742
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,734
Are you still afraid of the ghost you saw last night?

743
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:01,592
No.

744
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,618
I see that you haven’t fully recovered.

745
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,356
I want to stay near to take care of you.

746
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:07,854
I’ll sleep on the floor.

747
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,820
Fine.

748
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,020
Good night.

749
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:33,989
Heng.

750
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:35,407
Yes.

751
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,203
You know…

752
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:44,843
I can’t sleep without a bolster.

753
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:49,985
Why are you telling me that?

754
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:59,454
Today, I washed my bolster.

755
00:52:01,316 --> 00:52:02,960
I left it outside to dry.

756
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
And?

757
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,243
If you want to sleep on my bed,

758
00:52:13,272 --> 00:52:14,690
then come on.

759
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:20,610
I never thought, not even once before

760
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,363
That this love would knock on my door

761
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,000
Is it you? Is this real and true?

762
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:30,683
I can't figure out why it had to be you

763
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:31,745
Wait.

764
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,740
Are you supposed to be my bolster?

765
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,309
Then you need to stay still.

766
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,727
If you move,

767
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,820
you need to go back to sleep on the floor.

768
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,396
Mo.

769
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,930
This must be my lucky day

770
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:57,221
That made you turn my way

771
00:52:57,243 --> 00:53:01,185
To win your love, I played my every card

772
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,490
And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

773
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,287
I feel a bit dizzy.

774
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,760
Then…

775
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,392
When you feel better, let’s go on a trip.

776
00:53:16,705 --> 00:53:17,796
This time,

777
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,225
we will go just the two of us.

778
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:21,970
Good idea.

779
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,985
I have a place I want to go with you.

780
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,130
Where? Where do you want us to go?

781
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,963
Let’s go meet my parents.

782
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:41,098
Sure.

783
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,960
What?! Mo!

784
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,749
Stay still.

785
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,625
What do you mean?

786
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:50,385
When will we meet them?

787
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,763
No.

788
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:53,949
Heng.

789
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,338
Stay still when I hold you. Close your eyes.

790
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,741
What should I wear?

791
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,392
Wake up. Don’t fall asleep yet.

792
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,698
Hello, Mom.

793
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:17,970
Hello, Dad.

794
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,300
Hello, Mo’s family.

795
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,349
Why can’t we tell them that we’re on a trip together?

796
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,294
If we told them the truth, do you think they would let us take the leave?

797
00:54:35,316 --> 00:54:36,436
I just got here.

798
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,349
Isn’t it too soon to meet your parents?

799
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,847
You don’t want to meet my parents?

800
00:54:39,883 --> 00:54:42,349
Of course, I really want to meet them.

801
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:44,130
I never told you before.

802
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:45,367
I like men.

803
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,821
Don’t call me ‘Dad’!

804
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:53,650
Don’t you worry about your dad’s reaction at all?

805
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:55,105
I’m begging you.

806
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:56,749
Do you love Mo?

807
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,654
Yes.

808
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:01,105
If you want to date him, follow me.

809
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,923
Who is your mate?

810
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,909
How dare you say that to me, scumbag?

811
00:55:06,938 --> 00:55:07,938
Please don’t hurt him.

812
00:55:07,963 --> 00:55:09,554
If you want to hit him, you can take it on me.

813
00:55:09,578 --> 00:55:10,778
Why didn’t you say it earlier?
