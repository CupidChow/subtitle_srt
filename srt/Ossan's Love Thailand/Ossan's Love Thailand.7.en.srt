1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,000
I’m falling for your girlfriend.

2
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:08,468
Ten is my ex.

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,982
Recently, he asked me to get back together.

4
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:12,680
I already said no.

5
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:17,320
Didn’t I tell you to read the contract thoroughly before you sign it?

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,005
How could you let this happen?

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,748
I will never let you feel lonely again.

8
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:22,800
I love you.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,097
I love you too.

10
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:27,548
Chi is my friend.

11
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:30,200
If you only see her as a friend,

12
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:32,822
then prove it by dating me.

13
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,948
Can you do that?

14
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:34,982
Yes, I’ll date you.

15
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:23,405
Mo, you’re up?

16
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,320
Good. I just finished reheating breakfast.

17
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,550
Come and eat it.

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,714
Why do you act like…

19
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,310
like…

20
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,748
Like nothing happened?

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,250
Bluhh!

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,222
Are you crazy?

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,554
Actually, I…

24
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,531
I don’t know how to act.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,325
Now, do you understand how I felt

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,314
when you kissed me that night?

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,040
I didn’t know how to act back then.

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,737
Is this your payback on me?

29
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,050
Yes.

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,017
But I remember

31
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,360
when we kissed,

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
how it felt.

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,697
I slowly walked to you.

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,354
And you…

35
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,617
I remember it.

36
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:55,651
Let’s have breakfast.

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
Are you sure?

38
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,550
Yes.

39
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:07,428
Dig in.

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,794
Good boy, nom nom.

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,468
What are you doing?

42
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,657
I don’t know how couples usually act.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,485
I also have never dated a guy before.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,411
I don’t know…

45
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:47,445
if I should feed you or you should feed me.

46
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:57,548
This kind of thing,

47
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,325
whether I feed you,

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,022
or you feed me,

49
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:07,605
It’s all fine.

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,085
You ask me if you look okay

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,994
I'll answer every time though you don't hear what I say

52
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:23,811
You're the sweetest of all, I can't stop smiling for sure

53
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,874
I can never ask for more

54
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:33,028
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

55
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:37,137
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

56
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:39,417
Want to see you every time I wake

57
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,405
Take another bite.

58
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,828
Thank you for being someone great

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,805
Someone I’ve been searching for

60
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:50,422
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

61
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,737
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Good boy.

63
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,137
No precious gift I need

64
00:04:57,154 --> 00:05:00,971
Just stay the same like this, please

65
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:05,994
And this is the very best of all Can you stop staring at me?

66
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:07,622
You look cute when you are shy.

67
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:10,931
It’s the very best of all

68
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,920
It’s the very best of all

69
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,074
Can I still change my mind?

70
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:13,971
No, it’s too late.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,970
It’s the very best of all

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,176
It’s the very best of all

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Let’s eat.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Mo.

75
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,680
Are you okay?

76
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,091
Umm…

77
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I…

78
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,100
I think we should keep our relationship…

79
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:40,731
I won’t tell anyone.

80
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,554
I know what I need to do.

81
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,445
I get it.

82
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,582
I don’t know how to tell them either.

83
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,165
A few days ago, we were arguing.

84
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:55,188
Now,

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,217
we have kissed.

86
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,400
Don’t worry.

87
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,434
Let’s go to work.

88
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:13,554
Mo.

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Get in.

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,460
You can go first.

91
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,460
If we go in together, it will be suspicious.

92
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:19,828
Suspicious? How?

93
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,291
Why don’t you come with me?

94
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,617
No.

95
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,542
Come on, Mo.

96
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,617
Mo.

97
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,651
Mo.

98
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,817
You go first.

99
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,834
Mo.

100
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,988
Boss, this is this month’s entertainment expenses.

101
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:50,645
Meow.

102
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:51,674
Yes?

103
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:54,840
Do I look different?

104
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,308
No.

105
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
That’s right.

106
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,291
I did not change at all.

107
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,034
I’m the same person.

108
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,891
Yes.

109
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,908
The same.

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,371
You are exactly the same.

111
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
The same.

112
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,165
Yes, you did not change.

113
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,148
Not at all.

114
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:22,177
Yes.

115
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,302
You did well, Kongdech.

116
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,780
You are back to being the cool boss.

117
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,994
Only focus on work.

118
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,702
Did you call me to see you?

119
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,520
Have a seat, Hengne…

120
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,428
Here, here.

121
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,702
Here is the important work

122
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:08,525
I’m going to assign to you, Hengn...

123
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,034
Here.

124
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,605
This client is a level 5.

125
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,382
Level 5? This is a VVIP.

126
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,017
Everything about them is top secret.

127
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,440
After you complete the project, you can destroy all the documents.

128
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
Wow.

129
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,988
Is this JJ, the top star?

130
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,028
He wants us to find a perfect condo for him.

131
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,022
Do you think you can do it?

132
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,020
Absolutely.

133
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,750
I won’t tell anyone about it.

134
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,140
I’m counting on you, Hengn…

135
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Thank you.

136
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,428
Ney.

137
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,291
Ney, ney, ney, Hengney.

138
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,588
Why do I keep calling him Hengney?

139
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,994
Am I being too affable?

140
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,770
No.

141
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,910
I need to be strict,

142
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
tough,

143
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:22,914
and rigid.

144
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,702
Hello, Mr. Heng.

145
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,577
I’m JJ.

146
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,588
I have a sales appointment with you.

147
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,170
Isn’t that supposed to be my lines?

148
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:53,765
Huh?

149
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:54,794
That’s my lines.

150
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Oh.

151
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,148
I’m Heng.

152
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:00,874
I’m sorry, Mr. JJ.

153
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,017
I’m too nervous. I’m sorry.

154
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,320
Are you sure no one follows you?

155
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,565
Of course. I checked it.

156
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,005
I’m not wearing a camera or a wire.

157
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,594
If you don’t believe me,

158
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,011
I can take my clothes off.

159
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,588
It’s okay.

160
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,930
I think we should go see the apartment.

161
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:25,942
Good.

162
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,325
This way.

163
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:31,228
Not this way.

164
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,245
It’s that way.

165
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,930
Yes.

166
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,377
This way, Mr. JJ.

167
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,988
The first room is a penthouse.

168
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,680
It’s 198 square meters.

169
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,182
Please turn right here.

170
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,874
Watch out, Miss Rose.

171
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:51,102
Watch out, Mr. JJ.

172
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,530
Hey!

173
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,714
Mo.

174
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Heng.

175
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,634
What are you doing here?

176
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,862
Mo.

177
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:15,302
Huh?

178
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:19,382
Our boss assigned us to take care of celebrity clients.

179
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,302
Why did he assign Miss Rose to you?

180
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,965
Why? You want to switch to take care of her?

181
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,177
No. I’m just curious.

182
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,982
It’s such a coincidence that they will live in the same building.

183
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,611
There’s no such a thing as coincidence.

184
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,451
What do you mean?

185
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,411
I think they are dating.

186
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Huh?

187
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,371
Keep your voice down.

188
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,651
No way. Your guess is wrong.

189
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,622
Mr. JJ plays the protagonist.

190
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,620
Miss Rose plays the antagonist.

191
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:06,977
There’s a rumor that he’s seeing Baifon, his female lead.

192
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Yes, they are dating.

193
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,994
This is why we need to keep it a secret.

194
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,714
If this is leaked to the media,

195
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:21,914
our clients will have a problem.

196
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:23,737
You two will be in trouble too.

197
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:24,971
Do you get it?

198
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:26,102
Yes.

199
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
What is this?

200
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,525
You share your client's information with your coworker.

201
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:33,822
How can you do that?

202
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,771
Do five squats.

203
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:36,817
Yes.

204
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Do it now!

205
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,525
One.

206
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,582
Two.

207
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,622
Louder. Be more active.

208
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:47,645
Three.

209
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:48,674
Four.

210
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:49,777
Five.

211
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,051
Why are you still here?

212
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,251
Go back to work.

213
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Yes.

214
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,611
My notebook.

215
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,165
Yeah!

216
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,411
Yeah, yeah, yes!

217
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,988
I am tough and fierce.

218
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,645
I’m back, Heng…

219
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,577
…ney.

220
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,982
No, no, no. Let’s do it again.

221
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,148
Did you two do something to upset our boss?

222
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,057
He has become grumpy lately.

223
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,050
He keeps ordering me to do push-ups.

224
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,891
Really?

225
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,320
We are curious about it too.

226
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,990
Right?

227
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,571
Right.

228
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,577
I got four amusement park tickets from a client.

229
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:57,090
He is an ambassador for the park.

230
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,045
Is your new client a celebrity?

231
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:00,714
Yes.

232
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:02,365
What!? No.

233
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,788
No.

234
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:08,325
We’re looking for a place near the amusement park for him.

235
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:12,222
So we looked around the area and got the tickets.

236
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,220
Just drop it.

237
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,540
Meow told me everything.

238
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:18,982
Really?

239
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,891
Newyear, since you already knew the truth, you need to keep it under wraps.

240
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,890
I’ll give you all four tickets.

241
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,137
You can invite girls to go with you.

242
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,130
Please.

243
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,611
Can you invite the girl for me?

244
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,420
How would I know who you want to invite?

245
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,508
It’s Chicha.

246
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,605
I told you I have a crush on her.

247
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,645
I told you to run away from her.

248
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,971
I can’t run away from my heart.

249
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,085
I’m begging you.

250
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:54,502
If you help me, I’ll buy you a bowl of edamame.

251
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,800
Newyear, Bro.

252
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,885
Is that all I’m only worth?

253
00:15:58,908 --> 00:15:59,977
Can I get two bowls?

254
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,605
Here are your drinks.

255
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,245
Thanks.

256
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,154
Wait.

257
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,150
I want to order more food.

258
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,394
Sure.

259
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:15,994
What do you want to order?

260
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,782
Larb Salmon.

261
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,320
Larb Salmon.

262
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:21,302
Somtam with soba noodles.

263
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,640
Somtam with soba noodles.

264
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:25,737
And can you go to an amusement park with Newyear?

265
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:26,360
Huh?

266
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,737
Heng!

267
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:29,588
Umm…

268
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,034
Amusement park?

269
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:33,285
Yes, amusement park.

270
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,411
I haven’t visited it for a while.

271
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,428
Will you go too?

272
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:38,811
I’ll ask Mo first.

273
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,954
Ouch!

274
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,925
(If we go, they will find out that we’re dating.)

275
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,337
Ouch!

276
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:48,428
(You have to go. If you don’t go, there’s no way Chicha will go with me.)

277
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,650
Ouch!

278
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:52,040
You can’t go.

279
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,982
You have to go.

280
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:56,834
You have to go.

281
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:57,668
You can’t go.

282
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:57,994
You have to go.

283
00:16:58,022 --> 00:16:59,022
You can’t go.

284
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,274
That’s enough.

285
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:01,765
We all go together.

286
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:03,251
My feet were almost broken.

287
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,250
Four of us?

288
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:10,131
We have four tickets.

289
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,982
Why did you tell them that we’re going?

290
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,240
Come on, Mo. It’s not a big deal.

291
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,674
We are a couple now.

292
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,268
It’s normal to go on a date, right?

293
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,788
I know that.

294
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,177
But I told you

295
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,697
I don’t want anyone to know about us.

296
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,057
It’s okay.

297
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:41,314
We usually hang out together.

298
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:45,708
We just need to act normal when we are together.

299
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,691
That’s all.

300
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:47,994
No one will find out.

301
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Fine.

302
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,982
How can this be a date?

303
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,980
I have a plan.

304
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,982
Newyear will want to be alone with Chicha.

305
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,120
We just have to act normal

306
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:09,485
and find a chance to slip out to enjoy our date.

307
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:11,091
Come on, my darling.

308
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,777
Please come with me.

309
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,650
Come on.

310
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,268
Please, please, please.

311
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,165
Wait.

312
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,200
I have one condition.

313
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,977
If you’re going on a date with me,

314
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,628
you can’t wear that T-shirt.

315
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,400
I don’t want to wear it.

316
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,680
It’s not my style.

317
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,365
I’m begging you. I really don’t want to wear it.

318
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,257
Mo.

319
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,577
But I just bought another one from an auction to celebrate first our date.

320
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,194
You know, couple T-shirts.

321
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,988
We will look cute.

322
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,594
Can’t you do what I asked?

323
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,590
Can’t you do what I asked?

324
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,485
Why are you here alone?

325
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,480
Where is Heng? He’s not here yet?

326
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,451
You usually look pretty.

327
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:17,994
But you look even prettier today.

328
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,971
I kind of know that.

329
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,430
I’m kidding.

330
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,302
Look at them.

331
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:29,822
You look so dressed up that I thought you came out of a runway.

332
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:32,800
But…

333
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,660
The colors of your outfits are matching.

334
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,290
Did you pick the colors together?

335
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,794
No.

336
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,560
We…

337
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,142
We saw the chart about the lucky colors of the day.

338
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,622
It said if we wear these colors,

339
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,114
we can enjoy the rides better.

340
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,451
Who made the chart?

341
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:50,485
It’s so detailed.

342
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,017
Forget it. It’s nothing.

343
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:55,977
Let’s go in.

344
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,165
The park is open.

345
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,546
Let’s go otherwise the queue line will be long.

346
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,011
Come on.

347
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,102
Let’s go.

348
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:01,548
Okay.

349
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:02,737
Come on.

350
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,411
Let’s go.

351
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,470
Wow.

352
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,257
I really miss it.

353
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,862
It was the first thrill ride I went on.

354
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,857
Me too.

355
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:20,880
I remember that I went on the ride with Heng.

356
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:24,531
He was so scared that he peed his pants.

357
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,177
I didn’t pee on my pants.

358
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,662
It was just a leakage.

359
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,451
I was just a second grader.

360
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,588
Now, I can ride on it all day.

361
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,360
Are you sure?

362
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:35,988
Yes.

363
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,017
I don’t believe you.

364
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:41,091
I have never gone on thrill rides before.

365
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:41,988
I don’t like them.

366
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:43,262
Can I stay here?

367
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,622
No, no, no.

368
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,697
Come on, Mo. Let’s go on the ride together.

369
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:47,840
Please, please, please.

370
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:48,702
Let’s do it together.

371
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:49,040
That’s right.

372
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:49,388
Please.

373
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:50,194
Come on.

374
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:50,908
Are you sure it’s a good idea?

375
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,165
Yes.

376
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:52,137
Let’s get in the line.

377
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,451
Come on.

378
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,228
Even second graders can ride it.

379
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,251
Come on.

380
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:30,868
It’s amazing.

381
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:31,891
Yes, it is.

382
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,490
This is fun.

383
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:34,617
Let me get out.

384
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:38,685
It’s over.

385
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,977
I can’t do it anymore.

386
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you okay?

387
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:51,674
It was so much fun.

388
00:21:51,714 --> 00:21:52,805
I never did it before.

389
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,365
When it went up to the peak, it was so thrilling.

390
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:57,582
It was so thrilling that…

391
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:59,405
I was afraid I would pee on my pants again.

392
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,434
The memory of when I was a second grader is still vivid.

393
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,102
I don’t want to do it again. I can’t do it.

394
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,645
I don’t want to do it, Chicha.

395
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,062
Really?

396
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,982
Do you mind if I want to go on the ride again?

397
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,177
Good idea.

398
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:14,337
Someone was screaming so loudly the last time.

399
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:15,714
I couldn’t focus at all.

400
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,091
Do as you want.

401
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,090
I watched a football game and went to bed late last night.

402
00:22:21,114 --> 00:22:22,868
I’m feeling a bit dizzy after getting off the ride.

403
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,776
I’ll find a place to sit down while waiting for you.

404
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Ouch!

405
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,857
I suddenly feel dizzy.

406
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:30,850
I watched the same football game as her.

407
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,850
I’ll sit with Chicha and wait for you.

408
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:34,462
Fine.

409
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:36,805
There are only us left.

410
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,971
We should just skip it.

411
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:39,737
It’s too bad.

412
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:40,800
It’s okay.

413
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,491
You two can go enjoy it.

414
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,411
Chicha and I will find a less thrilling ride to enjoy.

415
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,308
You can go on the ride.

416
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:53,708
Shouldn’t you ask me first?

417
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,700
Why? Are you afraid?

418
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:56,874
Of course.

419
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,257
I’m afraid that I won’t get to ride it again.

420
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,262
Really?

421
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,320
It’s settled then.

422
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,320
We’ll meet you at the water park at 2 pm.

423
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,750
Sure.

424
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,085
Heng, let’s go on the ride one more time.

425
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,125
This time, let’s take the back-roll seats, okay?

426
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:14,965
This way, Chicha.

427
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:15,988
Come on. Let’s go.

428
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
What’s wrong?

429
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:18,422
Do you want to take a leak?

430
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:19,633
Do you want to go to the toilet first?

431
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:20,840
Where are you going?

432
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:21,874
Come here.

433
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,760
Where are you going?

434
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:23,788
Come here.

435
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:30,880
Wow.

436
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,542
It’s kind of fun to chill on a ride like this.

437
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,977
But I’m getting sleepy.

438
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,205
Look. It’s a dinosaur attack.

439
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,262
Roaaar!

440
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,342
After seeing the dinosaur models,

441
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,542
it reminds me of…

442
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,645
Jurassic Park.

443
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:03,668
Right?

444
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,097
Have you seen the movie?

445
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,902
Yes.

446
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,154
Why?

447
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
It’s an old movie.

448
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,405
Now, everyone only watches the newer films in the series.

449
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,600
This is the first time I met someone who likes the movie too.

450
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,977
No, I don’t like it.

451
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:28,840
Heng does.

452
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,468
After he watched it, he kept talking about it.

453
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,994
Oh, look at the dinosaur.

454
00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:44,794
It looks so funny like Heng.

455
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,382
I’ll take a picture and show it to him.

456
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,548
It looks exactly like him.

457
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:52,582
Look.

458
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,420
This one also looks like him.

459
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,331
It looks so dumb.

460
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
It looks like him, right?

461
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,468
Thanks.

462
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,200
I threw your T-shirt away.

463
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:25,662
It has puke all over it.

464
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,102
I’m sorry.

465
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:37,085
You helped dress me up.

466
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,080
I should be the one apologizing to you.

467
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:44,222
Next time, if you can’t do it,

468
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,308
you need to tell me.

469
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,022
Mo, how could I tell you?

470
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,902
You looked so happy.

471
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,382
How can I be happy if you are like this?

472
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,800
If we are going to be together,

473
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,988
our happiness can’t be felt only by you or me.

474
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:06,525
We both need to feel happy.

475
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,314
I’m so happy after hearing it.

476
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,497
How about this? If you feel better,

477
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,531
shall we find non-thrill rides to enjoy?

478
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,794
Can I enjoy you?

479
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,965
Because you are so cute.

480
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Am I cute?

481
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,714
I can be scary too.

482
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:52,537
Do you want to see it?

483
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,530
No, Mo.

484
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:55,960
It’s better when you are cute.

485
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,491
Stop it. I like it better when you’re cute, Mo.

486
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,160
Why are you running away?

487
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,720
Heng, wait up.

488
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I got it.

489
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,628
Do you have Instagram?

490
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,810
I’ll tag you in the photos.

491
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,851
You did this a lot?

492
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:23,885
Yes.

493
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,474
I always take photos for my mom.

494
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,468
I’m talking about you asking for a girl’s Instagram.

495
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,571
Did you do it a lot?

496
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,645
I’m kidding.

497
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:36,674
You can have it.

498
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:38,660
I barely use it anyway.

499
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,982
I like this photo.

500
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,634
Is it the photo that I took?

501
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
No.

502
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,245
It’s the photo that Heng sent me.

503
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:19,702
Look.

504
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,268
He threw up on himself.

505
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,651
So he needed to get change.

506
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,005
It’s so funny.

507
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,411
He’s so dumb.

508
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
It’s funny.

509
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,348
I arranged this trip to get closer to you.

510
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,988
But I just realized that you have a crush on Heng.

511
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
Wait.

512
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,611
No, I don’t

513
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,645
Don’t you notice it?

514
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,994
You keep talking about him all day.

515
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,851
I think I’d better leave.

516
00:29:22,902 --> 00:29:24,900
Please tell Heng that I have something come up.

517
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,805
Newyear.

518
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,777
I…

519
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Chicha.

520
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,520
In my opinion,

521
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,222
Heng is slow-witted.

522
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,514
If you don’t tell him how you feel,

523
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,308
he will never know it.

524
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:22,108
Oh.

525
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,930
Wait.

526
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:26,810
Is your shirt also get dirty?

527
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,977
I’m not clumsy like you.

528
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,914
I heard someone said…

529
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,817
he wanted to wear couple T-shirts.

530
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,708
Whose boyfriend is this?

531
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,451
Why are you so sweet?

532
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,280
I’ll let you take a selfie.

533
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,325
But you can’t post it.

534
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,217
I know that.

535
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:57,491
I won’t post it.

536
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:00,320
I keep it to look at later.

537
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,914
Let’s take a photo together.

538
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,291
She looks like Chicha.

539
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,388
I’m sorry for acting like this.

540
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:38,382
It’s okay.

541
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:40,310
You don’t need to apologize.

542
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,977
I thought that she was Chicha too.

543
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:50,788
I…

544
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,525
I mean I’m sorry for everything.

545
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,840
Can I ask you something?

546
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,594
Since we started dating,

547
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:10,822
did I make your life harder?

548
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:22,462
It’s Meow.

549
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,594
Hello, Meow.

550
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Huh?!

551
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,605
Really?

552
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,268
Sure.

553
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,668
I’ll be right there.

554
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,010
Yes. Thank you.

555
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,310
Bye.

556
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:36,880
What happened?

557
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:40,977
Miss Rose has a problem with the condo.

558
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,450
I…

559
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,988
I have to leave now.

560
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,280
Should I go with you?

561
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:52,394
No, no.

562
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:53,519
It’s okay.

563
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,010
You can go to the water park with them.

564
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:57,160
Don’t miss the chance.

565
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:00,942
See you at home.

566
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
I’m sorry.

567
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
It’s okay.

568
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,605
You don’t have to apologize.

569
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:22,810
You should go and do your work.

570
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:24,154
I’ll go home.

571
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,131
I got to go.

572
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,570
Hey.

573
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
Where is Mo?

574
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,337
Something came up.

575
00:33:57,354 --> 00:33:58,554
He already left.

576
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:02,102
Where is Newyear?

577
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,994
He also had something come up.

578
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,285
They both have left.

579
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,314
What are we waiting for?

580
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:14,348
Shall we go home?

581
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:15,497
Wait.

582
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,560
Since we are here,

583
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,228
can we stroll around first?

584
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,662
This reminds me of when we went to the beach together.

585
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,731
When I spent over an hour building a sand castle,

586
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:42,350
but you kicked a ball to destroy it?

587
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,257
You got it wrong.

588
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:46,468
I didn’t do it.

589
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,302
I swear I didn’t do it.

590
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,977
Ouch.

591
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,034
I’m sorry.

592
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,051
I’m sorry.

593
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,520
It’s okay. Go get your ball.

594
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,930
See?

595
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,880
Karma works fast this time.

596
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:04,577
Chi.

597
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Heng.

598
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,165
Let’s go there and build a sand castle.

599
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Sure.

600
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,240
This reminds me of when we were young and built a sand castle together.

601
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Yes.

602
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,611
(In my opinion, Heng is slow-witted.)

603
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,970
(If you don’t tell him how you feel, )

604
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,685
(he will never know it.)

605
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,770
Hey.

606
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,845
You go first.

607
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,965
It’s okay. You go first.

608
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,690
I…

609
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,870
I have something important to tell you.

610
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,542
I have kept this secret for some time.

611
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,570
Now,

612
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,954
I think…

613
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,611
it’s time to tell you.

614
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,280
I…

615
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,302
I’m dating Mo.

616
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,594
Since when?

617
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:40,988
Since last week.

618
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,360
No one knows it.

619
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,982
You are the first one I told.

620
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,211
Actually, Mo wants to keep it a secret.

621
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,914
But he said if I wanted to tell you,

622
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
he was okay with it.

623
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,691
What were you going to tell me?

624
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:24,411
Umm…

625
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
I…

626
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Umm…

627
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,491
I…

628
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,990
I...

629
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,548
I’m hungry.

630
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:38,617
I’m hungry.

631
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:49,657
Then I’ll…

632
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,230
Hello.

633
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Huh?!

634
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Sure.

635
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,988
Is it urgent?

636
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,897
Sure.

637
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:07,971
I’ll be right there.

638
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,610
Chi.

639
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:15,110
I was going to have dinner with you.

640
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,611
But something came up.

641
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,548
I can’t go with you anymore.

642
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,662
It’s okay. You should go.

643
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,994
I want to play with sand for a while.

644
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:35,017
It’s fun.

645
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:51,862
I got to go to work.

646
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,570
Heng.

647
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
Huh?

648
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,217
Good luck.

649
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Bestie.

650
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,400
Good luck to you too.

651
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,720
Do you think it’s easy to find a condo these days?

652
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,118
If you like this place, why don’t you buy it?

653
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:24,868
We visited many places before we found this place.

654
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,234
Can you be reasonable here?

655
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:27,451
I am being reasonable.

656
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:28,262
Reasonable?

657
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,702
You suddenly changed your mind.

658
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,182
I saw it.

659
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,142
I saw someone follow us here.

660
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,028
Who? I don’t see anyone.

661
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:36,057
Do we need to care what they think?

662
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,737
Yes.

663
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,422
Please calm down.

664
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:38,485
They are just strangers.

665
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,040
I saw him. Why can’t you believe me?

666
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,257
Please calm down.

667
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,800
What happened?

668
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,068
Since it has come to this point, we should just tell them.

669
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:48,091
You can’t.

670
00:41:48,194 --> 00:41:49,194
Why?

671
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:50,970
We are dating.

672
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,982
To be honest,

673
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,531
we kind of already knew.

674
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,777
I think someone follows me here.

675
00:42:11,788 --> 00:42:13,497
Can I cancel the contract?

676
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,982
Miss Rose,

677
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:20,862
the bank already approved your mortgage.

678
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,350
Yes.

679
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,988
One more thing,

680
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:29,160
it’s not easy to find a room in a location this good.

681
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,691
That’s right.

682
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,445
See?

683
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,502
If you are so worried about people finding out,

684
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:37,337
why not go public with our relationship?

685
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:39,114
Do you want to see me being blasted by the whole country?

686
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:39,840
So what?

687
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:40,987
It’s not like we are having an affair.

688
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:44,314
Who would want to see a male lead dating a villainess?

689
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,285
You’ve been waiting for so long to play a male lead.

690
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:52,285
Do you want to see it go down the drain?

691
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,822
I play a male lead, so what?

692
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,182
But we have to hide our relationship.

693
00:42:58,211 --> 00:42:59,594
Are you really okay with it?

694
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,171
Why do you look at it that way?

695
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,582
When will you be mature?

696
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:06,000
If that’s what you think, we should break up.

697
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:06,782
Fine, let’s break up.

698
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:07,217
Fine.

699
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:08,125
I know you’ve been wanting to break up.

700
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:08,954
Yes, I want to break up.

701
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:09,845
You are so childish.

702
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:10,788
You’re childish.

703
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:11,634
You’re childish.

704
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,982
I told them to keep this a secret.

705
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,980
Why do they let these two argue in public?

706
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,862
Let’s break up.

707
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:17,605
Fine, let’s do it.

708
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:18,091
Fine.

709
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:18,422
Fine.

710
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,291
Actually, we are dating too.

711
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,320
I didn’t know that you two are dating.

712
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,622
Although our relationship

713
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,320
is not high profile like yours,

714
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,914
I understand how you feel.

715
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,794
Part of me is worried that other people will find out.

716
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,908
At the same time,

717
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,982
I also feel distressed

718
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,302
because I can tell no one about it.

719
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,262
I know how tormented you feel.

720
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,200
Caring about what other people think,

721
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,491
it’s not a bad thing.

722
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,708
But when it comes to relationships,

723
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,302
you should care about your partner’s feelings.

724
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,217
I agree with him.

725
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,457
Someone told me if you decide to be in a relationship.

726
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,280
It’s no longer about how you or your partner feels.

727
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,890
It’s about how both of you feel.

728
00:45:00,971 --> 00:45:01,994
Mr. JJ.

729
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Miss Rose.

730
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:05,051
Don’t worry.

731
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,280
We will find a home for you.

732
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,685
We want to see you both happy.

733
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,977
You can trust us.

734
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,530
I’m sorry.

735
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:20,611
I’m sorry too.

736
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:23,970
Sorry for raising my voice.

737
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,700
Please stop being mad at me.

738
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,250
No.

739
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,450
No.

740
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,645
Why don’t they take these two inside?

741
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:41,982
I’ll take photos to use as evidence.

742
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:44,834
I’ll give them a long lecture tomorrow.

743
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:56,005
What?

744
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,982
What am I doing?

745
00:46:00,565 --> 00:46:02,697
Why do I have to be so cruel to Hengney?

746
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,262
Is that the stalker? Go hide.

747
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,022
Hey!

748
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:15,377
Hey, stop right there!

749
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:18,262
Hey!

750
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Stop right there.

751
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Stop.

752
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:29,165
Help.

753
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,920
Stop right there.

754
00:46:32,577 --> 00:46:33,628
Stop.

755
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:37,982
Stop right there.

756
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,790
Hey!

757
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,200
You!

758
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,262
There’s really a stalker.

759
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,260
Boss.

760
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,308
What are you doing here?

761
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:08,434
I…

762
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:11,160
I came to help you catch the stalker.

763
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,880
Didn’t I tell you to keep it a secret?

764
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:17,640
Boss.

765
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,434
Why are you so nice to us?

766
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,365
Thank you so much, Boss.

767
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:26,085
If you didn’t help us, we would have been in big trouble.

768
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,800
(Now, I remember.)

769
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,611
(The old me is not a strict boss.)

770
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,388
(But I was a boss who would protect my team members.)

771
00:47:35,405 --> 00:47:36,948
(I remember it.)

772
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,308
Boss.

773
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,622
Boss.

774
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:40,737
Boss.

775
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,142
Huh?

776
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:43,428
Are you okay?

777
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,420
Yes.

778
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,171
No need to thank me.

779
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,965
It’s my job to protect you, Hengn…

780
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,640
It’s good that we catch him.

781
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,748
Thank you, Boss.

782
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:07,771
Thank you.

783
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,222
Stay still.

784
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Here.

785
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:19,708
Thanks.

786
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,850
Cheers.

787
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,182
Hey.

788
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,445
What did Miss Rose say about this?

789
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,000
I called and told her that we caught the stalker.

790
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,474
About the apartment,

791
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,794
she said she needed some time to think.

792
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,188
So many things happened today.

793
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,565
True.

794
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:15,771
Heng.

795
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:16,908
Yes.

796
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:24,702
I’m sorry for announcing our relationship without consulting with you.

797
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,977
I’m okay about that.

798
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:30,370
It’s not a big deal.

799
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,365
You said like there’s something else bothering you.

800
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,000
You told me…

801
00:49:48,628 --> 00:49:50,620
dating me is stressful.

802
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:53,268
Mo.

803
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,777
Why didn’t you tell me?

804
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,720
I didn’t want you to feel bad.

805
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:07,211
If you are not happy, how can I be happy?

806
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,914
You told me that.

807
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:11,417
You should practice what you preach.

808
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,890
Heng.

809
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Yes.

810
00:50:24,862 --> 00:50:26,860
Are you okay with dating me?

811
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,297
Be honest.

812
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,582
Is it really okay to date me?

813
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,434
I should be the one to ask you.

814
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:03,582
If you don’t want to tell anyone about us,

815
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,611
it’s okay.

816
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,977
Being your boyfriend is not something

817
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,977
I would be embarrassed about.

818
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:23,422
Oh, dreams, in dreams, my heart feels so free

819
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:28,428
Each time I dream, things are the way I wish them to be

820
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:34,880
No more hiding this love I’ve locked deep within

821
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:39,868
In dreams, I can tell you everything

822
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:46,211
False awakening, I wish dreams come true

823
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:51,251
Where everything I imagine repeats anew

824
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,668
Not just a memory fading in time

825
00:51:57,685 --> 00:52:05,685
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

826
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,748
Heng. Mo.

827
00:52:30,782 --> 00:52:31,982
We have a big problem.

828
00:52:32,005 --> 00:52:33,605
You need to go to the meeting room ASAP.

829
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,190
Did the client’s secret leak out?

830
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:36,777
No.

831
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:40,977
It’s about you did a great job in keeping our clients’ secret.

832
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:56,417
I’d like to invite Mr. Haruta from the head office in Japan to give the opening speech.

833
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,217
Sawasdee krub.

834
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,417
I’m Haruta Soichi.

835
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:06,822
I would like to thank Mr. Heng and Mr. Mo for your excellent job.

836
00:53:06,862 --> 00:53:09,348
You drastically help improve our company’s image.

837
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,845
You also inspired other employees.

838
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,560
As a representative of your colleagues in Japan, I want to sincerely thank you.

839
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,537
Thank you very much.

840
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:20,622
To express our appreciation,

841
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,742
We have sent a souvenir to you.

842
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,588
Please take it.

843
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,628
Why don’t you say something to everyone here?

844
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,097
Okay.

845
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:45,440
First of all, I want to thank everyone for giving us this precious award.

846
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:49,451
I want to give all the credit to our boss.

847
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,074
Because he has been supporting us all this time.

848
00:53:53,102 --> 00:53:56,977
I want everyone to give him a round of applause.

849
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,260
I want to…

850
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,857
Hold on.

851
00:54:08,868 --> 00:54:12,371
We have slightly bigger news.

852
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,531
Mr. JJ and Miss Rose are holding a press conference.

853
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:17,940
Newyear, put it on the screen.

854
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,240
We don’t want to keep it a secret anymore.

855
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,462
Rose and I are dating.

856
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,080
We are sorry if any of you feel disappointed.

857
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:32,651
We want you to love us for who we are.

858
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,222
We decided to tell everyone the truth

859
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,760
because someone told us that relationships…

860
00:54:37,788 --> 00:54:38,691
Hey!

861
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,994
Give me the remote control.

862
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,742
I think we should get back to our ceremony.

863
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:48,740
We shouldn’t keep the head office waiting.

864
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,240
Besides the press conference has nothing to do with us.

865
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:53,154
That’s true.

866
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,125
Heng.

867
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,430
Please proceed.

868
00:54:57,851 --> 00:54:58,851
Okay.

869
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
I…

870
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:05,125
Are you okay with dating me?

871
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,714
If you are so worried about people finding out,

872
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,628
why not go public with our relationship?

873
00:55:09,645 --> 00:55:11,817
Rose and I are dating.

874
00:55:12,154 --> 00:55:15,988
Being your boyfriend is not something I would be embarrassed about.

875
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,857
Thank you, everyone.

876
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:26,697
I want you to love us for who we are.

877
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,177
Mo and I,

878
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,171
we are dating.

879
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:33,514
Huh?

880
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,685
Woohoo!

881
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,314
He is my boyfriend.

882
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,805
Amazing!

883
00:55:52,114 --> 00:55:53,342
No.

884
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,490
This is not true.

885
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:56,731
No.

886
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,102
It’s not true, right, Hengney?

887
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,580
It’s true, Boss.

888
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:18,571
The house that Heng’s client wants is rumored to be haunted.

889
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,171
Wear this when you go to bed.

890
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,074
Don’t forget to tell Boss that it’s my T-shirt.

891
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,308
Dad, don’t be scared.

892
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,850
This is your chance to score points with him.

893
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:29,137
It’s time for checkmate.

894
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:30,022
I’m so sleepy.

895
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,142
Come on, Hengney.

896
00:56:31,177 --> 00:56:32,177
Let’s go to bed.

897
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,777
Can I go in?

898
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,268
Why did you come here?

899
00:56:36,577 --> 00:56:38,260
Because I’m worried about you.

900
00:56:38,285 --> 00:56:39,937
Heng is different from us.

901
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,542
Can he introduce you to his family like I did?

902
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,234
I can’t sleep without a bolster.

903
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:47,731
If you want to sleep on my bed,

904
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,000
then come on.
