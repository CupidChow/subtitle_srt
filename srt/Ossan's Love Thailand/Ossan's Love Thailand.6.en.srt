1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:01,697
It’s my fault. I am the reason

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:03,564
you are fighting with your daughter.

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,383
If there’s anything I can do to help you,

4
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:07,466
please let me know.

5
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:09,484
Can you come to have lunch at my house this Saturday?

6
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:10,508
Sure.

7
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:13,951
I’m really sorry.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,801
I only see you as someone I respect.

9
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,977
Heng rejects me.

10
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:25,299
You reject a perfect guy like him.

11
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,685
What kind of person are you looking for?

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,136
I want someone I feel comfortable being with.

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,625
On the night we had beers together,

14
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,201
the moon was beautiful like tonight.

15
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:39,534
But I think tonight,

16
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:41,789
it’s more beautiful.

17
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:55,402
Our boss has never been late for a meeting.

18
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:56,459
Does something happen to him?

19
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,100
Right? He didn’t answer any of my calls.

20
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:02,650
Mo, what should we do?

21
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:06,974
He must have been in shock after I rejected him.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,275
Mo, please help me.

23
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,472
He has to close the deal with Elon today.

24
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,328
I don’t know how he’s doing.

25
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:15,697
Maybe the deal has collapsed.

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,251
He resigned from the company.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,651
Then we won’t get the year-end bonus.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,700
Right.

29
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:25,466
What should we do, Mo?

30
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:27,048
Help me, Mo.

31
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:28,500
That’s right. What should we do?

32
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,059
Huh?!

33
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:34,896
When did you get here?

34
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:36,037
A while ago.

35
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:37,659
I saw you were busy talking to each other.

36
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:38,914
I didn’t want to interrupt you.

37
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:41,817
About the deal.

38
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:45,099
We reached a conclusion.

39
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,045
Elon.

40
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,202
He agrees to sign a contract with us.

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,442
This means we all will get the year-end bonus.

42
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,400
The reason that I was late today,

43
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,302
I got a call from the head office in Japan.

44
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:16,275
They want me to go there for a one-week training.

45
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:21,488
I need to ask you guys to take care of our team.

46
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:22,512
Sure, boss.

47
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:25,663
We will take good care of our team.

48
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:42,666
What a relief.

49
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,248
I guess he probably moved on from me.

50
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:47,641
We should celebrate it.

51
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:54,208
I made a stuffed omelet for you.

52
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,190
Didn’t you say you were sick of the lunch spots around the office?

53
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,296
Mo.

54
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:05,697
Really?

55
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,622
Mo, I guess today is my lucky day.

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,758
The dark clouds in my life are vanishing.

57
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,317
I’ll eat it now.

58
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:17,494
Mo.

59
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,777
Where is the client list I requested?

60
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:24,574
Sorry. I already printed it out.

61
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:25,697
I’ll get it for you.

62
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:29,137
Did Mo make it for you?

63
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:33,468
Yes.

64
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,022
Did he move back to live with you?

65
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:38,202
Yes.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,903
Ten, why are you asking about it?

67
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,702
Wait, the number here is wrong.

68
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:51,217
Yes, I’ll check it, Ten.

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,867
The measurement units should be square feet.

70
00:03:57,891 --> 00:04:00,014
The headings font sizes should be 16 points.

71
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
Oh!

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Too close.

73
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,700
I got it.

74
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,238
Ten, can you move your hand out…

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Don’t resist me.

76
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,275
I’m not.

77
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:14,891
It’s too close.

78
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,629
Ten.

79
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,425
(I’m not sure if I’m overthinking.)

80
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,900
(But I feel that)

81
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,202
(the dark clouds are building up again.)

82
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,345
I’m sorry.

83
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,078
I’ll get it for you.

84
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
Here.

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Did you see it?

86
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,302
No.

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Did you see it?

88
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,130
I didn’t see anything.

89
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,134
You really saw it.

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,435
(Does Ten have feelings for me?)

91
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,303
(Why is this happening to me again?)

92
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,595
Ten has feelings for you?

93
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:44,746
You are imagining things.

94
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:46,648
I’m serious.

95
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,685
I saw my photo on his screen lock.

96
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,920
It’s like a déjà vu of our boss’s incident.

97
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,656
You probably look funny in the photo.

98
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,990
My selling point is my good looks, not my sense of humor.

99
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,005
If you don’t believe me, fine.

100
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:00,337
Believe whatever you want.

101
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:05,594
What’s wrong with him?

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,117
Don’t overthink it.

103
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,543
How about this?

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,600
Let’s drink a cold refreshing beer,

105
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,312
your favorite drink.

106
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:18,832
It’s on me.

107
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,084
Did you win a lottery?

108
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:23,853
It’s better than winning a lottery.

109
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,331
Someone is interested in buying this bar.

110
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,874
He wants to build a mall here.

111
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,357
Are you going to close this bar?

112
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:34,917
No, he said when the mall is completed,

113
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,869
he will give us the best spot in the mall

114
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,628
to open a bar for free for 20 years.

115
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:44,318
While waiting for the mall construction to complete,

116
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:45,780
I’ll miss this bar.

117
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,656
If you’re going to miss it, then take your colleagues

118
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,096
to the bar this Friday to celebrate the bar’s closure.

119
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,197
Celebrate the bar’s closure.

120
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,801
It’s quite ironic.

121
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,964
I should note it down.

122
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:23,013
Just say what you want.

123
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:24,380
Can you help me?

124
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:25,051
On what?

125
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:26,315
This Friday,

126
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,903
when I take my colleagues here, can you…

127
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,367
You want me to be your fake girlfriend

128
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,245
to avoid Ten?

129
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,660
As expected, you’ve known me since we were toddlers.

130
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,702
If you don’t want to help me, it’s okay.

131
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,128
I just want you to help me find out

132
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,300
if he has feelings for me...

133
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,151
or if it’s all in my head.

134
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:48,983
No, I don’t want to do it.

135
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:50,484
Five beers.

136
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Five packs of beers.

137
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:56,971
Five packs of beers.

138
00:08:58,297 --> 00:08:59,102
Deal.

139
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,896
Great. I’ll arrange it for you.

140
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,145
It’s nice to work with you.

141
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:06,651
How much is it?

142
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:07,985
It must cost a fortune.

143
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,710
Father.

144
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,100
I know I need to get over him.

145
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,900
But no matter what I do, I can’t forget him.

146
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
When I’m with others, I pretend to be strong.

147
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,872
But the truth is…

148
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:23,400
my heart can’t take it anymore.

149
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,420
You can fool anyone.

150
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,552
But you cannot fool God.

151
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,050
You made the right decision

152
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,862
to seek refuge here.

153
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
In the next seven days,

154
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,979
You need to find your peace

155
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:38,702
and focus on yourself.

156
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,705
Don’t talk to anyone.

157
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:44,251
Then the Lord will talk to you.

158
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,367
Yay!

159
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:04,909
Next is the song I recently wrote

160
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:07,653
to celebrate the bar’s closure.

161
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:11,131
It’s called “I’m happy that my bar is closed down,

162
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,112
what should I do when I’ll be jobless for years?”

163
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,075
If you are ready, please enjoy the song.

164
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,414
Yay!

165
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:32,638
Let’s drink.

166
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,946
Cheers.

167
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:37,350
Cheers. Yay!

168
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,734
Hello, everyone.

169
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:54,700
This is my first album.

170
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:58,506
I’m giving it to you as a souvenir.

171
00:11:58,725 --> 00:11:59,834
Thank you.

172
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:06,746
Wait.

173
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:08,825
Your name is Thirakorn.

174
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,564
Why is the name on the album Dunk Sae-tang?

175
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,562
I just changed my name.

176
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
Why?

177
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,097
Did a fortuneteller tell you to change it?

178
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:15,722
No.

179
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:19,465
My dream is to become a famous singer.

180
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,979
Now, I have the same name as the famous singer.

181
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,401
The famous singer.

182
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,297
The song title is great.

183
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:34,402
“Can you call me darling instead?”

184
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,850
I’ll refill my glass. I’ll be right back.

185
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,539
It’s obvious.

186
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:52,964
There’s something going on here.

187
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,491
See? I’m not imagining it.

188
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,125
I’m talking about those two.

189
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,997
They definitely have feelings for each other.

190
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,309
There is my only vinyl album in the world.

191
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,982
I’m giving it to you, Meow.

192
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,051
Look, I got the biggest one.

193
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,718
I’ll put it in a frame and hang it on my wall.

194
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,010
I should listen to it.

195
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,781
Why are you focused on the second lead couple?

196
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:17,325
What about the main character like me?

197
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,368
I forgot about it.

198
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,306
Heng.

199
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:33,158
What?

200
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,750
I have something to confess to you.

201
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:37,958
What is it?

202
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:41,425
Did you make a mistake again?

203
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,398
Don’t think about resigning.

204
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,859
It’s not about work.

205
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,693
What is it?

206
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,477
I’m sorry

207
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:51,254
but I think I’m falling for your girlfriend.

208
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:01,897
Chicha?

209
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,069
I’m sorry.

210
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:07,540
Stop it.

211
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,109
I’m going to resign from the company.

212
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,242
Nonsense. Chicha is not my girlfriend.

213
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,140
We’ve been friends since we were young.

214
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,500
She’s not my type.

215
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:17,777
Really?

216
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,791
Yes.

217
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,318
What a relief.

218
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,920
I’ll get rid of my resignation letter.

219
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:24,994
Fine.

220
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,380
Damn, I spilled it.

221
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
Sorry.

222
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:51,386
(Shit.)

223
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,758
(I misunderstand the whole thing.)

224
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:57,102
(The person Ten feels jealous of, )

225
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:01,133
(The person he has feelings for is Mo)

226
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,608
(This is a big twist.)

227
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:28,902
(Why can’t I stop thinking about Ten and Mo?)

228
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,777
(What’s wrong with me?)

229
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,774
(Why do I feel shocked?)

230
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:38,106
(Mo’s dating life has nothing to do with me.)

231
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,070
(You seem to really enjoy talking to him.)

232
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,576
(How can you move on from me so quickly?)

233
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,256
(You just confessed your feelings for me.)

234
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
(Then why did you make the stuffed omelet for me?)

235
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,629
(Why didn’t you give it to your beloved boyfriend?)

236
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,090
(What is so great about him?)

237
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:54,986
(He just holds a higher position than me.)

238
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,225
(He has a higher salary and sales than me.)

239
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,487
(If I were you, I would choose him too.)

240
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:02,625
(Damn it.)

241
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:04,728
Heng.

242
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,134
Where are the coffees I ordered?

243
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:10,628
Here.

244
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,355
Excuse me. I got to go meet a client.

245
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,040
Here is your coffee.

246
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,590
Thank you.

247
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,540
Coffee from this shop tastes good.

248
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,438
This cup is empty.

249
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,840
I think there must be a ghost in our company.

250
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,899
It must be a guardian spirit.

251
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,100
Why would he want to drink coffee?

252
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:39,315
You should have told me you want coffee.

253
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:40,724
I would have bought one for you.

254
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,530
He might feel sleepy.

255
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:44,917
You think so?

256
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,591
He wouldn’t help me win the lottery this month

257
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,177
because I left him hungry.

258
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,093
Hello, Miss.

259
00:16:58,968 --> 00:16:59,968
Huh?!

260
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:02,257
Chicha!

261
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,259
What are you doing here?

262
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,121
My house is going to be turned into a mall.

263
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,539
I need to find a new place to live.

264
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,765
Do you have any apartments near a subway station available for rent?

265
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,648
I’ll look into it.

266
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:22,402
From your budget, I think I can find ten…

267
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:24,822
Ten apartments?

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,792
The apartments would be ten kilometers away from a subway station.

269
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:27,442
Okay.

270
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:28,149
Yay!

271
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,635
Who the hell would be okay with that?

272
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,644
I can’t walk that far.

273
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,700
I’m just a frail woman.

274
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:36,248
Heng, please help me find a place to live.

275
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:38,306
Thua-ngok ditched me

276
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,745
and went to live with his friend.

277
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,480
Please help me.

278
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,334
Please.

279
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:43,511
Why are you acting so clingy?

280
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,810
Why don’t you move in to live with us?

281
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,457
Heng’s house is spacious enough for the three of us.

282
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,450
(No.)

283
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,211
Thank you, Mo.

284
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:01,150
I can move in with you today.

285
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:07,334
Fortunately, I brought my luggage with me.

286
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:08,804
So…

287
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,114
I’m ready to move in with you.

288
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:13,374
Let’s go.

289
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:14,524
Ouch!

290
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,557
Can you get your feet out of my way?

291
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,251
Yes.

292
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Let’s go, Mo.

293
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:23,794
- Sure. - Hey!

294
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,063
Wait, you two.

295
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,740
This is my house.

296
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:32,365
Please help me.

297
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:35,705
I am weak.

298
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:39,675
In my head,

299
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,800
it’s full of memories about Hengney.

300
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,352
Look.

301
00:18:58,435 --> 00:18:59,801
When I open my eyes,

302
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,499
I still see his illusion in front of me.

303
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,979
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

304
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Who are you?

305
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:23,715
Don’t be scared.

306
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,416
I’m the evil side of you.

307
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,004
You miss Hengney, don’t you?

308
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,288
No.

309
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:38,885
Stop denying your feelings.

310
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:40,374
You should go see him.

311
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,438
Do what your heart wants.

312
00:19:58,106 --> 00:19:59,718
Lord, I’m sorry.

313
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,768
Please forgive me.

314
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:05,980
Please forgive me, Lord.

315
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:08,594
Don’t go, Kongdech.

316
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:09,954
Who is that?

317
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:12,348
Don’t give in to your desire.

318
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:16,240
I’m your angel side.

319
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,380
I know you can do it.

320
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,616
Don’t go back and get hurt again.

321
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,488
Don’t listen to him.

322
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:26,302
You should go now.

323
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:27,595
Don’t do it, Kongdech.

324
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:28,717
Stay strong.

325
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:29,991
Kongdech.

326
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:35,303
Good. Kongdech, good boy.

327
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:41,597
Kongdech, good boy.

328
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:44,970
Kongdech, good boy.

329
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,023
Kongdech, good boy.

330
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:48,127
Kongdech, good...

331
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,001
Kongdech, good...

332
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:49,773
Kongdech…

333
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:51,331
Kong…

334
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,705
What the hell is this?

335
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:03,223
They are all here.

336
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:20,814
It’s delicious.

337
00:21:21,422 --> 00:21:25,976
What does Heng do to deserve to eat delicious meals like this every day?

338
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,457
Mo.

339
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,897
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

340
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,013
Please, please, please.

341
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:32,077
No, you’re overstating.

342
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,256
You are crazy.

343
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,165
Mo is probably not available for you.

344
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,351
He’s popular lately.

345
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,275
What are you talking about?

346
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:44,845
No. Nothing.

347
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:45,973
Chi.

348
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,547
I prepared a pillow and a blanket for you on the couch.

349
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:49,980
You can go try them

350
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,235
and see if they are comfortable for sleeping.

351
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:53,505
Why don’t you try them?

352
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,872
Because I’m going to sleep in your room.

353
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,069
Yes, I’ll try it.

354
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:00,256
Huh?

355
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,887
No. I haven’t said that…

356
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:04,917
Hello.

357
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:06,426
Thua?

358
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,715
Heng is so kind. He let me sleep in his room.

359
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:11,669
Mo.

360
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:12,546
What?

361
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:13,925
You need to go talk to her.

362
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,941
You were the one who told her to move in with us.

363
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,411
I am sweaty and sticky

364
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:19,549
after cooking the meal for you.

365
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,822
I need to take a shower.

366
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:21,985
Mo.

367
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:23,111
Mo.

368
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Mo.

369
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,802
Don’t you think about offering me to sleep in your room?

370
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Then…

371
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:33,213
Finish your meal.

372
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,395
And…

373
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:36,197
follow me.

374
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:37,724
Really?

375
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,331
I’ll finish it right away.

376
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:40,561
I’ll be right after you.

377
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,733
Mo, wait for me.

378
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:42,416
Mo.

379
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:43,638
Mo, I’m almost done.

380
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:44,928
Almost.

381
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,525
How did I get to the point I’m sleeping on the floor in my own house?

382
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,600
Mo, this is your fault.

383
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,205
You told Chicha to move in with us.

384
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,477
I knew you would never let her sleep on the street.

385
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:07,173
I just said what you would have told her.

386
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:08,877
Is that so?

387
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:11,380
Isn’t it because you want to move out?

388
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:13,628
So you want to find a new housemate for me.

389
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Heng.

390
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,604
Why do you keep making weird comments lately?

391
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:25,197
Are you mad at me?

392
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,190
What do you think?

393
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:38,654
Did you do something that would upset me?

394
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,248
You knew?

395
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:51,607
Yes.

396
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:53,211
I knew everything.

397
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:01,475
Just tell me. I won’t be mad at you.

398
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:09,964
Fine.

399
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:12,167
I’ll tell you.

400
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,859
I broke your Mr. Saturnworld.

401
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:27,230
I didn’t mean to break it, the one on the TV.

402
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:28,251
Mo!

403
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,551
How did you do that to me?

404
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,660
Don’t you remember how hard it was for me to get it?

405
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:36,555
It’s my favorite.

406
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,282
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t be mad at me?

407
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:41,128
You need to buy me a new one.

408
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,674
I didn’t mean to break it. Seriously.

409
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,302
- Buy me a new one. - Come on.

410
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:33,536
I…

411
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,591
I feel sleepy.

412
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:43,580
Me too.

413
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,290
It was just an illusion.

414
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,545
You miss me, don’t you?

415
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:25,888
He’s an illusion.

416
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:27,743
He’s definitely an illusion.

417
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:33,733
Right?

418
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,802
Although I’m not real,

419
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,540
I will let you do anything to me.

420
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,333
Really?

421
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,564
What do you get from being a good boy?

422
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:58,114
Don’t you want to eat Hengney up?

423
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,047
Oh.

424
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,771
Oh.

425
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,450
Kongdech.

426
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:11,979
Stay strong.

427
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,022
I’ll hold him back.

428
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:15,477
Go now.

429
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,454
Go to see Hengney?

430
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:18,831
Go pull yourself together.

431
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:20,336
I’ll handle him.

432
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:21,368
But…

433
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Kongdech!

434
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,620
No!

435
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,865
Mo, why didn’t you wake me up?

436
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:49,881
I’m going to be late…

437
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,032
I woke up early today because I needed to cook a big meal for us.

438
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:58,149
Wait.

439
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:00,497
Why did you cook such a big meal?

440
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,377
Were you going to invite the whole neighborhood to join us?

441
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:05,397
Sorry. I asked him to cook many dishes.

442
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:07,309
But don’t worry.

443
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:11,208
I called Thua and his friends to join us.

444
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,140
Wait. Before you invited anyone here,

445
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,718
you should have asked me first. I’m the house owner.

446
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:15,834
I don’t know. I don’t care.

447
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:18,275
Let’s eat before it gets cold.

448
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,370
How can we finish all this?

449
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:20,789
- Of course, we can. - Yes, we can.

450
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:21,642
Are you sure?

451
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,186
Yes, we can finish it.

452
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:28,241
It’s delicious like always.

453
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:32,097
I’m so jealous of you, Heng.

454
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Does it taste okay?

455
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,308
It’s better than okay. It’s so delicious.

456
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:40,149
Thua.

457
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,202
Come and join us for breakfast.

458
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,360
Why did he get here so fast?

459
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:45,983
Chicha, why don’t you call everyone to join us?

460
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,247
Stop it.

461
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:52,358
What’s wrong?

462
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:53,475
Are you okay?

463
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,912
I talked to the neighbors this morning.

464
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:59,133
They said there was no plan to build a mall in the neighborhood.

465
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:00,157
I was scammed.

466
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,454
I was scammed to give my bar to him for free.

467
00:30:02,506 --> 00:30:03,506
What?

468
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:23,755
He promised to give me the best spot in the mall.

469
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,297
I could use it for free for twenty years.

470
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:29,278
But he didn’t include the mall construction plan in the contract.

471
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:30,297
I didn’t know it.

472
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:32,602
I already signed the contract.

473
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:40,484
It means you gave our house and bar to him for free?

474
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:54,393
Didn’t I tell you to read the contract thoroughly before you sign it?

475
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,607
- How could you let this happen? - I’m sorry, Chicha.

476
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:58,096
- Chicha, calm down. - I’m sorry.

477
00:30:58,589 --> 00:30:59,675
- Thua, calm down. - Don’t do this.

478
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:02,460
- Sorry? Will it help us get our house back? - Chicha, that’s enough.

479
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:03,857
I’m sorry.

480
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,487
Go get our house back!

481
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:08,108
Everyone, stop fighting.

482
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:09,078
Chicha calm down.

483
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,837
I’m sorry.

484
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,592
Thua, please go back to your seat.

485
00:31:11,943 --> 00:31:12,943
I’m sorry.

486
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,198
Stop it.

487
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:15,807
Please sit down.

488
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:19,331
Thua, do you have the contract with you?

489
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,834
Maybe we can help you find a hole in it.

490
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:26,054
Yes, Mo. Please take a look at it.

491
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:27,724
This is the contract?

492
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,870
Okay.

493
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,903
You gave our whole house to him?!

494
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:32,706
Chicha, stop it.

495
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:35,103
Mo is helping look at the contract.

496
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,149
We will find a way to fix it.

497
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:36,877
That’s enough.

498
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:37,500
Calm down.

499
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:39,927
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

500
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,982
Breathe, breathe.

501
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,278
Stop it.

502
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:47,832
It’ll be fine. Trust me.

503
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:49,195
Mo is looking at the contract.

504
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:50,485
Okay?

505
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,857
After reading the contract,

506
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,093
there’s no way you will win the case.

507
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,155
It said nothing about the mall construction plan.

508
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,337
It only said that Thau-ngok would give the land.

509
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,687
Is there anything we can do?

510
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:23,201
There’s only one way. You need to find evidence

511
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,303
to prove that he promised about the mall.

512
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:29,368
Okay.

513
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:30,718
I got it.

514
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,472
Thank you.

515
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,906
Mo, you are so kind.

516
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:56,604
You not only help Heng but also help his friend.

517
00:32:58,082 --> 00:32:59,082
You must be tired.

518
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,038
It’s not a big deal.

519
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:10,517
If I were him,

520
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,250
I would never let you go through these troubles.

521
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:23,145
Thank you for worrying about me.

522
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:31,204
Why do the coffee granules take so long to dissolve?

523
00:33:33,322 --> 00:33:34,562
When will it be ready to drink?

524
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,040
My hand starts to hurt now.

525
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,170
Okay.

526
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,370
Whatever is behind this door,

527
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:50,626
I won’t be wavered by it.

528
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:51,648
Come on.

529
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:53,091
Come on.

530
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Oops.

531
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,362
Why didn’t you knock on the door?

532
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:00,733
How did it end up like this?

533
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,271
Why have you gone for so long?

534
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,976
Did you forget I’m a part of you?

535
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,841
Of course, I will be wavered by Hengney.

536
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,712
But you know how it’s going to end.

537
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:12,325
Heng will leave you anyway.

538
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:17,195
It’s not true.

539
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,078
It’s not true.

540
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,330
No. I don’t want to hear it.

541
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:22,674
I don’t want to hear it.

542
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:25,158
Hengney, please take me out of here.

543
00:34:26,028 --> 00:34:27,028
Sure.

544
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:30,087
Don’t say it.

545
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,336
Fine.

546
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,511
Go.

547
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,093
Don’t crawl back crying.

548
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:36,539
I warned you.

549
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:17,051
Latte with three extra spoons of sugar.

550
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,903
Your recipe to get diabetes.

551
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,830
If I had diabetes because of it,

552
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,515
you would have gotten liver cirrhosis.

553
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:27,200
How can you drink three packs of beer every day?

554
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,263
Hey.

555
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,977
This company has scammed many people.

556
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:39,983
Thua-ngok is not their first victim.

557
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,570
What are you looking at?

558
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:05,528
Are you Heng that I know?

559
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,918
From what I remember, you usually cried

560
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,700
and ran to me for help after being bullied.

561
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:16,029
Are you verbally bullied me?

562
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,029
I’m helping you.

563
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,005
I know.

564
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:25,022
Thanks.

565
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,694
Are you Chicha that I know?

566
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:36,278
Where did you hide my friend?

567
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:38,825
Tell me.

568
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:41,291
I probably hid her under your skin.

569
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,103
Do you want me to say this?

570
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:47,752
Yes.

571
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,408
Now, you sound like my friend.

572
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:58,017
Where is my note?

573
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,790
Chi.

574
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:11,942
To be honest,

575
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,047
you don’t need to thank me.

576
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,303
If I can’t find the evidence,

577
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,865
you will never give me back my room.

578
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:37,500
Can I do that?

579
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,050
Absolutely…

580
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:55,659
not.

581
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:01,328
If you feel sleepy, you should go to bed.

582
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:03,296
Stop wasting my time.

583
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:05,099
Otherwise, I won’t finish it.

584
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:18,739
You were right.

585
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:37,423
What happened?

586
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,205
He left me.

587
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:49,899
We both knew…

588
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,060
this was how it was going to end.

589
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,930
Is it because I’m an angel?

590
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:09,598
No.

591
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:11,691
Is it because…

592
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,800
I’m a man?

593
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:22,602
No.

594
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:26,660
He told me

595
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:31,982
he looked up to me like an angel.

596
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,071
But he doesn’t love me.

597
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,568
What did I do wrong?

598
00:39:45,877 --> 00:39:48,100
Is it because I’m worthless?

599
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:52,365
So no one loves me.

600
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:55,940
Everyone leaves me.

601
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,450
I’m sorry.

602
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:16,317
I promise.

603
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:21,398
I will never let you feel lonely again.

604
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:32,438
I love you.

605
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:36,108
I love you too.

606
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,970
Heng.

607
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:44,177
Wake up.

608
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,949
Don’t you have a meeting to sign a contract with a client this morning?

609
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:47,791
Get up.

610
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:49,082
I don’t want to get up.

611
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:51,114
Can you sign the contract for me?

612
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,330
No.

613
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,037
I can’t do that.

614
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:55,318
You need to sign it yourself.

615
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:01,391
Come on. You’ll be late.

616
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,208
Sign it myself?

617
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:14,496
I found it.

618
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
Hold on.

619
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:18,829
What did you find?

620
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,848
I found a way to help Thua.

621
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:40,493
The contract is void?

622
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,870
If you don’t believe me,

623
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:44,802
look at his signature.

624
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,162
Thirakorn was his old name.

625
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:56,232
He used that signature out of his habit.

626
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:59,700
But he changed his name.

627
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:01,700
His name is Dunk.

628
00:43:06,736 --> 00:43:09,299
So the contract became void.

629
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,200
The case is overturned.

630
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:16,102
La la la, la la la.

631
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,202
I already knew that. So what?

632
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:25,786
It has no legal effect

633
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,651
because Thua signed the contract.

634
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:31,770
He can sue us for this.

635
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:35,662
Mo.

636
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,223
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

637
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:40,869
I didn’t know that you would do this.

638
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:44,103
So the case is overturned.

639
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,183
Are you walking out by yourself

640
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:49,807
or do you want my men to escort you out?

641
00:43:52,728 --> 00:43:53,964
What are you doing to him?

642
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,108
Please let me go.

643
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:56,948
Let him go.

644
00:43:56,995 --> 00:43:57,995
Let me go.

645
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:01,002
Here is the evidence.

646
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:08,090
Thua always records things that he says.

647
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,330
Who knows he might record the conversation when you were scamming him?

648
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:16,589
Is that possible?

649
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:19,995
Usually, he only uses the recorder for his songs.

650
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:23,802
Right now, we need to use whatever we have.

651
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:27,278
I’ll walk out by myself. Please let me go.

652
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,980
I’ll walk out by myself.

653
00:44:32,694 --> 00:44:33,694
I found it.

654
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:39,105
(Yo, yo, yo)

655
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,440
(If I could, I would close my bar)

656
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:43,500
(Then where would you have your meal?)

657
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,982
Sorry. Not this file.

658
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:51,022
This is the file.

659
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:56,339
(I have a plan to build a small mall here.)

660
00:44:56,512 --> 00:44:58,502
(Thua-ngok, if you agree to give me your land.)

661
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:01,099
(I’ll give you the best spot in the mall)

662
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:02,983
(to open a bar for free.)

663
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,100
(The best spot?)

664
00:45:05,534 --> 00:45:07,204
(It sounds good for a song title.)

665
00:45:07,894 --> 00:45:09,600
(Can I record my song for a moment?)

666
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,277
Thua made a mistake with his recorder.

667
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:18,031
Instead of recording his song,

668
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:20,977
he recorded his conversation with you.

669
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:24,450
Shall we go meet the police?

670
00:45:38,317 --> 00:45:40,149
The case is overturned.

671
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:47,592
La la la, la la la.

672
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:50,391
Sit down.

673
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:51,825
We need to celebrate today.

674
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:54,070
Cheers!

675
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:02,980
I’m lucky that I didn’t lose my bar.

676
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:06,068
Thank you two so much.

677
00:46:06,257 --> 00:46:07,211
You don’t need to thank us.

678
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:08,229
That’s right.

679
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:09,437
I really thank you.

680
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,641
I have nothing to give you.

681
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:13,977
This is the only precious thing I have.

682
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:18,296
My second album with my autograph on it.

683
00:46:18,328 --> 00:46:19,574
Dunk Sae-tang.

684
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,558
It’s okay. I already had your first album.

685
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:22,844
It’s perfect for stabilizing a wobble table.

686
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:24,376
You can take it to stabilize your bed.

687
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:28,543
Where is Chicha?

688
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:32,220
Right. I saw her walk out of the front door.

689
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:33,237
I’ll go check on her.

690
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:58,201
Are you crying because you’re happy?

691
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,850
Nonsense.

692
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:01,207
Who’s crying?

693
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:03,297
You.

694
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:09,928
Chicha, whether you are happy or upset,

695
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:11,645
you can let it out.

696
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:13,238
Why do you need to keep cool?

697
00:47:14,324 --> 00:47:15,674
Why do I have to cry?

698
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,368
This bar is my brother’s.

699
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,909
It’s not mine.

700
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,299
I know how much you love this bar.

701
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:31,165
You picked everything from the tables to the toothpicks.

702
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:35,702
It was because my brother had poor taste.

703
00:47:45,647 --> 00:47:48,431
I still remember when the bar was first opened.

704
00:47:50,308 --> 00:47:53,900
You hired me to eat here to support him.

705
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,637
You ordered so many dishes.

706
00:47:57,647 --> 00:47:59,699
The bill was so expensive.

707
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,801
When we graduated, we celebrated it here.

708
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:16,484
We celebrated your birthday,

709
00:48:17,423 --> 00:48:18,423
my birthday,

710
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,305
and my first business deal.

711
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,973
When my mom left.

712
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:34,235
When you comforted me after I failed my exam.

713
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:43,402
Come to think of it,

714
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:46,303
they all happened at this bar.

715
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,401
Why am I crying?

716
00:48:58,482 --> 00:48:59,482
Good.

717
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:04,263
This is more like you.

718
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:09,894
It’s okay.

719
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:12,702
Let’s think that you are crying on my behalf.

720
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,245
I’ll comfort you.

721
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,717
It’s okay.

722
00:49:23,915 --> 00:49:26,722
If this bar were gone, we would have no place to go to get drunk.

723
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,401
We got it back.

724
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:35,118
Don’t cry.

725
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,503
If I can’t find the evidence,

726
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:02,102
you will never give me back my room.

727
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:08,463
Can I do that?

728
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,070
Absolutely.

729
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:04,162
Hey.

730
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:07,677
Where are you going?

731
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,930
Nothing.

732
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:13,562
I’m going to spend the night somewhere else.

733
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:18,598
What’s wrong?

734
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:21,256
Nothing.

735
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,920
I just need a change of scenery.

736
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:28,561
Are you going to spend the night at Ten’s place?

737
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:34,174
I saw you two secretly holding hands at the bar.

738
00:51:38,577 --> 00:51:39,973
You are dating him, aren’t you?

739
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:45,242
Ten is my ex.

740
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,450
Recently,

741
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:51,551
he asked me to get back together.

742
00:51:52,528 --> 00:51:53,865
I already said no.

743
00:51:55,093 --> 00:51:56,404
But he still doesn’t give up.

744
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:03,266
I’m leaving, it has nothing to do with Ten.

745
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,570
It’s because of me.

746
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:21,229
Good luck.

747
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,779
I won’t let you go.

748
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:02,109
Why are you so cruel?

749
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:06,262
Is it because I can cook?

750
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,130
Or is it because I know how to iron clothes?

751
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,160
You can find someone else to do it.

752
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:19,400
Chicha can do it.

753
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:24,087
What are you talking about?

754
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:26,305
She’s my friend.

755
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:28,760
If you only see her as a friend,

756
00:53:35,322 --> 00:53:37,659
then prove it by dating me.

757
00:53:38,912 --> 00:53:39,912
Can you do that?

758
00:53:57,822 --> 00:53:58,822
Yes.

759
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:25,961
I’ll date you.

760
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:37,644
That’s not funny.

761
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:38,909
I mean it.

762
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:46,908
Heng.

763
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:59,968
From now on, my ordinary days will become special every day

764
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:04,542
It’s all because I have you, oh, you are my best

765
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,887
Want to see you every time I wake

766
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:09,075
Thank you for being someone great

767
00:55:09,094 --> 00:55:12,728
Someone I’ve been searching for

768
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:17,496
You make my every moment feel like a wedding photo

769
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:21,822
You and me locking eyes underneath the moonlight glow

770
00:55:22,225 --> 00:55:24,282
No precious gift I need

771
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,026
Just stay the same like this, please

772
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:33,435
And this is the very best of all

773
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:40,065
I don’t know how couples usually act.

774
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:41,754
This kind of thing,

775
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:43,063
whether I feed you,

776
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:44,402
or you feed me,

777
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:45,349
It’s all fine.

778
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:46,761
I can’t run away from my heart.

779
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:48,081
I’m begging you.

780
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,248
Can you go to an amusement park with Newyear?

781
00:55:50,357 --> 00:55:50,931
Huh?

782
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,585
I haven’t visited it for a while.

783
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:55,370
It was so much fun.

784
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:57,549
Heng, let’s go on the ride one more time.

785
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:59,613
This time, let’s take the back-roll seats, okay?

786
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,068
If you feel better,

787
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,200
shall we find non-thrill rides to enjoy?

788
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:04,349
Can I enjoy you?

789
00:56:04,746 --> 00:56:05,746
Because you are so cute.

790
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:10,141
If you don’t want to tell anyone about us,

791
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,066
it’s okay.

792
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,303
Being your boyfriend is not something I would be embarrassed about.
