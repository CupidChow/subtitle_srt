1
00:00:01,316 --> 00:00:02,316
I’m sorry.

2
00:00:03,698 --> 00:00:05,690
This is Mo, from the Chiang Mai team.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,803
He will join our team today.

4
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,963
If you don’t stop acting like this,

5
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:11,452
you need to move out.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,646
I won’t go.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,056
If I moved out, who would I sponge off?

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,400
If you won’t move out, then I’ll leave.

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,523
A guy like you can live alone?

10
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:22,116
You don’t even know where your mom keeps tissues?

11
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:24,055
Do you want to be my housemate?

12
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:25,098
Will you?

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,246
Heng.

14
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,434
These are your photos, aren’t they?

15
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,021
Why are they on the Boss's computer?

16
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,046
I like you.

17
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,015
I won’t deny my heart anymore.

18
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,560
He confessed his love to me.

19
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:38,541
Why can’t men date each other?

20
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,883
Do you have a crush on our boss?

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,526
No, I have a crush on you.

22
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:42,375
This time,

23
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,370
I won’t lose you to anyone.

24
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,547
How did I get here?

25
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:52,732
Where both my boss and my colleague

26
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,544
confessed their love to me on the same night.

27
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,935
Congrats.

28
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:01,262
Now you don’t have to be single for the rest of your life.

29
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:02,286
Thanks.

30
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,406
But you’re missing the point.

31
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,175
Heng just came to me for advice on who he should choose.

32
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,720
I’d go for Mo, though.

33
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:13,298
I like someone who kisses for love.

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,667
Guys.

35
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,501
I’m not here to ask you guys to help me pick.

36
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,775
Are you here to brag?

37
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,926
No!

38
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,290
The thing is

39
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,024
there’s one more thing that bothers me.

40
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:31,821
After Mo and I kissed,

41
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,341
he ran into his room before I could say anything.

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,027
Then the next morning…

43
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,996
- Mo. - You’re up early.

44
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:10,763
Is it going to rain today?

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,424
That’s not it.

46
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:13,570
I haven’t slept.

47
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,940
Who would be able to sleep?

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
What happened last night…

49
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,212
Breakfast’s ready.

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,980
Eat up.

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,630
Wow, Mo!

52
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:22,400
This looks great!

53
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,000
I’ll dig in.

54
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,221
This is not it!

55
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:26,880
The thing is…

56
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,870
I have an appointment with a client this morning.

57
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,818
I’ll get going.

58
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,690
Mo!

59
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,370
Mo!

60
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,403
He acted as if nothing happened.

61
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,966
What should I do when he’s like this?

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,741
I think Mo is just shy.

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,446
I think he was just kidding you.

64
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,153
Just how guys fool around with each other.

65
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,144
Is that so?

66
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:52,781
I have so many guy friends.

67
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,172
Nobody does that.

68
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,209
Hey.

69
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,972
I’m betting 500 Baht.

70
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,203
He’s only teasing.

71
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,246
I’ll go for 1,000.

72
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,858
Mo’s just masking his feelings.

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
2,000.

74
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,738
2,500.

75
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:05,680
3,500.

76
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:06,646
5,000.

77
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,332
Enough!

78
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,984
Please focus on the right point.

79
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:13,540
I shouldn’t have come to you guys for advice.

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,778
Shall we go for 10,000?

81
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,261
You should listen to my words.

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,209
I’m definitely winning.

83
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,384
Hey, trust me.

84
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:22,320
Trust me.

85
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:23,612
Come on. Trust me.

86
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,726
20,000.

87
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:28,486
Hello, boss.

88
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,341
I want to talk to you about the quarterly sales.

89
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,289
I like you.

90
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,741
I won’t deny my heart anymore.

91
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:45,892
Huh?!

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,975
Be honest.

93
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,289
Is anything up with you today?

94
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,144
Uh, I…

95
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,412
I noticed you looking stressed since this morning.

96
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:04,849
If there’s anything you can always talk to me.

97
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,070
Hengney.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,935
Then, let me ask you something.

99
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:13,704
Who’s “Hengney”?

100
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:23,760
It’s a nickname used among lovers.

101
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,215
Lo…l…l…

102
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:27,760
It’s “Honey”.

103
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,618
“Honey” plus “Heng”.

104
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
“Hengney”.

105
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,550
Heng…

106
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,978
I see.

107
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,150
What about you?

108
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,046
Do you want to

109
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,273
call me by any name?

110
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,649
I will call you

111
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,664
“Boss” as usual.

112
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,310
So, what are you stressing over?

113
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,298
There’s one thing.

114
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,990
I…

115
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:22,403
I…

116
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,612
Do you have any assignments for me?

117
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,430
I haven’t had any clients these days.

118
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:35,815
Oh!

119
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,510
I thought you had a serious problem.

120
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,803
That’s not a big deal.

121
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,261
Nice timing.

122
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,260
I have an assignment for you guys.

123
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,375
“You guys”?

124
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,550
It’s Mo’s client.

125
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,380
So I want you to be his mentor.

126
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,286
What’s wrong?

127
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
What about you?

128
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,410
What’s wrong?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,501
Do you have anything to say to me?

130
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Heng.

131
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,770
What?

132
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:49,812
The client’s here.

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Hello.

134
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,750
Oh! Alone!

135
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:55,781
Heng!

136
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,704
How have you been?

137
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:03,390
Alone, this is Mo.

138
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:04,861
Mo, this is Alone.

139
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,720
He’s my student mentee.

140
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,289
The star of his hometown!

141
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,144
Hello, I’m Mo.

142
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,163
Hello.

143
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,040
Are you looking for a room to live with your friend?

144
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,610
No.

145
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,880
This is Kaitong, my boyfriend.

146
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Boyfriend?

147
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,250
His mother was my insurance client.

148
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,606
When she passed away,

149
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,101
I brought him the insurance policy.

150
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
I was consoling him.

151
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,858
Somehow, we ended up being together.

152
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,240
If you’re going to go into such detail,

153
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,184
might as well mention how I sang at her funeral.

154
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,458
That’s…

155
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,476
I was being sarcastic!

156
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,886
Hey, why are you spacing out?

157
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:48,270
Show them the room.

158
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,116
Uh, let’s check out the room.

159
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,141
Let’s go.

160
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,064
After you.

161
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,787
This is a two-bedroom apartment with one bathroom and one washing area.

162
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,780
This is the sectioned kitchen area.

163
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,316
I’ll check out the bedroom.

164
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,113
I’ll show you.

165
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,144
Let’s go.

166
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Hey.

167
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,218
Yeah?

168
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,787
Let me ask you something.

169
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,981
How did you and Kaitong get together?

170
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,203
I told you.

171
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,753
I was bringing him the insurance policy.

172
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:44,713
No.

173
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:46,510
I was talking about

174
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:48,313
how you came to realize it.

175
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,870
You were only going out with the hottest girls back then.

176
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,870
Well,

177
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,901
I don’t know either.

178
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,092
We were just friends at first

179
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,988
but when I invited him to share the rent with me

180
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:01,193
we just sparked.

181
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,190
Oh.

182
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,350
Your story scares me.

183
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,695
The room is quite small, isn’t it?

184
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:13,353
That’s okay.

185
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,080
I have another room to show you.

186
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,560
Guaranteed you will love it.

187
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:17,686
Trust me!

188
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:18,978
Alright!

189
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,784
Is the bed bouncy?

190
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,230
Shall I test it out for you?

191
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,652
I think this is good.

192
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:27,975
I really like it.

193
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,440
Hey, the kitchen is so cute.

194
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:34,997
I think it’s perfect for the two of us.

195
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:36,021
Let’s go with this room.

196
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,876
I want a bigger room, though.

197
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,299
In case I want to bring the team here for a meeting.

198
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,461
But this is already big.

199
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:41,292
Big?

200
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,966
Put one screen here and the room is already filled up.

201
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,064
Hey, it’s alright.

202
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,166
I have a lot more in store.

203
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,372
I will show you some more, okay?

204
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,701
Right, we have a lot more.

205
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,130
Alright.

206
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,981
This is a double loft.

207
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:00,640
Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and one office.

208
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,307
It’s super spacious.

209
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,732
You can even bring your entire company here.

210
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,430
It is spacious indeed.

211
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,110
The price is budget-friendly too.

212
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,545
Let’s check out the office upstairs.

213
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:12,569
Let’s go.

214
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:15,673
Any discounts?

215
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:17,193
I think so.

216
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,190
Do you like it?

217
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,236
Yeah.

218
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,310
This is the room.

219
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,769
Wow!

220
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:40,129
Um, can I ask you something?

221
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,655
Between you two,

222
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,550
who made the first move?

223
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,292
That was probably me.

224
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:50,461
I see.

225
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,707
Wasn’t he surprised?

226
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,861
Well, a bit.

227
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,304
So how did you go from there?

228
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,673
Weren’t you scared to lose the friendship?

229
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,670
Why do you ask?

230
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,356
Oh.

231
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,944
I’m sorry.

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,292
I was just asking to get info to find you a place.

233
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:16,824
I’m sorry.

234
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,172
That’s alright.

235
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,470
Hey.

236
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,529
I think I’ll go for this room.

237
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,633
Isn’t it too big?

238
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:25,969
There are only two of us.

239
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:31,193
That’s true but I think it’s better to get a room that is convenient for your work and living.

240
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:32,658
I don’t think so.

241
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:35,230
Home should be a place of relaxation.

242
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:38,430
A place where you sleep, eat, and live together.

243
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,787
Not to work.

244
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,473
Right?

245
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,390
If you want to work or have meetings,

246
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:46,781
then do that at the office, right?

247
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,266
If you want to dine and watch movies, then go to a shopping mall.

248
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,486
Isn’t that right?

249
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,510
Uh…

250
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,944
But I want to spend time at home.

251
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,341
I want to work at home too.

252
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:56,436
Why are you so stubborn?

253
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,507
You are the stubborn one.

254
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,270
Don’t you care about me?

255
00:12:58,295 --> 00:12:59,052
How am I not caring about you?

256
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,360
If you care about me then you should go with what I want.

257
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,101
Guys.

258
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,812
Woah.

259
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:06,596
Calm down.

260
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,381
We have many more rooms to show you.

261
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:08,935
That’s right.

262
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,073
Just as Heng said.

263
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,421
Let’s look around more.

264
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,627
Please don’t be upset.

265
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,049
Calm down.

266
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,169
I brought them to every location in Bangkok.

267
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,304
None of them could bang their hearts!

268
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,433
What do we do, Mo?

269
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,953
So what are you going to do next?

270
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,381
I will probably ask Ten first.

271
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,707
Let’s see if he has any apartments available.

272
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,412
I’m so tired, Mo.

273
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,338
Let’s talk about us.

274
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,870
About what?

275
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,775
About that?

276
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,793
Yes.

277
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:06,738
I don’t think we should handle this case together.

278
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,735
About this?

279
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,944
Why, Mo?

280
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,812
The clients fighting among themselves is bad enough.

281
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,640
Let’s not fight among ourselves too.

282
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,803
I will talk to Boss about this, okay?

283
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,932
Fine.

284
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,110
But I have one thing I want to clear the air with you first.

285
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,178
The thing is…

286
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,098
I have to head out for work again.

287
00:14:44,104 --> 00:14:45,255
I need a little nap.

288
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:46,273
Mo.

289
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Mo!

290
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,790
Mo!

291
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,033
Mo!

292
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,030
Here.

293
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,664
I’ve selected the rooms your client would like.

294
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,686
Thank you, Ten.

295
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,581
Sorry for bothering you.

296
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I understand.

297
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,415
It’s normal for a couple’s life.

298
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,532
It's a make-or-break point.

299
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:28,347
That’s why people tend to break up when weddings draw near.

300
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,590
Ten.

301
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,575
Have you ever got to that point?

302
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,110
Is that so?

303
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:41,363
Not yet.

304
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,683
But I’ve been through a lot.

305
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,636
That means you have some experience.

306
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,350
Ten, can I ask you for some advice?

307
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,375
About the clients?

308
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:58,676
No.

309
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:00,812
The other day, someone kissed me.

310
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,501
Someone kissed my friend.

311
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,892
Mo, if you go home now, you will be stuck in the traffic.

312
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,393
I think we should just dine here.

313
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:17,424
It’s on me.

314
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Alright.

315
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,541
Irasshaimase!

316
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,993
Hello, Thua.

317
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,990
Hello, Mo.

318
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:31,249
This is the latest menu from us.

319
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,676
For our special guest.

320
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,489
What’s this?

321
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,480
Saba in yogurt stew.

322
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,929
Yum!

323
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,612
How come?

324
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,649
The name doesn’t even sound appetizing.

325
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,996
Hey! That sounds like a good title for a song.

326
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:53,180
I’ve got an idea for a new song.

327
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,615
I should note that.

328
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,610
“The name doesn’t even sound appetizing.”

329
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,610
“Even a cat wouldn’t think of eating.”

330
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,110
How’s that?

331
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,129
Amazing!

332
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,520
I will let you hear it when it’s done.

333
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,569
Sure!

334
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,450
Mo!

335
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,701
The owner seems so laid back.

336
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,695
Heng said Thua used to be a musician.

337
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,227
He released his own album too.

338
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,196
A musician.

339
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
I like that.

340
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,999
Well, that was it about him.

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,249
Let’s talk about you.

342
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,120
What’s going on?

343
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:47,427
I noticed you were looking gloomy all day.

344
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:48,590
What’s wrong?

345
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,418
Is it that obvious?

346
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,516
Who do you think I am?

347
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,796
This is Meow.

348
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,218
I notice everyone’s business.

349
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,969
It’s about love, right?

350
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,735
Tell me about it.

351
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:03,415
I promise.

352
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,046
I won’t tell anyone.

353
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,627
Where do I begin?

354
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,981
The thing is…

355
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,996
I fell for someone I shouldn’t.

356
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,483
Oh my!

357
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,470
Is it someone close?

358
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,563
I was drunk that day.

359
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,603
When I got drunk,

360
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,480
I happened to cross the line.

361
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,600
So someone suddenly kissed you?

362
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,833
Kissed my friend, not me.

363
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,212
Oh, sorry.

364
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:53,210
What did your friend say?

365
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:56,984
The next morning when I got sober,

366
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,526
I acted as if nothing happened.

367
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,120
You’re afraid that it was unacceptable for your friend?

368
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,809
Do you think it was acceptable?

369
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,360
My friend said he wasn’t sure

370
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,123
if the kiss was driven by genuine feelings

371
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:13,267
or it was just a joke.

372
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,600
My sense tells me…

373
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,618
it’s a genuine kiss.

374
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,852
But the person is probably afraid

375
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,243
of your friend’s rejection.

376
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,076
That’s why he acted like nothing happened.

377
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:25,926
I shouldn’t have done that.

378
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,729
We can’t even face each other now.

379
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,144
What should I do?

380
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,212
Should I talk things out or pretend as if nothing happened?

381
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,064
I think it has to be straightened out.

382
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,200
It’s better than suppressing your feelings.

383
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:46,166
Love is beautiful, Mo.

384
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,569
Perhaps, that person has feelings for you too.

385
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,963
Sorry, I thought you might feel cold.

386
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,618
I’ll hurry and wash up.

387
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:46,683
Hey, hold on.

388
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,996
I have something to say to you.

389
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Oh!

390
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,400
About work, right?

391
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
No.

392
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,984
About the kiss that night.

393
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,369
Actually,

394
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,904
I was just kidding.

395
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:45,923
Huh?

396
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:48,904
You know, it was how guys fooled around.

397
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,073
Do you think I would actually kiss you?

398
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:53,378
Are you out of your mind?

399
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,730
No.

400
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,227
Normally, after I kiss you,

401
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:01,446
you have to play along.

402
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,190
“Bluhh!”

403
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,513
“Are you kidding me?”

404
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,972
But when you didn’t follow the script,

405
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,970
I was lost.

406
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,649
I see.

407
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:11,261
How would I know that?

408
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,409
I won’t miss it next time!

409
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,224
Bluhh!

410
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,633
Like this, right?

411
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,532
Yes, just like that.

412
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:20,920
Right.

413
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,910
Come on, Mo.

414
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,369
You got me so stressed out.

415
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:25,969
Next time, just say it to me.

416
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:28,880
I’ll get washed up and will be right back.

417
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:29,347
Yeah.

418
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,000
Alright?

419
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,350
Woo!

420
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,240
But I don’t think he has feelings for me.

421
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,981
After that night,

422
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,809
he never looked at me the same.

423
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,070
But keeping it inside is torture, Mo.

424
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:54,836
Your heart will explode.

425
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,215
That’s true.

426
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,658
But that’s better than losing a good friend like him.

427
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,516
I will try to be a good friend to him too.

428
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,320
This is the last room I could find.

429
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,461
You can ask Alone what he thinks.

430
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,830
But I don’t like this room.

431
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:35,987
I don’t like it either.

432
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,092
I don’t like the fact that you’re being picky.

433
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,353
Be considerate to Heng.

434
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,846
I liked the first one he offered.

435
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,335
Who was the one being picky?

436
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:45,206
If you like it so much, then just go and live there.

437
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,233
I’ll just live alone.

438
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:47,655
Great.

439
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,113
Let’s just live separately.

440
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:49,981
I’m sick of this.

441
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,280
So do I.

442
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Hey!

443
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,412
I think living separately is a good idea.

444
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,020
I’m not saying this because I want more commission fees.

445
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,181
Kaitong!

446
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:01,381
Alone!

447
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,523
Hey!

448
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,667
Can you hear me?

449
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,630
What did they say?

450
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,298
They told me they would think it over.

451
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,609
But I think they would break up before that.

452
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Heng.

453
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,590
If people really love each other,

454
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:29,000
despite how different they are,

455
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,618
they will find their way back together.

456
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,350
I see.

457
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,156
Like you and I?

458
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,966
Despite how different we are,

459
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,193
we will find a way to live together.

460
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,470
Because we love each other, right?

461
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Bluhh!

462
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,793
Are you kidding me?

463
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,750
Mo!

464
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,492
Why are you not taking my jokes?

465
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,227
You are the one who taught me that.

466
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:23,409
Sorry, I forgot.

467
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,996
Hey.

468
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,015
Yeah?

469
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,716
Boss wants to see me ASAP.

470
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,280
I’ll be back.

471
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,975
You wanted to see me?

472
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Is anything up?

473
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:09,990
Sorry to make you come up here.

474
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:11,636
I have something to give you.

475
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,889
But I can’t let anyone else see it.

476
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:21,300
Is it the white envelope?

477
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,978
Am I getting fired?

478
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,290
It’s this.

479
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,720
I made you a lunch box.

480
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,913
I heard Mo often makes stuffed omelets for you.

481
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,258
So I wanted to make one for you too.

482
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:45,707
Come and sit.

483
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:59,460
Wow, Boss!

484
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,458
Did you make all of this yourself?

485
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,978
I wanted to give it a go.

486
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,970
Here.

487
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Thank you.

488
00:27:24,252 --> 00:27:25,649
This is so delicious!

489
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Really?

490
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,467
I’m glad you like it, Hengney.

491
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,907
Thank you.

492
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,169
So, how are you doing?

493
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,270
I’ve heard work is tough for you these days.

494
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,818
Boss,

495
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,966
it’s tough work.

496
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:55,820
They’re going to live separately.

497
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:00,940
But I think it’s better this way.

498
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,556
Don’t forget, they came to us

499
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,089
to find the perfect room for the two of them.

500
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,778
But, Boss.

501
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,770
I don’t know what to do.

502
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:19,950
We’ve had tougher clients before.

503
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,850
Do you remember your first client, Hengney?

504
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,941
The chicken rice shop.

505
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,384
With the father and son.

506
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:31,138
I’ve lived here since I was born.

507
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,886
My regular customers live in the neighborhood.

508
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,076
(Mr. Tum’s Chicken Rice.) I will never sell this building.

509
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,498
Come on, Dad.

510
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,283
It’d be a miracle if we managed to sell such a shabby place.

511
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:42,960
Isn’t it this shabby place that paid your way through school?

512
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:44,443
Calm down.

513
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:45,809
Please don’t fight.

514
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:47,218
Am I in the wrong here?

515
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:49,680
I want you to live in a better house.

516
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,680
So you wouldn’t have to walk up and down stairs.

517
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:57,969
If your father doesn’t want to move out, then he doesn’t have to.

518
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:00,978
I will find a contractor to renovate the house for you.

519
00:29:01,193 --> 00:29:03,747
Then you can live more comfortably

520
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:05,740
and also meet his regular customers.

521
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,141
Wouldn't that be a win for both parties?

522
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,067
I remember it now!

523
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,329
I was so ambitious back then.

524
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,304
Do you remember what happened after that?

525
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,987
After that?

526
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:27,883
Hmm.

527
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,507
If you say that to the client,

528
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,083
we won’t get any commission fee.

529
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,480
I’m sorry.

530
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:33,981
You taught me yourself.

531
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,150
What did I teach you?

532
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,963
A good home is where everyone in the house is happy.

533
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,427
You once taught me during my probation period.

534
00:29:42,418 --> 00:29:44,410
So I thought if I did that,

535
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
the client would be happy

536
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,972
Hey!

537
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:51,996
Stop that!

538
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,246
Boss!

539
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:54,590
Are you okay?

540
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:55,163
I’m alright.

541
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,193
Follow him!

542
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,295
Hey!

543
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,169
Luckily, I ran after that thief.

544
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,643
Otherwise, your wallet would have been gone.

545
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:13,390
So…

546
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,410
What else?

547
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,738
That was all.

548
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,846
Think carefully.

549
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,966
That scene was the highlight of the story.

550
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,350
Highlight of the story?

551
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,747
You sprained your ankle.

552
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,960
So I had to buy you some bandages.

553
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,206
I’m back, Boss.

554
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,821
I will put the bandage on for you.

555
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Thanks.

556
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Does it hurt?

557
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:16,224
I’m alright.

558
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,421
Let me put your shoes on for you.

559
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,381
That moment made me feel…

560
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,227
as if I was Cinderella

561
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,660
and the prince put my shoes on for me.

562
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,098
That was when…

563
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,581
I knew my own heart.

564
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,667
That I…

565
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,978
have fallen…

566
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,984
for this guy.

567
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,010
Me?

568
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,498
I’ll try to talk to my daughter.

569
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,566
Daughter?

570
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,750
Hengney.

571
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,132
Please wait for me.

572
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,538
Boss, I don’t feel that way.

573
00:32:57,556 --> 00:32:59,649
Boss, can’t you see that Heng is uncomfortable?

574
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,775
What?

575
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,610
What?

576
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,787
I was just inviting Heng to talk about work.

577
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,913
About work?

578
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,080
Then what about that homemade lunch box?

579
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,723
You’re exploiting his time.

580
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:18,880
This is considered an exploitation of authority.

581
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,843
How can you say that, Mo?

582
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:24,092
He’s our boss.

583
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:24,498
Heng.

584
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,510
Yes?

585
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,997
Did I make you uncomfortable?

586
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:27,956
Not at all, Boss.

587
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:28,969
Not at all.

588
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,480
That’s because you are his boss.

589
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,141
Heng wouldn’t dare speak up to you.

590
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,876
If you really love Heng,

591
00:33:35,907 --> 00:33:37,219
then let’s fight this fight fairly.

592
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:39,210
As someone who also likes Heng.

593
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:42,329
Bluhh!

594
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,578
Bluhh!

595
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,501
Bluhh!

596
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,332
Mo!

597
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,178
Do the joke. Just as you taught me.

598
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,304
Be quiet!

599
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:52,800
The adults are talking.

600
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,590
Heng chose me.

601
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,329
Heng chose me.

602
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,409
I have been his friend for years.

603
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,187
Heng has been working for me for over ten years.

604
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,116
I can say ten good things about Heng right now.

605
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,966
Anyone can list ten good things about him.

606
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:09,704
I can list ten bad things about him.

607
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:11,255
I can do hundreds!

608
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:12,812
Heng often comes late.

609
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:14,264
He plays games until dawn.

610
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,827
That’s why he comes late.

611
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,236
No wonder.

612
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,406
He always walks absentmindedly into the meeting room.

613
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,660
And loses his files.

614
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:20,880
Not just files.

615
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,618
He even lost a laptop which was always at home.

616
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:25,840
He met up with a client and ruined the deal.

617
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:26,996
We lost millions.

618
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,578
My bonus was also gone.

619
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:29,384
Enough!

620
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,590
Please stop fighting.

621
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:31,926
Stay out of it!

622
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:34,190
Heng will choose me.

623
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,378
He will choose me.

624
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:36,418
He chose me.

625
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:37,341
He chose me.

626
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:38,372
He chose me.

627
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,276
Yes, Mr. Pramote?

628
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,975
The condo in Thonglor?

629
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:47,970
Yes, I’m on it.

630
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,203
Yes, sir.

631
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,621
He’s my client.

632
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:51,646
Right.

633
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,489
Please get the presentations ready and head to the meeting room.

634
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:55,710
Alright, please email me all the information.

635
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,603
Sure, no problem.

636
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:57,633
Let’s go.

637
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
What?

638
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Hey!

639
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:07,507
Mo!

640
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:08,670
Boss!

641
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,086
Aren’t you guys going to fight?

642
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,150
What was that?

643
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,535
What a day!

644
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,840
Wow.

645
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,073
The work must have been really tough today.

646
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:25,833
People are coming for drinks and chill.

647
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,963
Look, here comes another one.

648
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,520
Get me a bottle of beer.

649
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,621
Sure, you got it.

650
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:44,695
Wait, what’s wrong with you guys?

651
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,480
Why are you guys so tense today?

652
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,193
Right.

653
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,750
Ask him.

654
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,747
It’s nothing.

655
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,107
As if!

656
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,606
How can you say that to our boss?

657
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,184
I was helping you.

658
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,870
Helping me on what?

659
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,793
I know you told Boss that you like me

660
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:08,553
so that he would stop bothering me.

661
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,050
But there are better ways.

662
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,886
I wasn’t fooling the Boss.

663
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:14,880
I was fooling you.

664
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:20,516
Why would you do that?

665
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,218
I like you.

666
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,310
Did you hear clearly that I like you?

667
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,584
I wasn’t joking with you that night.

668
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:54,369
I really like you.

669
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,492
Did you move in with me and cook for me because you wanted something from me?

670
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,230
Damn it.

671
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,975
I trusted you.

672
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:14,018
I have always thought you are my friend.

673
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,970
Is this your true color?

674
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:26,492
I’m sorry.

675
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:31,570
If you’re uncomfortable because of me,

676
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,095
I will move you.

677
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,449
Chi, where’s my beer?

678
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,683
Right.

679
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Ouch!

680
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,843
Why did you hit me?

681
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:00,313
Because you’re an ass.

682
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:02,332
You were the one asking Mo to live with you.

683
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:04,330
Why are you acting like he deceived you?

684
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,095
Aren’t you the one who lured him into doing your chores for you?

685
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,609
A selfish person like you

686
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:11,360
deserves to be alone for the rest of your life.

687
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:13,193
No beer for you.

688
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,116
Damn it.

689
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,403
Chi!

690
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,990
Get lost.

691
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,618
Thua-ngok, please get me a beer.

692
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:22,818
I will bring it to you.

693
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:24,810
One second.

694
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,981
Thua-ngok.

695
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:17,932
(Heat it up before you eat. Don’t be lazy.)

696
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,033
(Because you’re an ass.)

697
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,046
(You were the one asking Mo to live with you.)

698
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,040
(Why are you acting like he deceived you?)

699
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,120
(A selfish person like you)

700
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,735
(deserves to be alone for the rest of your life.)

701
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,101
Hold on.

702
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,689
This is the first place I showed you guys.

703
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,680
Didn’t you say you don’t like it?

704
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,587
This place has a cute kitchen that my boyfriend likes.

705
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,541
Didn’t you want a big meeting room?

706
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,010
We’re thinking about renovating the room.

707
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,335
Just get rid of one of the walls.

708
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,584
We should get a bigger space.

709
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,643
That sounds good.

710
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:46,116
Since when did you guys talk it out?

711
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:48,443
While we were looking for separate places.

712
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:49,587
Can you believe it?

713
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:52,516
No matter how nice the kitchen is,

714
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,166
I don't feel the need for it

715
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:56,160
if I don’t get to come home and cook for him.

716
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,187
Me too.

717
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,304
I wanted a big meeting room.

718
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:04,812
But now I know.

719
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,193
I just wanted to come home and watch him cook for me.

720
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,430
That’s…

721
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,289
the house we’re looking for.

722
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,332
Sorry for causing you so much trouble.

723
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,569
Shall we sign the contract now?

724
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:26,344
That’s alright.

725
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,545
I’ll take care of that for you later.

726
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,960
I have to leave right now.

727
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,830
Thanks a lot!

728
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:31,873
Love you.

729
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I’ll get going!

730
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
Meow.

731
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,550
Where’s Mo?

732
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,116
I heard he’s taking the afternoon off.

733
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,261
Oh, Heng.

734
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:48,960
He asked me not to tell you that.

735
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,406
Is he…?

736
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:54,363
Meow, please tell Boss that I’ll take the afternoon off.

737
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:56,092
Thank you, Meow.

738
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,470
They’re like lovers trying to get back together.

739
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,090
Oops!

740
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,338
Is the person Mo like Heng?

741
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,793
Heng!

742
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,449
I’m rooting for you!

743
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:11,163
Do your best!

744
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:12,332
I’m cheering for you.

745
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:14,427
Guys.

746
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,070
Mo!

747
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,892
Are you really moving out?

748
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,907
Isn’t this what you wanted?

749
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,581
Mo, hold on.

750
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,387
If you have anything to say, spit it out.

751
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,763
I’m sorry.

752
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,610
Sorry for saying mean things to you that day.

753
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,236
But I’m glad

754
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,969
that you moved in with me that day.

755
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,710
I like this house with you in it.

756
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,470
Mo.

757
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,978
Would you forget the bad things I’ve done to you

758
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,381
and stay here with me?

759
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,713
As a friend.

760
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,418
Ouch!

761
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,972
What was that for?

762
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,276
I’m sorry, Heng.

763
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,984
But I think…

764
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,396
I can’t be your friend anymore.

765
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:21,852
False awakening, I wish dreams come true

766
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:29,883
Where everything I imagine repeats anew Not just a memory fading in time

767
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:41,316
This poor heart can't bear being the only one who dreams

768
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:05,520
Mo, last night you…

769
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,130
I forgot to give back your house key yesterday.

770
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,307
Where did you sleep last night?

771
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:13,372
We’re at the office,

772
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,060
so let’s only talk about work.

773
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,150
Mo, come on.

774
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:20,175
Everyone.

775
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,630
Our boss has something to say.

776
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:25,421
Please head to the meeting room immediately.

777
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,969
Mo.

778
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,144
Why is he calling for an urgent meeting?

779
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:52,504
Is he going to fire us?

780
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,409
Don’t worry too much.

781
00:46:55,427 --> 00:46:56,923
If he were to fire anyone,

782
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:00,920
Heng would be the first to go.

783
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,464
I have both good and bad news to tell you.

784
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,510
The bad news is…

785
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,996
we will have to wrap up sales three days early this month.

786
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,147
The good news is…

787
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,055
we will be going on a company outing during that time.

788
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,246
Yay!

789
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,660
I have got the place sorted.

790
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:41,218
Does anyone have any questions?

791
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
I do!

792
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,987
I want to know if I can sleep with Mo.

793
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:49,129
Huh?

794
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:05,624
(Come on.)

795
00:48:05,661 --> 00:48:07,858
(If I play it out this way, )

796
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:11,236
(fate will bring us together somehow.)

797
00:48:15,415 --> 00:48:18,424
Welcome to our outing.

798
00:48:18,455 --> 00:48:22,135
To get everyone to know each other better,

799
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,006
we will be playing some games.

800
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,000
When you said you didn’t want to be my friend,

801
00:48:26,264 --> 00:48:27,624
did you mean it?

802
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,135
Why don’t you want to be my friend?

803
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,209
You want me to see you as a friend.

804
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,963
You’re so selfish, Heng.

805
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:38,516
I don’t know what I am to you.

806
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,658
I’m so happy when I’m with you.

807
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,150
I will ask you one last time.

808
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,830
Will you move back to live with me?
