1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:01,204
Where is Heng?

2
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:03,220
If you have anything to give him,

3
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:04,297
you can give it to me.

4
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:08,302
I’ll see him at home later.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,440
I’m your boss’s daughter.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,536
Before my mom died, my dad promised her

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,411
that he would love her forever.

8
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:16,190
Until this Honey girl showed up.

9
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:19,939
I think Cher-aim is seeing someone.

10
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,560
Lately, she often came home late.

11
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,946
I knew it. You are dating someone.

12
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,736
Let me see the face of the man who is the reason you lie to me.

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,048
I know that you have feelings for someone

14
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:32,970
and you’re hiding it from me.

15
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:34,897
So I asked Heng to help me find the person.

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,598
The person I told you I want to marry is this man.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
What?!

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,197
The real Honey is you!

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,490
So you have been lying to me all this time?

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,834
I wasn’t lying to you.

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,200
I just didn’t tell you the truth.

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,100
Can’t you choose someone else, Dad?

23
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:11,265
Mo, staff at this café, anyone but him.

24
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,045
If it’s not him,

25
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,005
I can’t love anyone.

26
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:23,629
Fine.

27
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,404
You will regret it, Dad.

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,740
Wait, Cher…

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,848
Give her some time.

30
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:41,848
There’s no need to rush.

31
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,736
Today, you stepped up and admitted our relationship.

32
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:49,576
You already did well.

33
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,931
But I haven’t said anything.

34
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,312
Doraemo.

35
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:07,995
Doraemo, help me.

36
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,112
I’m in big trouble.

37
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,871
What’s going on? Calm down.

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,517
Cher-aim found out

39
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:15,201
that her dad has feelings for me.

40
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:16,497
She will definitely expose me.

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,271
If I were invited to Dr. Phil,

42
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,202
I would be condemned as a homewrecker, Doraemo.

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,626
Hey, listen to me.

44
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,314
You didn’t steal anyone’s husband.

45
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:30,850
He is the one who asked you out.

46
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:33,717
That’s right.

47
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,306
You’re right.

48
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,900
One more thing,

49
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,401
sooner or later, she will know the truth.

50
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,552
She’s not a kid anymore.

51
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,237
She will get over it.

52
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,537
Don’t worry.

53
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,185
She refuses to leave her room?!

54
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,448
She doesn’t answer me when I talk to her.

55
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,384
She doesn’t read my messages.

56
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:57,408
She refuses to eat.

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,000
She refuses to go to school.

58
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:00,565
Don’t worry.

59
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:03,413
This is my family’s problem.

60
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,260
How can I not worry about it?

61
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:07,779
It’s my fault.

62
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,896
No, no.

63
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:10,840
Thank you for worrying about us.

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,222
Everything will be fine.

65
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,841
Let’s go to the meeting.

66
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,137
Wait, boss.

67
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,696
Why are you taking a chopping board with you?

68
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,088
I thought it was my tablet.

69
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,100
I’ll call my housekeeper to bring me my tablet.

70
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:29,802
Boss.

71
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:31,324
This is an AC remote control.

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,151
I think you should sit down

73
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,210
and sip some coffee to calm yourself.

74
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:38,782
I’ll attend the meeting on your behalf.

75
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,430
Boss.

76
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,242
Boss.

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,930
What should I do?

78
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,103
This is serious.

79
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:53,794
I feel much better after sipping coffee.

80
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:55,161
He’s been talking to the AC remote control for an hour.

81
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:56,700
Is he okay?

82
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,306
I think he’s been stressed about his daughter.

83
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:05,296
I think we should give him some time.

84
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,656
Let’s do the work we can

85
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,853
to help him in the meantime.

86
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,405
We can’t do that.

87
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,228
I overheard the accounting staff talking.

88
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:15,727
If our team misses the sales target this quarter,

89
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,727
we won’t get the year-end bonus.

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,742
Wait.

91
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:24,300
I heard that our team performed well in sales.

92
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:25,826
That’s right.

93
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,198
But our boss seems to have lost his focus lately.

94
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Look.

95
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:31,760
Our team’s sales performance keeps dropping.

96
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,499
Did it start when you saw his phone lock screen?

97
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,990
You are right.

98
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,982
Am I the reason for our team’s disaster?

99
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,622
If he fails to close the major deal tomorrow,

100
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,070
it won’t only affect our year-end bonus,

101
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,757
our boss might also get fired.

102
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,241
Boss, are you sure you can do it?

103
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:24,432
If you can’t do it,

104
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,102
we can take over the presentation.

105
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:27,555
I’m okay.

106
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:28,669
Don’t worry.

107
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,367
I’m ready for today.

108
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,753
The presentation slide is ready.

109
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:34,017
I’m ready for the presentation.

110
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,644
My phone is also ready.

111
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:36,777
What?!

112
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,379
That’s an AC remote control.

113
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:41,237
I’m joking.

114
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:42,767
I saw you all look very nervous.

115
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,014
I’m worried that you will feel hot. I’m going to lower the AC temperature.

116
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,115
Lower it to 23 degrees Celsius.

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,912
It’s very hot in here.

118
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:48,124
Sure.

119
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,302
Although the price and tax of the property seem to be high,

120
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:57,565
we believe that

121
00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,494
this is a solid long-term investment.

122
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:00,844
Location,

123
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:02,979
in the primary of Sathorn.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,352
(How did I forget this?)

125
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,642
(He’s the one who has been leading us)

126
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:09,210
(to be the top team in the company for ten years.)

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,916
The whole building will be fully operational,

128
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
which means…

129
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:17,000
(I’m sorry for doubting you.)

130
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,564
Let’s do it.

131
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Let’s do it?

132
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:24,328
Okay, perfect decision.

133
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,324
Shit!

134
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:30,475
Oh my gosh!

135
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,423
Boss.

136
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:48,588
Sorry about that.

137
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,040
I saw he went to the bathroom

138
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:04,697
before coming into the meeting.

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,000
He probably forgot to put his pants back on.

140
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,760
Come on. The deal hasn’t fallen through yet.

141
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,130
It hasn’t

142
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,810
but they indefinitely postpone the final decision.

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,136
Everyone, can you excuse us?

144
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,899
I want to talk to him in private.

145
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:28,957
Here.

146
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,077
Thank you, Ten.

147
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,890
Here are your pants, Boss.

148
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,841
I’m sorry for disappointing you today.

149
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,197
You don’t need to apologize.

150
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,002
It’s my fault.

151
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,270
I am the reason you are fighting with your daughter.

152
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:12,725
If there’s anything I can do to help you,

153
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:13,760
please let me know.

154
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:19,339
Do you mean it, Hengney?

155
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,482
Yes.

156
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,930
Can you come to have lunch at my house this Saturday?

157
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,954
Sure.

158
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,145
Huh?!

159
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:34,275
How did it end up this way?

160
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,195
Aim, sweetie.

161
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,230
Please come out and eat something.

162
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:59,491
You haven’t eaten anything.

163
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,232
You must become so skinny.

164
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,550
Aim, listen to me.

165
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,842
Heng is a good man.

166
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,177
I invited him to have lunch with us this Saturday.

167
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,201
Will you come out and meet him?

168
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,490
Then you can decide what you’re going to do.

169
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,600
I will join him for lunch.

170
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:37,748
Thanks, sweetie.

171
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:40,100
If he fails to impress me,

172
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,269
then you can’t meet him again.

173
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:44,611
Okay?

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Sure.

175
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:52,102
He made me fall for him.

176
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,401
I believe that you will like him too.

177
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,416
Thank you, sweetie.

178
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,669
Why are you still up?

179
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,699
Don’t you have to get up early to meet her tomorrow?

180
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,201
Our team’s year-end bonus depends on me.

181
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,751
No one could fall asleep if they were me.

182
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,798
She won’t hate you more than she already did.

183
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
What made you fall for me?

184
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,500
I really want to know.

185
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,348
It will help boost my self-confidence.

186
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:21,767
Do you remember our probation period?

187
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:25,072
Yes.

188
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:29,699
I helped you with the signage, right?

189
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:35,888
Since then,

190
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,137
you started to develop feelings for me.

191
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:42,191
No.

192
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,970
When I saw your lousiness,

193
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:49,302
I felt encouraged.

194
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,149
Mo.

195
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:55,280
I’m serious.

196
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,530
I mean it.

197
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:10,977
Back then,

198
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,099
I just moved into the city.

199
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,059
I couldn’t even go to the office

200
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:19,662
without getting lost.

201
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,915
Who would want to be my friend?

202
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,800
Anyone wanted to have talented friends.

203
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:39,499
You were the only one who hung out with me.

204
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:44,997
You were nice to me

205
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:52,702
when I didn’t even like myself.

206
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,194
But now,

207
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,511
I started to hate you.

208
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Wow!

209
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:32,112
Don’t worry.

210
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,804
We will use this earbud to communicate with you.

211
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,440
We all will help you from here.

212
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,515
Damn.

213
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Wicked.

214
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,225
It’s like I’m in a spy movie.

215
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:49,610
That’s right.

216
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,659
You are Heng Bond 007.

217
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:58,042
You have a mission to win over Cher-aim.

218
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:02,697
Your team’s fate depends on this mission.

219
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,537
Go and win over Cher-aim.

220
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:06,407
Go!

221
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,066
Go!

222
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:07,597
Go.

223
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:08,105
Go.

224
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,125
Go, go, go.

225
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,410
- Stay focused. - Go, go, go.

226
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,528
Come in.

227
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:38,762
Thank you, Boss.

228
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,022
You are dressed up today, Hengney.

229
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,640
You’re exaggerating.

230
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,706
I always dress like this.

231
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,816
Why are you wearing the earbud?

232
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,300
Earbud?

233
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,025
Today is a weekend.

234
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:57,468
I wear it in case I get a call from a client.

235
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,610
Cher-aim,

236
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,900
Heng is here.

237
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:05,385
Why don’t you come down and say hi?

238
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,112
This is her favorite outfit.

239
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,496
You said the T-shirt is a limited edition, right?

240
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:30,056
Yes.

241
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,240
But your outfit looks so plain.

242
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,472
Heng, stay cool.

243
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,792
Everyone, stay cool.

244
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,346
You can score points with her during lunch.

245
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:45,659
Try this.

246
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
This too.

247
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:48,885
Try the egg too.

248
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:50,851
Is it a salted egg?

249
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:51,976
Yes.

250
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:58,174
Your cooking is so good.

251
00:17:58,663 --> 00:17:59,667
You could open a restaurant.

252
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:00,691
Have you gained weight?

253
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:05,699
Aim, sweetie.

254
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:07,344
You shouldn’t ask him that kind of question.

255
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,368
It’s okay.

256
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,490
I think she’s just joking.

257
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,900
How much is your salary?

258
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:18,826
Cher-aim!

259
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,210
It’s okay.

260
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,844
My salary excluding the commission fee is around 30,000 baht.

261
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:25,808
Your salary is so low.

262
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:28,442
Your partner will be starving.

263
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:34,453
She criticizes his looks, work, and personal life.

264
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:40,402
I think she intends to mess you up.

265
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:42,882
If talking nicely to her is not working,

266
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:44,611
then we need to use plan B.

267
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,555
Cher-aim, I bought a cake for you.

268
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
It looks yummy.

269
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,389
See? My cake has helped me

270
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:07,188
win over several girls’ hearts.

271
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,411
I’ll share it with Nappo.

272
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Boss.

273
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,099
Who is Nappo?

274
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,611
Is she your housekeeper?

275
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:24,718
A dog.

276
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:29,413
Cher-aim’s dog.

277
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:30,994
Dad!

278
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,453
Nappo spit it out and shook its head.

279
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:36,945
She said even her dog doesn’t want to eat your cake.

280
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:40,488
You, little brat!

281
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:41,530
Damn.

282
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:42,125
What?

283
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,560
What room do they live in?

284
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,540
- Chicha, calm down. - I can’t take it anymore.

285
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:46,814
Thua, calm down.

286
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:47,842
Let me go!

287
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,481
Everyone, please calm down.

288
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:50,611
Calm down.

289
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,616
She said it didn’t want to eat it.

290
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,271
It was so delicious when I ate it.

291
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:56,949
Heng, keep going.

292
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,125
Cheers.

293
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:02,936
Cheers.

294
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,404
Boss.

295
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:08,896
Can I use your bathroom?

296
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,051
Sure. It’s right there.

297
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:30,629
I want to go home.

298
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,099
Heng, calm down.

299
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:37,647
Don’t forget you’ve been working as a salesman for ten years.

300
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:40,302
Don’t let this kid mess up your mind.

301
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:42,757
You are right.

302
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:48,190
I’m Heng Bond 007.

303
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:49,648
There’s nothing that I can’t do.

304
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:51,285
That’s right.

305
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:52,502
Heng.

306
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,226
What?

307
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,185
I look through her Instagram.

308
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:56,235
So?

309
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,349
She has a similar lifestyle to yours.

310
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:00,782
Her lifestyle is cool like mine?

311
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:01,761
She’s a geek.

312
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:03,042
She plays games all day.

313
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,151
Why don’t you ask her to play games with you?

314
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:08,302
You two may hit it off.

315
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,949
She doesn’t even want to look at me.

316
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:16,263
Hey.

317
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:17,514
Do you hear me?

318
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Hello?

319
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,075
No!

320
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:33,977
What should I do?

321
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,537
Cher-aim, do you want to play games with me?

322
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,696
I heard that kids these days like playing games.

323
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:01,604
So I want to play games with her.

324
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,210
If you don’t want to, it’s totally fine.

325
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,490
You asked me to play games with you.

326
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,920
Do you know how to play it?

327
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I know a little about it.

328
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,442
I’m my school’s e-sport champion.

329
00:22:25,382 --> 00:22:26,822
If you aren’t scared, we can try it.

330
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,065
Deal.

331
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,477
Here, Dad.

332
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,588
I played the game with her a few times.

333
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,502
I always got shot down.

334
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:03,352
She was annoyed by it.

335
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,508
It’s okay. We will play as a team this time.

336
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,786
I’ll help you.

337
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,903
Don’t try to help.

338
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Just stay out of my way.

339
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,598
If Heng is still in the house, it means

340
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,394
our plan to use video games is working.

341
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:35,506
He can’t compete with kids these days in video games.

342
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:38,757
Don’t worry.

343
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,402
He might be a loser in the real world.

344
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:46,100
But in the virtual world,

345
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,099
he is as strong as a mountain.

346
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,242
Everyone in the virtual world calls him…

347
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:29,220
Mountain Sniper.

348
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:52,030
That’s the world’s championship runner-up team from last year.

349
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,465
What are they doing here?

350
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:58,327
Boss, watch out.

351
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Follow me.

352
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,312
Aim, watch out.

353
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:24,351
Dad.

354
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,810
Boss.

355
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,605
Dad.

356
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:34,736
Boss.

357
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,471
Aim, I can’t keep going anymore.

358
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:39,817
Heng.

359
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:40,998
Yes.

360
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:42,725
Please take care of my daughter.

361
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:44,524
Yes, Boss.

362
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,631
Dad.

363
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:49,973
Dad.

364
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:52,961
The only way for us to win this game.

365
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:56,014
We need to work together.

366
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:29,494
Yes!

367
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Yay!

368
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:44,155
What?!

369
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:48,198
What?!

370
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,284
Boss. Cher-aim.

371
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,906
I’m sorry. I was into the game too much.

372
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:05,162
The cup Mom gave me as a birthday gift!

373
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:08,549
Shit.

374
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,121
Why did I need to knock this one over?

375
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:11,851
Cher-aim.

376
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:32,296
Get out of my house.

377
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:40,789
After that day,

378
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,068
did Cher-aim say anything about me?

379
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,669
She no longer hid in her room.

380
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,630
That’s good news.

381
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,438
Congratulations, Boss.

382
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:55,157
But I have to do this in exchange.

383
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,134
I can’t talk to you.

384
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:04,054
I can’t look at you.

385
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:06,180
I can’t touch you.

386
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:09,905
I have to act like you don’t exist.

387
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,029
Huh?!

388
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,900
It’s so hard for me, Hengney.

389
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,202
You are in the same room with me

390
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,445
but I even can’t look at you.

391
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Boss,

392
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:22,408
then how are we going to work together?

393
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:24,102
Boss, you can’t do this.

394
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:26,154
Stop talking. I can’t hear anything.

395
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,490
- Boss. - I can’t hear anything.

396
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,047
I have a meeting with Elon tomorrow.

397
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:30,321
I need to prepare for the meeting.

398
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:32,025
I can’t hear anything. Don’t talk to me.

399
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:32,629
Boss.

400
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
Don’t talk to me. I can’t hear anything.

401
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,401
Doraemo, help me.

402
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,659
If he continues to act like this,

403
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,536
he won’t be able to close the deal tomorrow.

404
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:42,982
Please help me, Doraemo.

405
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,103
Help me, Doraemo.

406
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:45,613
Help me.

407
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:47,650
Then there’s only one choice left.

408
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,780
You need to resign from the company.

409
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,694
So our boss can focus on work again.

410
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:53,508
Don’t do this, Mo.

411
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:56,345
Can you go talk to her for me, Mo?

412
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:57,062
Please help me.

413
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,211
Please, please, please.

414
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,248
Heng.

415
00:28:59,641 --> 00:29:00,383
Listen to me.

416
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:03,100
Stop passing the buck.

417
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:05,407
Things end up like this because of you.

418
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,211
Is this my fault?

419
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,795
He is the one who has a crush on me.

420
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,202
Have you ever rejected him?

421
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:16,560
But I made it clear that I…

422
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:19,265
Have you ever clearly told him?

423
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:20,645
You keep running away from the problem.

424
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:22,582
If you made it clear from the beginning,

425
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,528
things wouldn’t have blown out of proportion.

426
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:26,337
Mo.

427
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:29,531
Hey.

428
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:39,623
Heng.

429
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:41,685
Boss tell me to give you this note.

430
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,899
Why didn’t he just email it to you?

431
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,312
Boss.

432
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:34,604
Shh!

433
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,331
In this world,

434
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:40,767
my name is Emerald.

435
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:43,601
I’m the prince of the Elves.

436
00:30:45,817 --> 00:30:46,817
You are…

437
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,148
the knight of the mountains.

438
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:54,102
No one can’t stop us.

439
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:03,020
(See you at the sacred tree of Cefiro tonight.)

440
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:10,154
Prince.

441
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,560
Let’s go on an adventure together.

442
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,442
I miss you so much.

443
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:40,746
Congratulations.

444
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,537
You receive bonus points.

445
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:45,426
If you two change your status to “in a relationship”,

446
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,114
you will receive the legendary sword

447
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,204
and double points.

448
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,750
Oh.

449
00:31:58,634 --> 00:32:00,296
It’s the legendary sword.

450
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,190
What do you want to do?

451
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:05,466
Will you be my boyfriend?

452
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:10,505
Boss.

453
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,282
Boss.

454
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
No, no.

455
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:17,697
No, I don’t want to hear it.

456
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:18,931
- Boss. - I don’t want to hear it. No.

457
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:19,576
Boss.

458
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,770
- No, I don’t want to hear it. Don’t say it. - Boss, you need to listen to me.

459
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:27,602
I have something important to tell you.

460
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,303
I’m really sorry.

461
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:36,231
Why?

462
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,490
Is it because of my daughter?

463
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:43,317
No.

464
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,154
Is it because of me?

465
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:52,705
Because I’m a man?

466
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,161
No.

467
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:00,527
Boss.

468
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:07,802
I only see you as someone I respect.

469
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,819
Every time our team has a problem,

470
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:16,211
you always protect us.

471
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:22,294
Every time…

472
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,540
I make a mistake,

473
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:33,100
you point it out to me.

474
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:39,949
You teach me how to be better at my work.

475
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:49,607
Boss.

476
00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:00,160
I’m so lucky to have you as my boss.

477
00:34:08,788 --> 00:34:10,211
Why don’t you choose me?

478
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:13,200
Why don’t you choose me?

479
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,804
Why, Hengney?

480
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:23,697
Because I don’t love you.

481
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,210
Boss.

482
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,260
I want us…

483
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,710
to go back to being what we used to be.

484
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:57,402
Thank you so much for falling for me.

485
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,066
Dad.

486
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,625
What’s wrong, Dad?

487
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:16,453
I’m heartbroken.

488
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:23,897
Heng rejects me.

489
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
I’m here.

490
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,601
I’m sorry.

491
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:31,595
Are you disappointed?

492
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:36,349
To see this side of me.

493
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:05,031
It’s okay.

494
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:21,545
You didn’t do anything wrong.

495
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
I love you, too.

496
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,422
Are you okay?

497
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:46,601
I told him.

498
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:57,334
You reject a perfect guy like him.

499
00:39:58,111 --> 00:39:59,711
What kind of person are you looking for?

500
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,976
I want someone I feel comfortable being with.

501
00:40:58,894 --> 00:40:59,894
Hey.

502
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,890
Why do you suddenly become quiet?

503
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,979
You know there’s no such a person in this world.

504
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,402
If you have nothing else to say,

505
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:20,268
I’ll go drink water.

506
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,045
Wait.

507
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:23,607
Huh?

508
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:25,995
Do you want to drink beer with me?

509
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,702
I’ll keep it.

510
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:19,022
Until we both pass the probation.

511
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:21,115
Then we come to celebrate together.

512
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,560
What if we both don’t pass?

513
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,552
I won’t open it.

514
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,333
Until we both…

515
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,760
get to work together again.

516
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,607
I thought you already drank it.

517
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:46,783
No.

518
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,882
We promised to celebrate together.

519
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,010
Since then,

520
00:43:00,152 --> 00:43:04,063
I haven’t had a chance to celebrate with you.

521
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:14,413
Hey.

522
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,220
Wait.

523
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:19,367
The beer is eight years old.

524
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,903
Is it still edible?

525
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,025
You’re right.

526
00:43:27,345 --> 00:43:28,345
I don’t know.

527
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:31,699
Then you drink it first.

528
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:36,114
Me?

529
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:53,426
No?

530
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,610
No.

531
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,865
I think it’s not edible.

532
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,391
You’re right.

533
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:06,096
It’s okay.

534
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
I brought another can.

535
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:14,303
This time, I’ll drink it first.

536
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,019
Don’t get drunk.

537
00:44:18,794 --> 00:44:19,794
Sure.

538
00:44:22,512 --> 00:44:23,936
Wow.

539
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:25,511
The sound.

540
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:39,943
Here.

541
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,365
Here.

542
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,690
That’s enough for me.

543
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:16,392
Go easy.

544
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,930
On the night we had beers together,

545
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,900
the moon was beautiful like tonight.

546
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,137
But I think tonight,

547
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,110
it’s more beautiful.

548
00:45:32,804 --> 00:45:37,158
You make every day like a wedding day

549
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:39,534
I look into your eyes under the moonlight

550
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,534
Only you and me

551
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,958
No need for a special gift

552
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:52,060
Just being you, it’s the best thing already

553
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,595
I got a call from the head office in Japan.

554
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,570
They want me to go there for a one-week training.

555
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:04,593
I need to ask you guys to take care of our team.

556
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:05,617
Please help me.

557
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:06,817
I am weak.

558
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:07,897
In my head,

559
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:10,742
it’s full of memories about Hengney.

560
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,170
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

561
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:15,260
Hello, everyone.

562
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,844
This is my first album.

563
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:19,081
The song title is great.

00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,543
“Can you call me darling instead?”

565
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:23,231
Ten has feelings for you?

566
00:46:23,425 --> 00:46:24,205
You are imagining things.

567
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:27,200
I saw my photo on his screen lock.

568
00:46:27,482 --> 00:46:29,425
It’s like a déjà vu of our boss’s incident.

569
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Did you see it?

570
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:31,921
I didn’t see anything.

571
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,371
You really saw it.

572
00:46:33,426 --> 00:46:36,717
Why is this happening to me again?
