1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,159
I think Mo is just shy.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,160
If there’s anything, you can always talk to me.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,320
Hengney.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,800
Who’s “Hengney”?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,376
It’s a nickname used among lovers.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,000
Someone kissed my friend.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,200
It’s a genuine kiss.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,640
I made you a lunch box.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,040
Boss, can’t you see that Heng is uncomfortable?

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,320
Let’s fight this fight fairly.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
As someone who also likes Heng.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,800
Did you move in with me and cook for me because you wanted something from me?

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,040
I’m sorry.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,320
I can’t be your friend anymore.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,480
I’m sorry.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,959
Mo, come on.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,040
We will be going on a company outing

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,816
Does anyone have any questions?

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
I do!

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,280
I want to know if I can sleep with Mo.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
What’s wrong with you?

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,640
I can sleep with anyone

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
but him.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,240
No, Mo!

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Please be my roommate.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,440
I want to be your roommate.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,559
That’s your problem.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,040
I want to be your roommate, Mo.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Let’s be roommates.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,480
I don’t want to.

31
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,879
I want to sleep with you.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
I don’t want to.

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
No.

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,960
Heng shall not be anyone’s roommate except…

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
A draw.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,920
Oh.

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,720
Let’s do a draw.

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,640
Sounds great, Boss.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Pick one.

40
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,880
No exception for the Boss.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,680
(Come on.)

42
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,479
(I’ve played it out this way.)

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,720
(Fate will bring us together somehow.)

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,439
I can’t believe it.

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,680
We ended up together.

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,560
This must be destiny.

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Yes, dear?

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,560
Dad has arrived at the hotel.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,920
Who’s my roommate?

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,240
I sleep alone.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,359
Of course, I would sleep alone.

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,440
Oh, no.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
I don’t want my team members to feel uncomfortable.

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Mo.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,400
Breakfast tickets.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,320
The schedules are in the group chat.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,080
Thank you.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Mo!

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,360
Hold on.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
Wait up, Mo.

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,560
Wait a second.

62
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Wait.

63
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Can I swap the room with Ten?

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
I really want to be your roommate, Mo.

65
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,960
Please?

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I told you already.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
That I will only talk about work.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Mo.

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Fine.

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,680
Do you think you can avoid me forever?

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,880
We’ll see.

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Hengney.

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Here you are.

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,960
Let’s get ready for the schedules.

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,880
Hello everyone.

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Welcome to our outing.

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,799
It’s me and Meow.

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
That’s right, everyone.

79
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,599
We will be your MC throughout this trip.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,079
Everyone, listen to me carefully.

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,000
Today,

82
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,839
to get everyone to know each other better,

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,439
we will be playing games.

84
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,920
The first game is called…

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,840
Called?

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
“Guess who I am.”

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,520
The rule is each of you will come on stage

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,999
and impersonate someone in our department.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,760
The others will guess who that person is.

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,239
Understood?

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Clap if you have understood.

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I’m not sure if you could tell.

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,079
Heng! Mo!

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,279
What are you guys talking about?

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,319
Fill me in!

96
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,440
Promise I won't tell anyone.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,040
Who is this?

98
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,240
So hard!

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
Meow!

100
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,840
Come on, guys! I’m not a nosy person!

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
Boss!

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
I’m sorry I’m late.

103
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,320
There was an issue with the subway.

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
It’s not that I was playing games all night

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,879
It’s not my fault, Boss!

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,920
Point to the person in 3…2…1…

107
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
Heng!

108
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,840
Guys, if you drink a coffee, please throw your coffee cup away.

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
The last person to leave the office,

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
please turn off the PC.

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Alright, everyone.

112
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,160
Get ready and point.

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,840
1…2…3…

114
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
Mo!

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,359
For the next activity,

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,880
as this is the outing of the sales department,

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,600
we will have you pair up and ‘sell’ your friend.

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,840
Then we will have a vote for which friend we want to buy.

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,440
Yay!

120
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,840
Those on stage.

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,999
Heng and Mo, are you ready?

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

123
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,400
Ready? Go!

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
This is Newyear.

125
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,159
Though he is young,

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
he has the responsibility of an adult.

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,360
He never came late.

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,080
Unlike a certain adult with a kid's brain.

129
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Aw!

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,520
Our boss might seem intimidating

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,520
but he is a kind daddy.

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
You can talk to him about anything.

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,920
He doesn’t run away from problems.

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
Newyear is reasonable.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,096
You don’t need to repeat yourself for him to understand.

136
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,080
Our boss is very forgiving.

137
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,880
Not only about jobs,

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,880
he will listen to all your complaints.

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,199
Newyear is not a pusher.

140
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,520
Boss is not childish.

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,880
Heng and Mo.

142
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,159
Please go easy on each other.

143
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,480
The game is to promote your friend,

144
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
not to diss your friend.

145
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
Calm down.

146
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,959
In this next game,

147
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,239
we will pair up for a treasure hunt.

148
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,080
The person in front will be blindfolded.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,559
The person behind will have their mouth covered.

150
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,480
They need to find a way to communicate with each other.

151
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Oops.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,519
Mo, I know you can’t speak

153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
but guide me more clearly.

154
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,120
Let’s do this.

155
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,279
If I’m on the right track, just stay still.

156
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,520
If I’m on the wrong way

157
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,160
then find some way to tell me. Okay?

158
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,960
Alright, so now we go right, right?

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Ouch!

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Can’t you find a more subtle way?

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,039
Mo, let me ask you straight.

162
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,399
When you said you didn’t want to be my friend,

163
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
did you mean it?

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
Mo, I’m asking you honestly.

165
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Why don’t you want to be my friend?

166
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,079
Why?

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,520
I don’t get it.

168
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Is it because I leave cooking to you entirely?

169
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Or is it because I didn’t take tissues out of my pocket before I do the laundry?

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,560
Because I didn't lift the toilet seat up when I peed?

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,680
Mo! So what is it?

172
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,520
Why don’t you want to be my friend?

173
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,240
Just tell me straight.

174
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Aw!

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,880
Mo!

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,200
What’s wrong with you?

177
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,400
We’ve got our winners.

178
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,560
Heng and Mo!

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,160
Yay!

180
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,640
Well done.

181
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
Good job!

182
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,880
Thank you, Boss.

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,759
Is the outing fun?

184
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Yes.

185
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,600
Thank you, Boss.

186
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Mo.

187
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,360
Let me ask you something.

188
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,960
Are you and Heng on bad terms?

189
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
No.

190
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,240
We just don’t talk much lately.

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,999
You guys are friends so let’s not fight.

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,679
I notice that you guys usually bicker

193
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,679
but you guys have been so quiet.

194
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,896
Hurry up and straighten it out.

195
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,360
You guys are friends.

196
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:50,600
Don’t stay mad for too long.

197
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Understood?

198
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Yes.

199
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,280
Ten.

200
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Ten.

201
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Ten.

202
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Ten.

203
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,239
Ten passed out! Help!

204
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,320
Help!

205
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,960
Ten!

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,000
Ten!

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
What happened?

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Ten passed out.

209
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,280
Ten!

210
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,240
Please call an ambulance.

211
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Ten!

212
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,560
Ten!

213
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Call the ambulance.

214
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,719
I left my phone in the room.

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,280
Does anyone have their phone with them?

216
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,079
Please run the schedule on my behalf.

217
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Don’t go to bed after 10.

218
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:31,296
Don’t have more than one glass of drinks.

219
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,200
Go on.

220
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Go rest peacefully.

221
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,079
Get a lot of rest.

222
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,879
Don’t worry. I got this.

223
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
Don’t forget about what I said.

224
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
His condition is pretty bad.

225
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,920
He took this outing very seriously.

226
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,840
I saw him skipping sleep preparing for it.

227
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,200
No wonder he passes out.

228
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,200
Hey.

229
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,920
What?

230
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,439
This means I can go sleep in your room.

231
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,200
Mo.

232
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
Can I sleep in your room?

233
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Heng.

234
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Let’s have a word in private.

235
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Follow me.

236
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,080
Alright, Boss.

237
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
Wow.

238
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Boss.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,760
What did you want to discuss?

240
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Boss!

241
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,480
Marry me.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Boss!

243
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,600
Boss.

244
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
I…

245
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,600
I said this to my wife here.

246
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,320
Come on, Boss.

247
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,280
Does this mean you proposed to her here?

248
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Yes.

249
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,160
I also wrapped up my first deal here.

250
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
So it’s a memorable place for me.

251
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,640
I didn't know there was such a place in this hotel.

252
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Our wedding was held here.

253
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,920
It sounds romantic like one in fairytales.

254
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,400
I’m glad that Hengney likes it.

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
I have decided.

256
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,600
If I were to get married again,

257
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
I would do it here.

258
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,040
How did we get here?

259
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,320
Hengney.

260
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Yes?

261
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,520
My daughter loves her mother dearly.

262
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,720
So I have decided to wait
until she’s graduated.

263
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,520
Then I will tell her about…

264
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
us.

265
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
About us?

266
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,840
Wait for me.

267
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
I promise

268
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,320
I will take you here and put a ring on you.

269
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Boss.

270
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,520
This area.

271
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,480
Tear down all of these.

272
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,720
Get rid of that too.

273
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,480
Bring them all down.

274
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Mr. Man?

275
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,159
Oh, Mr. Kongdech.

276
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,200
Hello.

277
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Hello.

278
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,280
Excuse me, I overheard you saying bringing the place down.

279
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,960
What does that mean?

280
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,239
Well, someone wanted to buy my hotel and turn it into a shopping center.

281
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Pardon?

282
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
When is that?

283
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Probably within a month or two.

284
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Honestly, I didn’t want to sell.

285
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,600
But my hands are really tied.

286
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
What’s wrong?

287
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,960
Hey.

288
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,960
You guys haven’t talked things over, right?

289
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,200
I have nothing to say to him.

290
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,400
You’re all sad.

291
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,200
Don’t be sad.

292
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
Take some.

293
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,040
Don’t be sad.

294
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
I’ll be back.

295
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,960
Boss, here’s your BBQ.

296
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,280
At my wedding,

297
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
they also served BBQ.

298
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,480
But there’s no more of that now.

299
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Newyear.

300
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
Boss looks stressed.

301
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,960
Do you know anything that would cheer him up?

302
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,920
Well.

303
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,399
There’s one.

304
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
I used to do it at my freshmen' welcoming event.

305
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,280
It will definitely cheer him up.

306
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,480
Are you sure?

307
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Yes.

308
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Trust me.

309
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,960
Alright, everyone.

310
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:05,360
This is “The King” game.

311
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,719
The rule is I will give this to each of you.

312
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,639
If you get the stick with a crown symbol,

313
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,320
you can order others to do whatever you want.

314
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,000
They can’t refuse your order.

315
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Alright.

316
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Yay!

317
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,760
I’m the king.

318
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,120
I want number 4 to drink it all up.

319
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,840
Who’s number 4?

320
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,920
I’m number 4.

321
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Boss.

322
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,759
If you’re uncomfortable, it’s okay.

323
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
You can just have a sip.

324
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
Wow!

325
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,240
Amazing!

326
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,680
You’re so cool, Boss!

327
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Let’s pick a new one.

328
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Yes!

329
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,320
I’m the king.

330
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Then, I will have number 7

331
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,120
spill one of their secrets.

332
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,480
I’m number 7.

333
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,560
Oh no.

334
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,960
I actually have a secret.

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,320
One that I have been hiding for so long.

336
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,120
Since this hotel is about to close down,

337
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,216
I will call my daughter and let her know now.

338
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,120
Boss.

339
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,000
Please don’t do that.

340
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,280
We’re just doing it for fun.

341
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Right?

342
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,519
Yeah.

343
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,320
Let’s not bother other people, Boss.

344
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Really?

345
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
Guys.

346
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,600
Huh?

347
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
Let’s pick a new one.

348
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,560
Let’s do that. Random it again.

349
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
I’m the king!

350
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,200
Boohoo!

351
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Then I’ll dare number 2.

352
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,440
That’s not you, right, Boss?

353
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Almost.

354
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
Huh!

355
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,000
I got number 2.

356
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,480
Then I will have number 2

357
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
and…

358
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,600
number 6 go into the tent and talk for 5 minutes.

359
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,040
I’m number 6.

360
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
Wow.

361
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,000
Here we go.

362
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Mo.

363
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,320
Are you going to stay silent for these 5 minutes?

364
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,280
Dude.

365
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,280
Boss asked me to marry him.

366
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,200
He wants to have the wedding here

367
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,760
before it’s torn down.

368
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Congratulations.

369
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Mo.

370
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,040
Come on.

371
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,080
I’m so stressed out.

372
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,840
Help me out, Mo.

373
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,520
Please, Mo?

374
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Can you at least let me stay in your room to ease my mind just for tonight?

375
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,039
Please, Mo?

376
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,160
Please?

377
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Why?

378
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,280
Don’t you like Boss?

379
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
It’s not that.

380
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,400
I respect him.

381
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,960
So what’s the problem?

382
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,920
I’ve never seen him as anything else apart from my boss.

383
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
You can’t even see him as anything else.

384
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,320
But you want me to see you as a friend.

385
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,760
You’re so selfish, Heng.

386
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Mo.

387
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
How did it go?

388
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,840
Meow?

389
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,320
Yeah?

390
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Ten called.

391
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Uh?

392
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,680
Hello, Ten.

393
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh, we’ve run through the activities.

394
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,720
We had dinner and are now practicing meditation.

395
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Oh, Ten. Don’t worry.

396
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,200
Rest at ease.

397
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
Do not worry.

398
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,600
I will take care of the secular world for you.

399
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,119
I mean, I will take care of it here for you.

400
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,560
Good night.

401
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
Alright.

402
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,080
Come on.

403
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,679
Bring more booze.

404
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,080
Keep it coming. Bring them on.

405
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,320
Cheers!

406
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,480
Yay!

407
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Woohoo!

408
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,520
All out!

409
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Yay!

410
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,600
Boss, what time is it now?

411
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Hey!

412
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Hey!

413
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
Hey!

414
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,520
Calm down, Mo.

415
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,360
Calm down, calm down.

416
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,240
Calm down, Mo.

417
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,080
Calm down.

418
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,800
Calm down.

419
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Calm down.

420
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,520
Last night, we were playing games.

421
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And…

422
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
how did we end up like this?

423
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,080
I know what happened.

424
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,280
What do you mean?

425
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,200
This is your room.

426
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,600
So cute.

427
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,560
I will go back to my room.

428
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Wait.

429
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,760
Will you sleep in my room tonight?

430
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,480
I’m scared of ghosts.

431
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,880
But Boss is waiting for me.'

432
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,560
Are you prioritizing him over me?

433
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,440
Stop it.

434
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
It’s hot here.

435
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,880
Look into my eyes.

436
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,800
I will take it off for you.

437
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Hey!

438
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,400
I think you should stop watching.

439
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,400
Don’t you want to know how it ends?

440
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,359
I don’t.

441
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,599
I want to erase this video.

442
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,400
I don’t want to.

443
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,160
I do.

444
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,360
I don’t want to.

445
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Mo.

446
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,320
Mo.

447
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
Is Heng with you?

448
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,520
Mo.

449
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,959
If he finds us in this state,

450
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,959
he will definitely kill me.

451
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,200
What do we do?

452
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Lower your voice.

453
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,120
Mo, open the door for me.

454
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,680
Your shoes.

455
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
My shorts.

456
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,880
Go hide in the bathroom.

457
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,000
Go hide in the bathroom for now.

458
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
One second, Boss.

459
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,200
I’m in the bathroom.

460
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,480
Are you done?

461
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,680
One second, Boss.

462
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Heng.

463
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,800
He’s not in my room.

464
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,456
He didn’t come back to the room last night.

465
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,440
I thought he would be here.

466
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,080
No.

467
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,600
But hmm.

468
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Hmm?

469
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,239
Hmm?

470
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,800
Hmm?

471
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,040
Oh!

472
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,600
Last night, a drunk person lurked around my balcony.

473
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,120
Right.

474
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,239
Heng was drunk last night.

475
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,320
He might have climbed up and slept on your balcony.

476
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Heng.

477
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Heng.

478
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,880
I don’t see him, Mo.

479
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,680
Help me look for him.

480
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
Oh, right! I have to spill this tea.

481
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,359
Breaking news.

482
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,280
Heng didn’t go back to his room last night.

483
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
No idea where he went.

484
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,880
Rooftop?

485
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,560
What a crappy day is this?!

486
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
I woke up this morning and I was alone in my room.

487
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,320
I've called him several times but he’s not picking up.

488
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
How is it?

489
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Mo!

490
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,600
Everyone, I’m here!

491
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,080
I couldn’t find him.

492
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Mo!

493
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,280
You have to notice me this time.

494
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,919
Shall we ask the receptionist?

495
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,719
Perhaps they know something.

496
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,320
Good idea.

497
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,856
Then I will go the other way and have a look.

498
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I’ll leave it to you.

499
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,040
Meow! Mo! Everyone!

500
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
A dog?

501
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
Don’t take that with you!

502
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,520
Shoo!

503
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Shoo!

504
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,160
They’re gone.

505
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
They’re all gone.

506
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
Gone.

507
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,840
My only hope is gone.

508
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,160
What should I do?

509
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,720
All his stuff is here.

510
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,080
I think Heng must still be here.

511
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Let’s do this.

512
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,600
Let’s go through the CCTV.

513
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,040
You can’t do that.

514
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,959
That would be a violation of the other guests’ rights.

515
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,359
But this is an important matter.

516
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
No need for arguments.

517
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,040
The thing is the CCTVs are broken.

518
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,960
Since the hotel is about to be closed down, I didn’t bother to fix them.

519
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Then, I’ll try calling him again.

520
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Guys, do you hear something from over there?

521
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,960
You’re right.

522
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,439
That’s Heng’s ringtone.

523
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,240
Why does it come from your room?

524
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,879
Are you sure?

525
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,960
I’m confident.

526
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,200
But…

527
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,400
Mo.

528
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,920
It’s ringing loudly.

529
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,560
Open the door.

530
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Alright.

531
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
What are you doing?

532
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
My legs are tired.

533
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,160
The sound is gone.

534
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Right.

535
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Where did it go?

536
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,999
It might come from next door.

537
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,160
Shall we check the next-door room?

538
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,560
Fine, Let’s go.

539
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Good.

540
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Hey!

541
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Here it is.

542
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,359
It’s really Heng’s phone.

543
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,520
Why is it with you?

544
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,000
I was drunk last night.

545
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,320
I probably took his phone by mistake.

546
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Shall we look through his phone?

547
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:04,840
Maybe we can find some clues.

548
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Good idea.

549
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,640
Everyone,

550
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,240
I have found a clue about Heng.

551
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,000
This way.

552
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,200
Let’s go.

553
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,920
Where is it, Newyear?

554
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,296
Why don’t you tell us what you’ve found?

555
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,840
Over there.

556
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,160
Let’s go.

557
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Mo.

558
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Mo!

559
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,960
I’m here.

560
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Hey!

561
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,400
Mo!

562
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,320
I’m here.

563
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
Over here!

564
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
Hey!

565
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,200
Mo, hurry up.

566
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Mo.

567
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,480
Mo.

568
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,160
Mo!

569
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Where are you going?

570
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
Guys!

571
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,280
I’m here!

572
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,360
The staff found shoes that looked like Heng's.

573
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,840
Hey, hold on.

574
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
These are…

575
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,240
These are Heng’s socks.

576
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,959
I can recognize them.

577
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Why are they here?

578
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Boss!

579
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:31,200
Did someone attack Heng

580
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,320
and bury him here to hide the crime?

581
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,120
Oh, Heng.

582
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,920
Hengney.

583
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,840
Oh, Heng.

584
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,360
I promise I will find you.

585
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,120
I will punish those who hurt you.

586
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,640
Hengney!

587
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Where are you, Heng?

588
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,760
Heng.

589
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:53,800
Boss, let me help you.

590
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,880
I’ll do it.

591
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,039
Heng.

592
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,600
Hengney.

593
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,760
I promise I will take your body home.

594
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,959
Hurry up and dig.

595
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,279
No, Hengney.

596
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,760
Why are you buried vertically like this?

597
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Heng!

598
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
What should I do?

599
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,520
Everything I threw down

600
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,080
was taken away by the dog.

601
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,320
Fine!

602
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Heng!

603
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Mo!

604
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,480
How did you end up like this?

605
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
Take my cardigan.

606
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,400
Thanks.

607
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,880
I was just trying to get help.

608
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,120
I was calling you so many times.

609
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,560
Didn’t you hear?

610
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,800
I did.

611
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
But…

612
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,639
I couldn’t stray away from them.

613
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,400
Plus, if they see you like this,

614
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,120
it would lead to me eventually.

615
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,800
Just say I was drunk and came up here.

616
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,720
Who would believe that?

617
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,840
I have an idea.

618
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,520
Let’s do this.

619
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Yeah?

620
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,920
Just go down

621
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,839
and pretend to be drunk and fall asleep in a toilet somewhere.

622
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,400
Alright?

623
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Let’s go.

624
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,480
Hold on.

625
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
What?

626
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,200
I forgot to tell you.

627
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,480
The door is broken.

628
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,080
It’s locked from inside you can’t open it.

629
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,920
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

630
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
I didn’t know how to tell you.

631
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,600
If I had known, I wouldn’t have ended up like this, Mo.

632
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,920
What do we do?

633
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,400
What do we do?

634
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,640
We have to tell them.

635
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,800
Hengney.

636
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
Can we find him?

637
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Guys.

638
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Guys.

639
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
Ten!

640
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,560
What are you doing here, Ten?

641
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,640
I heard Heng is missing.

642
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,320
I asked to be discharged early.

643
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,160
Yes.

644
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,160
I was worried something bad might happen to Heng.

645
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,679
You should take care of yourself first!

646
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,240
I’m fine.

647
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,080
No!

648
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,760
Meow, I can do it.

649
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,159
I will help you find Heng.

650
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,680
Will you be okay?

651
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,800
Ten.

652
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,200
He’s stuck, Boss.

653
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,279
Everyone, leave it to me.

654
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,360
I can do it.

655
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
Everyone, leave it to me.

656
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,440
Answer the phone, Meow.

657
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Hey!

658
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
What is it?

659
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
The battery died.

660
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,800
It’s funny.

661
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,960
I used to wish…

662
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
for us to be alone like this again.

663
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,280
But I didn’t think it would turn out like this.

664
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,320
So it’s because of you.

665
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
I’m sorry.

666
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,760
Forget it.

667
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
I should have known that the door was probably broken.

668
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,520
Not that.

669
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,960
I mean,

670
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
I’m sorry.

671
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,240
Sorry for asking you to be my friend.

672
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,520
I understand now that it’s impossible.

673
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,320
Just like how I can no longer

674
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,760
look at Boss the same.

675
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,680
If you get it now,

676
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,680
then leave me alone.

677
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,960
But I still want you as my friend.

678
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,800
For me,

679
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,320
I don’t know what I am to you.

680
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,400
But I’m so happy when I’m with you.

681
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Mo.

682
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
I will ask you one last time.

683
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,520
Will you move back in with me?

684
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,960
(Why did you push yourself too hard, Ten?)

685
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Boss?

686
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,680
Huh? Grandma?

687
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,320
Grandma is waving at me.

688
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,720
Grandma.

689
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,080
Grandma is waving at me.

690
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,040
Boss!

691
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
I’m here.

692
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,520
Boss.

693
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,600
Hey!

694
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,240
Dude, we’re safe now!

695
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Heng!

696
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,960
Grandma.

697
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Hengney.

698
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,879
Wait for me there.

699
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,320
I will rescue you right now!

700
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,480
Grandma, you’re so kind.

701
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,360
You’re waving at me.

702
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
I’m sorry.

703
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Hengney!

704
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,880
We were worried about you.

705
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Where have you been?

706
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,480
Why are you two here, Mo?

707
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,440
How did you get up here?

708
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
I…

709
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,960
I was drunk and fell asleep here.

710
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,639
Mo was looking for me.

711
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,720
So we both were locked out.

712
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,360
Boss. Meow.

713
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
I see.

714
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,719
Why did you all fall for his story?

715
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
What is not to believe?

716
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,719
Many people don’t remember what they do when they are drunk.

717
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Are you okay?

718
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,640
I’m alright, Boss.

719
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:51,040
See? I told you he’s still in the hotel.

720
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,280
All his stuff is still here.

721
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,000
It’s good that you’re alright.

722
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Yes.

723
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,239
I thought you were dead.

724
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,000
I’m not dead.

725
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:59,496
- Have you eaten anything? - We’ve been looking for you everywhere.

726
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,999
No, I’m starving.

727
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Is that so?

728
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,999
Just get some rest.

729
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
I will pack up for you.

730
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,480
Boss.

731
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,120
Yeah?

732
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,960
I’m sorry

733
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,280
for making this trip all chaotic.

734
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,960
No, Hengney.

735
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,360
It’s not your fault at all.

736
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,400
Do you know what I think?

737
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,760
I think that the universe…

738
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,000
is trying to tell me something.

739
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,120
What do you mean, Boss?

740
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,240
Well, this hotel is closing down and you went missing,

741
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,960
I think it’s trying to tell me

742
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,400
not to keep you...

743
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,800
waiting for me any longer.

744
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Boss.

745
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,040
Why does it circle back to me again?

746
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,480
Hengney, look.

747
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,040
My daughter is calling me right at this moment.

748
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,880
The sign cannot be any clearer.

749
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,080
Hengney.

750
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,600
Yes?

751
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,280
I will tell my daughter about us.

752
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,920
Boss, wait. Don’t tell her just yet.

753
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,039
Mr. Kongdech.

754
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Mr. Man.

755
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,920
Thank you.

756
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,360
Thanks to you,

757
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,960
I don’t have to sell my hotel anymore.

758
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,120
What?

759
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:48,480
Wait, wait.

760
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
Why’s that?

761
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,920
Well, when we were digging to find Heng,

762
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,600
he found the old treasure his great-grandfather had buried.

763
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,760
He doesn’t have to sell the hotel anymore.

764
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,040
Boss.

765
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,440
Does that mean you no longer have to tell your daughter?

766
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,880
I’m happy for you, Boss.

767
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,880
Yay!

768
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,400
Have some water, Dad.

769
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
Thanks, dear.

770
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,320
Did you have fun at the outing?

771
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,920
It was so-so.

772
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,960
Nothing outstanding.

773
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,600
What about the other night?

774
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,800
The other night?

775
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,800
You called me at 3 am the other night.

776
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,359
(What’s the matter, Dad?)

777
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,960
(Why are you calling me at this hour?)

778
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Aim, my dear.

779
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Cher-aim.

780
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,680
I’m…

781
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
in love.

782
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,840
Tell her!

783
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,760
Tell her!

784
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,520
Tell her!

785
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,200
Aim, I want to remarry.

786
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,200
Yay!

787
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,160
Did you hear that?

788
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:13,999
Remarry.

789
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,360
Remarry.

790
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,600
Remarry.

791
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Remarry.

792
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,960
Are you going to remarry?

793
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,080
No, no.

794
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,399
We were playing games and I lost.

795
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,200
When you lose, there’s a punishment.

796
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,799
So the kids told me to call and prank you.

797
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,320
It…it was nothing.

798
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,840
That’s a relief.

799
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,360
I’ve been worried all this time.

800
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
I feel better now.

801
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
Then, what if…

802
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,760
I mean what I said?

803
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Huh?

804
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,480
If I’m thinking about…

805
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,560
remarrying with someone,

806
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,560
would you mind it?

807
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
What?

808
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Hey!

809
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,560
Where’s my house key?

810
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
You left it in my room when you were drunk.

811
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,840
Hey, Mo!

812
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
Here.

813
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,960
Thanks.

814
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,080
Are you sure…

815
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,560
about wanting me to move back?

816
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Yes.

817
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,480
You are not going to be afraid of me

818
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,080
the way you are with Boss, right?

819
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
I’m not afraid.

820
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,920
I won’t be gentle like Boss.

821
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,600
I won’t be a pushover

822
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,200
like when I am with Boss.

823
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,640
This must be my lucky day

824
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,920
That made you turn my way

825
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,280
To win your love, I played my every card

826
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,920
And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

827
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,720
Yes, you are my lucky star

828
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,440
This is the last time

829
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,960
I will do this to you.

830
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,880
After this,

831
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,919
you won’t see this version of me again.

832
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,999
And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

833
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:08,000
La la la la la la la la la la la la

834
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,920
La la la la la la la la la la la la

835
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,799
And now I’m blessed with you in my heart

836
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,080
If you don’t come in now,

837
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,280
you can forget about dinner.

838
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,000
Make me a stuffed omelet!

839
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,160
I’m your boss’s daughter.

840
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,640
Before my mom died, my dad promised her that he would love her forever.

841
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,880
Until this Honey girl showed up.

842
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,960
Are you free this Saturday?

843
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,520
I’m not free this Saturday.

844
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,519
Who ordered you to work? I’ll talk to them.

845
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,240
Please help me, Mo.

846
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,520
Can you go to have dinner with our boss for me?

847
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,039
I’m busy this Saturday.

848
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,639
I think they will celebrate a birthday together.

849
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,760
Anyway, we need to catch them this Saturday.

850
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,320
What the hell is going on today?

851
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,960
What a crappy day!

852
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,040
Happy G-Day.

853
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,480
You remember my birthday?

854
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,296
I won’t sell it no matter how much you’ll pay me.

855
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,240
Because this is a birthday gift from my friend.

856
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,200
This is the first gift you gave me.
