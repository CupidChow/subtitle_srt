00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,260
Hello, I’m from Haran from Okaeri Real Estate.

2
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,120
I’m calling to update you about Mega Sathon.

3
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,290
Yes.

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,370
Meow, any updates on the condo at Ari?

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,850
Oh! Ari?

6
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,870
I forwarded it to Newyear.

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Newyear.

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,000
I took the client to visit 18 rooms

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,590
but he didn’t like any of them.

10
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,970
Don’t worry.

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,630
I’m going to take him to visit the 19th room.

12
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,310
Everyone.

13
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,300
I successfully closed the Mega Sathon deal.

14
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,620
I want to thank everyone for your hard work.

15
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,120
This month,

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,980
our team has the highest sales in the company.

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,980
The top salesperson

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,460
who is the pillar of our team is…

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,770
Heng!

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,270
You played games until dawn again.

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,260
Heng!

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,690
What time is it?

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,440
Why didn’t you wake up earlier?

24
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,610
You’re now 30 but I still have to wake you up for work.

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,410
Do I need to wake you up until your kid’s graduation?

26
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,890
I forgot.

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,780
Who would want to marry you?

28
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,530
You really push my buttons.

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,800
Mom, if you could find someone to marry you,

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,510
then so can I.

31
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,890
Right?

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,180
Heng.

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,370
You, rascal.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,970
I want to thank everyone for your hard work.

35
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,570
This month,

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,890
our team has the highest sales in the company.

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,300
The top salesperson who is
the pillar of our team is…

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,360
Ten, the senior member of our team.

39
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,610
And Heng.

40
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,810
Me?

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,270
You are the most frequently late on the team.

42
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,310
Your sales? Don’t get me started.

43
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,120
Even New Year, our team’s newbie,

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,220
has higher sales than you.

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,976
If you don’t improve yourself by next month,

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,310
I’ll need to take serious action.

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,310
Yes, boss.

48
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,990
I’m screwed.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,970
(For me, the top salesperson in my heart is...

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,210
(Irene.)

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,100
(For this year’s Valentine’s Day, I will ask Irene out for dinner.)

52
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,580
(I’ll find a chance to confess to her that…)

53
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,690
Will you marry me?

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,560
Huh?!

55
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,690
Yes.

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Huh?!

57
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,810
Wonderful.

58
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,700
You two are finally getting married.

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
Why?

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,980
I have had an eye on her for over a year.

61
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,710
He only works here for a few months.

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,700
He got ahead of me and got her.

63
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,980
Why does this kind of thing always happen to me, Thua-Ngok?

64
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,450
Being single is not that bad.

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,980
Look at my sister, Chicha.

66
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,390
She’s having situationships with five people.

67
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,530
She’s chatting with them all day. She almost had a trigger finger.

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,906
Are you trying to make me feel better or boast about it?

69
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,180
Since you are my friend,

70
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,630
I’ll give you one of my dates.

71
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,470
This person is a freeloader just like you.

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,760
I think you two will hit it off.

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,186
Do you want me to help you exchange the contact info?

74
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,350
Shut up.

75
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,760
From now on, I’ll focus on work.

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,420
I won’t pay much attention to love.

77
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,210
I will be the top salesperson.

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:33,820
Cheers.

79
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,220
Cheers.

80
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,330
My Irene.

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,610
Eternal rest grant upon them.

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Heng.

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,630
- May he rest in peace. - Heng.

84
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,730
Father.

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,310
He’s not dead.

86
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,740
No?

87
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,780
No. He’s just drunk.

88
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,170
Heng.

89
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
Mom.

90
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,080
Why did you lock the gate?

91
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,650
You know I always forget to bring the key.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,060
If you don’t stop acting like this,

93
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,310
you need to move out.

94
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,710
Go!

95
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
I won’t go.

96
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,270
If I moved out, who would I sponge off?

97
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,740
Heng! You, bastard.

98
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,210
If you won’t move out, then I’ll leave.

99
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,550
Do as you please. I won’t send you off.

100
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,550
Heng. You, rascal.

101
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Open the door.

102
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,450
Yes!

103
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,970
I won’t be late today.

104
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,820
I guess today is my lucky day.

105
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,150
Boss!

106
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,670
Hello.

107
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,050
Heng.

108
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,740
(Next station, Lumpini.)

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,480
(Doors will open on the left.)

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
For the upcoming event,

111
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,680
I’ll assign you to lead the team.

112
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Me?

113
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,090
Yes.

114
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,270
This is your chance to make up for the loss you caused the last time.

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Yes, boss.

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,110
I’ll get it for you.

117
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
It’s okay. I can…

118
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,610
(Lumpini Station.)

119
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,800
(Please mind the gap between train and platform.)

120
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Let’s get off.

121
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
Boss.

122
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,070
This is not our stop.

123
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,610
Boss.

124
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,280
(Next station, Silom)

125
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,150
Meow asked me to give this document to you to sign.

126
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Did you see it?

127
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
No.

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,640
You definitely saw it.

129
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,020
If you’re talking about the document, I haven’t looked at it.

130
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,590
You really saw it.

131
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,400
I didn’t see anything, boss.

132
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Sorry.

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,860
That’s okay. It’s my fault.

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
I’m sorry.

135
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,980
Have we met?

136
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,010
Mo.

137
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,090
Heng, this is Mo from the Chiang Mai team.

138
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,810
He will join our team today.

139
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,230
He’ll replace Irene who resigned to be a housewife.

140
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,010
Mo.

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
It’s me, Heng.

142
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Do you remember me?

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,480
We worked together during the probation period.

144
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,420
Heng.

145
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Yes.

146
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Okay.

147
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,846
It’s good that you know each other.

148
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,110
Heng, can you help him adjust to the team?

149
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,670
Sure, I’ll show him an incredibly warm welcome.

150
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,630
I’ll close the door.

151
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Hey.

152
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,410
We have many of our clients living in this condo.

153
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,600
Here’s my advice for you.

154
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,470
You should befriend the condo’s staff.

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
When there’s a problem,

156
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,210
they will be willing to help you.

157
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,370
This girl is Namwan.

158
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,940
I think she’s introverted.

159
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,050
She’s quiet.

160
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,720
I think she has a crush on me.

161
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,970
You don’t believe me?

162
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
No.

163
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,850
I’m not lying.

164
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,710
If you don’t believe me, I’ll prove it to you.

165
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,030
I’ll wait and see.

166
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,060
Namwan, hello.

167
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,060
This is Mo.

168
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,050
He’s a new member of my team.

169
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,010
Hello, I’m Mo.

170
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,770
I took Irene’s place on the team.

171
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,310
This is my business card.

172
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,440
I’m Namwan.

173
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,990
Do you have a Line or Instagram account?

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,420
Have you had lunch?

175
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
No.

176
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,440
I’m not asking you.

177
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,110
You can leave now.

178
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,110
I can take Mo to meet the clients.

179
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,410
Please let my hand go.

180
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,480
You can hold my hand instead.

181
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,620
Heng, aren’t you going to help me?

182
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Please let me go.

183
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,360
I think I introduced you to all our clients.

184
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,970
But we have one bag of snacks left.

185
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,050
Aunt Taweep.

186
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,800
- Yes. - I have snacks for you.

187
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,260
It looks yummy.

188
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,300
Thank you, Heng.

189
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,470
It’s nothing.

190
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,000
I should be the one who thank you.

191
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,716
Because you take good care of the condo,

192
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,780
It’s easy for me to bring new clients to rent here.

193
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,210
You’re so sweet.

194
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,820
I’ll enjoy it.

195
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
Good.

196
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,070
I got to go.

197
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,320
Goodbye.

198
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,610
Goodbye.

199
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,350
Watch your step. Pay attention to the ground.

200
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,120
You’re as kind-hearted as before.

201
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,390
Before? When?

202
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Nothing.

203
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,550
Excuse me.

204
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,390
It’s Meow.

205
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,310
Hello, Meow.

206
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,550
Huh?!

207
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:15,860
Newyear, I don’t mind if you want to show a dozen of rooms to a client in one day.

208
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,860
But don’t shift your work of making a presentation to me.

209
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Heng.

210
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,970
Where is the promotion file you want to add to the presentation?

211
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,260
I can’t find it.

212
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,360
It’s on our boss’s computer.

213
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
On the desktop. You’ll see it.

214
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Okay.

215
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,500
Is the file’s name Quarter 4/2024?

216
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,170
Yes, open it.

217
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,270
Okay.

218
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Heng.

219
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
These are your photos, aren’t they?

220
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,650
What?

221
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,260
Oh! They are really my photos.

222
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,680
Why does he have so many photos of me?

223
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,560
Why are they on his computer?

224
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Wait.

225
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,300
Is this your or his computer?

226
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,370
I’m confused.

227
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,640
It’s his.

228
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,970
I just finished a meeting.

229
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,640
Mo, you have an early meeting with a client tomorrow, don’t you?

230
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,910
You can go home.

231
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,120
Heng and I will finish the presentation.

232
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Okay.

233
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,130
Mo.

234
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,470
Goodbye.

235
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,260
You definitely saw it.

236
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,110
I didn’t see it.

237
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,090
I didn’t see the promotions file.

238
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Heng.

239
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Listen to me.

240
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,970
Boss, I forgot to buy fish sauce for my mom.

241
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,240
Can I take the work to do at home?

242
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Thank you.

243
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,550
Goodbye.

244
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,490
Heng.

245
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,130
Heng.

246
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,110
Heng.

247
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
I bought coffee…

248
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Heng.

249
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Heng.

250
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,010
(I was going to give the promotions file to you.)

251
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
(I guess you didn’t hear me calling.)

252
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Boss.

253
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,600
Then why didn’t you say it?

254
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,010
Are you okay?

255
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I’m okay.

256
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,310
Good.

257
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Do you want coffee? I bought it for you.

258
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,440
Thank you, Mo.

259
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,620
Mom, I’m home.

260
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
Why don’t you turn on the light?

261
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,970
Mom, where are you?

262
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,860
I’ll find something to eat myself.

263
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,660
Since you refuse to move out, I’ll leave.

264
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,860
Mom, did it take long for you to come up with the joke?

265
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,500
Should I play along with you?

266
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,810
Fine, I’ll do it.

267
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,170
You’re under the table, right?

268
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,920
I’m not joking. I’m leaving.

269
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,410
I’ll wait until the day you can take care of yourself.

270
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,020
Are you nagging me?

271
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,810
I don’t want to play anymore.

272
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,710
If you’re not under the table,

273
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,480
you must be here.

274
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,030
Stop looking for me.

275
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,320
I’m leaving for real.

276
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,170
You, rascal!

277
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Mom.

278
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,320
This is cursing, not nagging.

279
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,720
Mom, where are you?

280
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,820
Please, come out.

281
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,310
I don’t want to play anymore.

282
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,420
Did she really leave?

283
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,320
Please come out. Are you upstairs?

284
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,670
Mom, please come out. Come on.

285
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,970
Mom, where are you?

286
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,530
What should I do?

287
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,110
Please cook a meal for me.

288
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Mom.

289
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,950
Mom!

290
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,110
I was looking for her everywhere in the house.

291
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,810
I think she really left.

292
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
It’s okay.

293
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,810
When she isn’t mad anymore, she’ll come back.

294
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,110
But I’m not stressed.

295
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,610
I’m happy.

296
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
From now on,

297
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,690
I don’t need to listen to her nagging.

298
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,510
A guy like you can live alone?

299
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,890
You don’t even know

300
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,310
where your mom keeps tissues?

301
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,476
Why do you think I don’t know?

302
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,650
If you knew,

303
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,970
you wouldn’t steal it from my restaurant.

304
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,970
Take it out.

305
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
You saw it?

306
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Here.

307
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,370
You stole the whole box?

308
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,510
My mom isn’t home. I need to cut expenses.

309
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,130
Heng, you don’t want to live alone, right?

310
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,870
Then it’s time to keep your promise.

311
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Huh?

312
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
What promise?

313
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,710
When you were in Grade 2,

314
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,400
you promised to marry my sister if you were still single when you were 30.

315
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Oh.

316
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,260
That would be hard.

317
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,400
Because I’ve never been single since Grade 2.

318
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,576
Even if you are single, I won’t date you anyway.

319
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,690
My type is a perfect housewife,

320
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,710
not a house trasher like you.

321
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Stop it.

322
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,840
How could you say that to me?

323
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,110
You two need to calm down.

324
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,850
Chicha, calm down.

325
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,030
You know what kind of guy he is.

326
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,800
Did you have dinner?

327
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,830
Yes.

328
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,210
Oh, but you look so hungry.

329
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,850
It’s okay.

330
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,630
I just added a new dish to the menu.

331
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,270
I just finished plating it.

332
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,470
This is a soba topping with Som Tam and caramel.

333
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,900
When will you sell ordinary dishes like other restaurants?

334
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,600
My restaurant is Fusion Food Izakaya.

335
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,910
(Taste it.)

336
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,210
Here are your chopsticks.

337
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,710
Taste it.

338
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,790
Please enjoy.

339
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,500
You can eat it. I’m not hungry.

340
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,650
Mo, what are you doing here?

341
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,120
Meow gave me your address.

342
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,196
She said you would have to work all night to finish the presentation.

343
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
So I came to help you.

344
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,350
Meow exaggerated it.

345
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,300
I can finish it in a few hours.

346
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,260
Right. I won’t take your time anymore.

347
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,490
Here, in case you feel hungry at night.

348
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,800
What is it? A meal or a snack?

349
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
It looks yummy.

350
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,760
Is there any shop selling this around here?

351
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,500
No, I made it.

352
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,670
Huh?

353
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
The joke is good.

354
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,970
Tell me the truth.

355
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,140
If it tastes good, I’ll order it later.

356
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,620
I mean it. I made it.

357
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
When I was young,

358
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,310
I helped my mom in the kitchen.

359
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,190
Really?

360
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Don’t overreact.

361
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Hey.

362
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,770
Do you know

363
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,950
any affordable condos for rent in the area?

364
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,810
I’m living with my aunt after moving here.

365
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,660
I don’t want to bother her anymore.

366
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,610
Affordable condos?

367
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
How about this?

368
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,020
Do you want to move in with me?

369
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,870
Hey.

370
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Your joke is good.

371
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Right?

372
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,490
I mean it.

373
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,470
Do you want to be my housemate?

374
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,330
Will you?

375
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,410
I want to thank my mom for leaving me that day.

376
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,430
Now, I’m very happy.

377
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,450
Because I got a new mom who is very kind.

378
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,110
He’s good at house chores.

379
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,050
More importantly, he’s a great cook.

380
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,170
How is it?

381
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
It’s delicious, Mo.

382
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,910
Are you talking about a mom or a wife?

383
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,350
Right?

384
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,890
Mo.

385
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Will you marry me?

386
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,340
Please marry me.

387
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,450
Why would I do that?

388
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,710
Why not?

389
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,580
No.

390
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,110
I want to be with you.

391
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,110
No.

392
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,920
Why? I want to be with you.

393
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,800
Please.

394
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,730
No.

395
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,710
Please marry me, Mo.

396
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,730
No, I won’t.

397
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,750
Please marry me.

398
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,440
Stop it, Heng.

399
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,400
I’ll feed you.

400
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
(At the time, )

401
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,110
(I didn’t know that my epic love war had begun.)

402
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Did you see it?

403
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,200
You definitely saw it.

404
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,110
You really saw it.

405
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,390
Heng.

406
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,440
Are you here to see our boss?

407
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Yes, Meow.

408
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,720
Today, he took a leave.

409
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,380
If you have something to give him,
you can leave it with Ten.

410
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,750
A workaholic man like him took a leave?

411
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,500
Today, he has a date with his wife.

412
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,340
He’s married?

413
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,970
Yes.

414
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,700
He doesn’t like to talk about his personal life.

415
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,710
But I like to pry into people’s private life

416
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,750
That’s how I know it.

417
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,970
I can tell that you like to pry into other people’s life.

418
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,970
Gosh, Heng.

419
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,460
This means everything was a misunderstanding.

420
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,860
He was just joking.

421
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,500
Mom, how are you?

422
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,500
We are doing well.

423
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
Dad still says he misses you.

424
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,909
(Maria Wannapa Attasethakul
9 March 1974 – 6 October 2014)

425
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,833
Heng, you can breathe now.

426
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Meow, excuse me.

427
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,840
I need to go back to work.

428
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,030
Good. Go.

429
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,300
Heng.

430
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Did you check the sample?

431
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,900
Newyear put the wrong QR code on the flyers.

432
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,670
We already handed them out.

433
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Don’t blame him.

434
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,730
It was my fault.

435
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,080
I’ll resign from the company.

436
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
You don’t need to do that.

437
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,710
The event begins tomorrow.

438
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,610
Print out the new QR code

439
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,300
and put it on the flyers.

440
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,310
But I’m taking a client to visit seven rooms.

441
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,710
I can cut it down to five.

442
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,150
It’s okay. I’ll take care of it.

443
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,970
You don’t need to resign.

444
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,730
Don’t leave me yet.

445
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,350
You don’t need to fix it.

446
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,510
Now, everyone is registering on the website.

447
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,250
No. This was my fault.

448
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,520
I didn’t check it first.

449
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,150
It’s already past working hours.

450
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,000
You can go home first. I’ll stay to finish it.

451
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,820
It’s okay.

452
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,170
I want to help.

453
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,160
No. You can go home first.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,860
In the past, you helped me.

455
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Don’t you remember it?

456
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,130
Don’t you remember it?

457
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,730
(8 YEARS AGO)

458
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,290
Hey.

459
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,850
Are you putting up a sign?

460
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,790
Did you have permission from the staff?

461
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,580
I’m sorry.

462
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,640
I was told to change the phone number.

463
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,590
Mo.

464
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,420
Don’t you remember me?

465
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,150
I’m Heng.

466
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,346
We worked together during the probation period.

467
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,370
We were on the same team.

468
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,470
I see.

469
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
Sorry.

470
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,950
Do you want my help?

471
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Is it a good idea?

472
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I’ll help you.

473
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,530
Come on.

474
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,950
I’ll carry you up.

475
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Come on.

476
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Here I go.

477
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,510
Are you alright?

478
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,400
I think we should switch our places.

479
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,860
Okay. Thank you.

480
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,040
Easy.

481
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Yes.

482
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,340
Are you done?

483
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,370
Just a minute.

484
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
I almost got it.

485
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,360
I got it.

486
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Did we get it?

487
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,860
Yes.

488
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,840
We finally finished it.

489
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Here.

490
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
I bought it for you.

491
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,440
To celebrate finishing the job.

492
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,650
Thanks.

493
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,230
Sori.

494
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,370
I’m sorry

495
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,790
Sori?

496
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,270
Now, I get it.

497
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,770
This is why you barely talk to anyone.

498
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,310
If you were teased about your accent from day one,

499
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,860
would you have the courage to talk to people?

500
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,580
This is why

501
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,660
you can’t remember anyone on the team.

502
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,110
It’s okay.

503
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,610
My name is Heng as in good luck.

504
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,910
My mom won the lottery when I was born.

505
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,800
I’m Momo.

506
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,100
You can call me Mo.

507
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,290
Cheers.

508
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,470
Bottoms up.

509
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,540
You finished the whole can?

510
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Yes.

511
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
It’s okay.

512
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,420
I got this one for free.

513
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,510
Take it.

514
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,240
I’ll give you.

515
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,720
No. You should drink it.

516
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,380
It’s okay. I got plenty of this at home.

517
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
No.

518
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,400
You should drink it.

519
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,930
I get tipsy easily.

520
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
Really?

521
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,210
How about this?

522
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,930
I’ll keep it.

523
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,250
Until we both pass the probation.

524
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,350
Then we come to celebrate together.

525
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,580
What if we both don’t pass?

526
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,220
I won’t open it.

527
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,700
Until we both…

528
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,970
get to work together again.

529
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,110
I’m sorry for being late.

530
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,670
We’ve been correcting the QR code until dawn.

531
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Yes.

532
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,290
Heng.

533
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,810
The mascot actor that you gave his contact info to me.

534
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,570
I’m unable to contact him.

535
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,050
Oh.

536
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,460
Did you contact another actor?

537
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,940
How would he know who he should contact?

538
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,510
Why did you assign such an important job to a newbie?

539
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,400
Please don’t scold him.

540
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I’m sorry.

541
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,800
I’ll resign from the company.

542
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,480
You don’t need to do that.

543
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,280
I’ll contact other actors.

544
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,320
Stop it

545
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,820
The event will begin soon. They won’t make it in time.

546
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
I’ll wear the costume.

547
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:17,057
Listen.

548
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,715
We’re not selling houses.

549
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:22,915
We’re selling homeliness.

550
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,668
If we are fighting like this,

551
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,782
how can we take care of our clients?

552
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Boss.

553
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,911
I’ll do it.

554
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:21,859
Please take a look around.

555
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,380
Feel free to ask if you have questions.

556
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,213
Feel free to ask questions.

557
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,173
Heng.

558
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:30,894
Heng!

559
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:32,226
Everyone, come and help him.

560
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:33,601
Heng.

561
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:34,671
- Heng. - Heng.

562
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Heng.

563
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:40,628
Heng.

564
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,730
(Emergency Room)

565
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:54,391
Mo.

566
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
How is Heng?

567
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,357
I haven’t heard any updates.

568
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:17,979
It’s too bad. He’s still young.

569
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:19,782
That’s right.

570
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,770
This shouldn’t have happened, right?

571
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:24,072
I feel bad for him.

572
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:28,414
- Heng.
- Heng.

573
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:44,351
Heng.

574
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:49,911
Boss.

575
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:52,025
Mo.

576
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,317
Are you sure the program is not broken?

577
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,190
Yes, you’re fine. Nothing to worry.

578
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,914
You can go home now.

579
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:03,207
Wait.

580
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:06,051
Why my IQ level is equivalent to a middle schooler, nurse?

581
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:07,579
Wait.

582
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:10,485
Nur…

583
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:15,765
When she said that he’s still young,

584
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,161
she was talking about your IQ level?

585
00:40:18,453 --> 00:40:21,035
You scared everyone.

586
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:22,072
Calm down, Mo.

587
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:28,050
It’s good that he’s fine.

588
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,440
Then...

589
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,597
you can go home first.

590
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:41,979
I want to talk to Heng in private.

591
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:49,211
Yes.

592
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:00,813
I’m sorry for causing the trouble.

593
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Next time.

594
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,616
Don’t do anything like this again.

595
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,666
You, silly.

596
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:24,561
Boss.

597
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,805
If something happened to you,

598
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:29,234
how would I live, Heng?

599
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,127
Don’t do this again.

600
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Do you hear me?

601
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
Yes, boss.

602
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:14,408
We all passed the probation.

603
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:15,438
Cheers.

604
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:25,234
Eat as much as you want.

605
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:26,090
This is my friend’s restaurant.

606
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,110
It’s on the house.

607
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,170
On the house?

608
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:38,506
I’ll give you a 50% discount.

609
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:50,284
I got a call.

610
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:51,428
I’ll go and take it.

611
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:01,693
Hello.

612
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:03,091
(Is this Mo?)

613
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:05,186
Yes.

614
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:07,278
(I’m from the HR department.)

615
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,500
(I called to tell you that you passed the probation.)

616
00:43:10,694 --> 00:43:12,405
Really?

617
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,013
Can I ask you something?

618
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:21,315
Why did my result come out after the others?

619
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:25,311
(You got the highest sales.)

620
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:27,616
(Other branches want to recruit you to their teams.)

621
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:30,142
I see.

622
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:33,377
(Your hometown is Lampang, right?)

623
00:43:34,388 --> 00:43:35,388
Yes.

624
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,527
(Are you interested in joining the Chian Mai team?)

625
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:38,976
They asked me to recruit you.

626
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,290
Chiang Mai?

627
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I’ll do it.

628
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:15,173
When can I start?

629
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:44,607
Thank you for giving me a ride.

630
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:51,832
About today…

631
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:53,509
You mean about the work.

632
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:55,752
I’ll sum up the sales report and give it to you.

633
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:56,588
I like you.

634
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:57,714
Huh?!

635
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Heng.

636
00:45:04,555 --> 00:45:05,555
I…

637
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:08,822
I like you.

638
00:45:12,856 --> 00:45:14,047
Wait.

639
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:18,921
I planned to keep this secret and take it to the grave.

640
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:20,568
But you saw what happened today.

641
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:25,952
Your photo on my screen lock.

642
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:27,426
Yes.

643
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:28,669
I saw it.

644
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,681
Heng.

645
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:34,668
I almost lost you today.

646
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:41,370
I won’t deny my heart anymore.

647
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,604
But you’re married.

648
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:58,176
My wife.

649
00:46:02,586 --> 00:46:04,377
She passed away ten years ago.

650
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:15,401
Heng.

651
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,826
Give me some time to sort things out.

652
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,111
In the meantime,

653
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,430
please wait for me.

654
00:46:24,974 --> 00:46:25,974
Please.

655
00:46:28,377 --> 00:46:29,081
Thank you.

656
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:30,677
I’ll get it done soon.

657
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:33,306
Thank you. I got to go.

658
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:43,192
Boss.

659
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:45,786
I haven’t said anything.

660
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:58,977
Did he just confess his feelings to me?

661
00:46:59,576 --> 00:47:00,576
Am I dreaming?

662
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:01,629
Is this real?

663
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:33,825
Heng.

664
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,288
Huh?

665
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,680
Are you okay?

666
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:38,174
You look so pale.

667
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,493
I’m hungry.

668
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,811
I’ll go find something to eat.

669
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,977
Heng, are you still not done?

670
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:21,311
No.

671
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:22,949
Why?

672
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,514
Are you going to help me scrub my back?

673
00:48:25,854 --> 00:48:26,854
No.

674
00:48:40,174 --> 00:48:41,174
Thank you, Heng.

675
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,743
I’ll get it done soon.

676
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:46,574
Thank you.

677
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,125
I got to go.

678
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,226
Heng.

679
00:49:01,477 --> 00:49:02,477
At the hospital,

680
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,502
what did our boss say to you?

681
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:12,687
It was about work.

682
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,321
Really?

683
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:18,739
If you need someone to talk to,

684
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:21,505
you can tell me.

685
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:30,632
Really?

686
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,410
But you can’t tell anyone about it.

687
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:36,677
Fine.

688
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:41,133
Boss.

689
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,349
He…

690
00:49:46,973 --> 00:49:48,481
He confessed his love to me.

691
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,180
Really?

692
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,357
Why don’t you look surprised?

693
00:50:07,201 --> 00:50:09,915
What did you tell him?

694
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,555
What do you expect me to say?

695
00:50:14,991 --> 00:50:15,991
Why?

696
00:50:17,078 --> 00:50:18,117
Are you dating someone?

697
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,040
No.

698
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,979
But he’s a guy.

699
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:07,521
Why can’t men date each other?

700
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,293
Why are you mad at me?

701
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,571
Do you have a crush on our boss?

702
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,090
No, I don’t have a crush on him.

703
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,755
I have a crush on you.

704
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:25,034
This time,

705
00:51:26,825 --> 00:51:28,306
I won’t lose you to anyone.

706
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:39,568
(From the person who almost gave up on love.)

707
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:43,222
(I suddenly have two guys confessing their love to me on the same night.)

708
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,662
(What on earth is going on today, gosh!?)

709
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,210
Directed by Kornprom Niyomsil

710
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,425
Congrats.

711
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,961
Now you don’t have to be single for the rest of your life.

712
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:10,985
Thanks.

713
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:12,872
But you’re missing the point.

714
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:15,906
I fell for someone I shouldn’t.

715
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:19,195
Perhaps, that person has feelings for you too.

716
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,623
But I’m glad

717
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:22,647
that you moved in with me that day.

718
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,712
I like this house with you in it.

719
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Heng chose me.

720
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,638
Heng chose me.

721
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:30,595
He chose me.

722
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,620
He chose me.

723
00:52:31,669 --> 00:52:32,565
He chose me.

724
00:52:32,675 --> 00:52:33,700
He chose me.
