1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,850
=Recruit a General to Lead the Troops=

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,580
You wretched woman, I will cut you down.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,060
Hey.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,469
Wretched woman, caught by me at last.

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,580
Hmm.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,189
Today I will kill you, wretched woman.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,189
You must not kill her.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,380
Why?

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,069
With a living hostage right here,

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,580
why not use her?

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,860
Oh.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,820
Right.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,789
Let us do it this way.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,189
Good.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,060
Good.

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,429
This is bad.

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,300
Shihou Stronghold
has come to challenge us.

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,260
Listen inside.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,149
Send out Chen Xinrou.

21
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,660
Or I will kill Tao Lianxin.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,349
Leader.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,980
The fourth boss is in their hands.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,980
Li Chengyu has not been captured.

25
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,789
Big boss.

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,789
Second boss.

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,980
Surrender.

28
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,700
Li Chengyu, how dare you.

29
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,349
To collude with Shihou Stronghold.

30
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,069
We are only thirty feet away
from entering the stronghold.

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,549
We will be inside at once.

32
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,349
Lower your banner and surrender quickly.

33
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,340
Surrender.

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,969
What is this?

35
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,032
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,509
Did not expect that, did you?

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,340
When I turn ruthless,
I care not even for myself.

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,340
You truly are ruthless.

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,349
Tao Lianxin.

40
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,700
I will kill you right now.

41
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,120
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

42
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,949
Oh no, I cannot take it.

43
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,180
I am going to faint.

44
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,020
You are awake. How do you feel?

45
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,780
I am fine now.

46
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,500
Thank you.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,380
What is that sound?

48
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,269
Ah, tonight

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,500
is the ceremony
for Best Stronghold Member.

50
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,660
What is Best Stronghold Member?

51
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,500
You do not know this?

52
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,429
It is chosen once every month.

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,549
The one who contributes most
to the stronghold

54
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,749
is elected as Best Stronghold Member.

55
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,500
They may then enter the Treasure Pavilion
and choose a gift they like most.

56
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,549
There, the bandaging is done.

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,749
You may leave now.

58
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,180
Hey.

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,500
The secret lies
within the Treasure Pavilion.

60
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,500
(To enter the Treasure Pavilion
and find evidence,)

61
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,869
(one must
first become Best Stronghold Member.)

62
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,669
I told them to cancel it for now.

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,940
Too much has happened
these past two days.

64
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,740
Let everyone rest. We will speak again
at the start of the month.

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,589
By the way,

66
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,740
I asked you to follow Li Chengyu
and see why he went down the mountain.

67
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,229
Could it be that he truly colludes
with Shihou Stronghold?

68
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,340
No.

69
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,940
He and I were captured together
by Shihou Stronghold.

70
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,869
In the end, he saved me.

71
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,300
He saved you?

72
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,780
When you have rested, spread the word.

73
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,580
Say that we have captured someone
from Shihou Stronghold.

74
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,469
If they dare to send people to rescue,

75
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,029
we will seize whoever comes.

76
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,909
I already told Minmin
to bandage Li Chengyu.

77
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,580
Then send him down the mountain at once.

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,940
Li Chengyu!

79
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,940
My apologies.

80
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,580
During this time,

81
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,140
I have troubled you.

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,380
I shall take my leave.

83
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,900
You may stay.

84
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,700
Very well.

85
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,900
You may stay to recover.

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,580
But while recovering you must work.

87
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,229
The stronghold does not feed idlers.

88
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,549
Who is an idler?

89
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,380
You.

90
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,580
Hmph.

91
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,700
Hey.

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,140
What?

93
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,700
All of them were captured.

94
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,669
Where is Huzi?

95
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,589
Captured.

96
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,700
What?

97
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,700
Awake?

98
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,260
Oh.

99
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,580
You are awake too.

100
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,580
Are you not about to hold a ceremony

101
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,229
for Best Stronghold Member?

102
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,380
It has been delayed.

103
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,669
Why?

104
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,900
Because of...

105
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,580
If you have something to say,
just say it.

106
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,669
- Can I take part?
- You want to enter the Treasure Pavilion?

107
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,909
(Is it that obvious?)

108
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,469
No, it is not that.

109
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,580
I simply wish to contribute
to the stronghold.

110
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,340
(How could someone
like her commit treason?)

111
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,340
(I do not know why,
I just find her so adorable,)

112
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,220
(not like someone who would rebel.)

113
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,460
(To enter the Treasure Pavilion
one must become Best Stronghold Member.)

114
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,260
The environment
in Qingfeng Stronghold is so harsh.

115
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,920
(Hot spring, rest area, shower area)
Even Chen Xinrou finds bathing difficult.

116
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,240
(Bathing area, hair combing area)
Even Chen Xinrou finds bathing difficult.

117
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,909
If I build them a hot spring,

118
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,700
so they can bathe with ease,

119
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,140
would they not be deeply grateful to me?

120
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,340
In that case, becoming Best Stronghold Member
would be nothing at all.

121
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,380
I truly am a genius.

122
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,149
And there is one more person.

123
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,020
One more person?

124
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,580
Who else?

125
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,269
Why stop halfway through?

126
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,020
In this time I could have said
my name several times.

127
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,060
Put your foot down.

128
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,460
Why are you still awake?

129
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,700
I dropped a book.

130
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,060
By the way, Young Master Li,

131
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,109
I think...

132
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,060
We have captured someone
from Shihou Stronghold.

133
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,100
(It feels as though something is wrong.)

134
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,180
Enter.

135
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,949
Let us out.

136
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,189
Let us out.

137
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:08,869
Release us.

138
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,100
Set us free.

139
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,860
Help!

140
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,300
Help!

141
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,300
Help! Help!

142
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,100
Help! Save us!

143
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,340
Open the door!

144
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,700
Open up!

145
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,629
Murder!

146
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,949
There is killing inside!

147
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,220
Murder!

148
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,300
Who is it?

149
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,229
Why are they all dead?

150
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,229
I do not know.

151
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,949
It was already like this when I entered.

152
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,300
Perhaps suicide.

153
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,940
They are death warriors.

154
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,420
(Could this mark be...)

155
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,700
Aiya.

156
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,100
Young Master Li,

157
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,860
thank you for saving my life.

158
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,229
That Liu Pitang

159
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,469
sent people to kill me.

160
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,100
Why would he want to kill you?

161
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,589
I do not know.

162
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,749
Per... Perhaps because
I know too many secrets.

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,580
What secrets do you know?

164
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,069
That... I do not know.

165
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,340
What secrets?

166
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,820
No secret is worth killing me over.

167
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,420
So Liu Pitang
never truly saw me as a brother.

168
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,820
He treated us like dogs.

169
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,989
You are my brother.

170
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,860
My good brother.

171
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,949
I do not care,

172
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,469
I will stay in Qingfeng Stronghold.

173
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,460
Qingfeng Stronghold is my home.

174
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,109
You are my big brother.

175
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,700
(The bathhouse hot spring
cannot be built so quickly.)

176
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,940
(A few laborers are indeed needed.)

177
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,700
(Can't have the girls do it.)

178
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,460
(These men will do just fine.)

179
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,060
You may stay,

180
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,229
but Qingfeng Stronghold
does not keep idlers.

181
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,109
You must all work.

182
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,229
Fine, we can do any work.

183
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,340
Any work at all.

184
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,349
Qingfeng Stronghold does not keep men.

185
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,820
Am I not a man?

186
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,340
Enough, I will go speak to the leader.

187
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,180
It is raining, everyone up.

188
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,980
Report!

189
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,100
