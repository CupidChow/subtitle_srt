Hey, eat this.

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,669
Alright.

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,709
You too. Have some of this.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,149
Oh, don't be shy.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,829
This meat is good.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,029
If I hadn't asked someone

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,580
to check the imbalance in our stronghold
that we needed a husband to balance it,

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,389
I would never allow a man

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,140
to live in Qingfeng Stronghold.

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,060
After all, I hate men most.

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,909
But we have no choice.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,860
Fate decides everything.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,829
Come.

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,629
Sisters, today is our leader's wedding.

18
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,869
Let's eat and drink well!

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,069
Eat and drink well!

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,189
Come, eat and drink well.

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,260
Not you. You're a child.

Chen Xinrou experiments daily.

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,220
How do I contact that spy?

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,349
Okay?

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,900
The spy doesn't know my plan,

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,060
but they bear a unique peacock mark.

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,989
Darn Shihou Stronghold. Those animals.

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,429
They set fire to our stronghold

65
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,740

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,620
the 500 jars promised to the winery,

70
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,549
the 500 scarves for Yipin Hall,

71
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,269
and 300 bottles of natural juice
for Huiyuan Pavilion are all burned.

72
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,269
If we can't deliver in three days,

73
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,500
we need to compensate 30,000 taels.

74
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,340
What do we do?

75
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,380
Tonight,
the only outsider in the stronghold

76
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,620
is that person.

77
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,429
So it was arson.

78
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,060
I thought my cover was blown.

79
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,500

Mr. Qian led a group
into Qingfeng Stronghold.

82
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,380
Lock Li Chengyu up for me.

83
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,260
(No way you're locking me up.)

84
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,060
We came in good faith
to congratulate your leader.

85
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,140
But we didn't expect

86
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,900
to see our goods burned.

87
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,260
Give us an explanation.

88
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,940
If I recall correctly,

89
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,380
delivery is in three days.

90
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,580
Yet you came so quickly.

91
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,109
Do you have far-seeing eyes

92
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,820
or super hearing?

93
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,029
Or was it you who set the fire?

94
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,869
- Yes.
- It must be them.

95
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,940
Definitely.

96
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,020
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,029
Why would we burn

98
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,580
our own goods?

99
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,349
Cut the nonsense.

100
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,789
Today, either hand over the goods,

101
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,460
pay up,

102
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,260
or...

103
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,460
I can see that your stronghold

104
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,380
has many pretty women.

105
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,029
You should fetch good money.

106
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,020
Don't you dare.

107
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,380
Our master trained in martial arts
for over 40 years.

108
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,909
General God of War

109
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,589
may not even be his match,

110
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,229
let alone a woman like you.

111
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,260
Fine, I won't bully you.

112
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,500
Call out your leader Chen Xinrou
to speak with me.

113
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,940
Seems your leader isn't here.

114
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,380
Listen up.

115
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,700
Surround them all for me!

116
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,220
Surround them!

117
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,229
I want to see

118
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,060
what this mysterious Chen Xinrou
looks like.

119
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,580
Hey.

120
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,380
Get up.

121
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,220
Speak.

122
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,580
Where's Chen Xinrou?

123
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,140
What are you doing?

124
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,429
This is Chen Xinrou.

125
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,500
Look at the fierce face and sharp teeth.
Exactly like the rumors say.

126
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm not.

127
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,060
Hey, you...

128
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,220
Are you fooling me?

129
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,700
I'll give you a chance to live today.

130
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,380
Crawl through my crotch,

131
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,220
and I'll spare you.

132
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,269
Come to my residence
to empty the night pot at night, haha!

133
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,260
I'll give you take two steps.

134
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,669
(General)

135
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,940
General? I'm the damn retired emperor!

136
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,140
Come on.

137
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,900
I used to deliver food.

138
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,140
I could endure it then.

139
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,820
Now I'm a general.

140
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,029
Even in my dream,
I won't let you bully me.

141
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,469
What's happening here?

142
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,580
Huh?

143
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,060
What is this?

144
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,780
Oh no.

145
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,309
Is this General God of War's
legendary move,

146
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,309
Thunderous Force?

147
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,460
Ah?

148
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,860
Once unleashed,

149
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,580
dark clouds cover the city

150
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,940
and can repel millions of enemies.

151
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,940
General God of War.

152
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,109
General God of War.

Forgive me, I didn't know
you were General God of War!

154

Forgive me, General God of War.

155
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,060
Forget those goods outside.

156
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,109
I'll release them right now, alright?

No need.
