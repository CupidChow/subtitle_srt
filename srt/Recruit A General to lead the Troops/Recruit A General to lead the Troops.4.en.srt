00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,670
Those shopkeepers have actually
joined hands with Qingfeng Stronghold.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,070
Now that they've joined forces,

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,870
no one supplies us anymore.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,550
They've cut off the source of income
for our Shihou Stronghold.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,479
Hahaha...

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,559
Brother.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,630
Brother.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,199
You're the boss or I'm the boss?

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,190
You're the boss.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,350
Brother, sit.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,879
Weren't we just putting on an act
in front of those shopkeepers?

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,470
Were you too carried away?

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,110
You rascal.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,110
Let me tell you.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,519
Those shopkeepers teamed up
with Qingfeng Stronghold.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,719
They've made money.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,070
Those old fools
dare to make a fool out of me.

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,150
Brother, what should we do?

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,630
Chen Xinrou.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,990
If it weren't for her,

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,799
my stronghold wouldn't have fallen.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,199
My brothers wouldn't be dead.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,079
That's right.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,430
Eighty-one men.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,359
A full eighty-one men!

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,719
Eighty-one men!

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,159
Only the two of us survived.

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,630
Brother...

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,150
You've stirred up my grief again.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,350
Brother, I've found out.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,159
The culprit
is the new husband Chen Xinrou

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,439
just brought home, named Li Chengyu.

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,870
Li Chengyu?

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,270
He helped Qingfeng Stronghold
out of crisis.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,359
He is indeed talented.

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,510
Hmm.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,439
Tell Yun to bring him here,
I want to see him.

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,990
All right, I'll go at once.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,630
What is this?

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,919
Who are you?

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
We have no grudge, no feud.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,710
What are you doing?

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,630
How do I reach that secret agent?

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,630
He has a unique peacock mark
on his body.

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,230
You can find him through that mark.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,510
I'm also one of His Majesty's men.

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,830
You're a secret agent too?

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,510
Wait, you... you're Yun.

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,959
Every agent bears a mark.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,999
Show me your mark.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,599
Hey, hey!

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,719
I'm new here.

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,230
I haven't had it done yet.

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,319
I am a general.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,750
Why waste words with you?

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,879
(General)
I am the General God of War.

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,470
Is that enough?

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,070
The General God of War?

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,510
You are the General?

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,670
General...

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,750
You seem so excited to meet the General.

64
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,719
General...

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,670
Please, save my family.

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,630
Shihou Stronghold has taken them.

67
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,350
They forced me to set the fire.

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,479
And now,

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,159
they want me to bind you
and take you there too.

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,479
General, I had no choice.

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,070
I beg you to act.

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,119
If you are willing to rescue my family,

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,910
I will tell you everything
I have found out.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,910
What do you know?

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,750
I know where they hid the key evidence.

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,879
All right, but your clothes
stand out too much.

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,590
Change, and let's go.

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,790
Yun!

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,630
Yun!

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,510
Li Chengyu, what on earth are you doing?

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,439
Why are you here?

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,719
If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have known
what you were up to.

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,999
And I trusted you so much.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,150
Well.

85
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,830
Another woman shows up?

86
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,479
Li Chengyu, our leader said this,

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,679
you've got talent.

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,479
Why not join our Shihou Stronghold?

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,599
But only you are invited.

90
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,919
The rest, kill them.

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,070
All right.

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,030
I'll go with you.

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,270
You'll go with them?

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,830
They're from Shihou Stronghold.

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,470
Ah!

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,590
Overestimating yourself.

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,270
Yun.

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,470
This...

99
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,590
Why does she cough blood
every time she uses that move?

100
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,390
(Qingfeng Stronghold)
I know you didn't kill Yun.

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,390
And I never poisoned you.

102
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,830
It wasn't you who poisoned me?

103
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,150
Then what was it you fed me?

104
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,350
A tonic.

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,710
A tonic for what?

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,599
I don't know what it's for.

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,150
See for yourself.

108
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,150
You're using me as a test subject?

109
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,150
Go after whoever poisoned you.

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,590
You may leave the mountain now.

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,799
(Leaving the mountain?)

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,030
(I just learnt the evidence
is in the Treasure Pavilion.)

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,039
(I can't leave.)

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,390
You're asking me to leave?

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,030
You still don't trust me.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,879
What can I trust you with?

117
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,799
Mr. Qian treated you
as an honored guest.

118
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,359
Yun trusted you, not me.

119
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,359
You knocked me out
in front of Shihou Stronghold,

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,950
and yet we still made it back alive.

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,390
Li Chengyu,
give me one reason to trust you.

122
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,679
Chen Xinrou.

123
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,766
What if I like you?

124
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,359
♪Being unnoticed,
yet I still tell you I love you♪

125
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,470
What?

126
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,559
♪But my confession
is drowned out by the wind♪

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,804
Since things have come to this,

128
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,566
I won't hide it anymore.

129
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,710
Chen Xinrou,

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,999
I like you.

131
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,879
From the first moment I saw you,

132
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,359
I realised
you were nothing like the rumors.

133
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,239
You are different.

134
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:48,039
Gentle and gracious.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,991
Not even rumors could sway you.

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,359
When everyone else doubted me,

137
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,229
only you...

138
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,516
Only you gave me this chance.

139
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,790
I truly don't want to leave.

140
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,359
But if you insist on sending me away,

141
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,359
♪You brushed past me,
leaving your trace in the crowd♪

142
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,966
I will respect your choice.

♪Yet I seem to clutch you,
unable to let you fade into the crowd♪

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,119
Then leave the mountain.

148
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,150
Ah?

149
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,999
Fine, I'll leave.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,390
Who would want to stay
in this wretched place anyway?

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,599
Did my act just now seem unconvincing?

152
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,830
I thought I played it quite well.

153
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,070
Yet she still saw through it.

154
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,150
I feel like
I'm getting used to this body.

155
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,950
Ordinary moves aren't a problem anymore.

156
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,830
But whenever I use
that charged technique, I cough blood.

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,350
No, I'll try again.

158
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,390
Ah...

159
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,910
Still the same.

160
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,719
Erniang.

161
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,359
Hm?

162
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,470
What sort of person
do you think Li Chengyu is?

163
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,070
Rubbish.

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,239
We chose him
to bring fortune to the stronghold.

165
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,710
But ever since he arrived,
nothing good has happened.

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,710
And every misfortune is tied to him.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,719
Leader, you were right
to drive him away.

168
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,710
Keeping him here
would only bring us harm.

169
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,870
As expected, no man is any good.

170
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,470
Brothers!

171
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,999
Our big brother has spoken.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,959
We'll guard here at Qingfeng Stronghold,

173
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,350
on the only way down the mountain.

174
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,639
If anyone comes alone,

175
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,950
we strike!

176
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,950
That's right.

177
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,710
Ha!

178
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,310
Isn't that Li Chengyu?

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,239
Brothers!

180
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,950
After him!

181
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,590
Stop!

182
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,430
Hm?

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,830
Take him.

184
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,550
What's wrong?

185
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,199
I've been poisoned
by Soft Muscle Powder.

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,230
It's too cold.

187
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,599
What are you doing?

188
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,719
Keeping warm.

189
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,830
Get off.

190
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,830
Alright.

191
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,599
Hey...

192
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,750
Move closer this way.

193
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,079
I didn't mean anything.

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,710
I just don't want you
freezing to death here.

195
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
Hey, don't fall asleep.

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,110
If you sleep now, you'll never wake.

197
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,950
Be quiet.

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,950
Don't sleep.

199
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,590
Let's talk instead.

200
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,479
I've nothing else to do anyway.

201
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,479
Come on, tell me.

202
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,759
Your Qingfeng Stronghold,

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,350
why do you have such a deep feud
with Shihou Stronghold?

204
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,879
Why should I tell you?

205
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,190
Hey.

206
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,599
If we really die here,

207
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,119
I reckon,

208
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,599
I'll end up back delivering takeaways.

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,479
By then,
even if you want to tell someone,

210
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,870
no one will hear.

211
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,870
Brother, those two
are locked in the dungeon.

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,470
Catch.

213
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,870
Both of them were caught by you.

214
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,190
I truly favor you.

215
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,870
Give me a reward then.

216
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,670
Applaud.

217
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,310
Brother, what do we do with them?

218
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,750
The woman,

219
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,470
dispose of her.

220
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,719
As for that pretty boy,

221
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,599
if he submits, let him go.

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,359
If he refuses, dispose of him too.

223
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,470
Alright.

224
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,670
Bring the axe.

225
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,350
Hm.

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,190
Hey.

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,359
I'm just saying,

228
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,590
has our stronghold grown this poor?

229
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,830
Where's the meat?

230
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,590
You eat it?

231
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,239
I didn't.

232
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,830
(Qingfeng Stronghold
used to be Liu Pitang's turf.)

233
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,350
(They plundered and pillaged,
committing every crime.)

234
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,950
(The leader and I were captured
and taken there too.)

235
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,230
(Later...)

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,999
(Later, the leader)

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,959
(couldn't bear to see the women
in the stronghold abused.)

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,710
(We seized the chance
and slaughtered them all in secret.)

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,310
(Only Liu Pitang
and Cold Tiger escaped by luck.)

240
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,310
(Afterwards, they
founded Shihou Stronghold.)

241
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,719
So aren't you afraid they'll return

242
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,119
and seize your land again?

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,350
They wouldn't dare.

244
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,999
Inside and outside the stronghold,

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,950
we've set countless traps.

246
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,470
(Every ten feet beyond the gate,)

247
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,239
(there's a hidden pitfall.)

248
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
(If they dare to storm in,)

249
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,590
(they'll never return alive.)

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,550
Do you want to live?

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,590
Why do you ask?

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,639
My hairpin is sharp.

253
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,190
It's my lifeline.

254
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,590
Take it off.

255
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,999
See if it can cut the ropes.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,879
You had this thing,

257
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,310
why didn't you say so earlier?
