3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,550
You went to catch him cheating
and left me out.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,990
I was afraid you'd kill him on the spot.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,070
It's not too late to kill him now.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,070
Chengyu, you've gone
way too far this time.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,190
Xinrou, if you can detoxify her,
please help me save her.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,830
Miss Dongfang is awake.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,830
Thank you, for saving me.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,550
Don't thank me yet.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,510
Just tell me who sent you.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,919
I can't tell you yet.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,310
Once the poison is gone,
I'll tell you everything.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,230
So, you don't trust me.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,510
Up, up, up!

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,230
Move aside!

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,519
Liu Pitang, you actually
dared to show your face!

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,910
You've got a heart of stone.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,359
After all the time we spent together,

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,159
you sent people to kill me.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,910
Cold Tiger!

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,439
Isn't this Mr. Liu the shopkeeper?

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,630
Did you forget?

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,079
Mr. Liu?

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,919
Funny.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,150
Hahaha.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,790
Shopkeeper Liu,

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,790
what brings you here today?

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,350
Master Li.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,359
I didn't come here for pleasure.

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,630
I came to demand justice.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,799
That Miss Dongfang you took away

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,439
was in love with me.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,230
We were already getting married.

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,879
Why did you steal the woman I love?

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,990
Why you...

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,710
Wasn't Liu Pitang captured?

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,079
Why is he still alive?

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,159
I'll kill him myself.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,310
Wait!

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,159
Mr. Liu, mind your words.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,319
We have a crowd here.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,910
Everyone is watching.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,070
I don't know any Mr. Liu.

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,590
And I'm not betrothed to him.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,510
The one I'm truly in love
with is Young Master Li.

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,719
You heard her yourself.

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,190
She made it very clear.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,839
You'd best leave.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,070
Don't stick around here.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,910
My dear Shan...

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,190
I know I haven't treated you well.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,910
I beg your forgiveness.

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,159
I deserve the worst.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,839
I deserve it!

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,110
I deserve it!

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,159
But it was only one quarrel.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,190
Why would you pretend not to know me?

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,910
Wait...

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,590
We even have a marriage contract!

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,510
It's written here in black and white!

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,319
Take a look for yourselves.

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,910
Be my witnesses.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,559
It's written here, clear as day!

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,670
Nonsense!

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,750
Master Li.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,750
My feelings for Shan are true.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,159
I miss her day and night.

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,159
My yearning sickens me.

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,439
I beg you.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,719
Give her back to me.

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,239
I'll kneel and kowtow to you.

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,950
I'll kowtow!

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,879
Master Li, I'm begging you.

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,510
I'll kowtow to you.

76
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,599
I beg you.

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,110
I'll kowtow to you!

78
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,399
Liu Pitang,
with acting skills like that,

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,910
why aren't you on the stage?

80
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,390
On the what?

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,910
I don't even understand
what you're saying.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,910
Master Li.

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,070
Fine.

84
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,390
If you insist...

85
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,159
If you insist

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,719
that Miss Dongfang belongs to you,

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,070
then show us some proof,

88
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,150
right here before everyone.

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,910
We need some convincing!

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,119
Right?

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,390
Isn't that so?

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,710
Li Chengyu.

93
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,350
Here's the antidote.

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,119
Give it to Miss Dongfang.

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,070
He's trying to take her away.

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,390
You two...

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,830
You should get married now.

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,679
Xinrou!

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,719
No more nonsense.

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,799
Do you really want to
watch him take her away?

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,950
Hurry!

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,790
Of course they can prove it.

103
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,799
If you don't step in,

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,039
they'll be married on the spot.

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,350
Mr. Liu, since you're already here,

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,390
why not bear witness with all of us?

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,239
Let them bow to heaven
and earth right here and wed.

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,950
This won't do!

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,830
This won't do! No!

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,270
Absolutely not!

111
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,830
No, no!

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,710
Hurry up.

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,830
Fine.

114
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,910
Everyone here, bear witness.

115
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,470
I, Li Chengyu,

116
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,350
will wed Miss Dongfang here and now.

117
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,470
First bow to heaven and earth.

118
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,070
Second bow to the parents.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,470
Bow to each other.

120
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,055
(A House of Joy)

121
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,230
The ceremony is complete.

122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,830
Good.

123
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,030
Good.

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,390
Mr. Liu, still not leaving?

125
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,950
Are you planning to steal
another man's wife in broad daylight?

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,430
Go!

127
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,950
Shihou Stronghold isn't safe.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,590
Head to Qingfeng Stronghold.

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,239
What are you doing?

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,879
We're officially married.

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,230
We are husband and wife.

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,470
It's a wife's duty to serve her husband.

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,919
I told you. It was just an act.

134
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,390
Why take it so seriously?

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,790
Put this on.

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,950
Qingfeng Stronghold is full of traps.

137
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,590
Liu Pitang won't get in.

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,350
You seem to be recovering well.

139
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,390
I've purged the poison for you.

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,350
Don't you think
you owe me some answers?

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,470
Are you sure

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,919
you want to know who it was?

143
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,070
Tell me.

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,390
I don't know who's behind it.

145
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,879
I only know the one
who hired me to forge the weapons.

146
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,350
His name was Li Fang.

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,590
He wore a mask,
so I couldn't see his face.

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,390
But judging by his clothes,

149
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,710
he must've been working
for a high official in the capital.

150
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,590
Li Fang...

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,999
(I don't know the court well enough.)

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,710
(How would I know who Li Fang is?)

153
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,590
I still have the receipt
from when he paid me.

154
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:56,439
(Three thousand taels
paid to Dongfang Shan, by Li Fang)

155
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,350
(It matches the handwriting found
in the Vice Minister of War's letters.)

156
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,070
(Dongfang Shan didn't lie to me.)

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,950
In any case,

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,230
thank you, Young Master,
for saving my life today.

159
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,230
I hate owing favors.

160
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,390
I have nothing to give you in return.

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,950
Hey, what are you doing?

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,510
Hey!

163
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,599
What's the deal with Li Chengyu?

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,039
He didn't come to cheer you up.

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,599
And he claims he has
private business with Dongfang Shan?

166
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,470
Hmph.

167
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,239
Xinrou.

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
What happened to you just now?

169
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,470
Why did you officiate
their wedding ceremony?

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,119
Because too many
past misunderstandings

171
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,870
have sown rifts between us sisters.

172
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,310
Distrust breeds gossip,

173
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,950
gossip breeds discord,

174
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,550
and business comes to a halt.

175
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
This time, I want to try believing him.

176
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,470
He is all alone with a woman.

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,470
You may trust him, but I don't.

178
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,639
I think the Leader is right.

179
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,470
We're one family,
we have to trust each other.

180
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,599
He may be alone with the woman,

181
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,910
but she could just be decent company.

182
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,839
Talking is a waste of time.

183
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,950
If you don't believe it,
see for yourselves.

184
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,710
Let this kiss be my thanks,
Young Master.

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,710
Shameless.

186
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,710
The drug didn't work?

187
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,710
How did you know
I was trying to kill you?

188
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,119
From the way you and Liu Pitang
acted just now,

189
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,310
I knew something was off.

190
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,590
If he truly wanted to take you away,

191
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,750
he wouldn't have left so easily.

192
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,190
I never meant to kill you.

193
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,830
But I had no choice.

194
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,470
The weapons I forged
were used for treason.

195
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,950
If my involvement is known,

196
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,710
my family will be doomed.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,950
I can only keep
walking down this path of no return.

198
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,350
Even if...

199
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,950
you are a good man.

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,119
I gave you the antidote and cured you.

201
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,110
That proves I can protect you.

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,750
I don't trust anyone.

203
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,990
Believe it or not,

204
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,950
only I can keep you safe.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,750
Protect me? How exactly?

206
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,870
Enough talk.

207
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,550
Just wait and see.

208
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,350
Li Chengyu, are you into
some kind of perverted tricks?

209
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,470
It's getting impossible
to explain myself.

210
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,479
Manyue, after all this,

211
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,350
are you still going to defend him?

212
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,350
Even the study hall has been defiled.

213
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,359
No, I can't stand this anymore!

214
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,230
Everyone, out.

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,959
Leader, look at him!

216
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,110
Out!

217
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,710
Let's go.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,310
Don't hold me back!

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,350
Li Chengyu.

220
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,999
They've all left now.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,590
It's just us two.

222
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,479
Hear me out.

223
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,430
No. Let me explain.

224
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,110
She just tried to kill me.

225
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,399
Didn't you bring her back yourself?

226
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,950
Why would she want you dead?

227
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,430
Young Master, even if you can't have me,

228
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,359
must you slander me so?

229
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,990
But you...

230
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,070
Ah, here you are!

231
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,639
I need a word with you.

232
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,110
Come with me.

233
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,590
You need something?

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,950
Come on, let's go.

235
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,999
No, wait.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,110
Come, this way.

237
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,359
This way.

238
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,359
Listen to me.

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,719
You can't leave those two alone.

240
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,959
There will be trouble!

241
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,999
Brother, let the women

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,239
settle their scores.

243
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,719
We'll just wait outside.

244
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,230
If they start fighting,

245
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,310
we'll step in and break it up, eh?

246
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,950
Why are you staring at me?

247
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,470
I've met many people in this world.

248
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,070
But never someone like you.

249
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,959
To save me,

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,599
you let the one you love most

251
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,950
marry another before everyone's eyes.

252
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,710
And you risked everything to cure me.

253
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,310
Tell me.

254
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,710
Is it me you love, or him?

255
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,070
That's my business.

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,990
None of your concern.

257
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,310
I didn't save you
out of my feelings for him.

258
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,110
Then why?

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,310
To me,

260
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,110
you're just a patient.

261
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,959
Does a doctor
need a reason to save someone?

262
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,870
You're lucky to have
such a clever pal like me.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,710
I could see the Boss
was about to blow her top.

264
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,119
If you'd stayed,
you'd have lost that argument.

265
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,470
That'd have been awkward.

266
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,310
But honestly, I envy you.

267
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,710
Think about it.

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,710
The Boss is devoted to you.

269
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,239
The Second Boss thinks you're fated.

270
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,599
The Third Boss respects you deeply.

271
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,599
The Fourth Boss has already
pledged her heart to you.

272
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,119
The Fifth Boss obeys your every word.

273
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,079
And now there's even
this undefeated Dongfang girl.

274
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,470
