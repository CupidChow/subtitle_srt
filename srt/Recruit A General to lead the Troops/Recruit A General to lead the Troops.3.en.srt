3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,220
What did you give me to eat?

4
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,020
Poison.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,220
You gave me poison?

6
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,789
Li Chengyu,
you had better tell the truth.

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,949
Tell the truth about what?

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,869
Explain it!

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,660
If you don't, how can I admit anything?

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,309
Tell me who you really are.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,469
And what is your connection to Mr. Qian?

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,780
And the fire at stronghold, was it you?

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,709
I am just an ordinary farmer
from the foot of the mountain.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,869
I have long admired Qingfeng Stronghold,

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,000
and wished to see it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,789
I never thought that
once I climbed the mountain,

17
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,800
I would become your husband
to guard the stronghold.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,860
It was also
my first time meeting Mr. Qian.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,269
Perhaps because of my good looks,

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,780
we became close at once.

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,269
As for the fire,
it could never have been me.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,069
Now Qingfeng Stronghold is my home.

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,980
How could I burn down my own home?

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,500
You said you were an undercover spy.

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,980
Undercover?

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,620
Good heavens!

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,500
That's a local saying from my place.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,220
A dialect, you understand?

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,420
That fire really wasn't my doing.

30
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,620
But I can give you a clue.

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,349
You should check the firewood shed.

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,629
There are many empty wine jars
for wedding feasts,

33
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,149
all stained with oil.

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,540
And discarded fire sticks nearby.

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,269
Who delivered the wine that day?

36
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,060
I think you should
know better than I do.

37
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,260
About the fire, I believe you.

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,980
As for Mr. Qian,
it doesn't matter if you don't tell me.

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,340
Then you can wait for death.

40
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,500
Hey, wait!

41
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,060
All right.

42
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,469
Within three days,
I will give you an answer.

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,149
For the sake of my own life,

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,220
I must handle this properly.

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,820
Deal.

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,500
When I find the evidence,

47
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,060
let's see how arrogant you are then.

48
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:34,429
(Qian's Winery)

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,469
Where is your Mr. Qian?

50
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,460
We are here to discuss
a business deal with him.

51
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,429
The shopkeeper is not in.

52
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,429
Well then,

53
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,949
I will decide.

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,100
Not in?

55
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,969
So Mr. Qian isn't here? Let's go.

56
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:45,949
Stop talking nonsense.

57
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,500
Don't you want the antidote?

58
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,749
Guards.

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,020
Yes!

60
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,100
What's going on?

61
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,389
If you ruin this business deal,

62
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,869
can you bear the responsibility?

63
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,900
Beware, or your master
will hold you to account.

64
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,900
Where is he?

65
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,060
Where is the man I told you to capture?

66
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,469
There are still three days left
on the deadline.

67
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,709
If you arrest him now,
it would be unjustified.

68
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,180
People would only laugh at us,
wouldn't they?

69
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,620
Once the three days are up, we will go up
the mountain and seize him at once,

70
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,460
and deliver him to Shihou Stronghold.

71
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,780
Very well.

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,869
I will give you three more days.

73
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,340
If you succeed,
you will be well rewarded.

74
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,820
But if you fail,

75
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,340
you know what I am capable of.

76
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,500
Good.

77
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,900
I shall give you one chance.

78
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,340
But in our winery, there is a rule.

79
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,300
Inside the winery,

80
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,340
wine comes first.

81
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,180
You drink a bowl of wine,

82
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,900
then say a word.

83
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,060
What, have you lost your nerve?

84
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,700
Don't forget,
in two days your delivery is due.

85
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,260
Trash will always be trash.

86
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,820
Spineless.

87
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,140
At this rate,

88
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,340
you might as well send your leader
Chen Xinrou to talk to me.

89
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,909
A dog that only bullies the weak.

90
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,460
Why bother with him?

91
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,109
Wait until their master returns.

92
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,429
Forget two days,

93
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,780
you'd wait thirty.

94
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,589
Men really are unreliable.

95
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,349
Fine.

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,789
If you won't drink,

97
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,500
I will drink and you speak.

98
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,260
Deliver.

99
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,820
Goods.

100
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,940

Door.

102
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,460
Tch,

103
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,140
truly a useless waste.

104
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,789
You even let a woman drink for you.

105
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,940
Oh, right.

106
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,349
What did you say earlier?

107
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,469
Women doing business?

108
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,349
They should hurry home
to marry and have children.

109
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,220
Everyone in their stronghold
is unwanted.

110
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,109
Even the leader
was a man taken by force,

111
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,469
a live-in husband.

112
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,549
What a disgrace.

113
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,140
Haha...

114
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,380
Deliver.

115
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,620
Goods.

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,820

Door.

118
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,580
What did you say?

119
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,789
I didn't hear you.

120
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,349
Are you deaf?

121
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,260
You...

122
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,549
Stop drinking.

123
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,380
Can't you see they did it on purpose?

124
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,060
Stay out of it.

125
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,669
What kind of man bullies women?

126
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,789
I will drink.

127
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,140
I will drink one jar
and speak ten words.

128
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,700
Fine.

We receive the pigeon,

133
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,469
and deliver to the door.

134
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,940

135
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,709
No.

136

137

Today,

138
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,460
I will drink until I outlast you.

Is this how you treat your guests?

149
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,900
Go and apologise.

150
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,389
Young... Young Master Li,

151
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,189
I was foolish,

152
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,109
I was foolish.

153
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,100
I am sorry.

when I was bullied before,

158
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,940
I wanted to smash a wine jar
over their heads.

159
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,940

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,940
Why is there nothing here?

189
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,460
What a rotten idea.

190
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,820
A waste of time.

191
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,069
With this time,
I could have done so much more.

192
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,280
Sisters, listen to me.

193
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,589
Trusting a man's lies
will bring bad luck for three lifetimes.

194
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,700
That pigeon box cost two hundred taels.

195
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,629
Li Chengyu,
you will have to pay it back.

196
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,709
Come on.

197
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,340
Hey, don't go!

198
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,820
You don't believe me either?

199
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,580
I never did.

200
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,100
But we can wait a little longer.

201
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,109
Don't be so hasty.

202
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,660
Let the pigeons fly a while more.
