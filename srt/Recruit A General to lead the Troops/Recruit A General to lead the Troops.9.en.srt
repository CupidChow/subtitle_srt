1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,850
=Recruit A General to lead the Troops=

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,260
Truly worthy of being Little Stone.

4
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,580
Good.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,940
Already found the solid evidence
so quickly.

6
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,980
I should immediately dispatch troops
to suppress the bandits.

7
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,420
But this matter is of great importance.

8
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,140
Only I know that Little Stone

9
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,340
is not in prison.

10
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,909
Who should I send

11
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,580
to ensure everything goes flawlessly?

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,709
Your Majesty,

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,269
in recent days,

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,789
Minister Li Aotian

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,620
has knelt daily before the hall,
pleading for the general.

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,220
Bound by flesh and blood,

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,780
closest kin.

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,060
Although Li Aotian
is naturally weak and sickly,

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,540
he still comes every day to plead.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,060
Unlike the Chancellor's followers,

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,420
who want the Li family gone
or avoid them.

22
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,709
It shows that Li Aotian
is upright and principled.

23
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,900
He can be trusted.

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,220
Good.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,700
Summon Li Aotian to the audience.

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,629
I will secretly send him with troops

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,420
to assist Li Chengyu
in taking Qingfeng Stronghold.

28
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,029
Handle them gently.

29
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,429
These are wine jars.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,269
Treat them as you would your own lady.

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,620
Handle them gently.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,029
Ahhh!

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,500
General.

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,869
General, I'm really sorry.

35
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,220
I truly appreciate you
delivering the wine in person.

36
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,589
I heard something happened at
Qingfeng Stronghold a few days ago.

37
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,220
Are you all right, General?

38
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,940
You had me deliver the wine

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,429
just to see if I was all right.

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,620
If I weren't,
how could I deliver the wine to you?

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,029
Yes. You are right, General.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,469
I was reckless.

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,829
Please forgive me, General.

44
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,780
Stop calling me "General" all the time.

45
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,620
Afraid they won't know my identity?

46
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,340
Ah, right.

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,060
Young master.

48
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,869
Steward.

49
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,669
Steward!

50
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,429
Come!

51
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,589
Hurry, come!

52
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,620
Here he comes.

53
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,989
The previous steward
was very disobedient.

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,309
I already broke his leg
and kicked him out of the mansion.

55
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,100
This is the new steward I hired.

56
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,749
From now on, young master's goods

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,140
will be handled by him.

58
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Young master's affairs
must be well taken care of.

59
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,340
Must be well taken care of.

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,220
Alright, get busy.

61
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,469
Alright.

62
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,660
Gently.

63
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,309
This is 60 taels and eight qian.

64
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,580
Please count.

65
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,740
Also, this is a tip from our shopkeeper.

66
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,780
Keep it safe.

67
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,660
(At the Matchmaker Temple)

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,780
All poisoned.

69
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,989
I knew these women

70
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,660
are no match for me.

71
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,869
Go, call a few people.

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,989
We'll collect the bodies.

73
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,669
Xinrou,

74
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,589
I've already spread the news
about the poisoning.

75
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,429
Absolutely natural.

76
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,709
The people of Shihou Stronghold
will surely believe it.

77
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,309
Mm.

78
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,829
Once Liu Pitang
enters Qingfeng Stronghold,

79
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,589
we'll make sure he never returns.

80
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,780
Mm.

81
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,460
Half of Qingfeng Stronghold's sisters
died because of Shihou Stronghold.

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,780
They must pay
for this blood debt in full.

83
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,137
Boss. You forgot, there's still a master
in Qingfeng Stronghold

84
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,549
hasn't shown up yet.

85
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,700
Oh.

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,020
Right.

87
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,220
Also, there's a hidden coward
still not showing himself.

88
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,229
Anyway, these women have all wilted.

89
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,109
I refuse to believe that
Shihou Stronghold, with all its people,

90
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,580
cannot find even one
who can handle the hidden coward.

91
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,500
Go, gather people.

92
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,700
Recover lost territory!

93
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,020
Flatten Qingfeng Stronghold!

94
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,269
Where is Li Chengyu?

95
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,909
(I wanted to call him here,)

96
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,260
(but Cold Tiger said
he was gone since morning.)

97
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,260
(Who's pretending to be spooky?)

98
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,380
Chengyu,

99
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,220
big brother finally see you.

100
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,720
Big brother?

101
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,620
What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,820
How come you don't even recognize me?

103
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,269
I am your real brother,

104
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,620
Li Aotian.

105
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,349
(So I actually have a big brother.)

106
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,469
Ah.

107
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,589
I've been under too much
work pressure recently.

108
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,260
I remember now.

109
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,229
Chengyu, this is...

110
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,220
Do you like it? It's for you.

111
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,140
I am a civil official.

112
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,380
It's useless for me.

113
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,549
Seeing you safe makes me relieved.

114
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,020
I knew you wouldn't rebel.

115
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,260
(Ah.)

116
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,909
(How can General Li Chengyu)

117
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,220
(has such a frail brother?)

118
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,229
Even if you have a secret mission,

119
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,380
you can't hide it from me.

120
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,029
Why did you come all of a sudden?

121
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,269
Chengyu, our people are already
spread throughout the city.

122
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,580
I disguised myself as a steward
hiding in the winery.

123
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,380
I wrote you letters
in the name of Mr. Qian

124
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,580
just to lure you here.

125
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,020
Guard.

126
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,220
Your Excellency!

127
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,580
The rebel letters are solid evidence.

128
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,820
The emperor has ordered,

129
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,260
for you to lead troops
to Qingfeng Stronghold.

130
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,589
Capture Chen Xinrou.

131
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,229
No.

132
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,140
Impossible!

133
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,340
Charge!

134
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,220
Stop!

135
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,940
Today, I am in good mood.

136
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,380
Search thoroughly.

137
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,140
Search carefully.

138
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,549
Whoever searches the most,

139
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,789
I'll reward the most!

140
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,260
Good!

141
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,060
Search!

142
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,869
Leader.

143
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,589
Liu Pitang

144
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,820
already brought everyone
to Qingfeng Stronghold.

145
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,549
(Why hasn't Li Chengyu returned?)

146
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,900
(Has something happened?)

147
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,029
Good.

148
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,580
Tell all the sisters

149
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,140
to be on high alert.

150
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,029
This...

151
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,229
Your arrival is too sudden.

152
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,020
I'm not ready yet.

153
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,589
You watch tens of thousands
in battle without blinking,

154
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,260
so what preparation do you need
for a small Qingfeng Stronghold?

155
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,909
I feel anxious for you.

156
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,869
Finish early,

157
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,469
return to the capital early to report.

158
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,580
Restoring your reputation is important.

159
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,460
But I...

160
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,709
It's getting late.

161
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,460
You must depart quickly.

162
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,460
As for me, due to my health,

163
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,620
I will stay here and wait
for your triumphant return.

164
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,349
I...

165
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,780
Yes!

166
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,060
Wait.

167
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,669
With so many of us,

168
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,229
we'll surely alert them.

169
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,709
I know Qingfeng Stronghold well.

170
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,029
I'll scout ahead first,

171
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,460
you wait here for my news.

172
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,700
Yes.

173
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,580
Don't follow me.

174
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,460
Boss.

175
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,420
We've been ambushed.

176
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,180
Brother!

177
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,340
Brother!

178
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,469
Boss, there's an ambush!

179
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,580
Boss.

180
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,709
Brother!

181
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,860
Boss.

182
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,869
How could this happen?

183
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,700
Boss.

184
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,300
We've been ambushed.

185
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,180
Fatty!

186
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,980
Fatty!

187
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,589
I've been ambushed!

188
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,180
Where are my men?

189
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,820
Where are my men?

190
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,060
(Why is there no one in the fort?)

191
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,820
Li Chengyu.

192
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,940
I'll kill you.

193
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,660
Ah, I...

194
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,420
General, what's wrong?

195
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,580
As expected of a general.

196
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,700
In such a short time, a single person
has killed so many bandits.

197
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,229
Isn't there still one left?

198
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,989
Capture him for me.

199
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,709
Yes.

200
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,700
Go!

201
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,869
Don't move.

202
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,949
Sir, here you go.

203
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,540
Eat this.

204
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,220
Move faster.

205
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,940
Where did you go?

206
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,949
I thought something happened to you.

207
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,660
They've left.

208
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,469
I went to deliver wine to Mr. Qian.

209
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,820
I heard people from
Shihou Stronghold have arrived.

210
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,820
(Qingfeng Stronghold)
Hurry!

211
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,389
Sir, he's also a bandit.

212
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,180
Why don't you catch him?

213
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,709
Do you even know who he is?

214
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,469
Sir, ignore his nonsense.
Take him back and interrogate properly.

215
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,989
Use all 18 tortures.

216
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,300
Yes.

217
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,229
You little pretty boy.

218
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,989
You'll meet a miserable end.

219
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,860
You little pretty boy!

220
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,940
General.

221
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,760
Why are you only catching men?

222
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,229
Wasn't Qingfeng Stronghold supposed
to be a women's stronghold?

223
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,869
Information is outdated, huh?

224
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,989
Qingfeng Stronghold isn't
what you think it is,

225
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,629
a bandit fort dominated by women.

226
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,869
But Minister Li said...

227
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,109
What does he know?
Has he ever been here personally?

228
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,229
Have you been here personally?

229
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,980
You've been here, haven't you?

230
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,869
I saw it with my own eyes.

231
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,389
These men are the main force
of Qingfeng Stronghold.

232
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,829
The rumors about women

233
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,469
were meant to trick you
into becoming slaves and soldiers.

234
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,109
Now that you've captured them,

235
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,349
it's already a great achievement.

236
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,869
Take them back and claim your merit.

237
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,829
But Minister Li said

238
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,420
we must capture Chen Xinrou alive.

239
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,720
Who's the general here?
Will you obey the orders?

240
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,629
If you don't, and something goes wrong,
how many heads will you answer with?

241
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,940
I dare not. Only the general's orders
are to be followed.

242
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,869
Alright then.

243
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,309
Take them back.

244
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,469
I'll personally handle Chen Xinrou.

245
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,389
Yes.

246
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,540
Let's go.

247
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,229
Chengyu,

248
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,980
why did you come alone?

249
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,180
You didn't catch Chen Xinrou?

250
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,460
Chen Xinrou can't be caught.

251
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,700
Why?

252
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,860
I suspect the evidence is flawed.

253
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,820
What's wrong with it?

254
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,100
Not clear yet.

255
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,509
But think about it,

256
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,860
if this evidence is indeed flawed,

257
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,069
and we capture her,

258
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,220
it would be like making the Emperor
misunderstand the Chancellor.

259
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,989
Look, I'm a military man.

260
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,829
I fight on the battlefield every day.

261
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,589
I'm not afraid,

262
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,740
but you're a civil official.

263
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,180
You bow to the Chancellor
day in and day out.

264
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,660
It wouldn't look good
if faces were torn apart.

265
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,629
How could it?

266
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,229
If the truth is found,

267
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,580
I'll personally go apologize.

268
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,300
But this thorn is already
deeply lodged in the Chancellor's heart.

269
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,060
The Li family will be criticized.

270
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,709
What will the Emperor think?

271
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,820
We would have falsely accused
the Chancellor for no reason.

272
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,349
Who takes the hit?

273
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,820
The Emperor's face,

274
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,460
or ours?

275
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,940
This...

276
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,309
Look,

277
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,469
today wasn't entirely fruitless.

278
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,340
We did catch that man, right?

279
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,629
He's also a leader.

280
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,869
You'll take him back
for secret interrogation.

281
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,820
I'll stay at Qingfeng Stronghold
to continue investigating.

282
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,349
Once I find clues,

283
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,460
I'll report to the Emperor.

284
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,740
(Looks like he's convinced.)

285
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,700
But capturing Chen Xinrou
is the Emperor's order.

286
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,420
Chengyu, this isn't your nature.

287
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,300
You resist in every way,

288
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,540
are there any hidden reasons?

289
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,309
There definitely aren't.

290
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,980
I'm just afraid the Emperor
will misunderstand.

291
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,740
Do you really think

292
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,340
the Emperor wants the truth
about the rebellion?

293
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,180
As long as it's the Chancellor,

294
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,820
the truth doesn't matter.
