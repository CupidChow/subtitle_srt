=Recruit a General to Lead the Troops=

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,550
Was I wrong?

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,150
Because of me,

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,510
Dongfang Shan is dead,

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,670
and Cold Tiger's been caught.

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,430
If I keep digging,

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,150
how many more people
will get caught up in this?

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,270
Am I really just a tiny stone powerless

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,150
to move this mighty river?

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,270
Will it just swallow me whole?

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,990
Well done.

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,879
You're not completely useless.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,270
Stay out of sight from now on.

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,910
Thank you, Mysterious Sir.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,270
I'll take my leave now.

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,159
Sir, why don't we just destroy

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,150
the evidence Dongfang Shan had?

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,910
Destroy it?

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,350
That would be a waste.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,510
I just need to tweak it a bit,

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,150
and the evidence will point
to the Chancellor.

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,030
If we say Li Chengyu discovered it,

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,190
His Majesty would have no reason
not to believe.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,670
What is our next step then?

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,159
Once His Majesty gets that evidence,

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,950
the Chancellor's treason
will be a sure thing.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,030
All we have to do now
is capture Chen Xinrou,

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,750
then their fates will be sealed.

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,719
Our priority

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,039
is to get Li Chengyu.

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,959
I have big plans.

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,070
We can't let him ruin my plans.

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,279
Sir, Li Chengyu gives me

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,599
a headache.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,559
He's too strong.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,310
We've tried every trick but to no avail.

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,399
Didn't you catch one of his men?

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,630
Do you need me

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,350
to show you how to get it done?

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,790
Like trapping a turtle in a jar.

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,159
Your Majesty,
Minister Li presented the evidence.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,510
These two arrowheads
were made by Li Fang.

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,590
In his will, Li Fang said

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,719
he forged weapons

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,719
at the Chancellor's orders
at Qingfeng Stronghold,

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,670
intending to rebel.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,070
Good.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,230
Send immediate orders to detain

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,559
and interrogate the Chancellor.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,159
Deliver this imperial decree

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,510
to wherever Li Chengyu is at once.

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,670
General,

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,190
when the prefectural magistrate
was around,

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,599
I had no choice.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,439
The bodies were still there.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,399
I had to keep up appearances.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,439
Otherwise, it would be suspicious.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,559
Even with
the prefectural magistrate gone,

61
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,159
I must ensure my own safety.

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,999
That's why

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,279
I brought you here today,
to discuss how to handle Cold Tiger.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,559
He's accused

65
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,390
of murder.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,910
By law, he is to be executed.

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,879
I have two ways

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,359
to handle this.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,879
First,

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,879
you reveal your identity
to the prefectural magistrate.

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,719
If you're truly a general,

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,070
killing one man is no big deal.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,150
The other option is...

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,230
to trade a life for a life.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,070
Chengyu,

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,950
you came to save me...

77
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,950
So this is what you mean

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,479
by "discuss"?

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,599
He's a person, not some beast!

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,070
General Li, you know how it is.

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,590
I can't refuse

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,150
the prefectural magistrate's orders.

83
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,719
See? As soon as the magistrate left,

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
I brought you here

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,950
to take your subordinate away.

86
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,590
Release him! Now!

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,710
Men.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,130
- Cold Tiger...
- Chengyu...

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,039
You've suffered.

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,470
Not really.

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,590
Can I go back now?

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,950
I came to save you.

93
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,150
Of course, I'll get you out of here.

94
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,599
All right.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,750
Let's go.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,159
Let's go...

97
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,390
Let's go home...

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,999
Make sure he's secured.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,070
Make it tight.

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,679
Chengyu!

101
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,590
Chengyu, what's going on?

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,590
Let him go!

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,710
Why are you tying him up?

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,119
Please!

105
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,719
Please let him go!

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,919
Let Chengyu go!

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,999
Let him go!

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,270
Cold Tiger.

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,030
Chengyu...

110
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,150
What's going on?

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,239
Why did he tie you up?

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,390
Cold Tiger.

113
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,150
Stop crying.

114
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,270
You're not a little girl.

115
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,239
You won't get a wife like this.

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,390
Do you understand?

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,999
Why did they make you take my place?

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,479
I'm not leaving.

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,910
Cold Tiger.

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,470
I'm investigating them.

121
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,390
I'm bluffing them.

122
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,470
This is the only way
we can get to the truth.

123
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,350
I'm giving you a task.

124
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,470
Go back to Qingfeng Stronghold

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,950
and protect it.

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,559
Go.

127
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,830
Why did they tie you up...

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,150
Go, Cold Tiger.

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,919
I won't...

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,350
Go!

131
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,590
Are you sure you'll be all right?

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,790
I'll wait for you
at Qingfeng Stronghold.

133
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,710
Li Chengyu, Li Chengyu,

134
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,350
you're finally in my hands!

135
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,390
Isn't this just what you wanted?

136
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,359
I never thought

137
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,350
you'd be so loyal.

138
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,559
You'd actually let yourself
be chained up

139
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,950
for one of your men.

140
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,830
I should have killed you immediately,

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,230
but you're too useful alive.

142
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,919
I won't let you die so easily.

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,390
Li Chengyu.

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,350
I'm going to make sure you suffer!

145
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,999
Sir.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,119
Be careful how far you push it.

147
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,839
Don't kill him

148
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,359
before we catch Chen Xinrou.

149
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,230
Understood.

150
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,230
I've already ordered my men
to search the holiday resort.

151
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,359
I'll need a reason

152
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,879
to shut down

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,399
Qingfeng Stronghold too.

154
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,319
Good.

155
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,999
Oh, right.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,550
What about the female bandits, sir?

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,870
Handle them however you want.
All I care about is Chen Xinrou.

158
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,479
Sir,

159
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,999
everything is ready.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,350
Tomorrow, we move on to Qingfeng
Stronghold to capture Chen Xinrou.

161
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:16,655
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

162
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,092
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
Sir!

164
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,479
What are you panicking about?

165
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,800
Sir, we can't get into Qingfeng Stronghold.

166
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Chen Xinrou and her people
have the place completely sealed off.

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Our leader is dead,
and we can't take a single step inside.

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,479
Order our men to retreat.

169
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,719
Spread the word

170
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,879
that tomorrow's the day
they behead Li Chengyu.

171
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,710
Yes, sir.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,710
I'm sure that will get

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,710
Chen Xinrou to show up.

174
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,842
(Notice)

175
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,079
Look!

176
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,350
Come see this new notice!

177
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:09,842
(Notice)

178
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,417
(Notice)

179
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,350
The odds are unclear.

180
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,750
I want to save him.

181
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,639
Leader, think this through carefully.

182
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,950
He's now a wanted criminal.

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,310
Saving him means
the end of Qingfeng Stronghold.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
Either we fail the rescue
and he's executed on the spot,

185
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,950
or we spend
the rest of our lives on the run.

186
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,990
Leader.

187
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,950
I trust your judgment.

188
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,710
Me too.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,950
I may not know much,

190
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,479
but Chengyu is definitely not

191
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
the heinous criminal
the county magistrate

192
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,350
is making him out to be.

193
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,999
He doesn't deserve to die.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,759
I think this is just a false charge
made up by the county magistrate

195
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,870
to get rid of Yulang.

196
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,350
Sir.

197
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,590
Everything for tomorrow's ambush is set.

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,759
If Chen Xinrou and her group
dare show up,

199
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,590
they won't leave alive.

200
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,950
They're going to execute him.

201
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,710
They're going to execute him.

202
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,110
We're limited in numbers.

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,470
To succeed,

204
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,350
we have to outsmart them.

205
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,350
Tomorrow, the southeast wind will blow.

206
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,590
Erniang,

207
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,310
find a tower in the northwest corner
and scatter flower petals there.

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,470
The petals will be coated with poison.

209
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,950
This will help knock out
most of those at the scene.

210
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,190
I'll go to the capital to verify
the arrest warrant's authenticity.

211
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,599
See if any higher official
can intervene to save Li Chengyu.

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,479
Minmin,
prepare the carriages for a getaway

213
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,399
outside the city.

214
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,470
Got it.

215
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,550
Lianxin, Cold Tiger, and I
will spread out

216
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,350
around the execution ground,

217
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,990
ready to launch the rescue

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,310
at any moment.

219
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,599
They're all just commoners.

220
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,310
There are no officials here.

221
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,950
Li Chengyu,

222
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,759
the people coming to save you
are all right here.

223
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,070
No one's getting away!

224
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,479
It is the hour of Wu.

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,350
Execute him!

226
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,280
