=Recruit A General to Lead the Troops=

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,340
Hey.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,669
What are you doing?

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,540
Why is it always fighting and killing?

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,860
Do all Death Servants have unique marks?

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,620
Courting death.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,589
Why did you not dodge?

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,549
How could I dodge?

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,660
You are a martial master. I am not.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,660
Hey.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,540
It is this mark.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,740
I am really curious.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,600
You are a Death Servant,

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,889
so how did you become
the Fourth Boss of Qingfeng Stronghold?

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,940
None of your concern.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,949
You will not say?

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,749
If you will not,
I will go find Chen Xinrou.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,949
I will tell her

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,629
that her Fourth Boss
only pretends to be loyal,

21
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,989
when in truth she is a Death Servant
of unknown origin.

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,620
I will have her drive you out.

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,780
She will never believe such nonsense.

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,620
She may not have before,

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,780
but just now Shihou Stronghold sent
Death Servants into Qingfeng Stronghold.

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,429
And you just happen to be one yourself.

27
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,140
Do you not think she will suspect you?

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,549
And once suspicion arises,

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,140
the charge will stand.

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,149
At that point, whether you are or not,

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,700
she will cast you out.

32
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,340
I cannot leave.

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,989
Cannot leave?

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,789
Why not?

35
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,980
I am her Shadow.

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,700
My purpose in life is to protect her.

37
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,780
A Shadow must not be seen.

38
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,540
That is the rule.

39
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,220
Then how did you become her Shadow?

40
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,149
You ask too many questions.

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,989
Still not speaking?

42
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,549
Then I will tell her.

43
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,700
Stop.

44
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,549
Wealthy nobles
choose children without parents

45
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,789
and train them as Death Servants,

46
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,869
to serve them.

47
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,540
I was one of those.

48
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,500
Then,

49
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,949
what did they have you do?

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,300
Kill.

51
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,949
The Leader's father chose me

52
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,589
to be her only Death Servant.

53
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,500
Then how did you become the Fourth Boss?

54
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,020
That year,

55
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,709
the Leader fled
from her marriage into the outskirts.

56
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,100
She accidentally fell into the water.

57
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,220
Later, as you know,

58
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,900
she was captured by Shihou Stronghold.

59
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,620
Bullied day after day.

60
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,780
And I could not reveal myself
to save her.

61
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,589
I am a Death Servant.

62
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,340
My heart should feel no pain.

63
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,220
But when I saw her being bullied,

64
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,100
my heart twisted like a knife.

65
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,549
I revealed myself

66
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,900
and protected her.

67
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,060
That day, I was ready to leave.

68
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,340
Heroine.

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,900
Stay with us.

70
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,180
Let us be good friends from now on.

71
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,660
She is the only one
who treats me like family.

72
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,749
So I must protect her,

73
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,780
and never let anyone hurt her.

74
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,740
It is best she never learns of this.

75
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,900
So you must not reveal a single word.

76
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,060
Do not worry, I will not tell.

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,709
She sees you as a sister,

78
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,340
I see you as a brother.

79
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,220
And between brothers,
there must be trust.

80
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,989
My dear Leader,

81
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,300
how could you let them stay?

82
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,549
Having one man in the stronghold

83
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,149
was already annoying enough.

84
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,029
Now look at this,

85
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,549
there are four more.

86
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,940
If this continues,

87
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,940
our stronghold will turn
into a den of men.

88
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,740
If Li Chengyu wants them here,
then let them stay.

89
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,500
Leader.

90
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,900
Do you truly
have feelings for Li Chengyu?

91
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,620
How could that be?

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,580
Was it not you who said marrying a husband
would be good for the stronghold?

93
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,507
(Qingfeng Stronghold.
Yuchang Hot Springs)

94
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,260
Beautiful sisters, come take a look.

95
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,429
Step right up and see for yourselves.

96
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,669
Do you all feel itchy?

97
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,183
By chance, my brother

98
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,440
(Yuchang Hot Springs)
has just built the Yuchang Hot Springs.

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,780
Yeah. Yuchang Hot Springs.

100
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,620
As the name suggests,

101
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,060
it is a place for bathing and changing.

102
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,469
Hot water in abundance.

103
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,029
You may bathe and soak.

104
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,469
Snacks are plentiful.

105
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,669
So what are you waiting for?

106
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,229
Come inside and enjoy a bath.

107
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,580
Blow bubbles, splash water.

108
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,060
Hey, all of you, come here.

109
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,340
Hey, hey, do not leave.

110
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,229
You would dare
enter a place built by men?

111
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,909
Is it not filthy?
Are you not afraid of the stench?

112
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,349
Disperse, all of you.

113
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,500
Go about your business, quickly.

114
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,029
Qiu Erniang.

115
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,989
Even Chen Xinrou did not interfere,
so why are you making trouble here?

116
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,109
And you dare call me filthy?

117
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,700
I say you are the one
who is filthy for not bathing.

118
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,060
You must not offend Erniang.

119
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,709
Back in the day, her man

120
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,989
was a minor leader
of Qingfeng Stronghold.

121
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,669
At that time, Liu Pitang was the Leader.

122
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,349
In order to please Liu Pitang,

123
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,940
that minor leader
offered Erniang to him.

124
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,429
That very night,

125
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,469
a bolt of lightning

126
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,020
struck down
and killed her man on the spot.

127
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,549
When Liu Pitang saw it,

128
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,580
he thought, this woman is ominous.

129
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,940
So he dared not touch her.

130
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,229
From then on,

131
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,549
Erniang came to despise men.

132
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,589
And men in turn

133
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,349
did not dare to go near her,

134
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,140
fearing a terrible death.

135
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,349
No wonder she is so wild,

136
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,940
and hates men so deeply.

137
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,500
How do you know this so clearly?

138
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,349
Do you like her?

139
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,900
Hahaha, brother,

140
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,229
what are you saying?

141
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,589
Even if I did like her,

142
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,989
I am timid.

143
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,340
I fear death.

144
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,589
In those years,

145
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,349
I was just a water-carrying bandit
in Qingfeng Stronghold.

146
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,709
Relying on my cleverness,

147
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,349
I rose step by step
to become the Second Boss.

148
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,109
Come, applaud.

149
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,669
Applaud, hahaha.

150
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,429
So if you want to open this hot spring,

151
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,340
you must first deal with Qiu Erniang.

152
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,460
But handling Erniang is no easy task.

153
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,469
She trusts no one.
She believes only in fate.

154
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,700
Every time she delivers goods
down the mountain,

155
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,909
she goes to
the Matchmaker Temple to pray.

156
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,700
Matchmaker Temple?

157
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,820
Tomorrow, she will deliver
another batch of goods.

158
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,589
Why are you helping me?

159
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,460
Do you like me?

160
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,669
Brother.

161
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,789
This Erniang,

162
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,109
she hates men so much.

163
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,709
Why does she go
to the Matchmaker Temple?

164
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,407
(Matchmaker Temple.)

165
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,789
(The more she despises men,)

166
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,580
(the more she longs for one.)

167
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,500
This fortune slip.

168
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,380
Congratulations, young lady.

169
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,909
This is the best of fortunes.

170
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,029
Your destined one will soon arrive.

171
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,700
When you return home,

172
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,780
at the moment you step inside the gate,

173
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,220
walk straight for fifty steps,

174
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,229
then turn east for thirty more,

175
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,549
and enter the house.

176
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,700
There you will meet your destined one.

177
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,820
Thank you, Master.

178
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,020
Old man, much obliged.

179
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,380
General Li, you are too polite.

180
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,140
(What is that smell on these clothes?)

181
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,420
Welcome, Second Boss,
to give your guidance.

182
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,229
I never expected

183
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,189
the first guest of the hot spring
would be you, Second Boss.

184
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,220
Let me show you around.

185
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,869
This large pool behind me,

186
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,469
that is the hot spring area.

187
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,709
It is where the ladies may bathe.

188
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,060
Now, look this way.

189
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,349
Behind this curtain

190
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,820
is where the ladies change clothes.

191
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,300
Follow me.

192
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,469
Here is a mirror.

193
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,709
Cosmetics are over here.

194
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,629
This side

195
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,869
is for the ladies to freshen up

196
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,660
and put on their make-up again.

197
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,460
And here is even better.

198
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,469
There is a shower area,

199
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,100
and a place for scrubbing.

200
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,340
Second Boss.

201
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,740
Let me ask you something.

202
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,420
If you do not like someone,

203
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,820
and even dislike him greatly,

204
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,749
but fate has arranged
that he is your destined one,

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,540
what would you choose?

206
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,060
I would choose to accept fate.

207
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,820
But I truly detest that person.

208
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,580
Fate is the greatest
of all arrangements.

209
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,749
Forgive me, Leader.

210
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,540
Let us bathe together.

211
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,869
Second Boss.

212
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,589
That is not what I meant.

213
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,460
Sometimes fate depends on the person.

214
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,340
Yulang.

215
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,869
(Qingfeng Stronghold, Yuchang Hot Springs)
Beautiful ladies, come and see.

216
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,300
Take a look.

217
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,509
Your Second Boss
is already inside, bathing.

218
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,509
Blowing bubbles and splashing about.

219
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,229
What are you still waiting for?

220
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,109
Say it.

221
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,940
Welcome.

222
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,740
Welcome.

223
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,660
Make some bubbles.

224
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,540
Blow some bubbles.

225
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,300
Between these two mountains
there is only one river.

226
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,229
And that Qingfeng Stronghold

227
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,700
has been taken by them.

228
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,229
I have not bathed for half a year.

229
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,420
It itches terribly.

230
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,469
Tell me, those women in that stronghold,

231
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,740
what did they build?

232
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,460
Yuchang Hot Springs.

233
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,829
It was Cold Tiger and Li Chengyu.

234
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,629
They dug through
the well at Qingfeng's gate.

235
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,469
What?

236
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,709
Huzi did not die?

237
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,629
No.

238
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,629
Go.

239
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,469
Find someone to finish him off for me.

240
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,109
Half a month's work,

241
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,069
and today is
the Best Stronghold Member Ceremony.

242
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,940
The award can belong to no one but me.

243
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,740
Is that not Shihou Stronghold?

244
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,420
Damn, that is
the well linked to my hot spring.

245
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,180
They have ruined my plan.

246
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,460
Do not run.

247
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,940
Mischievous.

248
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,060
So mischievous.

249
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,989
Chengyu, this Yuchang Hot Springs
is truly delightful.

250
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,940
It seems men are not entirely useless.

251
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,469
No wonder the Leader kept them here.

252
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,180
Yes, though our monthly
expenses have risen.

253
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,709
But I think Chengyu
is really a good man.

254
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,109
Not only did he build this hot spring
for everyone's benefit,

255
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,420
he also asks for no silver in return.

256
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,589
A few days ago he asked me
about the Best Stronghold Member.

257
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,540
Why is he doing all this?

258
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,340
He went to such lengths
to build Yuchang Hot Springs.

259
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,589
There must be a reason.

260
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,980
Sisters,

261
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,340
perhaps you could find
a chance to test him for me.

262
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,420
How should we test him?

263
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,940
I do not know either.

264
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,820
Oh, stop fooling around.

265
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,660
Sorry, sorry.

266
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,620
