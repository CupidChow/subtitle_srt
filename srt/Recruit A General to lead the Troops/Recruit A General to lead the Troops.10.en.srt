=Recruit A General to lead the Troops=

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,509
You still don't understand,

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,869
as long as it's the Chancellor,

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,020
the truth doesn't matter.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,909
The Emperor used to give orders,

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,149
you never hesitated,

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,900
but this time...

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,980
You're not really falling
for Chen Xinrou, are you?

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,220
Impossible.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,220
She has a fierce face.

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,620
I'm not blind.

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,420
Then take people
to capture her immediately.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,620
No!

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,860
Okay.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,900
Even if I really have feelings for her,

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,820
can you give me some time?

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm begging you.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,060
Okay.

20
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,420
We are brothers.

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,260
There must be no rift.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,700
Then...

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,620
I'll go delay the Emperor a bit more.

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,789
Ah.

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,789
That's my good big brother.

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,869
By the way,

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,060
I have one more favor to ask.

28
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,420
Speak.

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,780
Whether that man we caught today

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,860
is guilty or not,

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,900
help me kill him.

32
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,349
He didn't do anything to you, right?

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,340
I won't let him get away.

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,620
He can't do anything to me.

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,260
I understand.

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,220
You want to stand up for Chen Xinrou.

37
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,420
Let's go, I'll escort you back.

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,060
Don't worry, I'll still be
in the role of the steward.

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,149
I just want to see

40
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,220
what kind of girl
could make you fall for her.

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,709
Go.

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,620
Please.

43
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,269
Aotian.

44
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,429
Why do you insist on

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,669
going up the mountain?

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,109
Look at your cough.

47
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,429
I want to see if you're doing well.

48
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,220
I worry about you.

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,780
By the way, they're...

50
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,269
They're not targeting you,

51
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,220
they're targeting every man.

52
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,900
No men are allowed in this stronghold.

53
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,460
Who is he?

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,500
You misunderstood.

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,869
This is Mr. Qian,

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,740
newly hired steward at the winery.

57
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,709
We helped each other
take down Shihou Stronghold.

58
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,109
Mr. Qian also shone.

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,620
They're here to give gifts.

60
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,669
From the head steward
to the servants, all are like this.

61
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,269
No rules.

62
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,020
Just walked straight in.

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,620
He has no manners,

64
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,900
don't you understand, Yulang?

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,869
Yulang?

66
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,900
It's my first time
hearing this title too.

67
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,829
Enough.

68
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,500
The gift has been delivered. Go away.

69
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,269
(I know your whole family was wronged.)

70
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,220
(I can save you,)

71
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,220
(but you must do something for me.)

72
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,780
Your Majesty.

73
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,109
How is the situation over there?

74
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,380
Allow me to report in detail.

75
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,029
This mission relied on Chengyu
leading troops up the mountain,

76
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,669
many bandits captured.

77
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,669
The leader seems related to treason,

78
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,700
already imprisoned in the capital,

79
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,260
but Chengyu thinks
Qingfeng Stronghold has other secrets.

80
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,269
The evidence seems questionable too.

81
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,340
He doesn't want to alert them,

82
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,500
and plans to stay in Qingfeng Stronghold
to investigate further.

83
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,789
Requesting more time from Your Majesty.

84
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,900
Chengyu will see this matter
through to the end.

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,500
Not completely without results, right?

86
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,340
Minister Li.

87
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,820
Since you are already involved in this,

88
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,340
I will leave this case in your hands.

89
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,909
Work with Chengyu,
coordinate inside and outside,

90
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,460
annihilate the rebels in one move.

91
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

92
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,700
Lianxin.

93
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,820
What are you doing? Having a meeting?

94
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,029
Can't you see?

95
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,589
Four of them fighting for territory.

96
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,140
Fighting for territory?

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,140
I plan to take this hill
of Shihou Stronghold,

98
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,460
so I let them four figure out
what they can do here.

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,989
After one night, hmph.

100
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,469
Look how spacious it is.

101
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,109
Of course, it's for me to cook.

102
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,820
Or to dry flower petals.

103
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,989
A training ground.

104
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,589
Let's open a school.

105
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,580
I think learning is more important.

106
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,349
If you ask me,

107
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,669
these four leaders

108
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,060
are quite busy.

109
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,580
Why not let me renovate this place?

110
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,149
I have an idea.

111
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,319
I want to open a holiday resort.

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,229
(Yuchang Hot Springs)

113
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,269
(Qingfeng Stronghold
has a women's hot spring.)

114
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,820
(Shihou Stronghold should have
a men's hot spring too.)

115
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,549
(Considering parents bringing kids,)

116
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,720
(Advertisement promotion)
(and kids have endless energy.)

117
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,589
(If kids are happy,
parents will naturally bring them.)

118
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,109
(Dad's dad is grandpa.)

119
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,669
(Mom's mom is grandma.)

120
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,260
(Ring toss,)

121
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,460
(claw machine,)

122
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,260
(and other small games,)

123
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,789
(plus some more)

124
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,020
(Shihou Stronghold's
natural advantages.)

125
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,669
You rascal, let me chop you to death!

126
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,789
Hey, Second Lady!

127
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,140
Don't hit people!

128
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,820
Everything needed is here,

129
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,380
but something feels missing.

130
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,380
Got it,

131
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,700
How could we miss

132
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,580
"House of Joy"?

133
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:36,207
(House of Joy)

134
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,349
Come, let's drink.

135
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,420
Thirsty?

136
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,069
Didn't expect our "House of Joy"

137
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,460
to be this fun.

138
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,660
Here, I toast you.

139
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,660
Drinking straight is boring, let's play.

140
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,869
You can play dice too?

141
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,820
Here.

142
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:25,945
(Drink no riding, ride no drinking)

143
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,660
Hmm.

144
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,860
Haha.

145
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,700
Li Chengyu.

146
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,300
I want to tell you something
from my heart.

147
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,060
We really thank you

148
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,220
for helping us
destroy Shihou Stronghold.

149
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,820
Everyone was actually very happy
about your arrival

150
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,340
and willing to accept you.

151
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,060
But...

152
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,540
I still feel unhappy

153
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,660
because Liu Pitang

154
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,460
killed so many of my brothers
and sisters.

155
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,580
I feel...

156
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,109
I really feel useless.

157
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,300
Xinrou.

158
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,300
You're drunk,

159
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,660
have a strawberry.

160
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,340
Don't worry.

161
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,980
I promise, I won't let him live.

162
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,660
- Really?
- Really.

163
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,700
I'll take you somewhere.

164
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,700
Let's go.

165
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:19,170
(Treasure Pavilion)

166
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,220
Hurry up.

167
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,100
Hey.

168
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,100
Why did you bring me here?

169
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,195
(Account book)

170
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,460
Found it.

171
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,860
Oh.

172
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,700
This big gold bracelet.

173
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,940
One for you, one for me.

174
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,940
Don't take it without my permission.

175
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,220
Wasn't there something missing inside?

176
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,060
Missing what?

177
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,300
Seems like a few account books
are missing.

178
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,420
That's not important.

179
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,189
(Not important?
Those account books are all evidence.)

180
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,820
(How can it be unimportant?)

181
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,660
(Look at her expression,)

182
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,109
(she really doesn't know.)

183
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,060
Actually, I have a secret
I want to tell you,

184
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,820
but I never figured out how to say it.

185
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,540
I think when two people are together,
they should be honest with each other.

186
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,420
Actually, I don't belong here either.

187
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,509
(I'm just a medicine apprentice
who can even mispick herbs.)

188
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,069
(Once when I went up the mountain
