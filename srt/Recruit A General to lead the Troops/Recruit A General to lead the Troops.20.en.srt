=Episode 20=

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,230
Chengyu,

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,350
that's not how you play Go.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,510
If you want to play with me,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,710
you have to follow my rules.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,919
This is five in a row.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,390
I win.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,799
Fine,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,070
you win.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,270
I'm going to win, no matter what.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,879
You've been through so much danger

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,590
and yet you're still alive and here.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,550
That's really something.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,110
Just fortunate, that's all.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,670
Oh, right.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,270
The Chancellor has been arrested.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,910
How do you feel about that?

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,070
Aren't you worried about Chen Xinrou

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,790
if you take her back?

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,510
I already told His Majesty
your thoughts.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,559
If he believed us, he'd wait longer

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,630
instead of arresting the Chancellor
as soon as the evidence came through.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,990
I told you,

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,990
His Majesty just wants
to eliminate the Chancellor

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,550
once and for all.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,990
If you bring Xinrou back,

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,510
she's as good as dead.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,150
Do you think Chen Xinrou is innocent?

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,230
I have my ways to convince His Majesty
that she's not guilty.

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,510
Very well.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,150
We'll go back together tomorrow.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,510
Report!

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,719
General.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,710
Sir.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,240
Chen Xinrou poisoned the prison guard.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,140
She threatened that the guard would die
if she doesn't get to see General Li.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,030
What?

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,070
Do you still believe
Chen Xinrou is innocent?

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,679
Ma'am, please, give me the antidote...

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,999
I don't want to die.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,679
I'm just a prison guard.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,279
Please...

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,110
Then why don't you hand over the keys?

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,910
Let him go.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,630
I know you gave him a tonic.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,510
A tonic?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,350
You scoundrel!

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,190
You wanted to see me.

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,350
I'm here now.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,510
Say whatever

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,599
you want,

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,670
curse me all you like.

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,039
Shouldn't you say something to me?

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,190
- You're the one who wanted to see me.
- Yes, but...

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm waiting

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,510
for your explanation.

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,590
I...

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,510
Fine.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,470
You won't say it?

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,350
Fine, I'll say it then.

62
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,710
Li Chengyu.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,950
Do you know
what it feels like to be betrayed

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,070
by someone you care about?

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,270
You're a general?

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,279
Yes.

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,510
You came to Qingfeng Stronghold looking

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,910
for proof of treason?

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,119
Yes.

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,150
You're investigating me.

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,590
Yes.

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,150
Once you get the evidence,

73
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,950
you're going
to destroy Qingfeng Stronghold.

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,999
Isn't that right?

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,830
Yes!

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,559
But...

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,350
I don't want to hear your excuses!

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,710
Everything happening now

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,230
is exactly how you planned it.

80
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,679
You pretended to be a farmer,

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,390
married into my family,

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,950
and earned the trust of me
and the other leaders.

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,439
Then, in our darkest hour,
you make your move

84
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,710
so we're grateful to you.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,470
Everything you've done
was part of your plan.

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,799
Were Liu Pitang
and that corrupt official

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,950
your accomplices too?

88
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,150
Don't touch me!

89
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,919
It's not what you think.

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,470
Then what is the truth?

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,910
I never truly understood you,

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,950
and you never saw me
as one of your own.

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,150
If you weren't plotting against me,

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,470
what reason would you have

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,150
to keep me,
the person involved, in the dark?

96
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,350
If you want to find evidence,

97
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,470
why don't you ask me?

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,950
Why not ask what I think,

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,799
whether I'm involved?

100
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,950
- Because I didn't want you dragged into this!
- But I already am!

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,950
Qingfeng Stronghold, my friends,
we're all tangled up in this now.

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,239
And now I'm locked up in this dungeon

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,150
all because of you!

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,950
Xinrou,

105
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,599
I can explain...

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,070
Don't touch me!

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,830
Xinrou...

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,830
Get out of my sight!

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,070
General, what's going on?

110
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,030
Nothing. Leave us.

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,710
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,590
Xinrou, take care of yourself

113
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,150
while you're here.

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,510
If danger comes,

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,790
you have to fight back
just like you're doing now.

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,470
Stab hard with the hairpin,

117
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,150
all right?

118
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,990
Still no sign of Qin Manyue?

119
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,119
We didn't ask you to come here to drink!

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,079
How much more are you hiding from us?

121
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,590
And is that imperial decree real?

122
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,199
If you don't come clean today,

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,550
you're not leaving.

124
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,950
Chengyu, we genuinely consider you
part of our family.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,590
Xinrou too.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,239
Even if you stayed silent

127
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,950
to protect us,

128
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,519
how do you know

129
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,239
we're not willing

130
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,590
to share the burden with you and Xinrou?

131
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,719
(The Chancellor has committed suicide
in the capital.)

132
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,950
(The Chancellor has committed suicide
in the capital.)

133
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,350
(The Chancellor is dead.)

134
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,110
(Chen Xinrou is of no use anymore.)

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,750
(In that case...)

136
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,590
Xinrou.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,599
Manyue, what brings you here?

138
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,110
Where are the others?

139
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,710
Li Chengyu let them in last time.

140
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,950
I asked Minister Li to let me in.

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,470
Minister Li?

142
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,590
Li Chengyu's older brother,

143
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,070
Li Aotian?

144
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,070
So he's the one

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,550
you can't stop thinking about.

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,710
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,350
Minister Li sent me,

148
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,750
but I've never done anything
to betray the stronghold.

149
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,350
I only kept daily records.

150
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,470
I haven't told them anything important.

151
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,310
So it was your secret messages
that allowed Li Chengyu

152
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,870
to disguise himself as a farmer
and enter the stronghold.

153
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,310
Thank you for clearing up
many of my doubts.

154
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,750
After all these years as friends,

155
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,950
I'm glad you trusted me enough

156
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,870
to be honest.

157
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,590
Erniang made this for you.

158
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,110
Try it.

159
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,750
All right.

160
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,550
It's good.

161
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,199
You should've

162
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,639
told us sooner!

163
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,550
Even if you only told the three of us,

164
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,590
we could have helped find the evidence.

165
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,350
All men are the same!

166
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,710
So stubborn and prideful!

167
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,710
Even if I'd told you earlier,

168
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,879
you might not have believed me.

169
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,879
Chengyu,

170
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,999
do you know who the real mastermind is?

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,999
Could it be someone

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,470
who's been by your side all along?

173
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,230
Aotian!

174
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,310
I always hold you back.

175
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,959
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,990
If he really wanted
to get rid of the Chancellor

177
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,110
and stage a rebellion,

178
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,070
he would have gone back
to the capital already.

179
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,990
He wouldn't still be here with me.

180
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,190
Because he can't kill you,

181
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,110
he's trying to stop you from returning.

182
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,350
He seemed uneasy about me
returning to the capital with Xinrou.

183
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,950
His arrival did delay me

184
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,950
getting Xinrou back to the capital.

185
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,710
It sounds like

186
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,190
he's trying to keep you from going back.

187
