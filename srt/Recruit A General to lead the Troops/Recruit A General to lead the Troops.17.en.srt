(County Office)

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,390
Sir.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,479
Well, Mysterious Sir...

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,590
Mysterious Sir.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,230
We couldn't find Dongfang Shan.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,559
And Li Chengyu is still alive.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,199
Li Chengyu is still alive?

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,830
And you couldn't locate Dongfang Shan?

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,510
What's the use of having you around?

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,319
Please have mercy on me, sir!

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,190
Please spare my life, Mysterious Sir!

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,270
I bet you're almost recovered.

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,790
Your decoction is nothing but nourishing.
I'm always energetic.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,990
You're glib.

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,750
Xinrou.

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,750
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,790
You've suffered these days.

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,190
I thought you weren't aware of that.

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,510
You were forced
to take in the other woman

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,350
and put up
with Liu Pitang's haughtiness.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,950
Of course you'd feel wronged.

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,159
(Above all, I actually suspected you were
helping Chancellor to stage a rebellion.)

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,670
I felt wronged

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,910
not because of Dongfang Shan
and Liu Pitang.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,510
I knew you took in Dongfang Shan
due to the investigation.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,030
And I was aware Li Pitang's fate
was beyond your control.

29
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,670
It's just that...

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,310
It's just that you never
told me anything.

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,510
It's complicated.

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,070
Once everything is over,

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,590
I'll tell you about it.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,510
Well, promise me,

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,310
don't do Qingfeng Stronghold harm
no matter what.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,910
Don't

37
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,790
hurt yourself too.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,590
Sure, you have my word.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,670
General Li.

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,350
Try this liquor.

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,110
(Liquor)
It's definitely a nice one.

42
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,110
What an unexpected visit,
County Magistrate.

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,759
Why? Are you here to mess with me?

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,510
You're jesting.

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,679
At first, I really had no idea
you're a general.

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,719
Pardon me for that.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,039
You're also the owner of a resort.

48
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,399
There are opportunities
for us to collaborate after this.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,150
Let's get rich together.

50
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,390
You felt sorry for not knowing
that I'm a general.

51
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,950
Yet you had Liu go to Qingfeng Stronghold
to catch me two days ago.

52
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,559
That's a double standard.

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,879
That wasn't my idea.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,599
Don't... Don't get me wrong.

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,999
I just helped Liu

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,470
to take over Mr. Qian's winery.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,679
I was trying to gain something
out of that.

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,599
Oh my!

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,039
Who would have thought
he'd be an ingrate by turning against you

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,479
and sowing discord among us?

61
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,070
He really deserves death!

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,719
He does deserve death.

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,070
Where's his body?

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,039
Well, don't worry.

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,999
I've had my men search the entire city.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,710
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

67
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,119
Today, not only am I here
to apologize to you,

68
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,470
but I'd also like to ask you for a favor.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,950
The prefectural magistrate

70
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,239
is visiting this small town soon.

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,590
And he'd like to hold a banquet

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,070
at some unique inn.

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,830
Having given it a thought,

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,599
I think our holiday resort
is the most unique of all.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,879
You need the support
of these local officials

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,350
to make your business bloom.

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,039
Since you hold a high position,

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,270
naturally, you have no idea
about the way of survival here.

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,999
Suit yourself.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,590
I'm done eating. Please excuse me.

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,590
And take back
that stupid liquor of yours.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,039
That's great news!

83
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,390
You shouldn't say no to it.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,790
If the prefectural magistrate
has a high praise of it,

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,070
our business will prosper for sure.

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,150
I think that cunning official
is up to no good.

87
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,710
Well, if he's cunning,

88
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,390
he'll just order you

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,799
to give him a special banquet.

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,559
Solve that issue

91
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,390
and he won't find fault with you.

92
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,590
I don't think that'll work.

93
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,039
My goodness. Go ask Manyue.

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,510
She's full of peculiar ideas.

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,710
Go on.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,350
Fine.

97
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,390
Didn't I forbid you to send letters?

98
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,710
I only listen to Minister Li.

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,239
I'll explain myself to him.

100
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,150
You'd ruin my plan.

101
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,710
Besides, do you think I'll do you harm?

102
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,150
Isn't Minister Li your brother?

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,270
What's the big deal
with sending him a letter?

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,070
I see, Minister Li is Li Aotian.

105
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,150
Who else could it be?

106
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,470
You do listen to him, huh?

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,590
From now on,

108
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,390
I only do as Minister Li says.

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,710
Back then, my father was
a trivial official in the capital.

110
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,510
He made a reckless mistake,

111
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,710
(and our family ended up in jail.)

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,590
Someone paid to have your life taken!

113
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,679
(Someone was jealous of my father
because of his influential status.)

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,390
(So they wanted to kill us all in jail.)

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,070
(Minister Li took that blow)

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,150
(and saved my life.)

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,390
Guards.

118
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,070
Get these bodies out of here!

119
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,390
If it weren't for him, I would've...

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,150
Do you fancy him?

121
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,110
Well, does he know you like him?

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,190
Minister Li is always occupied.

123
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,430
He doesn't have time for me.

124
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,830
Come on, it's all right.

125
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,950
To my surprise, you're lovesick.

126
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,710
Fine. If there's a chance,
I'll matchmake you two.

127
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,990
Just buy me a meal
when you're together.

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,310
I have an idea about the banquet.

129
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,710
Is this the surprise
you got me, County Magistrate?

130
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,710
Sir.

131
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,470
Pardon me...

132
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,239
Perhaps Mr. Li has forgotten
about the banquet

133
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,470
due to his busy schedule.

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,830
Gosh, I'm not here
for mountain climbing.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,759
With your incompetence,

136
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,479
you might as well resign
and do pig farming.

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,879
My God! Please calm down, sir!

138
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,350
Let me check on it.

139
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,730
(House of Joy)

140
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,470
Mr. Li.

141
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,959
Have you forgotten about

142
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,110
the prefectural magistrate's
banquet here?

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,230
Prefectural Magistrate.

144
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,239
Patient.

145
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,199
I've got you a surprise in there.

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,719
Come, let's go check it out.

147
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,710
Please.

148
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,550
This way, please, sir.

149
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,719
Ready, go!

150
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,750
Welcome!

151
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,359
Isn't this a bathhouse?

152
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,710
There's nothing special about it.

153
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,479
Prefectural Magistrate.

154
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,599
This is no ordinary official banquet.

155
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,399
The highlight is the hot springs here.

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,479
You get to have a foot soak

157
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,959
while enjoying delicious food.

158
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,310
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

159
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,879
Doesn't that sound interesting?

160
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,519
Well, that sounds great.

161
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,110
Nice one!

162
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,070
Visit this place often
and you'll find it fun.

163
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,839
I too find that interesting.

164
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,959
Well, please be seated.

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,190
Don't just stand here.

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,470
Chengyu.

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,110
Chengyu.

168
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,870
What's going on?

169
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,310
Let's go...

170
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,310
Help!

171
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,750
Prefectural Magistrate.

172
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,950
Come here!

173
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,990
Look!

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,350
There's a body in the hot spring.

175
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,359
Li Chengyu.

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,310
You've really got me a big surprise!

177
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,950
Sir.

178
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,870
The County Office received a report
not long ago.

179
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,750
They said Li Chengyu forcibly brought
Dongfang Shan here to the mountain.

180
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,239
She was nowhere to be seen since then.

181
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,950
I also heard

182
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,759
that Li Chengyu tied the knot
with Dongfang Shan

183
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,359
in front

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,990
of everyone.

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,599
I've got it figured out

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,599
now that I'm here.

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,599
He tricked Dongfang Shan
into coming here

188
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,470
and got rid of her!

189
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,350
Stop feigning ignorance!

190
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,079
They may not know what caused
Dongfang Shan's death,

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,119
but I do!

192
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,119
Say something!

193
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,639
I'm the county magistrate.

194
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,710
Stop it, Li Chengyu!

195
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,479
You killed this lady here.

196
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,239
Are you going
to kill an imperial official

197
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,599
in front of us all?

198
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,119
County magistrate, my foot!

199
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,639
You're going against my order here.

200
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,359
How lawless of you!

201
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,079
What are you waiting for?

202
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,079
Catch this murderer!

203
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,599
Chengyu!

204
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,199
Cold Tiger!

205
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,239
Don't kill him!

206
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,110
This has nothing to do with you.

207
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,119
I killed her.

208
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,470
I did!

209
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,430
Just catch me.

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,719
Arrest me.

211
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,990
- What are you doing, Cold Tiger?
- Chengyu.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,950
This woman was being disobedient,

213
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,950
so I killed her.

214
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,070
I threw the body into the water.

215
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,599
But I never thought it'd float.

216
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,639
I killed her.

217
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,759
I did that.

218
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,399
Just catch me.

219
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,639
Here, arrest him.

220
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,759
As long as I'm around,

221
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,959
no one can catch him!

222
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,759
This is a trap, Chengyu.

223
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,190
Don't fall for it.

224
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,830
Chengyu.

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,350
They won't stop
until they get one of us.

226
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,750
The resort has just opened.

227
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,750
It can't do without you.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,350
You can get me

229
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,230
out of jail.

230
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,879
I wouldn't be able to do anything

231
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,190
if you were jailed.

232
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,750
Chengyu.

233
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,990
I'll wait for you.

234
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,750
Just catch me!

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,190
Prefectural Magistrate.

236
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,110
Let's head back too.

237
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,710
Let's go...

238
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,230
What was that?

239
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,710
