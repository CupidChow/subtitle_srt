00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,390
Chengyu!

Chengyu! Chengyu!

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,830
Chengyu!

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,550
Who did this?

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,270
Who did this?

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,270
Help!

9
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:00,830
Help!

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,799
Chengyu...

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,879
You must live,

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,990
Chengyu.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,350
I lost my parents at young age.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,350
I have no one to rely on.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,350
I was fortunate enough to have met you.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,999
If you died,
I'd have no one to rely upon,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,150
Chengyu!

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,799
Don't die,

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,910
Chengyu!

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,070
Help!

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,270
Help!

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,990
Help!

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,719
Chengyu!

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,510
You're making too much noise!

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,990
Chengyu.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,990
You're still alive, Chengyu.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,270
The arrow is poisoned.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,150
Poisoned?

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,150
Luckily, I've had those pills
given by Chen Xinrou.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,990
Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,790
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,910
Cold Tiger.

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,430
What we can do now is keep moving.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,230
Let's see if we can find the exit.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,510
You took the arrow for me.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,110
How do I even repay your kindness?

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,390
Repay, your foot.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,439
There's nothing for you to repay.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,230
Nothing to repay?

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,030
What do you mean?

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,750
Liu Pitang and I made these weapons.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,310
That's a lot.

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,350
Slowly, we need to find

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,910
the way out.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,230
Have a seat here. That's a chair.

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,950
That's scary.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,920
Eh? Wait.

48
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:11,559
Eh? Wait.

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,750
Chengyu.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,310
There are some words here.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,510
What's that?

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,350
Read them out.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,060
I, what Fang...

54
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,070
I, what Fang...

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,750
Fang?

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,390
Li Fang?

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,070
"I, Li Fang, came here under the order
of the Vice Minister of War

58
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:42,043
to find Dongfang Shan
to forge unique weapons.

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,670
I hid myself in Shihou Stronghold,

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,510
secretly making weapons.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,950
But when I heard
the imperial court's siege had failed,

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,350
I feared being exposed.

63
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,910
So I moved out overnight.

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,707
And on the night
of the husband-choosing festival

65
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:03,310
at Qingfeng Stronghold, I disguised myself
as a villager from the Li Family Village

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,392
and slipped the letters exchanged
with the Ministry of War

67
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,070
into the Treasure Pavilion,

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,790
framing Chen Xinrou for it.

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,350
Then I came back here
to clean up the mess.

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,750
But unexpectedly..."

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,479
Where's the rest?

72
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,590
He didn't finish writing it.

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,390
I guess he didn't made it.

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,879
Yes. That must be it.

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,799
Like you, he didn't made it.

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,590
Wait. Chengyu!

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,030
Chengyu!

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,439
Don't die!

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,270
Hang in there, Chengyu!

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,830
I still need you!

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,790
You're my family!

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,350
I can't live without you!

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,710
(I haven't seen Li Chengyu in a day.)

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,710
(Why has he been avoiding me lately?)

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,070
Magistrate.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,350
This is it!

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,719
Li Chengyu is poisoned,

88
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,150
so he can no longer run away.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,359
Search inside!

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,390
Hold on.

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,479
If we unseal the cave,

92
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,950
he'd be able to get away with it.

93
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,599
Get some explosives

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,390
and blow this cave apart.

95
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,950
Blow it apart?

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,350
I should've thought of that.

97
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,479
How wise of you.

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,279
That's brilliant.

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,710
How brilliant.

100
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,359
Mysterious Sir never let us down.
Go get us some explosives here!

101
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,590
- Hurry!
- Quick!

102
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,230
Leader.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,790
Are you worried about Mr. Li?

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,710
I was trying to verify the ledger
with him last night, but he wasn't around.

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,710
Besides, Cold Tiger
was nowhere to be seen too.

106
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,270
Someone

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,790
help us!

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,390
Chengyu is dying! Help!

109
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,470
Chengyu is dying!

110
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,390
He's dying...

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,359
What happened?

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,710
Chengyu has had a poisoned arrow.

113
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,270
A poisoned arrow?

114
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,590
Chengyu? Chengyu?

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,910
Chengyu!

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,350
Quick. It's lethal.

117
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,390
Chengyu.

118
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,070
(Am I leaving soon?)

119
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,710
(I'm just a nobody.)

120
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,950
(Everyone's life is different.)

121
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,950
(But...)

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,790
(But I want to be a hero too.)

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,270
(It feels nice to be one.)

124
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,230
(I want to protect these people.)

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,799
(I want to find out the truth)

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,470
(and prove to Heaven)

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,950
(that a nobody can be a hero as well.)

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,710
Sir.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,710
Now that Li Chengyu is dead,

130
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,470
we're completely free from worries.

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,910
No.

132
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,390
Dongfang Shan is still alive.

133
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,390
I

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,679
will get rid of her.

135
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,830
Go ahead.

136
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,750
Come with me!

137
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,999
What is this, Liu Pitang?

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,599
Well,

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,350
I'm here to seal off Qingfeng Stronghold
on the county magistrate's command.

140
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,110
What are we guilty of?

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,359
(Wanted)
What are you guilty of?

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,759
Dongfang Shan was involved
in making weapons for the rebellion.

143
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,710
And I'm going to arrest her.

144
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,399
Go ahead and search the place!

145
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,550
Stop!

146
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,519
Listen up, Chen Xinrou.

147
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,079
Harboring a wanted criminal

148
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,639
is a capital offense.

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,639
Whoever you're looking for,
he's not here.

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,350
Instead of causing a scene here,
you might as well search elsewhere.

151
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,230
Also, as far as I know,
you're a mere shopkeeper.

152
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,070
Catching criminals
is the officials' job.

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,990
So, what gives you the right
to be barging into here?

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,350
How sharp-tongue you are!

155
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm telling you.

156
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,590
Today, I'm going
to get rid of you all too.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,719
You were safe because of Li Chengyu.

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,710
If not, you'd have been
dealt with long ago.

159
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,759
He's gone now.

160
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,599
Let's see who's going to protect you.

161
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,759
Charge!

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,950
Stop it!

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,190
Who said I'm dead?

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,239
Don't die!

165
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,230
Hang in there, Chengyu!

166
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,590
I still need you!

167
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,110
You're my family!

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,750
I can't live without you!

169
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,430
My parents died when I was young.

170
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,190
I've been all alone.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,350
What are you doing?

172
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,950
Go find the exit.

173
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,710
Chengyu.

174
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,839
There are wind

175
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,110
and a crack.

176
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,759
Is that Li Chengyu?

177
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,119
Oh my goodness!

178
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,479
He's still alive! Run!

179
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,959
Run! Open the door!

180
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,350
Good grief! Quick!

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,350
Li Chengyu!

182
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,830
(I can't stay here any longer.)

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,710
They're trying to catch me.

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,950
And they won't stop until they find me.

185
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,110
Are you leaving?

186
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,070
Qingfeng Stronghold has been
put on the spot because of me.

187
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,070
I'm going north.

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,590
It's where my home is.

189
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,750
If so, could you do me a favor?

190
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,750
What's it?

191
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,350
There are three papers

192
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,590
and two arrows inside.

193
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,990
The first sheet of paper

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,750
is a letter between Li Fang
and the rebels.

195
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,350
The second sheet

196
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,710
is the statement Li Fang made
when he asked you to forge weapons.

197
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,759
The third one is an inscription he left
before he died.

198
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,310
I made a rubbing of it
from the big rock.

199
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,470
As for these two arrows,

200
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,230
one was made by the rebels,

201
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,950
the other by you.

202
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,103
Take all this evidence with you
to the capital

203
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:36,470
and present it to His Majesty.

204
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,750
I believe His Majesty will protect you.

205
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,470
But how do I see His Majesty?

206
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,590
Cold Tiger.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,999
Cold Tiger!

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,590
Chengyu!

209
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,950
Chengyu!

210
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,310
What's the matter, Chengyu?

211
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,590
Are you having
a surge of vitality before death?

212
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,129
Stop cursing me already.

213
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,079
Give me the token.

214
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,350
Oh, the gold medal.

215
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,879
Are you leaving?

216
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,190
Farewell.

217
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,710
Take this token and depart for it.

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,870
Have a safe journey.

219
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,950
If you ever ran into danger,

220
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,710
forget about evidence,

221
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,430
you must save yourself.

222
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,359
If we ever see each other again,

223
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,110
I will

224
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,710
make you a God of War weapon.

225
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,719
See you again,

226
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,070
Li Chengyu.

227
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,359
(I hope)

228
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,950
(I can clear
Qingfeng Stronghold's name.)
