00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:17,750
(Qingfeng Stronghold)

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,039
(Looks like
the Chancellor is losing patience.)

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,270
(We need to move quickly.)

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,710
Did the Chancellor
really plot a rebellion?

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,070
If he didn't,

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,150
then who's the one framing him?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,150
But if he truly is plotting a rebellion,

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,479
does Xinrou know about it?

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,790
You said you were looking into evidence
proving Chen Xinrou's innocence.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,799
His Majesty is pressing
hard for answers.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,870
Have you found anything yet?

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,879
The Chancellor is the Chancellor.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,750
Xinrou is Xinrou.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,270
Even if the Chancellor really did rebel,

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,990
that doesn't mean
Xinrou had any part in it.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,150
But if the Chancellor is innocent,

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,350
and Xinrou truly knows nothing...

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,990
Why was the evidence planted on her

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,350
to frame her?

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,910
Could this arrowhead, like the letters,

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,270
be something Xinrou had no idea about?

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,550
Rebels forged this arrowhead
through Dongfang Shan.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,279
Could Dongfang Shan know

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,150
who's really behind all this?

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,230
If we want to keep digging,

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,790
finding Dongfang Shan is the key.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,230
Leader.

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,910
If you don't know
how to explain it to him,

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,150
then let me do it.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,910
Forget it.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,510
I'll tell him myself.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,990
Yulang.

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,110
I know you
and the Leader share feelings.

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,679
Even though she and I
were brought together by fate,

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,910
but if you truly like the Leader,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,670
I'm not the kind of woman to be petty.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,399
But I've noticed

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,310
that something seems off
between you and the Leader.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,070
Maybe that too is fate.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,070
Perhaps you two
just aren't meant to be.

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,590
Why not try believing in fate for once?

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm not forcing you, though.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,559
Sister Erniang!

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,750
Your kitchen's on fire!

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,999
(Fire?)

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,630
(Got it!)

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,350
You all heard that.

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,950
Oh dear...

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,790
There's nothing we can't talk about.

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,719
Leader, I just want to ask.
Do you actually like Yulang?

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,879
As long as you nod,

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,790
I, Qiu Erniang,
won't even hesitate to withdraw.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,670
I...

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,070
Yes, I do like him.

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,310
Ah, so it's true.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,999
Then, what's wrong?
Did you two have a quarrel?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,479
It was just a misunderstanding.

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,750
Li Chengyu came to ask me something.

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,679
The Leader mistook it

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,350
as him giving me something.

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,999
But the truth is, he was in trouble.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,910
He needed a thousand taels of silver.

65
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,590
A thousand? That's no small problem.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,470
No wonder Chengyu's been
drinking and brooding lately.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,879
So that's what's been troubling him.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,999
Sisters,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,790
we have to help him.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,350
He really stopped at nothing to see you.

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,950
He even burned down his own house.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,350
And I gave you poison,

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,070
so now his life is
the price for the antidote.

74
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,039
Brother!

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,119
There it is!

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,359
(Wanhua House)
My buddy saw Dongfang Shan

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,140
go in yesterday
and never came back out.

78
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,119
He must still be inside.

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,470
Are you sure?

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,510
Brother!

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,159
You really mean
to take me into a brothel?

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,910
I've never been in one my whole life!

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,710
Brother!

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,719
If the Boss finds out,
won't she claw at you?

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,599
- Haha!
- Get lost!

86
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,239
Stay here.

87
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,119
Hey!

88
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,039
Brother, you're not taking me in?

89
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,950
You're not taking me in?

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,239
You're not taking me in?

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,830
Fine! Next time I'll come by myself!

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,950
(So this is a brothel,
just like in the novels.)

93
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,559
Ah, Young Master Li,

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,359
my mistress has been
waiting for you upstairs.

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,350
- She sent me to fetch you.
- You know who I am?

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,150
Of course.
She sent me to fetch you herself.

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,150
This way, Young Master Li.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,070
Where is Mr. Dongfang?

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,470
I've long heard of your name.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,390
And now seeing you in person,

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,599
you truly are impressive.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,950
Miss Dongfang?

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,039
Miss Dongfang.

104
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,470
You greeted me with a hidden weapon
as soon as we met.

105
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,470
Isn't that a bit much?

106
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,950
You jest, Young Master.

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,919
All these girls here

108
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,150
are my welcome gift to you.

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,710
I only hope
the hospitality isn't lacking.

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,470
Send them all away.

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,910
You alone are enough.

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,710
Go.

113
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,510
You knew I was coming.

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,590
Of course.

115
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,599
Last night,
my estate suddenly caught fire.

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,599
Every place I could live in burned down.

117
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,390
Yet not a single person was harmed.

118
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,359
Clearly, someone wanted to see me.

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,679
But this someone is just a pauper

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,910
who can't even
put together a thousand taels.

121
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,030
Your price is outrageous.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,470
Let's speak plainly.

123
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,710
Was this arrowhead made by you?

124
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,910
And who ordered it?

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,510
The Chancellor.

126
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,359
But in your trade,

127
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,879
aren't you forbidden
from revealing a client's name?

128
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,470
Normally, yes.

129
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,310
But for you, I can.

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,350
After all, you're a general.

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,710
How do you know I'm a general?

132
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:14,959
(Wanhua House)

133
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,470
Why would Chengyu
come to a place like this?

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,550
Crows are black everywhere.

135
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,359
No man is worth trusting.

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,110
And here I thought
Li Chengyu was different.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,710
Turns out I was wrong.

138
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,519
Fate must have been blind

139
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,950
to send me this "good match".

140
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,350
Bah!

141
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,879
He's not that kind of man.

142
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,710
He must have
another reason for coming here.

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,239
I've heard that in the capital,
people hold meetings

144
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,599
right inside brothels.

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,110
The crowd makes it easier to talk.

146
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,359
And with the Leader at his side,

147
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,870
Li Chengyu wouldn't
go after other women.

148
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,950
Manyue, you're just
making excuses for him.

149
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,430
If you don't believe me,
see for yourself.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,110
Well, well.

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,550
Second Boss. What a coincidence.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,070
Cold Tiger? Why are you here?

153
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,230
Hey, let me tell you something.

154
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,199
Say it.

155
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,119
I like you.

156
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,550
Get lost!

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,759
Boss! Fancy seeing you here.

158
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,399
You two came to the brothel as well?

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,639
Enough nonsense. Is Li Chengyu inside?

160
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,950
Is he there or not?

161
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,239
No.

162
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,550
Get lost.

163
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,830
Let's go.

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,350
I heard that you were thrown into
the imperial prison for treason.

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,710
I wonder if that news is true or false.

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,710
If it's true,

167
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,190
then you must be an imposter.

168
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,350
If it's false,

169
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,950
then you're a fugitive
who broke out of prison.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,190
Who told you the general was in prison?

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,310
Hahaha!

172
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,470
I've roamed the martial world for years.

173
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,870
Naturally, I know all the tales.

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,070
They say the God of War's
ultimate move, Thunderous Force,

175
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,950
is mighty and peerless.

176
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,710
Young Master,
why not show me one strike?

177
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,590
That would prove who you are.

178
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,710
I only fear that if I use it,

179
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,350
you won't live to see it.

180
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,070
No matter.

181
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,550
If I'm fortunate enough to witness it...

182
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,230
I can die without regrets.

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,950
You really are the General.

184
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,990
Now you know.

185
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,999
Why are you coughing blood?

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,519
Hey, I didn't even use my full strength.

187
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,870
Don't you dare pin this on me.

188
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,950
I've been poisoned.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,310
General, save me!

190
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,590
Li Chengyu, you...

191
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,550
Manyue, tell me.
What do you think of him now?

192
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,199
A life is at stake.

193
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,350
We must save her.

194
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,399
So the thousand taels
you borrowed from Qin Manyue

195
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,470
were for your trip to the brothel?

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,079
Don't tell me you plan
to bring this shady woman

197
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,470
back to the stronghold.

198
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,119
Not Qingfeng Stronghold.

199
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,710
I'll take her to Shihou Stronghold.

200
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,950
Is that even the point here?

201
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,590
She's poisoned.

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,350
I can't just send her to a clinic alone.

203
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,950
Xinrou, help me treat her.

204
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,950
Mysterious sir.

205
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,310
Please, sit.

206
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,430
Quick, serve the tea.

207
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,710
Sir.

208
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,310
Dongfang Shan failed to kill Li Chengyu.

209
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,710
She was taken away.

210
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,879
Liu Sheng, how goes the work

211
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,950
on stockpiling silver
and forging weapons?

212
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,359
Sir.

213
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,959
Using my position as shopkeeper,
I made quite a lot of silver.

214
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,879
I've put all of it into weapon forging.

215
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,639
Good.

216
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,710
Now go find Dongfang Shan.
