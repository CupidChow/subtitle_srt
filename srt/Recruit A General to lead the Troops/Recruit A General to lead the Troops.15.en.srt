=Episode 15=

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,190
He and I just met by chance.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,239
I happened to be poisoned,

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,990
and he cured me, that's all.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,550
Yes, I know.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,239
Now that you're cured...

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,910
I'm not leaving just yet.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,870
I'm being hunted.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,310
I feel safer here.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,839
Since you're here, Miss Dongfang,

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,550
stay as long as you like.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,110
If you need anything, just ask.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,550
Brother, looks like
the wind is shifting.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,230
That Dongfang girl really is something.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,550
I was jealous of you just now.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,150
But now...

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,439
You'll need a new name.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,150
Call yourself "Utter Failure."

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,279
"When fair maidens abound,

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,790
gentlemen seek them out."

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,999
But too many fair maidens make it so hard...

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,270
Alright, enough.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,159
Oh, right.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,270
Brother.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,510
Why were you looking for Dongfang Shan?

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,910
You mentioned an arrowhead.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,359
What arrowhead?

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,710
Show me.

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,350
Here.

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,159
Oh-ho!

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,790
I made this one!

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,519
You made it?

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,359
Brother.

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,999
You like collecting arrowheads?

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,359
I have plenty more back home.

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,359
Why didn't you say so?

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,350
I'll bring you a bunch! Heh.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,430
Hold on.

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,639
I didn't actually make it.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,750
It was forged at Shihou Stronghold.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,999
Last year Liu Pitang got some wild idea,

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,599
and had us forge
weapons from blueprints.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,910
The whole place was
filled with smoke and chaos.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,510
(So Liu Pitang was
secretly forging weapons.)

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,679
(That means Liu Pitang is Li Fang.)

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,750
(No, wait.)

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,239
Where did they stash the weapons?

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,479
Oh.

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,910
No idea.

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,279
Liu Pitang

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,159
never let me near any weapon business.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,719
But aren't you the Second Boss?

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,790
He handled everything in secret.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,310
I knew something was off,

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,350
so I kept my eyes open.

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,750
What did you see?

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,350
I found out that

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,230
Liu Pitang secretly
hauled the weapons away.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,679
Where to?

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,590
Oh, that I don't know either.

62
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,319
Do you even have a brain?

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,839
Mm.

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,070
No wonder Liu Pitang wants you dead.

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,510
Why?

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,999
You know his biggest secret.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,390
Why would he let you live?

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,230
I guess I really am doomed.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,590
Boss!

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,670
Boss!

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,159
What's with all the panic?

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,759
What's going on?

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,070
Li Chengyu.

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,999
What is it?

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,999
Li Chengyu

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,310
invited you to Shihou Stronghold.

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,039
Why would he do that?

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,350
He just asked if you dare to come.

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,999
Asking if I dare?

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,159
I'll go.

81
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,790
I'll go.

82
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,559
Of course I'll go.

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,230
Go?

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,999
Go round up some men for me.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
But...

86
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,750
Shouldn't we report this
to the Magistrate first?

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,759
A waste of time.

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,350
Why bother him
with something so trivial?

89
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,559
I'll meet that pretty boy myself.

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,630
Roll out.

91
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,390
Hey.

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,950
Mind your hygiene.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,950
Try to act civilized.

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,470
Brother.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,350
Brother, tea's ready.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,830
Mr. Liu.

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,999
Take a look at my resort here.
Any thoughts?

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,470
Much better than
your shabby Shihou Stronghold.

99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,590
There is a reason for every visit.

100
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,999
So tell me, why invite me to bathe?

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,590
Plotting something, aren't you?

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,270
We're friends, aren't we?

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,439
Dongfang Shan already
told me everything.

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,790
What?

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,879
Don't get worked up.

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,039
Come, sit.

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,950
Have some tea, calm your nerves.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,150
She told you everything?

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,679
Drink.

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,350
Or do you think I poisoned it?

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,039
Mr. Liu, this is bold of you.

112
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,710
You have the guts to come here.

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,710
Do you think I'm stupid?

114
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,910
You think I came here alone?

115
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,950
Listen up.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,799
The place is surrounded by my men.

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,119
If anything happens to me,

118
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,390
they will storm in right away.

119
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,710
So I doubt you'll try anything funny.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,950
Though I have to admit,
I do feel a little itchy.

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,039
We might as well enjoy the bath.

122
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,590
Hahaha!

123
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,070
Well, how can I refuse such hospitality?

124
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,470
The tea's poisoned.

125
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,479
I poisoned it.

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,470
The poison you used...

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,879
Talk.

128
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,470
Where are the weapons stashed?

129
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,230
Speak!

130
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,630
I'll tell...

131
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,239
Hey, Brother.

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,039
Did you forget?

133
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,590
The poison you asked me to use
prevents him from talking.

134
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,830
Do you know who I am?

135
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,470
Get out of my way!

136
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,830
Keep an eye on them.

137
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,510
Liu Pitang.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,070
How about we play a little game?

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,439
My brother taught me one.

140
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,719
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,710
Loser goes under for five seconds.

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,270
Come on. Rock, Paper, Scissors!

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,999
You lost.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,719
Down for five.

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,070
Be good. Go on.

146
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,279
Without the Boss's order,

147
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,470
no one goes in.

148
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,070
Who's barking out there?

149
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,470
Well, County Magistrate.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,559
What brings you here today?

151
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,679
Insolence!

152
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,790
How dare you speak to the County
Magistrate with such insolence!

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,239
Kneel!

154
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,590
I can kneel.

155
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,030
Ask him if he dares to accept it.

156
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,710
I received a report

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,070
that you, Li Chengyu,
abducted Mr. Liu.

158
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,559
County Magistrate,

159
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,470
I did have some issues
with Mr. Liu before,

160
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,830
but that's all settled now.

161
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,599
I have no reason to seize him.

162
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,470
Then let us search inside and settle it.

163
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,919
Search?

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,950
Don't you dare!

165
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,470
County Magistrate,

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,150
I run an honest business.

167
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,830
You can't accuse me for no reason.

168
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,750
Are you defying authority?

169
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,830
I can let you go in and search.

170
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,710
But if you don't find anything,
then what?

171
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,830
Ridiculous. Do you expect me
to apologize to you?

172
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,710
I wouldn't mind that.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,350
Go! Search!

174
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,670
Get working!

175
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,199
If I don't find him today,

176
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,359
I'll kneel to you

177
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,959
and offer a formal apology.

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,959
But if I do find him,

179
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,750
I'll be taking your head.

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,070
Let's go.

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,830
Be thorough!
Leave no corner unchecked!

182
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,550
- Nothing.
- Nothing here.

183
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,310
Nothing found, Sir.

184
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,359
Watch the blind spots.

185
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,319
Check them thoroughly.

186
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,839
Since we're here, County Magistrate,

187
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,350
the search should be properly done.

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,830
You haven't checked the pool yet.

189
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,310
Let's go.

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,230
Sir.

191
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,839
Take a close look.

192
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,070
See whether there's anyone in the water.

193
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,599
Brother!

194
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,119
Hey!

195
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,470
Cold Tiger, how can you be so careless?

196
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,359
Ouch!

197
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,319
You're soaking wet.

198
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,750
Who did this?

199
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,710
Why don't we go search somewhere else?

200
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,710
Count yourself lucky, kid.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,110
Move.

202
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,310
Have some tea before you go.

203
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,830
And don't forget to apologize.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,350
These mechanisms
by Dongfang Shan really work.

205
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,719
(County Office)

206
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,879
Sir, we searched everywhere.

207
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,350
No sign of Mr. Liu.

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,070
What should we do?

209
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,110
Why didn't you
report to me before acting?

210
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,119
Liu Pitang went on his own,

211
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,590
ruining my plan.

212
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,070
Now Li Chengyu has
followed Dongfang Shan to a lead,

213
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,550
and they've detained Liu Pitang.

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,470
Useless fools!

215
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,830
Sir, what should we do now?

216
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,479
Keep watch on both strongholds.

217
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,119
I want to know their every move.

218
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,350
Yes.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,190
Pretty boy,

220
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,350
why not just give me a clean death?

221
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,870
A clean death would be too kind.

222
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,550
I'll make you wish you were dead.

223
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,959
Move.

224
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,190
Wait!

225
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,350
I'll talk.

226
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,470
I'll talk!

227
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,070
I'll confess everything.

228
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,870
Start talking.

229
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,470
Where did you hide the weapons?

230
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,950
All of them were shipped to the capital.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,839
I stashed a small batch

232
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,199
in a cave.

233
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,079
A cave?

234
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,519
There are plenty of caves.

235
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,830
Which one?

236
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,190
I can take you there.

237
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,399
I can take you there,

238
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,470
but...

239
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,070
I can only take you alone.

240
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,519
Why is that?

241
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,350
Did I say I was tagging along?

242
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,999
This is it.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,950
Come on.

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,950
Fine.

245
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,550
Cold Tiger.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,999
Am I still your brother?

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,190
Brother, what are you on about?

248
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,670
Looks like it's time
I told you my true identity.

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,950
And what would that be?

250
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,317
(General)

251
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,590
Brother!

252
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,999
So you're a big shot!

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,519
Yeah.

254
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,119
Oh man!

255
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,239
That's a huge piece of gold!

256
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,190
You can't read?

257
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,470
(General)
What does it say?

258
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,590
Gen...

259
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,239
You only read the ones you know?

260
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,430
Yeah.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,479
Take it.

262
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,479
For me?

263
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,999
Follow me and Liu Pitang.

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,190
Don't let him spot you.

265
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,719
If anything happens,

266
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,879
take this piece of gold...

267
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
Take this badge

268
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,950
and find the Li family in the capital.

269
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,950
Cold Tiger, stop him!

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,950
Why did you come in?

271
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,319
Didn't you tell me to come in?

272
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,359
I told you to block him!

273
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,550
Oh, I couldn't stop him.

274
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,879
Li Chengyu!

275
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,950
Tiger!

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,839
You're dead!

277
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,150
