=Episode 11=

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,909
General Li, I entered Qingfeng Stronghold
only to deliver a message.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,389
I've never done anything else.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,549
You have no proof

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,709
accusing me of forging evidence
against the Leader.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,380
Is this inappropriate?

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,389
I'm only speculating,

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,469
not certain.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,980
Look how flustered you are.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,909
Of course, you're the best
at bookkeeping.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,229
I can keep accounts,

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,509
but I can't alter the records.

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,860
You can check.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,109
No need, I trust you.

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,100
You wouldn't wade into this mess.

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,429
Then do you know

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,940
about this arrow?

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,069
How come

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,460
he's giving hairpins to someone else?

21
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,140
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,220
Think it over carefully.

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,260
I've never seen it.

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,149
(Minister Li,)

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,789
(today, General Li came to
Qingfeng Stronghold to investigate.)

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,909
(He suspected treason,)

27
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,540
(but it was confirmed to be a false
accusation against Chen Xinrou.)

28
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,900
(Hereby notified.)

Qian.

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,429
Young Master Li.

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,549
Where's Li Aotian?

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,349
Who?

34
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,500
Oh,

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,549
that new steward you hired.

36
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,869
Where is he?

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,149
He left after two days,

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,700
said something about family matters,
so I let him go.

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,140
What's wrong, Young Master Li?

40
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,520
Did he mess something up?

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,269
I can immediately get someone else
to handle it.

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,069
No need.

43
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,540
No need.

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,340
Where are you rushing off to?

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,549
Hahaha, Young Master Li,

46
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,300
this is all thanks to you.

47
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,389
You set up this Qingfeng Group,

48
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,780
and now my reputation
in the county has skyrocketed.

49
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,869
When the county magistrate heard
business was booming lately,

50
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,149
he decided to host a banquet,

51
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,429
inviting all of us shopkeepers to join.

52
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,029
Hahaha, oh my,

53
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,709
it's getting late,

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,100
I should be going.

55
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,780
Young Master Li,

56
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,900
why don't you come with me?

57
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,989
Think about it,

58
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,029
you're out alone, and it's not convenient
to reveal your identity.

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,229
If you come with me,

60
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,060
I can introduce you to the magistrate,

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,229
so it'll be easier

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,149
to handle matters in the future.

63
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,500
Right?

64
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,060
Let's go then.

65
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:57,745
(County Office)

66
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,580
Please, come in.

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,429
Mr. Qian, you arrived early.

68
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,389
Have a seat, Mr. Qian.

69
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,589
Mr. Zhang.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,149
I don't know what's up
with my Akhal-Teke horse,

71
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,549
it's moving unusually slow today.

72
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,429
Could it be because it's from
the Western Regions?

73
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,180
A precious horse like that
can't handle city roads, I guess.

74
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,300
No idea what's wrong.

75
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,549
My wrist has been aching lately,

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,180
I should see the doctor

77
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,620
once I get home.

78
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,660
If I had known it'd be
this kind of crowd,

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,340
I wouldn't have come at all.

80
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,149
- Your Excellency!
- Your Excellency!

81
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,780
Your Excellency!

82
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,869
Mr. Qian.

83
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,389
Your Excellency, I am Li...

84
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,389
Did you bring your servant?

85
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,620
No, this...

86
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,469
Mr. Qian,

87
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,060
you really treat your servant well.

88
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,949
By our rules,

89
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,869
a servant

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,749
shouldn't attend a banquet
with their master.

91
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,669
No.

92
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,749
You don't know,
this is Young Master Li, Li Chengyu.

93
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,589
Today's banquet

94
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,949
is to celebrate the court's
elimination of my greatest trouble,

95
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,180
Shihou Stronghold.

96
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,780
Also, thanks for supporting
our county business.

97
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,340
Your contributions
are truly appreciated.

98
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,549
Especially you three,

99
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,780
you are the pillars of this county.

100
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,669
I will continue to rely on you
in the future.

101
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,589
Ah, understood.

102
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,549
Your Excellency.

103
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,340
Here,

104
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,789
I offer a toast to you all.

105
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,940
Good.

106
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,580
Thank you, Your Excellency.

107
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,780
A toast to you all.

108
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,460
Everyone, please sit.

109
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,589
Ah, right.

110
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,940
On this trip north,

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,349
I managed to acquire
some rare treasures.

112
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,000
I'd like to present them
for your enjoyment.

113
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,869
Ah, um...

114
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,380
Please don't mind them.

115
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,029
Here.

116
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,869
Your Excellency,

117
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,589
this is for you.

118
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,469
Oh!

119
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,109
This is yours.

120
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,580
Thank you.

121
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,989
Mr. Qian.

122
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,109
Good.

123
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,709
Thank you.

124
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,669
I didn't expect

125
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,029
Mr. Li to also be here today.

126
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,140
Ah, this...

127
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,109
Nothing left.

128
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,029
Really, my apologies.

129
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,349
No problem.

130
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,140
Mr. Zhang, your trip north...

131
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,589
Your Excellency,
this crispy duck is truly delicious.

132
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,140
Here, cheers!

133
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,989
Your Excellency,

134
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,140
have a drink.

135
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,349
(After all, my identity
must not be revealed easily.)

136
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,320
(Maybe keeping the magistrate
will be useful later.)

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,789
Drink.

138
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,140
Eat.

139
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,349
Not bad.

140
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,780
Come, drink.

141
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,220
Your Excellency,

142
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,789
all of you shopkeepers,

143
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,229
I am Li Chengyu,

144
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,869
newly arrived,

145
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,989
and unfamiliar with the rules.

146
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,380
I hope you will kindly look after me.

147
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,500
I first offer a toast.

148
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,589
Come, Mr. Zhang.

149
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,589
Here.

150
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,060
Come.

151
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,020
Mr. Zhang.

152
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,820
Your Excellency,

153
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,380
all you shopkeepers,

154
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,349
I, Li Chengyu, newly arrived,

155
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,700
do not understand the rules.

156
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,789
I ask for your guidance in the future.

157
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,140
I offer another toast.

158
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,669
This crispy duck is quite good.

159
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,429
Delicious.

160
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,900
Bring three more.

161
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,140
Your Excellency,

162
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,580
I offer you another toast.

163
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,340
Your Excellency.

164
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,700
Li Chengyu,

165
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,349
what are you trying to do?

166
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,820
So you're not deaf, huh?

167
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,589
Coming from the countryside,

168
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,700
unfamiliar with rules,

169
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,740
you dare to cause a scene
at the magistrate's banquet?

170
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,380
Do you not wish to live?

171
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,380
Young Master Li, you...

172
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,700
Capture him for me!

173
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,549
Your Excellency, he can't be arrested!

174
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,549
Young master Li

175
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,669
actually knows high-ranking officials
from the capital.

176
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,140
Who cares who he is?

177
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,340
Seize him!

178
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,029
Your Excellency.

179
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,780
Are you alright?

180
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,789
Who is this brat?

181
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,669
So audacious.

182
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,380
He is the husband of Chen Xinrou,
the leader of Qingfeng Stronghold.

183
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,229
A live-in husband, right?

184
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,060
Daring to act wildly in front of me!

185
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,869
I won't let him off.

186
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,882
(Qian's Winery)

187
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,460
Mr. Qian.

188
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,940
Keep this safe.

189
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,709
You must never mention

190
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,700
that I took your goods.

191
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,229
Mr. Qian, why in the past few days

192
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,580
has no one been ordering
from Qingfeng Stronghold?

193
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,380
Because of General Li...

194
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,940
Young Master Li.

195
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,580
He offended the magistrate,

196
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,989
and so the order came down,

197
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,229
no shopkeepers may buy goods
from Qingfeng Group anymore.

198
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,789
You know they are officials.

199
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,149
I'm just a merchant.
If blame falls on me,

200
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,020
I can't even protect myself.

201
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,109
Please bear with me.

202
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,700
Please, bear with me.

203
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,500
Chengyu,
Xinrou isn't happy either lately.

204
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,340
She hasn't gone out at all.

205
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,149
It seems the Qingfeng Group
is also in trouble.

206
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,700
No one dares place orders for our goods.

207
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,580
What do you think we should do?

208
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,860
Boss, the chief constable
and a few officers have barged in.

209
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,420
The magistrate ordered
a search of the mountain.

210
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,509
Remove everything
from Shihou Stronghold.

211
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,869
No outsiders are allowed in.

212
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,300
Stop the music.

213
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,509
What's this? Your land? Just searching?

214
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,709
This is Qingfeng Stronghold's land.

215
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,629
Searching here now is breaking
into private property.

216
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,100
Do you know the law?

217
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,069
Obstructing official duties.

218
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,420
Be careful, or I'll throw you in jail.

219
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,820
Do you have the guts for that?

220
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,940
I am the only chief constable
in this city.

221
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,820
Tiger!

222
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,460
Beat him up!

223
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,229
Think carefully, I am the only
chief constable in the city.

224
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,460
Ah ha!

225
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,180
What should we do?

226
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,349
They're coming to give us trouble too.

227
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,389
You and Xinrou aren't handling anything.

228
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,949
At this rate,

229
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,940
how can our business survive?

230
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,580
Alright.

231
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,300
I'll think of a plan.

232
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,740
Selling buns!

233
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,100
(Qingfeng Bobo Shop)
Look at our big meat buns!

234
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,100
Why me?

235
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,509
Hey.

236
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,709
Don't you want to help
your Qingfeng Stronghold sisters?

237
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,940
Be good.

238
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,989
I want to.

239
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,860
Have you memorized your lines?

240
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,060
Good.

241
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,749
Hey everyone, don't miss this.

242
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,589
Take a look over here.

243
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,749
Check it out.

244
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,460
Don't miss it!

245
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,109
Welcome everyone to Qingfeng Bobo Shop!

246
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,949
Qingfeng Bobo Shop.

247
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,709
Today,

248
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,580
everyone is here at last.

249
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,229
Qingfeng brand Osmanthus Fine Wine,

250
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,340
(Hahaha, has everyone seen this?)
recognize it, Qingfeng brand sale!

251
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,109
Usually, if you buy one jar
of this wine,

252
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,300
it costs 20 taels of silver.

253
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,349
That's right, today,

254
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,589
no middlemen,

255
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,229
no resale markup,

256
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,749
just come to Qingfeng Bobo Shop,

257
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,589
and it's only 19 taels.

258
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,740
How much?

259
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,340
Too expensive!

260
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,340
Too expensive, 19 taels!

261
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,349
Nineteen taels?
I don't even want to buy it.

262
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,980
It's only one tael cheaper than usual.

263
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,109
Then...

264
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,940
What do you suggest we do?

265
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,700
You let everyone decide.

266
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,540
Nineteen taels is still expensive,

267
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,460
make it nine taels and nine.

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,869
Nine taels and nine?
Why don't you rush to grab it?

269
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,220
Exactly.

270
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,589
Forget it.

271
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,189
First, let everyone
see the quality of our wine.

272
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,340
Exactly.

273
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,100
Smells wonderful.

274
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,540
Sweet and refreshing.

275
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,540
So satisfying!

276
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,509
I won't allow

277
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,109
no one's ever tasted such good wine!

278
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,949
Exactly, come on.

279
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,069
Today, I'm drinking
from the smallest jar.

280
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,589
Today, all jars, big or small, are only

281
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,949
nine taels and nine.

282
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,349
What? Not possible?

283
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,629
No, stop messing around!

284
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,469
Ignore me, today this jar sells
for nine taels and nine.

285
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,949
At worst, I'll quit tomorrow.

286
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,940
Everyone, it's time to race
for your jars!

287
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,949
Today, everything is nine taels
and nine.

288
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,869
Come on, everyone, three, two, one, go!

289
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,109
- Grab it!
- No!

290
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,460
- Don't come over!
- Hurry and grab! I'll block her.

291
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,940
Come on!

292
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,709
Don't rush.

293
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,940
Don't panic.

294
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,220
Take it easy.

295
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,589
Who stepped on my shoe?

296
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,189
I haven't grabbed mine yet.

297
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,629
Exactly! Is there any wine left?

298
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,420
How can they do business
with this little stock?

299
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,389
Everyone, haha!

300
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,989
I didn't expect such enthusiasm.

301
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,869
I only prepared this much at first,

302
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,989
but seeing everyone so enthusiastic,

303
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,300
I'll bring out another batch.

304
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,940
Hey, Li,

305
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,060
this time we really can't sell
for nine taels and nine.

306
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,109
We'd be losing out.

307
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,589
Hey, no raising prices.

308
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,829
If you dare raise it,

309
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,460
I'll report you to the county office.

310
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,189
Everyone,

311
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,420
calm down.

312
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,420
Seeing everyone so enthusiastic,

313
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,869
we'll still sell
for nine taels and nine.

314
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,229
At worst, I'll quit tomorrow.

315
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,100
No!

316
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,069
What should we do?

317
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,349
Don't grab it.

318
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,980
Don't grab it!

319
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,300
Everyone, don't grab it!

320
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,700
Don't grab it.

321
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,060
Boss, your plan works!

322
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,349
Keep an eye here.

323
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm going to get some water.

324
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,980
I need to pee too.

325
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,509
I said it.

326
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,700
I don't know anything
about account book.

327
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,860
Liu Pitang!

328
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,820
I entrusted you with
the important task of forging weapons,

329
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,180
yet you can't even handle
a small Qingfeng Stronghold.

330
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,629
Now you've put yourself
in this situation.

331
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,940
You almost ruined my big plan.

332
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,469
Please spare me, Sir!

333
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,420
I know I was wrong.

334
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,589
I beg you.

335
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,180
Give me one more chance.

336
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,980
One more chance.

337
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,940
I'll give you the last chance.

338
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,309
Thank you.

339
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,869
Thank you, Mysterious Sir.

340
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,869
Thank you, mysterious sir.

341
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,189
(County Office)

342
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,189
Your Excellency.

343
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,589
Li Chengyu's business
is getting better and better.

344
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,109
What do you think about this?

345
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,100
What?

346
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,389
Go and take down his stall for me.

347
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,300
- Go now!
