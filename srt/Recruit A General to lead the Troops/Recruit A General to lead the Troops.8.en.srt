=Episode 8=

3
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:16,629
I wondered who it was.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,660
Turns out it's you,
that useless live-in husband.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,549
Trying to play hero, huh?

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,420
Want to do a hero rescue?

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,909
Idiot!

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,660
My boss is talking to you.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,709
Pretending to be deaf?

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,500
Speak!

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,629
Pretending you can't talk?

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,749
I'll smash you!

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,860
Hey!

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,820
Is it your turn to speak?

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,660
Trying to be a hero, huh?

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,189
Fine.

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,660
But first, I need to ask
my big bone if it agrees.

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,069
Boss!

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,509
Are you okay, boss?

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,140
Boss!

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,060
Whoa, boss!

22
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,260
Who attacked me just now?

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,789
Was it you?

24
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,989
Was it you?

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,060
I didn't see.

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,420
It was him.

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,909
Hey, slow down!

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,060
Ah!

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,540
Move aside!

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,420
Pretty boy!

31
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,980
Did you sneak attack me just now?

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,780
He didn't move!

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,789
Not a bit?

34
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,980
Not at all.

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,140
Not at all.

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,069
Could be a turtle.

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,500
Boss!

38
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,620
Qingfeng Stronghold may have
other experts.

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,420
Other experts?

40
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,780
Go back and cook it.

41
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,460
It's still edible.

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,060
Retreat!

43
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,620
Li Chengyu.

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,780
Who?

45
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,949
Who exactly attacked me today?

46
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,780
Who was it?

47
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,269
How could I not see?

48
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,060
Impossible!

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,780
I will find out.

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,940
I will tear him to pieces.

51
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,229
Boss, how's Chengyu?

52
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,660
I'll take care of him here.

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,580
Go use the backup water
and cook some mung bean soup.

54
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,669
Detox the others first.

55
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,580
Got it.

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,500
Taking care of me
while being sick yourself.

57
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,340
Li Chengyu.

58
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,100
Thank you.

59
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,460
Thanks.

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,429
So many herbs, which one is it?

61
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,780
Which one?

62
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,940
Take this one.

63
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,632
(Dried Tangerine Peel)

64
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,260
Get up and take your medicine.

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,940
Feeling better?

66
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,820
It's working.

67
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,260
All good now?

68
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,580
Should be fine.

69
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,020
So hot.

70
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,260
Why is it so hot?

71
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,060
You okay?

72
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,700
Li Chengyu.

73
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,020
Too hot!

74
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,060
What did you make me drink?

75
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,229
I just followed the recipe you gave me.

76
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,380
It's right there.

77
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,580
Step aside.

78
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,620
Move.

79
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,020
What do you mean, move?

80
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,380
Fine, moving!

81
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,060
Hey.

82
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,580
I am a gentleman.

83
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,109
No, you're serious.

84
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,269
Testing me.

85
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,140
Definitely testing me.

86
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,940
Jerk!

87
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,700
I'll make you pay with blood!

88
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,340
You might not believe this.

89
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,940
Sometimes,

90
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,580
I don't even know who I am.

91
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,940
Years ago, I fell into a river
and lost my memory.

92
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,460
I woke up at Shihou Stronghold.

93
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,460
It was a den of demons.

94
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,220
A nightmare.

95
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,340
I heard from the Forth Leader
about everything before.

96
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,220
It was you who drove away Liu Pitang.

97
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,820
How did you do it?

98
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,980
I...

99
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,740
I poisoned them.

100
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,580
I poisoned everyone
at Shihou Stronghold.

101
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,220
That was the first time

102
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,220
I used these hands

103
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,460
to kill.

104
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,980
They deserved it.

105
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,300
It wasn't your fault.

106
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,580
The other sisters said the same.

107
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,340
So, I blindly became the leader

108
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,060
and taking responsibility
for the entire stronghold.

109
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,420
I wanted, through my effort,

110
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,220
to let others live carefree

111
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,580
and unburdened.

112
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,820
Three years had passed. I thought...

113
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,580
I was doing well enough.

114
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,980
I could protect them.

115
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,180
But they said...

116
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,300
You're already doing well.

117
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,820
They wouldn't blame you.

118
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,420
Crying too much won't be pretty.

119
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,980
In the rumors,

120
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,460
I was fierce and scary,

121
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,180
over seven feet tall.

122
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,060
Yet you

123
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,300
were the first to call me beautiful.

124
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,340
Because you truly are.

125
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,820
(Li Chengyu,
I find it hard to trust others.)

126
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,300
(But today,
I told you my true feelings.)

127
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,180
You won't do anything
to betray the stronghold,

128
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,820
right?

129
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,180
I can trust you,

130
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,580
right?

131
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,300
(Can someone like this really rebel?)

132
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,349
(With the evidence I provide,)

133
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,520
(the court soldiers will immediately
suppress the bandits.)

134
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,340
(Those following Chen Xinrou
in Qingfeng Stronghold aren't wrong.)

135
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,860
(Forced into rebellion,)

136
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,820
(they'll surely go to jail.)

137
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,989
Feel softhearted?

138
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,300
Mm?

139
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,980
After being with them so long,
don't you have any feelings?

140
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,940
How could I not?

141
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,060
These pieces of evidence
are capital crimes.

142
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,100
How would I know?

143
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,820
But I don't want them to die.

144
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,980
Could the evidence be faulty?

145
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,060
I'm just speculating.

146
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,869
Have you noticed
anything unusual recently?

147
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,180
You're asking me?

148
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,109
Checking evidence is your job.

149
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,749
I just record daily events

150
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,340
and deliver messages to Minister Li.

151
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,109
Alright.

152
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,229
Then show me the notes
you've been keeping.

153
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,420
Let me see them.

154
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,309
Why should I show you?

155
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,989
Only Minister Li can see them.

156
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,180
No.

157
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,709
(General)

158
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,300
Is this enough?

159
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,460
General.

160
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,829
Yes, General.

161
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,940
Stop.

162
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,420
Don't give me that act.

163
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,829
I don't care who you obeyed before,

164
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,109
but now that I'm here,

165
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,629
you only follow me.

166
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,540
