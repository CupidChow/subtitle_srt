Close the gate!

Hide!

Silang!

10
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,090
I've seen plenty of trash before,

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,170
you really think this little array
can trap me?

12
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,250
Where's Li Chengyu?

13
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,130
Why is it so slow?

14
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,739
Xinrou!

15
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,419
Li Aotian is attacking!

16
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,019
Lianxin is no match for him!

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,299
Wasn't he just a scholar?

18
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,299
How is he so strong?

19
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,979
You must finish this medicine.

20
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,530
Otherwise, it's suicide!

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,459
Minmin, wait here.

22
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,419
I'll go.

23
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,019
Activate the mechanism.

24
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,250
Xinrou.

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,019
Don't worry.

26
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,499
He won't discover me.

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,410
If I can stall a little, I will.

28
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,370
I'll wait for you.

29
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,210
Xinrou.

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,050
Stop!

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,459
Lianxin!

32
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,650
Chen Xinrou.

33
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,979
It's me.

34
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,090
You're really hard to kill,

35
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,859
then I'll send you off again.

36
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,650
I have evidence of your crimes.

37
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,530
If you kill me,

38
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,979
aren't you afraid the evidence
will one day be found

39
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,530
and your crimes exposed to the world?

40
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,690
What evidence could you
possibly have against me?

41
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,530
Do you dare to bet?

42
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,370
I have a way to make the Emperor believe

43
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,370
Chen Xinrou is innocent.

44
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,579
Only I know where the evidence is,

45
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,530
you and I must go fetch it.

46
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,530
Let's see if you dare.

47
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,610
I know you're clever.

48
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,490
Don't play tricks.

49
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,410
Why so nervous?

50
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,970
I'm only

51
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,610
letting you get familiar
with the terrain.

52
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,610
Or maybe not

53
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,939
what if there are traps inside?

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,090
If you take another step forward

55
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,490
and trigger the mechanism,

56
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,699
both of us, along with the evidence,

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,370
will be burned to ashes.

58
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,930
Sharp-tongued.

59
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,579
It's dark inside.

60
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,850
Be careful.

61
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,730
Where's the evidence?

62
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,459
Where exactly is it?

63
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,810
Why are you yelling?

64
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,490
Can't we walk slowly?

65
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,370
Or you can find it yourself.

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,410
Tell me now!

67
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,490
Then,

68
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,730
there's an account book on the table.

69
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,730
Go find it yourself.

70
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,170
(Hold on within one incense stick's time,
the medicine will be ready.)

71
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,370
Do you know

72
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,370
that your father is already dead?

73
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,730
I know.

74
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,610
So what?

75
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,410
You should know

76
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,970
snapping your neck

77
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,970
is as easy as crushing an ant.

78
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,619
I know.

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,370
So what?

80
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,050
Even if you kill me,

81
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,730
you'll never get the evidence.

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,610
Even if you take the throne,

83
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,250
one day, someone will use
the evidence to overthrow you.

84
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,730
You are clever indeed.

85
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,179
What a pity.

86
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,730
Following Li Chengyu is a waste.

87
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,170
Why not follow me instead?

88
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,019
What about Manyue?

89
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,170
She?

90
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,970
Just the lowly daughter of a traitor.

91
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,410
A useless pawn.

92
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,250
Oh right.

93
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,610
How did you deal with her?

94
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,730
She had no evidence in her hands,

95
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,899
she must be dead by now, right?

96
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,610
I'm not as disgusting as you.

97
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,370
Good.

98
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,530
Then I'll play something
even more disgusting.

99
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,850
That coward Li Chengyu

100
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,050
still has to hide behind a woman.

101
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,259
How many cuts do you think
I have to make on you

102
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,090
before he shows himself?

103
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,370
Despicable.

104
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,170
Vile.

105
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,730
What did you say?

106
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,730
I said you are

107
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,730
despicable.

108
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,610
Vile.

109
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,170
You will never measure up to Li Chengyu.

110
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,970
Because you can never stand
in the light.

111
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,730
You're like a filthy insect,

112
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,619
lurking in the shadows,

113
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,850
stirring up storms.

114
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,730
If you have the guts,

115
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,090
then fight him openly and honorably.

116
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,090
Even if your martial skills are high,

117
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,970
you'll never defeat Li Chengyu.

118
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,730
Fine.

119
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,330
Then I'll grant your wish,

120
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,490
kill you first,

121
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,379
then kill Li Chengyu!

122
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,490
Stop!

123
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,899
Li Aotian!

124
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,259
The evidence you want is in my hands.

125
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,570
Let Chen Xinrou go!

126
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,970
What skill is there in bullying a woman?

127
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,730
If you have guts,
come take the evidence yourself.

128
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,570
Your poison has been neutralized.

129
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,619
A mere little toxin is nothing to me.

130
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,610
But you pretending to be weak
and sickly all this time,

131
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,130
so hypocritical.

132
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,850
Seems there was never
any so-called evidence.

133
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,610
Why don't you kill me?

134
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,979
I'm not like you,

135
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,379
addicted to killing.

136
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,539
I'll spare your life and drag you
back to the capital

137
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,450
to clear Xinrou's name.

138
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,210
You're doing all this just
for Chen Xinrou?

139
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,570
For her alone, it's worth it.

140
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,890
You're still as detestable
as when we were kids.

141
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,659
Always in the spotlight,

142
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,210
always the favored one,

143
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,970
yet always preaching about virtue.

144
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,970
Aren't we brothers by blood?

145
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,539
Do you really hate me that much?

146
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,730
Yes.

147
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,499
Precisely because we share blood,

148
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,130
I hate you.

149
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,890
Since childhood I've been sickly
and weak,

150
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,619
drank the bitterest medicine,

151
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,130
endured the harshest needles,

152
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,770
suffered the strictest training,

153
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,139
all just so

154
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,210
I could live up to the name
of a military family.

155
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,130
I never once complained

156
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,730
for all that.

157
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,890
At least our parents cared enough
to try.

158
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,490
But once you appeared,

159
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,450
everything changed.

160
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,570
After I was injured,

161
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,370
my memory hasn't been good.

162
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,250
Can you tell me about our childhood?

163
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,219
Of course you don't remember,

164
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,970
because those things
meant nothing to you.

165
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,739
Gifted as you were,

166
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,570
a prodigy in martial arts,

167
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,219
fighting alongside Father at twelve,

168
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,210
made a general at thirteen.

169
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,219
When you called the Emperor "brother",

170
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,250
did you ever think of me,
your elder brother?

171
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,890
Because of you,

172
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,370
our military family had an heir.

173
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,490
But also because of you,

174
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,259
the physicians stopped treating me,

175
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,250
Mother stopped making my medicine,

176
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,370
and Father

177
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,970
never spared me a glance.

178
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,450
I was like these fallen leaves,

179
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,250
decaying in some forgotten corner,

180
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,490
slowly sinking into the dirt.

181
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,730
No one cared.

182
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,610
So why should I care about anything?

183
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,379
When I seize the throne,

184
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,970
I'll make them all remember me!

185
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,490
I'll make them see

186
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,210
titles are empty.

187
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,259
Power,

188
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,139
wealth,

189
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,090
that's what matters most.

190
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,130
I can actually understand that.

191
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,490
Because I used to feel the same way.

192
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,370
I remember back when I delivered food,

193
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,730
nobody paid me any respect.

194
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,850
When I delivered
to those luxury apartments,

195
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,330
I wondered

196
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,970
why wasn't I the one living there?

197
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,330
What nonsense are you spouting?

198
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,490
But now I understand.

199
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,970
Everyone's path is different.

200
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,090
Living well,

201
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,330
with your loved ones safe and sound,

202
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,730
is what truly matters.

203
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,730
Chengyu,

204
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,730
you still don't understand.

205
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,770
Serving an Emperor
is like serving a tiger.

206
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,770
As a high-ranking official,
you can never truly live at ease.

207
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,979
Only by becoming Emperor yourself

208
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,890
can you control your own fate.

209
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,610
But I don't want to be a minister,

210
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,770
nor do I want to be Emperor.

211
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,730
I just want, after we return
to the capital,

212
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,210
to resign my post.

213
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,730
The truth is, I don't remember much

214
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,370
about our childhood.

215
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,610
But,

216
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,970
I still want to apologize
for how I was before.

217
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,379
The first time I entered
Qingfeng Stronghold,

218
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,370
I truly trusted you.

219
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,850
I saw you as my big brother.
