00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,850
=Recruit A General to lead the Troops=

2
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,887
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,260
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,020
I don't want to stay in the capital.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,180
What do you mean?

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,900
I don't want to be an official anymore.

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,340
I just want
to stay at Qingfeng Stronghold.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,580
I'll give Chen Xinrou a grand wedding

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,580
and live a worry-free life
with my family.

10
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,220
That would be enough for me.

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,540
Wouldn't it be better
to stay by my side?

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,140
Li Aotian committed treason.

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,200
That crime means
the annihilation of the whole clan.

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,900
Even if I capture him,

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,540
do you think the ministers
would trust me to keep you close?

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,340
It's too late.

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,700
What do you mean?

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,780
By His Majesty's order,

19
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,980
these three women are guilty of treason.

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,260
Execute them on the spot.

21
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,300
You've got this all planned out
all along.

22
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,060
If you'd been good
and stayed by my side,

23
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,220
I could have given you glory and wealth.

24
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,060
But since you insist on leaving,

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,780
you can't blame me for being merciless.

26
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,740
Truth be told,

27
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,900
I've already sent my men
to capture Chen Xinrou and the others.

28
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,500
You make me look like a fool!

29
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,389
You can't blame me for this.

30
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,749
Now you're the General God of War.

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,520
You're powerful enough
to make me feel threatened.

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,780
How could I possibly keep you?

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,500
Did you know why I've always
called you Little Rock?

34
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,149
How impressive of you, Brother Li.

35
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,149
Your Highness.

36
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,589
You're the future emperor,

37
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,429
so you should stop calling me brother.

38
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,429
But I'll always be the rock in your hand.

39
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,269
I'll strike

40
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,429
wherever you want me to.

41
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,340
Great! Let's have another round.

42
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,709
But now,

43
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,989
this rock has grown bigger

44
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,300
and bigger.

45
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,989
I fear some day I'll lift it up

46
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,580
only to crush my own foot!

47
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,149
Listen here.

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,620
There are no brothers
in the imperial family.

49
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,180
There's only power.

50
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,620
To secure my throne,

51
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,740
I can only sacrifice your clan.

52
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,660
Chengyu.

53
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,620
You still don't get it.

54
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,900
Serving an emperor
is like being with a tiger.

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,989
When you hold the highest position,

56
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,140
there's no way to live in peace.

57
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,340
Li Aotian was right.

58
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,900
The higher the power,

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,900
the more sacrifices it demands.

60
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,700
Both Li Aotian and I bear the Li name.

61
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,220
It makes sense
that you want to get rid of me.

62
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,460
But what wrong did we commit?

63
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,900
I put my heart
into finding you evidence.

64
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,669
I treated you as my brother.

65
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,340
What did you see me as?

66
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,820
Fine.

67
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,900
You can have my life.

68
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,940
Will you let them live instead?

69
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,340
Please keep your word.

70
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,340
I'll drink the poison.

71
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,340
You must guarantee their safety.

72
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,700
Permission granted.

73
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,260
(From now on,)

74
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,940
(the General God of War, Li Chengyu,)

75
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,340
(shall cease to exist.)

76
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,989
(You once saved my life.)

77
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,709
(Well,)

78
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,789
(we're brothers.)

79
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,560
(I saved your life,
yet you threw me in prison.)

80
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,349
How low of you!

81
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,340
You'll secretly infiltrate
Qingfeng Stronghold.

82
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,549
Chen Xinrou

83
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,029
is ferocious and merciless.

84
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,709
It's you.

85
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,340
Chen Xinrou.

86
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,260
What if I said I liked you?

87
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,140
Stay.

88
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,340
Can I trust you?

89
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,580
Yes.

90
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,020
(Chen Xinrou.)

91
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,780
(Goodbye.)

92
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:41,245
(Thirty years later)

93
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,589
Back then, during the court rebellion,

94
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,349
the General God of War, Li Chengyu,
risked his life

95
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,229
to uncover evidence of treason
and uphold justice,

96
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,780
perishing together with Li Aotian.

97
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,320
General Li dedicated his life
to the nation and the people.

98
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,940
His military achievements were unmatched,
making him an eternal legend.

99
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,869
(Thirty years have passed.)

100
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,580
(The Qingfeng Stronghold he once stayed in
is now Qingfeng Manor.)

101
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,349
(It's thriving)

102
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,340
(under the management
of two ladies.)

103
00:08:47,930 --> 00:09:00,160
(Tomb of Li Chengyu)

104
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,882
(Tomb of Li Chengyu)

105
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:54,220
(Tomb of Li Chengyu)

106
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,980
It's time to wake up

107
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,940
from this dream of glory.

108
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,460
Yes, it's time to wake up from it.

109
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,989
This patient had alcohol
during his bath,

110
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,700
causing alcohol poisoning.

111
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,509
Our latest medical equipment

112
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,229
can stimulate his brain nerves

113
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,060
to speed up recovery.

114
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,920
The woman next door, Ms. Chen,
was poisoned by mushrooms.

115
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,349
They share one machine.

116
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,509
Both of them

117
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,829
still haven't come round.

118
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,229
If this goes on,

119
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,940
it'll get dangerous.

120
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,420
Wait, you're awake.

121
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,749
Where am I?

122
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,069
You're in hospital.

123
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,860
Do you remember what happened?

124
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,460
Where's the patient here?

125
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,700
She's gone.

126
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,580
I know you've been dutiful.

127
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,180
I was being inconsiderate then.

128
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,580
You've worked hard.

129
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,980
So have you.

130
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,580
