00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,509
 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫ 

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,418
 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫ 

4
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:15,254
 ♫ At the end of the other shore,
the long night finally pales ♫ 

5
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:18,649
 ♫ Only then is this oath not sworn in vain ♫ 

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:23,002
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫ 

7
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,870
 ♫ My resolve has never wavered ♫ 

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,654
 ♫ Even after millennia,
I'll cleave mountains asunder ♫ 

9
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:38,326
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,
the dawn to break, and for you to come ♫ 

10
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,786
 ♫ Storms and turmoil rage ♫ 

11
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:49,494
 ♫ Turbulent waves surge ♫ 

12
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:51,257
 ♫ Trampling the dawn's light ♫ 

13
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:54,128
 ♫ Let us venture together ♫ 

14
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,266
 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫ 

15
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,849
 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫ 

16
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:05,366
 ♫ At the end of the other shore,
the long night finally pales ♫ 

17
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,489
 ♫ Only then is this oath not sworn in vain ♫ 

18
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,542
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫ 

19
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:16,086
 ♫ My resolve has never wavered ♫ 

20
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:19,570
 ♫ Even after millennia,
I'll cleave mountains asunder ♫ 

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,930
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,
the dawn to break, and for you to come ♫ 

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,070
Title

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,850
 

24
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:44,885
Honestly, I want to become Huanhua Sect's leader.

25
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,785
Sect leader?

26
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:51,286
Qiu Shui, you're joking, right?

27
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:57,045
Since when did you have that idea?
You've never mentioned this before.

28
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,425
Everyone has dreams.

29
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:06,686
Well, if there is a sect leader among us,

30
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:12,445
it would make us Shenzhou Alliance
amazing, don't you think?

31
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:17,485
Are you serious, Qiu Shui?

32
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:22,205
But Master Xiao insists on letting Yi Ren
inherit the position as the sect leader.

33
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:27,605
Besides, the Succession Ceremony
is just days away.

34
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:32,366
S-So, we need to brainstorm.

35
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:35,266
Bros, use your wisdom to help me analyze it.

36
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:39,226
How can I make my father change his mind?

37
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:45,105
To become the heir, you need
reputation in the martial circle.

38
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:48,725
Yi Ren already has great reputation in Jinzhong.

39
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,325
We've done heroic deeds
in a low profile all these years.

40
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:59,890
In terms of reputation in the circle,
you're far behind Yi Ren.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,126
So I need the reputation?

42
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:12,966
Easy. Let's create some hype.

43
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:14,966
- Hype?
- Hype?

44
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,606
What hype?

45
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:23,186
I mean, we can create gimmicks.

46
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:26,225
For example, let's say,

47
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:31,566
invent impressive nicknames of me
and spread them everywhere,

48
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:34,884
making people know my name before seeing my face.

49
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,308
Enough talk! Bros, list all the influential figures

50
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:41,945
in the martial world for me now.

51
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:45,386
I'll go challenge them.

52
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:47,186
List them all?

53
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,566
All of them? Are you sure?

54
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:54,086
Of course. Come on. Hurry up.

55
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:59,073
D-Don't catch cold. Qiu, come on. Han.

56
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:02,746
 

57
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,990
What?

58
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,780
That many?

59
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,046
Donald Duck?

60
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:14,726
This is absurd!

61
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:17,285
He's famous.

62
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,706
It is how the martial world works now.

63
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:24,945
Nine Heavens, Ten Earths,
Nineteen Demons, Sword Sage...

64
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:30,006
Some even use nicknames
like Sweetheart, Duck, or numbers!

65
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:35,126
So making an impact first won't be easy.

66
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:39,765
To gain reputation quickly, we have
to kill more Power Gang's elite.

67
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:44,305
Qiu Shui, you told us to conserve strength.

68
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:47,225
This is so frustrating!

69
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:50,105
Actually, there's still a way.

70
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:51,885
What is it?

71
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:57,706
All heroes heed the divine token's call.

72
00:04:57,706 --> 00:04:59,785
What is this?

73
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:03,105
Hear me out. This refers to the supreme treasure!

74
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,645
You mean the Hero Token?

75
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,765
Exactly.

76
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,125
The Hero Token was forged from meteorites by Emei,
Wudang,

77
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:15,205
and Shaolin sect leaders.

78
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:20,706
I heard Yan Kuang Tu hid
the supreme Book of Oblivion within it.

79
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:24,046
If you obtain it, you could be famous
throughout the martial circle.

80
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:28,686
The Hero Token is with Madam Wu,
mother of General Wu Jie at Xianren Pass.

81
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:31,745
Everyone in the martial world
is seeking her whereabouts.

82
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:38,385
How do we find the Book of Oblivion
within the Hero Token?

83
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,246
Book of Oblivion again!

84
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:52,146
I can't get the manual
before becoming a sect leader.

85
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:56,600
But I can't become a sect leader
without the manual.

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,960
It's a dead end!

87
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:06,745
Just kill my character!

88
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:12,185
What are you mumbling? Don't worry about that.

89
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,185
- Let's go have some fun first.
- Where to?

90
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:16,545
- Let's go, Qiu Shui! 
 - Take it! Tang Rou.

91
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,506
- What about Feng Lang?
- Have fun first!

92
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,797
- What's our next step?
- Let's go first.

93
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:22,985
 

94
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,306
Here! This is the place!

95
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:36,030

00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,865
- Look how well they dance! 
 - Impressive!

97
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:48,166
Good!

98
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,890
&nbsp;

99
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:56,265
- Sir, this way please.
- Good!

100
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,765
Beautiful!

101
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:01,645
- Good!
- Good!

102
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,706
Good!

103
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,220
- Do you like this? 
 - Pretty great.

104
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,420
Glad that you like it.

105
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,745
This dance is new.

106
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:20,845
- Let's go, Qiu Shui. 
 - Excellent.

107
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:23,285
You think the same as I do.

108
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,066
How is it, Qiu Shui?

109
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:40,606
The Qunfang Hall is lively,
with countless heroes and scholars visiting.

110
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:45,206
 This scene setting has been reproduced accurately. 

111
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:54,045
- Good.
- Good.

112
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,666
Qiu Shui.

113
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:02,265
Qiu Shui.

114
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,706
- Qiu Shui?
- What?

115
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:08,346
Why do you look nervous?

116
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:12,786
- I think we should...
- Oh!

117
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:19,105
Mr. Zuo! Long time no see. Greetings to you all.

118
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:21,106
Madam, find us a quiet spot.

119
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:23,606
Sure. This way please.

120
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,246
Let's go, Boss.

121
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,605
Please!

122
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:33,086
- Hong Ye! Qing Liu!
- Coming!

123
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,530
&nbsp;

124
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:03,950
 This poison is potent.
 

125
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,640
I can't even expel it out of my body.

126
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:47,946
 Even if I'm so hurt that I can't move,
approaching me would cost their lives. 

127
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:59,765
- Good.
- Good.

128
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:08,986
Sir, bring a pot of fine wine
to that private room.

129
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:11,165
Alright. Please wait.

130
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,525
Move aside! Make way!

131
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,185
Why causing trouble here?

132
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,805
A murderer of our men is hiding here.
Stay out of our way!

133
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,765
Power Gang?

134
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:26,366
Search!

135
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:31,565
 Did the Power Gang know we killed Fu Tian Yi? 

136
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:34,966
Search thoroughly.

137
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,686
- Move aside!
- Clear the path! Search!

138
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:41,925
- Don't block the way!
- Move aside! Clear out!

139
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,726
Sirs, you can't barge in like this!

140
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,325
- Make way!
- Make way!

141
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,725
- Check thoroughly!
- Search!

142
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,966
- Move! 
 - They acted so fast.

143
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,385
Open the door!

144
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,700
You, go!

145
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,620
Pardon me.

146
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,760
I'll hide here for a while.

147
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,405
He's in the room! Go!

148
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,140
 

149
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:06,345
 Feng Lang? My Lucky Bag NPC Feng Lang? 

150
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:35,525
Stop! Who are you? How dare you interfere us?

151
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,745
I am here to uphold justice.

152
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,470
Get him!

153
00:12:57,765 --> 00:12:59,380
Catch the sword!

154
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:26,935
 Muscle memory has been fully awakened. 

155
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:29,785
 I'm more skilled than I was
when fighting Fu Tian Yi. 

156
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:32,825
 It's not bad to run into Feng Lang. 

157
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,366
- Qiu Shui!
- Qiu Shui!

158
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,825
- Are you okay?
- Qiu Shui.

159
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,126
You finished them all alone so quickly?

160
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:50,785
Are you trying to earn reputation?

161
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:53,460
I see.

162
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:58,665
Look, Xiao Qiu Shui, third young master
of Huanhua Sect, is upholding justice!

163
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:01,246
Spread the word far and wide!

164
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:04,226
That's Xiao Qiu Shui? Impressive!

165
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,080
- It's him?
- Indeed.

166
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,026
Extraordinary!

167
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,945
 Xiao Qiu Shui? 

168
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:14,086
Huanhua Sect?

169
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,805
Shut up!

170
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:20,405
Kid, do you know who you've saved?

171
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:25,826
He acted quickly. I didn't even see
how he killed that guy.

172
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:35,717
- Who did you save?
- My friend, Feng Lang.

173
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:38,166
 

174
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:42,070
 

175
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:46,726
 It's the jade pendant I described. Exactly. 

176
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:17,417
Sword sings like rain.

177
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,470
 

178
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,185
Rain Sword.

179
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:27,845
It's him alright.

180
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:14,465
 The scar is at the position I wrote. 

181
00:16:14,465 --> 00:16:16,965
 Location and token are correct. 

182
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:19,665
 It must be him. 

183
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,710
 

184
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:52,600
You're awake. Don't move.

185
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,560
Don't move. You're injured.

186
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,866
Who are you?

187
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:11,845
Tell me, is this jade pendant yours?

188
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,540
Yes.

189
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:18,245
I am Feng Lang, the Rain Sword.

190
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:29,746
It is you indeed.

191
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:42,726
This darn system finally did something right.

192
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:48,365
Bro! I'm glad. My bro!

193
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:51,466
Sir. Sir.

194
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:54,366
Apologies. I am too excited.

195
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:03,106
Have we met before?

196
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:07,705
Never too late to know each other.
Well, let me get you water.

197
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,446
Let me ask you.

198
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:19,966
Who's your master? When did you start
swordsmanship? What's your favorite?

199
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,265
Here. Have some.

200
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,165
I don't know.

201
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,506
W-What?

202
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:37,626
Did you hurt your brain?

203
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:42,006
Sir, what are you trying to get from me?

204
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:51,826
 A crash might happen to the Lucky Bag
when meeting a player abruptly. 

205
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:56,060
Lucky Bag, I know you're powerful.

206
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,400
Rest assured, I'll keep your secret.

207
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:06,325
Why do you keep calling me Lucky Bag?

208
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,890
How to explain it?

209
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,660
I can't clarify this now.

210
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,106
Anyway, you'll help me kill enemies,
get treasures, and offer strategies.

211
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:25,225
Most importantly,
you'll help me become a sect leader.

212
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:29,726
Do you feel compelled to protect me at first sight

213
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,845
and want to do everything for me?

214
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:35,166
- No.
- No?

215
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:39,886
At first sight, I sensed you might not live long.

216
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,976
 Weird. 

217
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:46,805
 The Feng Lang I wrote
not only helped me find Supreme Elixir, 

218
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:49,144
 but also transferred all his power to me. 

219
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:53,626
 Why is he different now? 

220
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,525
Haven't you regarded me as a friend yet?

221
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,246
Should I?

222
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:10,045
 Not friends yet.
So the Lucky Bag remains inactivated? 

223
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:15,185
Don't worry. We're not friends now,
but you'll understand what I mean later.

224
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:19,346
But for now, the priority
is to heal your injury first.

225
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:23,605
Water is there. Help yourself.
I'll fetch a physician for you.

226
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:38,446
Feng Lang?

227
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,385
Xiao Qiu Shui?

228
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:49,845
Mr. Feng's injuries are minor, but he's
poisoned with Cantharides Poison.

229
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:53,165
Cantharides Poison?
It's a poison without toxicity.

230
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:55,525
It requires another poison
without toxicity to detox.

231
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,106
The Power Gang is so cruel.

232
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:04,705
Xue Yu is skilled in medicine. Qiu Shui,
take him to Huanhua Sect for treatment.

233
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:08,966
The poison in him will activate
within three days. Time is limited.

234
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,306
Three days?

235
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,125
Then what to do?

236
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,805
Qiu Shui, I know a place.

237
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:21,106
Brewer Manor. The master is famous
for brewing extraordinary wines.

238
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:24,465
There's a wine called Drunken Styx that
can make one drunk to death instantly.

239
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:27,706
- It's a poison without toxicity. 
 - This works.

240
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:30,765
The Brewer Manor is only
half a day's journey from here.

241
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:34,525
Good. Let's set out now.

242
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,505
- Let's go.
- Wait, Qiu Shui.

243
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:41,726
Who is that Feng Lang? You saved him,
and now you're trying to heal him too?

244
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,806
Helping those in need is our duty.

245
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:54,025
Qiu Shui, you're acting strange.

246
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:59,386
Yu Han, I can't explain everything right now.

247
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:04,346
The martial world is in chaos.
I naturally need loyal followers.

248
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:08,166
Enough talk! Let's go.

249
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:31,246
Feng, hang on. We're almost there.

250
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:36,206
We're mere acquaintances.
Xiao, why go to such lengths?

251
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:42,826
Well, even if I told you,
you might not understand.

252
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:48,106
The priority now is to activate our friendship.

253
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:52,705
Is befriending me really that important?

254
00:22:57,745 --> 00:23:00,110
Well, Feng.

255
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,980
Do you think
surviving in the martial world is tough?

256
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:09,325
It's indeed not easy.

257
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:17,146
Right?

258
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:27,085
When I first arrived here,
every step was a struggle.

259
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:31,254
Thinking of the challenges ahead

260
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:36,045
fills me with dread.

261
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,846
Never mind. Let's not dwell on it.

262
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:49,074
As long as we become friends
and support each other,

263
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:54,486
we can achieve greater success
in this troublesome martial world.

264
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:58,146
I see.

265
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:03,106
If my poison is cured, then I will be your friend.

266
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:08,865
Why are you smiling so unnaturally?
Come on, fist bump.

267
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:13,206
- This is...
- Deal?

268
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,980
Never mind.

269
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,906
Qiu, hurry up!

270
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:22,665
- Thank you.
- Almost there, Qiu Shui.

271
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,740
 

272
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:53,285
So many want Drunken Styx?
Is it really that amazing?

273
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,605
Drunk straight, it's indeed like poison.

274
00:24:55,605 --> 00:25:00,926
But mixed with spring water,
it is the world's finest wine.

275
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:02,526
Zuo Qiu.

276
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:10,525
Tang Rou, escort Mr. Feng to an inn to rest.

277
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:16,346
Yu Han, Chao Ran. Let's go greet them.

278
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:26,725
 

279
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,805
Here they come.

280
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:34,525
Look! Look at this vase! A family heirloom!

281
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:35,525
Pardon me.

282
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:38,265
Sell it to me! I have gold!

283
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:44,285
Everyone, listen!
Here's only one jar of Drunken Styx.

284
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:48,386
My master said only rare treasures
qualify for exchange.

285
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:53,425
Gold and mansions aren't rare enough!

286
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,706
- Hey, sir...
- I have something.

287
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:13,026
Who's she?

288
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:15,166
What treasure is she offering?

289
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,166
Exactly.

290
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,726
Look what she's holding!

291
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:37,396
Sheye Bloody Wine from
the fallen kingdom Sheye a century ago

292
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,045
is long-lost to this world.

293
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:45,826
But recently, someone found this jar.

294
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:49,786
Sheye Bloody Wine? It's really rare.

295
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:54,126
Ask your master if he wants it.

296
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:59,765
Yes! Yes! Miss, my master adores rare wines!

297
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:02,505
- Qiu Shui.
- Miss, please come in.

298
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,505
Hold on!

299
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:09,446
I have a rare wine too!

300
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:11,505
He has one too?

301
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:15,066
What rare wine have you brought, sir?

302
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:21,346
A wine unprecedented in history.

303
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:26,505
If it's unprecedented, then how did you obtain it?

304
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:28,405
I brewed it myself.

305
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:36,140
Then of course, no one's ever tasted it.

306
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,880
How can you call it unprecedented?

307
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:44,385
I wouldn't dare present any shoddy brew here.

308
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:49,045
Steward, my wine is truly rare.

309
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:53,686
One glance and you'll know I speak truth.

310
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:57,826
Then show it to me now, sir.

311
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:01,686
The wine takes another half a day
to finish brewing.

312
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:03,765
It's not ready?

313
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,066
Steward, this man is just a liar!

314
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:10,406
Don't waste time on him,
and give me the Drunken Styx!

315
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:16,006
If my wine proves ordinary, then you
can give the Drunken Styx to others.

316
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:19,120
But if my wine is extraordinary,

317
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,460
your master will regret missing it.

318
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:27,810
Fine.

319
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,786
Think it over. Bros, let's go.

320
00:28:31,786 --> 00:28:36,565
Wait! I'll wait for you for half a day.

321
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:39,786
My master will personally judge
you two's rare wines,

322
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:45,246
then decide who'll get the Drunken Styx.

323
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,766
Thank you.

324
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:01,225
Qiu Shui, when did you learn brewing?

325
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:03,020
Yu Han. No, Chao Ran.

326
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,166
Time is ticking. Let's divide the work.

327
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,966
I'll go buy wine now.

328
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:12,246
And you'll go find slender bamboo tubes,
porcelain bottles, mint leaves...

329
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:15,740
Right, sugar and salt.

330
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,586
Bamboo tubes, mint leaves, sugar...

331
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:22,185
Wait, Qiu Shui. Can these things make wine?

332
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:25,285
Go! No more dawdling!

333
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:28,765
Excuse me, where can I buy wine?

334
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,909
- Over there.
- Thanks!

335
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:36,514
 

336
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:45,446
Half a day has passed.
I think that man is just a fraud.

337
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:48,280
I bet he wouldn't dare to come again.

338
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,520
Let's stop waiting for him.

339
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:56,445
- In that case, please.
- Wait!

340
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:19,025
 

341
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,066
- Master, the guests are here.
- Let them in.

342
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,826
Yes.

343
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:27,725
Please enter.

344
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,386
Greetings, Manor Master.

345
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,250
Greetings, Manor Master.

346
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,270
&nbsp;

347
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,154
 

348
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:49,966
Do you two have rare wines?

349
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:54,465
Manor Master, I have a jar of Sheye Bloody Wine.

350
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:28,246
Master.

351
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:51,285
Excellent! What a rare wine.

352
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:57,406
It's sweet as dew, rich in flavor
with lingering aftertaste. Wonderful!

353
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:05,106
Sir, what about yours?

354
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:09,415
Manor Master, my wine requires full appreciation.

355
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:12,645
From sight to sip, then to intoxication.

356
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:41,286
Here.

357
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:43,725
Master.

358
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,625
Master.

359
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,685
What's this wine called?

360
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:23,446
Let worldly sorrows drown in a single sip.

361
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:29,806
This wine is called No More Sorrows.

362
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:09,310
After drinking in the pavilion,

363
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,145
I dream of a fair maiden.

364
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:17,850
When I awake at dawn,

365
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,420
no more sorrows remain.

366
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:23,966
No More Sorrows. What a fitting name!

367
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,945
Is this wine that impressive?

368
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:31,585
Its taste is just like other common liquor.

369
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:37,165
Yet the syrup and citron juice mixed in

370
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:42,165
harmonize with the liquor,
transforming its essence.

371
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:48,366
That final touch of salt and mint

372
00:35:48,986 --> 00:35:52,225
is truly brilliant!

373
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:59,625
I've never imagined
I could taste such divine wine!

374
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:03,605
Good. Great!

375
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:09,345
Wait! He just used some tricks to deceive you.

376
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:12,085
Wine should remain pure.

377
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:16,866
You've mixed things in it.
Is this even wine anymore?

378
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:22,145
Wine is all about flavor.
Why care about what's mixed in it?

379
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:23,906
Right, Manor Master?

380
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,565
You are right.

381
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:29,045
- Grandfather!
- Grandfather!

382
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:33,346
- Grandfather, we want some too!
- Grandfather, we want some too!

383
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:36,826
Children shouldn't drink alcohol.
You put me in a bind.

384
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:39,366
Well, sir...

385
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:48,806
Kids, you shouldn't drink alcohol.

386
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,120
- Come here.
- Go ahead.

387
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:54,785
I'll mix you something special.

388
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:10,050

389
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:20,705
There we go. Try it.

390
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:23,346
Take a sip.

391
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,826
Is it good?

392
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,826
- Yes.
- It smells good!

393
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:34,045
- Grandfather, what is this? 
 - Grandfather, it smells good!

394
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:38,190
- Then have more. Go on.
- Okay.

395
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,925
- Take it slow. 
 - Well, what exactly...

396
00:37:46,545 --> 00:37:48,786
S-Soy Milk Qilin.

397
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:54,565
Some lowly trick.

398
00:37:55,145 --> 00:38:01,925
Your wine awakens my appetites,
but his wine opens my mind.

399
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:08,255
All these years, I thought I had mastered brewing, and couldn't be any better,

400
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:10,786
so I muddled along.

401
00:38:10,786 --> 00:38:15,456
But I never imagined there are so much more

402
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:17,706
in brewing that I've never discovered.

403
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:21,805
I still have much to learn.

404
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:26,365
May I know your name?

405
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,545
Xiao Qiu Shui of the Huanhua Sect.

406
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:33,685
You are really amazing! I am deeply grateful.

407
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:36,065
- Steward!
- I am here.

408
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:41,725
Return Sheye Bloody Wine to this lady,
and gift her a thousand taels of silver.

409
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,160
Yes.

410
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:48,305
The Drunken Styx belongs to Mr. Xiao.

411
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,460
Thank you.

412
00:38:57,306 --> 00:39:01,306
Surprisingly, your No More Sorrows worked! 
  

413
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,145
I thought we would be kicked out.

414
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:06,486
Qiu Shui, so those slender bottles you wanted were

415
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:09,466
to distill liquor within liquor
for stronger flavor.

416
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:12,105
Pity that I didn't get
to taste that No More Sorrows.

417
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:15,665
If you want to taste it, I'll brew you some later.

418
00:39:16,985 --> 00:39:20,546
I finally obtained it.

419
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:31,360
You talk harshly and mask your face.

420
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,545
I bet you are mean.

421
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,740
Can't even afford to lose?

422
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,386
Are you a bandit?

423
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:39,006
Give me the Drunken Styx.

424
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:43,505
What? Attempting robbery in broad daylight?

425
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:45,346
Yes.

426
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:46,946
Watch out!

427
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:56,745
- Qiu Shui, are you hurt? 
 - I'm fine.

428
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:58,906
She uses hidden weapons. Be cautious!

429
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:02,810
Sis! Sis!

430
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,346
What are you doing here?

431
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:07,686
- What are you doing here? 
 - Sis?

432
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:10,646
- Sis?
- I'm traveling with friends.

433
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:14,346
That's Xiao Qiu Shui. Come on.

434
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:18,306
So you are always out traveling
with this Xiao Qiu Shui?

435
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:22,605
Sis, Qiu Shui treats me well.

436
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:26,426
Qiu Shui, this is my elder sister Tang Fang.

437
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:31,450
 

438
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:38,426
Tang Rou, you should be careful in making friends.

439
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:44,645
Sis, why do you need the Drunken Styx?

440
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:48,200
- Move.
- Sis,

441
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,540
Qiu Shui is my friend. Stop this!

442
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,426
Tang Rou.

443
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:00,966
You stay out of this.

444
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:04,986
Here is the Drunken Styx. Must you get it from me?

445
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:07,245
Give it to me.

446
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:11,326
I'll break it, and neither of us gets it.

447
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:12,945
- You!
- Fang!

448
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:16,585
Qiu Shui needs the Drunken Styx to save a friend.

449
00:41:16,585 --> 00:41:19,266
Though I don't know why you need it,

450
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:23,586
nothing matters more than a person's life.

451
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:30,606
I got the Iron Command to use Drunken Styx

452
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:33,926
as a gift to open the Clueless Gate.

453
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:37,925
Do you still think a person's life matters more?

454
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:44,006
Tang Rou.

455
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:48,386
What does she mean?

456
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:53,326
When we get the Iron Command,
we must succeed in our actions.

 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

487
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,957
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

488
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:55,520
 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

489
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:59,286
 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

490
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:01,844
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

491
00:44:01,844 --> 00:44:05,622
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

492
00:44:05,622 --> 00:44:12,994
 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

493
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:22,400
 ♫ As flowers fall, so does the heart ♫ 

494
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,190
