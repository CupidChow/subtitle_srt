Qiu Shui.

23
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:57,221
In the next life,

24
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,140
we'll still be best friends.

25
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,781
Tang Rou.

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,140
Tang Rou.

27
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,740
 How did this happen? 

28
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,740
 I have saved Tang Rou. Why did he still die here? 

29
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,820
 Why couldn't I stop all this from happening?

Tang Fang.

47
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,340
Thank you for everything you've done.

48
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,621
Please take the cart and the horse.

49
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:08,141
It's scorching, so Mr. Tang Rou's body
needs to be buried soon.

50
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,541
Please take him back to the Tang Sect now.

51
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:20,621
Madam Wu, could you send someone
to escort his body back on my behalf?

 ♫ Like a mournful farewell ode ♫

There are still family matters I must attend to.

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,821
I may have to stay for a few days.

55
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:36,580
In that case, Jiang Yue.

56
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,540
Here.

57
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,621
Proceed as Lady Tang has instructed.

58
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,421

73
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:13,460
Madam, Mr. Feng Lang woke up.

74
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,501
Let's check on him.

75
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,580
How is he doing?

76
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,340
The sword wound missed vital points, though deep.

77
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,301
But the palm strike burned all his lung meridians

78
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,380
with internal energy.

79
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,941
Madam Wu, there isn't much I can do.

80
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,661
Why is this happening? Why?

81
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,820
Qiu Shui.

82
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,541
Don't move.

83
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,980
It's pointless.

84
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,861
I was seriously injured as a child.

85
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,741
Though a master cured me,
the injury took a toll on me.

86
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:21,220
Kang Chu Yu's palm strike
must have landed on my old wounds.

87
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:27,220
Who was this master? We'll find him.

88
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:33,581
That master was reclusive and aloof.

89
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:40,221
He declared all debts settled after healing me.

90
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:44,700
He wouldn't help again even if you found him.

91
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,300
Feng Lang, can you tell us who he is?

92
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,460
If he's from the martial world,
I might be able to reach out.

93
00:08:55,581 --> 00:09:01,340
He was Master Dayin.

94
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
But he roams the world freely.

95
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,660
No one knows his whereabouts.

96
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,300
The Xiao family suffered casualties,
Mr. Tang Rou perished here,

97
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,381
and you are gravely injured.

98
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:24,421
I can't bear seeing you die untreated.

99
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:33,180
Master Zhang, will you do me a favor?

100
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,980
Please speak freely.

101
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:39,420
Take the Hero Token with you

102
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,218
and carry Mr. Feng to search
the martial world for Master Dayin.

103
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,900
Seeing the Hero Token,

104
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,900
the righteous martial artists
will help you find that master.

105
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,141
Please don't.

106
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,900
Madam Wu, my job was to guard you and this token.

107
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,221
How can I use it for myself?

108
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:12,300
The Hero Token was forged by leaders
of Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei.

109
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,020
It was meant to save the nation and punish evil.

110
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,540
Yet for decades, it's only brought bloodshed.

111
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,700
Now, using it to save lives

112
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,541
fulfills its true purpose.

113
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,581
Don't you agree?

114
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,381
That's right.

115
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,820
- Mr. Feng, please accept it.
- Madam Wu.

116
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,461
Master Zhang, will you help me?

117
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,420
By your command.

118
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,940
It's a matter of life and death. Do not delay.

119
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,740
Master Zhang, please set out this afternoon.

120
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:57,020
Understood.

121
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,220
Thank you for your help, Madam Wu.

122
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,900
Thank you, Madam.

123
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,621
Feng Lang, take your rest. We'll let him rest.

124
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,421
Let's go.

125
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,061
Madam Wu.

126
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:33,381
I would love to escort Mr. Feng and Master Zhang.

127
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,981
Mr. Feng put himself at risk for you.

128
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:39,060
I truly admire his chivalry and dedication.

129
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,660
Therefore, I wish to contribute.

130
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,490
Besides, I can attend to Mr. Feng
more carefully as a girl.

131
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,740
I can also assist Master Zhang.

132
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,820
Your kindness is appreciated.

133
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,740
Go with them.

134
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,781
Lady Tang.

135
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,341
You're a nice and innocent girl.

136
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:13,421
Stay true to yourself no matter what.

137
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,220
 Father. 

138
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,540
 Are you hurting again? 

139
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,861
 
 Yan Kuang Tu 

140
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:32,501
 injured me gravely on Mount Wuxing. 

141
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,420
 I've tried everything. 

142
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,700
 - Perhaps, only...
- The Book of Oblivion? 

143
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,341
 Is that your last resort? 

144
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:46,420
 But Yan Kuang Tu is long gone.
How am I supposed to find him? 

145
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,861
 You don't necessarily have to find him. 

146
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:52,700
 The Book of Oblivion has resurfaced. 

147
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,860
 Yu Zhi Liao from the Clueless Gate
knows everything in the martial world. 

148
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:08,460
 Father, I'll visit the Clueless Gate
and ask Yu Zhi Liao for information. 

149
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,460
 Fang. 

150
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,381
 The Law of the Jungle applies even in our family. 

151
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:23,061
 People only respect us
when I am the family leader. 

152
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,980
 If anyone finds out that I'm injured, 

153
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,061
 our whole branch will perish. 

154
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,221
 Fang, I'm counting on you. 

155
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,341
 You have to find the Book of Oblivion 

156
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:43,021
 and cure me for our whole branch to survive. 

157
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,581
Lady Tang, why don't you pack up?

158
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:52,061
Let's meet in Mr. Feng's chamber later.

159
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:11,661
I'm not dying yet.

160
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,580
Qiu Shui, you don't have to
stay and look after me.

161
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:23,740
I should have protected Tang Rou,

162
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,460
but he died because of me.

163
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,700
Feng Lang, I just thought that you were
different from what I had in mind.

164
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,381
You didn't have to prove anything.

165
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,780
Don't worry.

166
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,420
Since you call me the Lucky Bag,
I'll do my best to stay alive

167
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,620
and bring you luck when you need me.

168
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:04,781
Qiu Shui.

169
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,541
Qiu Shui, Chao Ran said that he would
avenge Tang Rou. I couldn't stop him.

170
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,580
Get some rest.

171
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
- Where are you going?
- Chao Ran.

172
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,220
Chao Ran, stop there.

173
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
You...

174
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,300
Qiu Shui, let me go. I have to avenge Tang Rou.

175
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,780
How?

176
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,581
I'll kill everyone from the Power Gang I run into.

177
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,381
And then what?

178
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:54,781
Then, we'll see.

179
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:58,100
Then I'll watch them kill you

180
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,860
and lose another friend?

181
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,660
But I can't let it go, Qiu Shui.

182
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,861
Get up.

183
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,661
Get up!

184
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,860
I can't, either.

185
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,740
When I first saw you,

186
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,740
I swore that I'd protect all of you.

187
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:48,421
But in the end, I failed.

188
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:57,181
Guys, impulsiveness serves nothing.

189
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,260
The only thing we can do

190
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,621
is to find our enemy

191
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:09,861
and avenge Tang Rou and our buddies.

192
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:14,301
Qiu Shui, the Power Gang is way too powerful.

193
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:20,341
How and when can we take revenge?

194
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,220
I know it's difficult.

195
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,740
But I'll take them down one day.

196
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:46,621
Qiu Shui. I believe in you.

197
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,420
Me too.

198
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,581
Let's return to help the Xiao family.

199
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:54,980
Then we can take down
the Power Gang to avenge Tang Rou.

200
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,900
Alright.

201
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,861
The Hailin Sect may be far,
but our branch is close to Chuanjin.

202
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,021
I'll go back and ask my father for help.

203
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:08,500
Mr. Qu is also at the Sword Retreat.
I'll ask the Qu family for help.

204
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,381
The ladies can send their friends to help.

205
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:22,460
Qiu Shui, here's my favorite booze.
I want you to have it.

206
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,260
Take care.

207
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:37,581
Alright, guys. Be very careful.

208
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,141
Try to avoid that despicable Kang Chu Yu.

209
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:45,341
I truly despise that man.

210
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,781
He became a lackey of the Power Gang.

211
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:51,541
We've been so close to him for years.

212
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,021
My seniors once even said that

213
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,500
he cultivated ice-cold internal energy

214
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,541
to unleash the power of the Hanhao Stone,

215
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,621
which was "awe-inspiring".

216
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:03,381
Unbelievable.

217
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:09,621
Qiu Shui, we'll get going
and wait to avenge Tang Rou.

218
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,420
Qiu Shui.

219
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,220
- Take care.
- Take care.

220
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,020
Take care.

221
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:26,234
 

222
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,260
 My seniors once even said that 

223
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,781
 he cultivated ice-cold internal energy 

224
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:35,181
 to unleash the power of the Hanhao Stone. 

225
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,821
 The sword wound missed vital points, though deep. 

226
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:49,500
 But the palm strike burned all
his lung meridians with internal energy. 

227
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,780
 We will cure you. Then I'll borrow the Hero Token. 

228
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,101
 Madam Wu is kind. I bet she will understand. 

229
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:25,061
They say this box made by
foreign handicraftsmen has two layers.

230
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:29,101
The inner stores items
while the outer contains corrosive liquid.

231
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:34,861
Without this mechanism, the Hero Token
would've been taken last night.

232
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:42,021
Master Zhang, are you opening it now?

233
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,581
Yesterday's fight might have damaged the box.

234
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:48,621
In that case, the corrosive liquid
could destroy the Hero Token.

235
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:02,490
 

236
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,821
All heroes heed the divine token's call.

237
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,621
So this...

238
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,661
This is the Hero Token.

239
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,260
I'll keep it for you.

240
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,141
You faked your injury.

241
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:35,420
Master Zhang isn't so badly injured, either.

242
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,500
Madam Wu is kind, but I've always distrusted you.

243
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,141
It was you all along.

244
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,941
So what?

245
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,260
What did you do to her?

246
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,460
Dream-Bound Incense.

247
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,381
Who are you?

248
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:27,381
You're one of those who destroyed
Herbal Valley 15 years ago, aren't you?

249
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,740
Seems I hit the mark.

250
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:37,780
Master Zhang, it's been 15 years.
It's time to settle the debt.

251
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:56,781
 My job is done. 

252
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:58,500
 I can take her with me. 

253
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,381
 The rest can wait. 

254
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:14,421
What happened to her?

255
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,362
Just drowsy.

256
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,250
Huh.

257
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:33,181
How are you standing again?

258
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,581
Aren't you glad I'm recovering, Qiu Shui?

259
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:42,341
Recovering? Glad?

260
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:46,021
Kang Chu Yu cultivated ice-cold internal energy.

261
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:48,460
Your lung meridians were burnt.

262
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,980
So you've been acting all along.

263
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,780
That's right.

264
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,661
Xiao Qiu Shui. I'm here on behalf
of the Power Gang to claim the Hero Token.

265
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,700
No wonder you claimed

266
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,060
that the world unites through profit.

267
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:13,021
You've been their pawn all along.

268
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:18,980
Qiu Shui. Do you truly believe
I meant to deceive you?

269
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:32,941
You called me Lucky Bag.
How do you like your luck now?

270
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,781
You're sick.

271
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,781
Not as much as your Xiao family
and the Huanhua Sect.

272
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:45,740
Your father Xiao Xi Lou is the true hypocrite.

273
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,301
Nonsense. My father is honorable.

274
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:53,621
He'd sacrifice himself to protect the world.

275
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:58,460
How dare you judge my father?

276
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,141
He appears to be righteous.

277
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:05,260
Yet how many vile deeds has he done?

278
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,381
You have no idea.

279
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:13,381
Your filthy lies sicken me further.

280
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,621
You oath-breaker.

281
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,020
Oath-breaker?

282
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,900
You still believe in oaths?

283
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,061
I made that bet with you at Lingliang Town

284
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:31,780
to show you whether people unite
through profit or righteousness.

285
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,180
In the end, you'll see.

286
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,941
You and your entire family
are absolutely laughable and pathetic.

287
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,181
Young Master, General Wu Jie's
troops are approaching.

288
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:04,980
At least, I didn't...

289
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,341
I didn't fail Rou's trust.

290
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:28,621
Xiao Qiu Shui.

291
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,460
Xiao Qiu Shui.

292
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,220
Xiao Qiu Shui.

293
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:48,282
Young Master.

294
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:56,941
If you are still mad, I'll find
a chance to kill them both.

295
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,568
Mark my words.

296
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:09,861
Harm Tang Fang, and I'll kill you.

297
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:13,541
Please forgive me.

298
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:17,754
I didn't realize Lady Tang's significance.

299
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:20,500
I'll forbid everyone from harming her.

300
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,420
Xiao Qiu Shui. I spared your life today.

301
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,090
You'll live to witness this chaos.

302
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,861
Let's see if you still believe in righteousness.

303
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,181
Song Ming Zhu.

304
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,220
I've obtained the Hero Token.

305
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:45,306
The siege on the Xiao family will only tighten.

306
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,074
Once they run out of water supply,

307
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,141
I'll get in the Sword Retreat

308
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:55,740
and drag Xiao Xi Lou's corpse
to Herbal Valley as a tribute.

309
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,581
Understood.

310
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:01,381
Young Master.

311
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,721
I know you hate the Pine Stone Pills.

312
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:11,821
But you faked the lung meridian injuries
with the Thunder Sting Technique.

313
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,021
It harms your health.

314
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,821
Please take one to speed up your recovery.

315
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,621
Song Ming Zhu.

316
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,301
Just complete the tasks I assigned you.

317
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:26,460
Don't meddle with my matters.

318
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,300
Understood.

319
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,301
Those who oppose me in the gang

320
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:44,260
must be rooted out one by one.

321
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,346
Or they'll forget
that I am the deputy gang leader.

322
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,260
Let's go back.

323
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,740
- Greetings, Madam Wu.
- Greetings, Madam Wu.

324
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,394
Why did you bring troops here?

325
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:27,450
Where's my son?

326
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,602
Madam. A month ago, the court falsely accused
General Wu of failing to defend the pass

327
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:34,740
and put him in jail.

328
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,101
So we abandoned our military status
and retreated to the mountains.

329
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,066
Get up.

330
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,220
Up.

331
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,301
You're Daxi soldiers, after all.

332
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,381
How can you just leave?

333
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:58,260
With General Wu there, we were defenders of Daxi.

334
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,781
But without him, we'd be reassigned as laborers.

335
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,700
Once disbanded,
this elite force will no longer exist.

336
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,901
You must save the general for us to save Daxi.

337
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:14,861
The emperor's decree can't be defied.

338
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:17,141
Madam Wu, your noble title grants influence.

339
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,781
If you plead his case,

340
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:20,781
you might get the general out of trouble.

341
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:23,381
We await General Wu's vindication.

342
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,500
- We await General Wu's vindication.
- We await General Wu's vindication.

343
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:36,341
Madam.

344
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:38,500
Please agree to their plea.

345
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,541
If they go back, these troops will perish.

346
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,954
It will be a huge loss for Daxi.

347
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:47,220
Fine.

348
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,020
All of you, rise.

349
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:53,381
I'll risk this old frame

350
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:55,301
and journey to the capital.

351
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,220
- Thank you, Madam Wu.
- Thank you, Madam Wu.

352
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:05,498
 

353
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,700
Tang Rou.

354
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,740
Tang Rou.

355
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,541
Your sister will be fine.

356
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,141
Your sister will definitely be fine.

357
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,780
She'll be alright.

358
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,781
I'm here.

359
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:36,581
I'm fine.

360
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:52,500
How is he doing?

361
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,660
Madam Wu, the injury
is quite serious but non-fatal.

362
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,341
He will be fine in a few days.

363
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,980
Madam, Master Zhang...

364
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:16,341
Luckily, his heart meridian sits
slightly to the left.

365
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:19,260
That's how he survived.

366
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,980
But he may never wield a sword again.

367
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:43,859
 

368
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:49,434
 

369
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,860
Who was so bold?

370
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,660
Yeah, I wonder.

371
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,700
The gang leader's in seclusion.

372
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,061
 
Who summoned us with the Assembly Drum?

373
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:14,861
I did.

374
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,541
- Greetings, Master Liu.
- Greetings, Master Liu.

375
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:27,220
I've gathered you here

376
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,100
to seek your advice.

377
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,941
While tracking the Hero Token,

378
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:40,860
Sword King's men obstructed me at Lingliang Town.

379
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,458
 
Yan Gui Gui, Iron Cavalry Demon,

380
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,994
 
suddenly appeared

381
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,082
 

382
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,101
 
and sabotaged my plan.

383
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,380
 

384
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,260
 
I wonder

385
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,460
if Sword King meant to oppose me.

386
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,220
Did Sword King order you

387
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,660
to block me in Lingliang Town

388
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,260
and send Iron Cavalry Demon
Yan Gui Gui and Kang Chu Yu

389
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,221
to steal the Hero Token from Madam Wu?

390
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,221
- I...
- Sword King didn't do it.

391
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,020
I did.

392
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,901
Gang Rule Fourteen.

393
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:26,061
All commands require approval
from the gang leader or deputy before execution.

394
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,820
Ju Xiu Shan.

395
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,620
Do you confess?

396
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,021
But the gang rules also forbid
low-rank members in the Xixian Hall.

397
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:41,901
Master Liu, didn't you also violate
the rule by dragging this messenger here?

398
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:43,780
Let's be flexible.

399
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,421
Yeah. We're all brothers and sisters here.

400
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:49,621
- Why...
- Medicine King, stop playing mediator.

401
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:51,621
I strictly follow the rules.

402
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:57,421
This rule about access
to the Xixian Hall applies to the living.

403
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,660
Corpses don't count.

404
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:18,340
Master Liu, among the Eight Kings,
the Sword King reigns supreme.

405
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,820
Shouldn't we revisit this matter later?

406
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,821
The Assembly Drum has sounded.

407
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:27,648
Sword King and Fire King are absent.

408
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:33,941
As deputy leader, I shall temporarily
fulfill Sword King's duties.

409
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,860
Even if I've been disrespectful,

410
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,322
I'd only face half-month confinement
in the Contemplation Cell.

411
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,741
This is only your first offense.

412
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:47,380
Secondly, your subordinate, Iron Demon Fu Tian Yi,

413
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,421
embezzled from Jinyin Bank
and colluded with enemies.

414
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:55,180
Thirdly, outside Xiangyang,

415
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:00,421
Purple Phoenix poisoned me
and attempted an assassination.

416
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:03,260
Today, you won't escape judgment.

417
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,901
Liu Sui Feng, Purple Phoenix is your subordinate.

418
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,701
What did I do?

419
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:15,700
All Kings consumed
the gang leader's Better-Dead Pills.

420
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,421
If we kill each other, the pill will break.

421
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:22,380
The attackers will be gravely injured,

422
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,581
allowing others to execute them.

423
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:27,541
You think I can't deal with you?

424
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:30,621
Is that why you're so relentless?

425
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:35,898
But remember, one can strike
without murderous intent.

426
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:51,620
 
My respects, Master, Madam.

427
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,656
 

428
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:58,740
Master meditates in seclusion. Keep it down.

429
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,581
Must I remind you?

430
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:03,101
Master, Madam.

431
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:05,581
Liu Sui Feng has grown tyrannical

432
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,541
and he's falsely accusing me now.

433
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,101
Please do me justice.

434
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:12,581
Master and I heard your arguments.

435
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,061
You know our rules.

436
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:17,820
Words without evidence mean nothing.

437
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,861
I have proof.

438
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:33,370
 

439
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,141
Get up.

440
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:42,220
- Thank you, Master.
- Thank you, Master.

441
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,581
Fu Tian Yi sent this confidential letter to me.

442
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:51,581
It reveals Liu's collusion with
Twelve Waterways' Heavenly King Zhu.

443
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:56,941
After sending it, Fu Tian Yi fell prey
to Liu Sui Feng's tricks and got killed.

444
00:38:56,941 --> 00:39:00,220
Now Liu Sui Feng is framing Fu Tian Yi.

445
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,221
It's all part of his scheme
to purge rivals and seize power.

446
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,301
Master, Madam.

447
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:15,341
I'm innocent.

448
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,101
Ju Xiu Shan.

449
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,820
At your service.

450
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,021
This letter reeks of self-serving fabrication.

451
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,666
This is not proof.

452
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,458
Understood.

453
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:29,498
- Sui Feng.
- Master.

454
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:34,301
Don't blame Xiu Shan for Purple Phoenix
and Fu Tian Yi's deeds.

455
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:36,981
Understood.

456
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:39,500
Actually, I have a question for you.

457
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,820
Why did you lead so many people

458
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,300
to besiege Xiao family's Sword Retreat,
which caused us a huge casualty?

459
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,660
Master, it was for the Hero Token.

460
00:39:56,501 --> 00:40:00,300
After I learned that Madam Wu
was at the Sword Retreat,

461
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,220
I took the initiative to besiege them

462
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,861
before I could write to inform you.

463
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,460
Where's the token now?

464
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:32,474
 

465
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,461
Yan Kuang Tu.

466
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:52,701
Surrender the Hero Token.

467
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:59,642
 

468
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:06,074
 

469
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,101
Yan Kuang Tu.

470
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:16,221
Your massacre proves you unworthy of this token.

471
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,341
You have objections?

472
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,740
Even with 16 sects combined,

473
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,180
you'll only add a dozen corpses to my count.

474
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,580
Fine.

475
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:37,020
I'll spar with you all today.

476
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,501
If anyone manages to take

477
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,581
the Hero Token from me,

478
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,061
I'll respect their courage.

479
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:46,820
I shall give them this token,

480
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,381
as well as the Book of Oblivion.

481
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:02,141
But if you fail to defeat me,

482
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:06,421
you shall obey my commands henceforth.
