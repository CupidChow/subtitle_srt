23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:44,111
Do you know who's behind the Jinyin Bank?

24
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,551
Who?

25
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:50,271
Fu Tian Yi, a demon of the Power Gang.

26
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,870
So what if it's him?

27
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,391
Qiu Shui, you always
advocate for upholding justice.

28
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,951
You're the boldest of us all.

29
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,140
Why do you seem different today?

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,030

⚔️ Loading... @VikiTeam.com 

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,190
Actually, it's because...

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,910
I get it!

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,510
The Power Gang has never touched Jinzhong.

34
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,351
He's worried that if they find us,

35
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,351
they will have an excuse
to attack Jinzhong's martial circle.

36
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,671
That's why you want us to ambush them, right?

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,930
 I am lucky. 

38
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:37,511
Sure. Seems you understand me best.

39
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,851
That's exactly it.

40
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:45,551
No wonder you're the boss of us. You're visionary.

41
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,391
It makes sense.

42
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,030
Don't worry, Qiu Shui.

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,831
Before meeting you, we were rookies
obsessed with martial arts.

44
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,870
You lead us to help the weak
and fight for justice.

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,991
We'll do what you say, anyway.

46
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,480
Good.

47
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,830
We'll leave for Zihui tomorrow.

48
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,310
Okay.

49
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,710
Okay.

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,851
 Wait, I just remembered 

51
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:23,411
 Tang Rou got ambushed in the original story. 

52
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,951
Tang Rou, you won't go with us this time.

53
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,111
Why?

54
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:46,490
Because I met a fortune teller who said

55
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,571
that this trip would put you in danger.

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,030
Stop laughing! I'm serious!

57
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,710
- Qiu Shui.
- Qiu Shui.

58
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,271
Are you kidding?

59
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:06,750
We take risks all the time
while upholding justice.

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,270
Even if I fear danger,
the Meteoric Needles of mine won't!

61
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,591
Can't you take this seriously? I'm not kidding.

62
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,370
Qiu Shui, why are you acting so timid?

63
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,811
Did the fortune teller curse you or something?

64
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:29,830
 Whatever. I'll play it by ear. 

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,371
 I should've read the book carefully. 

66
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,270
 

67
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,551
Be careful. Come.

68
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,630
- Watch your step!
- Thanks.

69
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,251
Thank you. Take care.

70
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,911
- Let's go.
- Take care!

71
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:55,591
- Madam, almost done.
- Alright.

72
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,331
One tray of buns, four beef noodles.

73
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,950
Coming right up!

74
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,231
Have a seat, Qiu Shui.

75
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,491
- Over here, Qiu Shui.
- Tea, please.

76
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,830
Here.

77
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,691
These buns look good.

78
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,730
- Drink water. It's scorching.
- Move aside!

79
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,410
Stop staring! Scram!

80
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,351
Move! Out of the way!

81
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,091
Out of the way! Now!

82
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:23,830
- What's this?
- What're you doing?

83
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,930
- Don't resist! 
 - Let go!

84
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,991
- Hurry up!
- Let go!

85
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,510
Have mercy, sir! Please!

86
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,351
I'll give you one more day.

87
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:37,750
If the Jinyin Bank doesn't get the money
by noon tomorrow, I'll burn your boat!

88
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,450
Stop!

89
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:45,630
What are you doing?

90
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,430
Trying to be heroes?

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,571
Sure, any problems?

92
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:51,430
Young man, don't fight with them!

93
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,814
My business will be ruined if you do.

94
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:54,950
Exactly!

95
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,711
Did you hear that?

96
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,430
 Time to uphold justice? 

97
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,591
- You have one day!
- Yes, sir!

98
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,550
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

99
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,991
Are you two alright?

100
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,630
Thank you both.

101
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,750
Tang Rou, ask that boat owner what's going on.

102
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,111
Sir, what happened?

103
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:26,671
Alas. We emptied our savings
for this boat to make a living.

104
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:31,190
We used to pay Heavenly King Zhu,
the controller of the waterway.

105
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:37,711
Now, the Jinyin Bank
also takes money from boat owners.

106
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,950
Since the war just ended two years ago,
we haven't earned any money yet.

107
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,991
We can't keep this business afloat.

108
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:47,351
Jinyin Bank again?

109
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,430
How do they get away with this?

110
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,770
No one in Wubei dares to offend them.

111
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,471
They can make your life really miserable.

112
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,671
True.

113
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:01,471
 That's it. The NPCs' quest. 

114
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:04,231
That's all. Goodbye.

115
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,831
Let's go.

116
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:13,111
Qiu Shui, you were right.

117
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:17,430
That's outrageous!
Qiu Shui, we must go to the Jinyin Bank!

118
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,830
Agreed.

119
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,830
Wait! Shouldn't we plan first?

120
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,571
Our noodles haven't been served yet. Sit. Come on.

121
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,011
No planning. Let's go now!

122
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,390
- There's no time to plan!
- Come on.

123
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,351
- Let's go.
- But I'm hungry.

124
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,630
- Come on.
- Sword!

125
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,791
This way, Qiu Shui.

126
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,382
- Your beef noodles.
- We're leaving.

127
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:37,710
What happened?

128
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:44,990
 

129
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,110
This is the place.

130
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,850
Guys, take it.

131
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,330
Once inside, don't reveal your identities.

132
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,591
Keep your masks on.

133
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:07,551
Qiu Shui, we're here to do justice.
We don't need masks.

134
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,591
- Exactly!
- Let's move.

135
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:12,710
Just wear it at night. Take it!

136
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,870
Those buns upset my stomach.

137
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,851
I need to use the toilet. You all stay alert.

138
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,931
Don't go. You're pulling an old trick.

139
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,071
I get it now.

140
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:34,251
You're trying to send us away again
to face the enemy alone, aren't you?

141
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:37,770
Qiu Shui, I'm telling you,
that won't happen again.

142
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,951
Exactly.

143
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,030
I'm not joking with you.

144
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,611
To be clear, this place is extremely dangerous.

145
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,231
You must be extra careful. Understand?

146
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,910
I mean it. Be extremely cautious!

147
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,571
Can't argue with him. Let's go.

148
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:58,550
Argue about what? I'm talking.
Where are you going?

149
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,951
Isn't the entrance over there?

150
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:03,951
Make way, Qiu Shui.

151
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,790
Why?

152
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,711
Make way.

153
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,511
Why?

154
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,771
 Oh my god. 

155
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,231
They can actually fly!

156
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,810
 Maybe I should try too. 

157
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,170
 You've got to be kidding me.
I can't do that at all? 

158
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:48,930
Today's collection from Hehan Street.

159
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,150
This is the money from 18 shops
at the intersection.

160
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,270
Good.

161
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,811
A female shop owner kept crying
about bad business and refused to pay.

162
00:09:58,811 --> 00:09:59,910
I dragged her back here.

163
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,111
Boss, how should we handle this?

164
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,191
Gouge her eyes out and throw her
in the market as a warning.

165
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,331
Who are you? How dare you barge in!

166
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,550
Do you know who owns this place?

167
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,431
Sure, Fu Tian Yi,
the Iron Demon of the Power Gang.

168
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,930
Since you know, why aren't you crawling away?

169
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:46,530
We're not leaving.
We're here to eliminate the evil.

170
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,091
Big talk! Chop them into pieces for fish bait!

171
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:20,250
 They're being serious! 

172
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:36,891
 Zuo Qiu's grappling skill is impressive,
precise, and powerful. 

173
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:41,630
 As a swordsman, Yu Han focuses on
clever techniques of the Hailin Sect. 

174
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,111
 It's quite powerful. 

175
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,371
 Darts. Tang Sect's hidden weapons are so good. 

176
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,670
 No wonder the Tang Sect has been century-old. 

177
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,531
 My buddies are all doing great. 

178
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:07,831
Blood! This is real blood.

179
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,791
- Where's Fu Tian Yi? 
 - I don't know.

180
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,611
 Escaping is the best strategy
for me. I need to live. 

181
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,431
Be careful!

182
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,931
Got it.

183
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,351
You two, where are you heading?

184
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,650
Young man, you are...?

185
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,111
Don't you remember?

186
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:26,390
We helped you when you were bullied
at the dock yesterday.

187
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,950
- I remember.
- Sure. I remember you.

188
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,591
Here's the thing.

189
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:35,231
We've had money to pay off the Jinyin Bank.

190
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,611
We hope they'll show mercy and leave us alone.

191
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:40,411
Exactly.

192
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:45,390
You don't have to go.
Someone already eliminated them.

193
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,910
Impossible! That's the Power Gang's bank!

194
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,810
True.

195
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,850
Rest assured, no one will oppress you anymore.

196
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:04,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

197
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,710
- You may go.
- Hey, young man.

198
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:12,390
You destroyed the Jinyin Bank?

199
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,790
That's a great thing!

200
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,431
That evil bank deserved to be wiped out!

201
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:19,131
Enough!

202
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,210
Young man...

203
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,290
Watch your tongue!

204
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,351
 A man fishing in the storm
on the riverside boulders. 

205
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:51,911
 That's Fu Tian Yi, the Iron Demon. 
 

206
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:56,811
 I've tried to stay far away!
How did I still encounter him? 

207
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,910
 This character showed up too abruptly. 

208
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:03,711
- You go first. 
 - Alright.

209
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:14,831
- Don't move!
- Stay on your knees!

210
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,490
Behave! Stay on your knees!

211
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,951
 
Unbelievable.

212
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,351
The Jinyin Bank actually colluded
with North Wasteland!

213
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:29,910
But these thugs won't talk.
We can't find the mastermind.

214
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,631
We've fought all night,
but still can't locate the Iron Demon.

215
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,991
These three young men are great.

216
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:40,990
Did you see? They destroyed the Jinyin Bank.

217
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,270
 Tang Rou, there's something I must warn you about. 

218
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,591
 What is it? 

219
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,391
 Beware of someone... 

220
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,970
 What? 

221
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:09,111
 Nothing. Just remember, guard
against anyone holding an umbrella. 

222
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:11,071
 An umbrella. 

223
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,071
 What? Are you getting superstitious? 

224
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:20,451
 Besides, it doesn't look like rain. 

225
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,870
 Be serious! I'm not joking. 

226
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,410
 Remember my words.
Watch out for umbrella carriers. Got it? 

227
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,570
 Many people are holding an umbrella.
Who am I supposed to be wary of? 

228
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,731
- Exactly! 
 - Bad people deserve it!

229
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:36,231
- The rain stopped.
- It did.

230
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:40,030
No one uses umbrellas when it's not raining.

231
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,930
Move aside!

232
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,571
- The constables!
- The constables!

233
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,031
- Arrest the bad people.
- Take them away!

234
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:49,670
- Those are the culprits!
- Yes, arrest them all!

235
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,170
- Capture these beasts! That's right.
- Don't move!

236
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,590
Who are you?

237
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,711
We're the bringers of justice.
You officials finally show up now.

238
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,911
May I know your names?

239
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,270
We are...

240
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,590
No need to know our names.

241
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,571
We've locked the criminals
in the backyard. Just take them.

242
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,711
The Jinyin Bank has been oppressing the people.

243
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:18,030
As a mere constable, I've failed
to act. I am ashamed.

244
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,391
But you've only caught small fry.
Their real leader...

245
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:26,410
Do you know where their real leader is?

246
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:30,131
Just for the record, if you don't speak now,

247
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:33,590
the trouble will fall on you after we leave.

248
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,490
Fine. I'll take you there.

249
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,630
Good heavens!

250
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,250
That's Qiu Shui!

251
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,851
- Qiu Shui!
- He found Fu Tian Yi.

252
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,170
I knew it! He's risking his life alone again.

253
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,191
Stay back! It's dangerous!

254
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,350
Sure, Qiu Shui. We won't interfere.

255
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,310
We'll leave the Iron Demon to you only.

256
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,230
- Come on, Qiu Shui! You can do it! 
 - Beat him.

257
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,771
You idiots! Are you kidding me?

258
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,671
Keep going, Qiu Shui!

259
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:12,371
- Keep it up!
- Fight on!

260
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,230
The second skill of Huanhua Swordplay, Soaring.

261
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:46,450
The third skill, Petals Plucking!

262
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,951
The fourth skill, Starry Fall!

263
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,870
- Qiu Shui!
- Qiu Shui!  Are you hurt?

264
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,530
Are you okay?

265
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,031
I'm fine.

266
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:14,550
 So, my subconscious remembers
this body's martial arts training. 

267
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,730
Huanhua Swordplay?

268
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:23,770
Since when do Xiao Xi Lou's men 
dare oppose Power Gang?

269
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,771
I hear you killed my men.

270
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:35,631
Then stay and fill vacancies. Serve me.

271
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,890
You won't refuse, will you?

272
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,170
You wish! Of course, we refuse.

273
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,911
You think you can command us?

274
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:50,070
All of you are no match for me.

275
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,231
We can't fight you individually.

276
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:59,051
But four against one? We might not lose.

277
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:03,590
You think you have three buddies?

278
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:08,091
It's not that I think so. It's a fact.

279
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,951
What if I remove one?

280
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:16,251
Remove one? Tang Rou!

281
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,370
It's you!

282
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,331
Are you hurt?

283
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,751
Tang Rou.

284
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,231
Good thing I have this.

285
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:36,751
 Right. Take this for protection. 

286
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,671
 Underpants? These aren't my size. 

287
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,571
 Tie them on. 

288
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,030
No one ambushes Tang Sect members.

289
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:01,631
- Remember this.
- The four of us stay together.

290
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,830
Then the four of you die!

291
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:52,951
- Qiu Shui!
- Qiu Shui!

292
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,951
- Charge!
- Charge!

293
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,830
Are you guys okay?

294
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:35,811
- Sure. 
 - The Iron Demon, true to his name.

295
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:42,371
He is invulnerable!

296
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,371
Fu Tian Yi's hands are no go.

297
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,030
Tang Rou, Yu Han, seize his arms.

298
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,451
Zuo Qiu, attack his lower body. Go!

299
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:02,650
That's Flowers Rain.

300
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,391
You used the blade as a hidden weapon,
the scabbard as the final strike.

301
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:08,291
Brilliant!

302
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:13,830
Dead!

303
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,650
Qiu Shui, he's dead!

304
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,191
Qiu Shui, we won.

305
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:22,791
We won!

306
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:35,170
Tang Rou, glad you're still alive.

307
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,170
Of course, I am.

308
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:48,151
I just used the Xiao family's techniques
to kill Fu Tian Yi.

309
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:51,771
Or what? With your bare hands?

310
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,970
Seems the Power Gang isn't so formidable.

311
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,051
Today, we killed the Iron Demon.

312
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:01,690
Tomorrow, we can kill Eight Great Lords
and Nineteen Demons.

313
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,891
Sure. Let's kill them all.

314
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:07,051
 Eight Great Lords and Nineteen Demons? 

315
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:13,010
 In the book, Power Gang attacked the Xiao family 
 when they knew we killed Fu Tian Yi. 

316
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,591
It's not good.

317
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:21,051
Yu Han, Chao Ran, go get some money
to silence that boatman.

318
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:25,151
Tang Rou, buy a small boat and get some oil.

319
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,691
- Why?
- Don't ask.

320
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:28,991
Hurry up! Stop asking questions!

321
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:31,591
- Come on! 
 - Let's go.

322
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:38,800
 He actually died. 

323
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:45,291
 Wh-What have I done? 

324
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,711
Are we destroying evidence?

325
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:59,231
Guys, let's not overthink it now.

326
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:02,991
We must leave Zihui before nightfall.

327
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:05,630
Let's go. Come on!

328
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:14,110
Sir, your food's served.

329
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,610
Alright. 
  

330
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,830
- Waiter. Thanks for your hard work.
- Enjoy your meal.

331
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,490
- Here.
- Okay.

332
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,811
We must be far enough now.
Finally, we can have a meal.

333
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,750
- Chopsticks.
- Let's eat, guys.

334
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,250
Here.

335
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:33,791
We're eliminating the evil.

336
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:37,291
- Why are we secretive all the time?
- Why, Qiu Shui?

337
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,800
Gather round.

338
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,750
Why else? I fear death.

339
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,930
Fear death? We never feared death.

340
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,530
Sure.

341
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:57,270
All these years, this is the first time
I've heard you admit fear of death.

342
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:02,371
Are you sick or something?

343
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,490
Come closer.

344
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,590
Which choice is better? Killing one demon or ten?

345
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,430
- Obviously ten. 
 - Exactly.

346
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:32,871
There's a saying, stay humble and grounded.

347
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:36,110
Good point.

348
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:42,431
Look, the four of us barely defeated one demon.

349
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:48,170
What if the rest of the demons come after us?

350
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,790
We'd be doomed for sure.

351
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,560
So,...

352
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,490
we must stay out of sight
and build our strength in secret.

353
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,590
Then gradually eliminate the evil
and protect the weak.

354
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,991
Once we're strong enough,
we'll challenge the Power Gang head-on.

355
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:13,350
Then we'll wipe them all out.

356
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,531
Dig in, guys. My treat.

357
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,571
That makes sense.

358
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,571
I'm starving.

359
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:30,251
I see, you want to accumulate strength to eventually fight the Power Gang.

360
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:36,510
You're our role model. Impressive.

361
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,291
N-Not exactly like that.

362
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,740
I see.

363
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:54,091
Qiu Shui, it's time
to do what we discussed earlier.

364
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,830
Yes, Qiu Shui. Perfect timing.

365
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,330
Correct.

366
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,191
This is a total cliché. Let's skip it.

367
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:18,771
Can't skip it! Three months ago,
you said it yourself.

368
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:25,891
After accomplishing a good deed,
we'd establish the Shenzhou Alliance.

369
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,751
Tang Rou.

370
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,771
Shenzhou Alliance? Not Four Brothers of Jinjiang?

371
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:43,328
Qiu Shui, your memory is bad.

372
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:49,070
You told us to unite all righteous men
and not to limit ourselves to Jinzhong.

373
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,590
So, we decided to build the alliance.

374
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,491
Today marks the birth of the Shenzhou Alliance.

375
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:00,270
 The original Xiao Qiu Shui was so rebellious. 

376
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,150
 Shenzhou Alliance? Quite an ambitious name. 

377
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,091
- Qiu Shui.
 -  Was this knife sterilized? 

378
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,310
Got a needle?

379
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,411
Needle?

380
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,850
Is this knife rusted?

381
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,410
Why are they so extreme?

382
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,191
By heaven above and moon as witness,

383
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:48,671
we'll live or die together
and establish the Shenzhou Alliance.

384
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,310
 Are they serious? 

385
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,871
What's wrong, Qiu Shui?

386
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:02,471
Drink!

387
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:04,931
Okay.

388
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:11,331
- Good!
- Good!

389
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:15,631
From now on, we'll live or die together.

390
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:18,531
- Live or die together. 
 - Yes, Qiu Shui.

391
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:27,631
We can live together,
but we don't have to die together.

392
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,070
Fair point.

393
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,030
If death comes,
I'll give my chance to live to you.

394
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,350
- Me too.
- Me too.

395
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,350
Don't say something like that.

396
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,010
Come on. Stand up and talk. Stop kneeling.

397
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,010
We're serious.

398
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,710
Is Xiao Qiu Shui really worthy of your trust?

399
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,311
When I first left Tang Sect, I was ambushed.

400
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:08,791
You risked your life to divert enemies.
That's how I escaped.

401
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:13,070
We were strangers back then.

402
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,391
When Chao Ran and I trained ourselves,
we recklessly hurt ourselves.

403
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:22,970
You just passed by and guarded us
in a temple for three days.

404
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,831
Since then, I've seen you as my brother.

405
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,590
Qiu Shui, the Shenzhou Alliance exists
for righteousness.

406
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,871
Where you stand, justice stands.

407
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,010
- Yes!
- Yes!

408
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,570
You guys make it sound ominous. What nonsense!

409
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:57,391
Since you all see me as your leader,
that means you trust me.

410
00:34:57,391 --> 00:35:03,411
Then it's my duty to take good care of you.

411
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,530
So, we all need to stay alive.

412
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,731
- Sure. Stay alive. 
 - Stay alive.

413
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:14,151
- Stay alive. 
 - Let me pour you liquor.

414
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,250
- Let me do it.
- Fill his cup.

415
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,371
 Xiao Qiu Shui is such a heroic young man. 

416
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:28,030
 I can't betray their expectations
while I'm Xiao Qiu Shui. 

417
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,851
 Anyway, once I finish the mission, I can return. 

418
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,871
 But before that, I'll protect them. 

419
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,990
 You spoiled a crucial plot to Tang Rou,
altering the story's course. 

420
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,291
 Boiling Blood Cocoon,
the punishment, is activated. 

421
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,951
 Count down. Three, two, one. 

422
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,991
 The warning punishment ended. 

423
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:42,030
 Next activation will deplete the user's Hit Point. 

424
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,710
 Additionally, the difficulty increased
from this moment. 

425
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:55,330
Difficulty increased?
How much harder can you make it?

426
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,451
Just kill me, okay?

427
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:58,130
 The Boiling Blood Cocoon activated
after I spoiled the plot to Tang Rou. 

428
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,110
 Another activation would be fatal. 

429
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:09,010
 Weirdly, the Power Gang attacked
the Xiaos over Fu Tian Yi's death. 

430
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,871
 But I've disposed of his body.
Why did I dream of their massacre? 

431
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:16,811
 Could this not be over yet? 

432
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:20,171
 Regardless, I must prepare thoroughly. 

433
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:22,971
 The original tragedy must not repeat. 

434
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:27,970
 If you're the Huanhua Sect's leader,
the story will unfold as you want. 

435
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,991
 The Demon Codex won't interfere with creation. 

436
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:35,831
 So, after becoming the leader
and removing the Boiling Blood Cocoon, 

437
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,630
 I could control the story's direction? 

438
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,471
 Wouldn't that satisfy everyone? 

439
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:54,531
How exactly do I become a sect leader
to alter the story?

440
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,751
 I set Xue Yu as an adopted daughter in the book. 

441
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:09,971
 So the Demon Codex retained some of my settings. 

442
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,150
 What about the cheat modes I previously set up? 

443
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,351
 

444
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,930
If I remember correctly,

445
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:28,051
there's an indestructible sword
at this river's bottom.

446
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:32,930
In this cave lives a white wolf
that knows martial arts.

447
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:37,771
These ruins hide a Gatling gun.

448
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:44,351
Most importantly,
I wrote a Lucky Bag, NPC Feng Lang.

449
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:48,311
He's a powerful martial artist
who obeys my every command.

450
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:52,130
If even one of these cheats remains,

451
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:58,931
changing the story's direction
would be much easier.

452
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:04,311
Tang Rou! Yu Han! Zuo Qiu!

453
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:06,590
Get up!

454
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:10,411
Qiu Shui, isn't this too early?

455
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:12,611
- I'm sleepy. 
 - Too early?

456
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:16,230
The sun is very high now.
You already woke up late.

457
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:21,831
Qiu Shui, it's raining. Are we still going out?

458
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:25,831
This is sunshower. It'll stop soon.

459
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,258
Come on! Go!

460
00:40:30,258 --> 00:40:33,074
 ♫ Ha-ah ♫ 

461
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:37,554
 ♫ Let's roam the world and be carefree ♫ 

462
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:39,951
 ♫ Cross mountains and seas to meet again ♫ 

463
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,360
Qiu Shui, check this out!

464
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,930
Catch!

465
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,980
Is this the indestructible sword?

466
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,690
This is just a broken pair of scissors!

467
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,510
And the Gatling thing is just a chamber pot.

468
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,991
The most ridiculous thing is this wolf
that can teach martial arts.

469
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,210
Get out of here!

470
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:14,150
Why is the white wolf yellow?

471
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,230
 The system said last night
it would increase difficulty. 

472
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,110
 It means it would remove all my items? 

473
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,770
 So, it will not give me Feng Lang,
the powerful NPC. 

474
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:34,190
Qiu Shui, you woke us up early,
but you still haven't told us why.

475
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,431
Honestly, I want to become Huanhua Sect's leader.

476
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,211
Sect leader?

477
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:55,710
Qiu Shui, you're joking, right?

478
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:06,610
