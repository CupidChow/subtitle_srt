21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,970
 

22
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,562
Tang Rou, I'll go and save the person.

23
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:44,902
I suppose I won't need
the entire jar of Drunken Styx.

24
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:47,642
Your sister wants the wine as a gift,

25
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:51,261
but does she really need a full jar?

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Exactly, Fang.

27
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,962
You better not play tricks.

28
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,418
Qiu Shui.

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,221
Chao Ran, Yu Han, let's go upstairs
and detoxify Mr. Feng.

30
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:46,710
Fang, help Qiu Shui

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,282
remove that Silver Butterfly Dart.

32
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,970
- Let's go.
- Move.

33
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:09,178
Let's begin.

34
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:13,498
Let's talk before removing the dart.

35
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,702
There's nothing to discuss.

36
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:21,402
Fine. Let's skip the chat then.

37
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,661
I'm warning you.

38
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,742
My brother Rou is naive
and doesn't read people well.

39
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:37,381
He admires you. You must've fooled him thoroughly.

40
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,841
I don't care what happened between you two,

41
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:43,562
but stay away from my brother from now on.

42
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,526
Agreed.

43
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,906
Smart choice.

44
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,182
I've promised,

45
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:06,062
but whether Rou stays with me
isn't my decision alone.

46
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,121
You'll have to ask him.

47
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:11,741
Don't worry about that. Just keep your promise.

00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:33,181
You seem to have quite a set of tools here.

50
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:37,522
You must be experienced in dart removal, right?

51
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:41,042
They usually die with one dart.
No need for removal.

52
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:49,421
How about this three-inch one?

53
00:04:56,162 --> 00:05:00,034
What? What do you mean?

54
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,722
Scared?

55
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:05,941
Me? Get on with it.

56
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,866
Wait.

57
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,430
There's another one.

58
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,181
In one month,

59
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:34,062
if you stay away from Rou,

60
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:36,421
I'll remove the second dart.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,842
You snake.

62
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,862
Blame fate's unpredictability.

63
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,741
Qiu Shui.

64
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,241
- Qiu Shui. 
 - Done.

65
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,830
Mr. Feng is detoxified.

66
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,334
Okay.

67
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,121
Fang.

68
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,302
Give me the rest.

69
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,401
Fang, well...

70
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:14,881
The wine's all used up.

71
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,274
Messing with me?

72
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,142
Blame fate's unpredictability.

73
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:32,001
Why glare? You broke our trust first.

74
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,400
- Qiu Shui!
- Qiu Shui! You...

75
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,054
What exactly do you want?

76
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:52,462
My dart's wings connect to the shaft.
How much pain can you endure?

77
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,981
You know brewing, don't you?

78
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,341
Replicate a jar of Drunken Styx for me.

79
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,181
I'll inspect it tonight.

80
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,221
If it's not convincing,

81
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,441
you'll see what happens.

82
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,030
You okay, Qiu Shui?

83
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:23,482
Does it hurt?

84
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,622
Of course it hurts.

85
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:28,382
Tang Rou,

86
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:33,221
can't you remove the remaining dart from me?

87
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:35,418
It really hurts.

88
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:36,981
I can't do it, Qiu Shui.

89
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:40,218
Every member of our sect
has their unique hidden weapon style.

90
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:42,462
Besides,

91
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,142
my sister is so skilled.

92
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:48,981
If I interfere recklessly,
your arm might get crippled.

93
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,922
What then?

94
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:54,000
What else can we do?

95
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,250
Brew the wine.

96
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,254
 

97
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:18,742
Sir.

98
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,142
My mistake for failing to reinforce you in time.

99
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:39,581
I never imagined our gang
would harbor such a traitor.

100
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:44,781
Has your poison been fully cured?

101
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,181
I'd never atone even through my death.

102
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,982
You've been closest to Purple Phoenix.

103
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:53,921
Didn't notice any suspicious moves from her?

104
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,461
I swear to heaven I bear no disloyalty to you.

105
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,722
If you harbor any doubt, please kill me now.

106
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:08,441
Since I haven't killed you yet, save your breath.

107
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:15,758
  
  

108
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:21,902
 
Where's Madam Wu?

109
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,541
 
Hand over the Hero Token.

110
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,142
I might let you keep your corpse intact.

111
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:28,661
Purple Phoenix, you gangsters go too far!

112
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:32,021
We will fight you to the death today!

113
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,930
Liu Sui Feng?

114
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,270
 

115
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,561
- Mr. Liu.
- Mr. Liu.

116
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,081
You can't even handle a mere escort agency?

117
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:40,500
Please forgive me.

118
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:51,298
Purple Phoenix, remember this.
I never give a second chance.

119
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:54,454
- Understood. 
 - Move! Quickly.

120
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,842
- Father!
- Father!

121
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,706
Liu Sui Feng.

122
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,094
Father!

123
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,300
- Father!
- Father!

124
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,158
Release me!

125
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:15,150
Give him half an hour. Start with his eldest son.

126
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,962
- Father!
- Father!

127
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:22,342
I didn't take the Hero Token. I swear I didn't!

128
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:44,002
Mr. Liu.

129
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:49,521
Zheng Kai Yang confessed,
but the person's not here.

130
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:51,854
They found Madam Wu during their escort mission.

131
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:54,130
He intended to seize the Hero Token.

132
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,821
But Zhang Lin Yi, the Yin-Yang Swordsman
by her side, grew suspicious.

133
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:01,401
They lost track of her upon entering Jinzhong.

134
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:06,281
But they heard Madam Wu
boarded the Huanhua Sect's carriage.

135
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,702
Huanhua Sect?

136
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:21,621
We found a Marching Pill allegedly
to be sent to the North Wasteland.

137
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,270
Purple Phoenix.

138
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:57,621
Who paid you off to take my life?

139
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,541
How did you know?

140
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,342
How did you know my poisoning attempt?

141
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,622
Traveling all this way to kill me.

142
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,342
You even prepared my favorite Qishan Cuimei Tea.

143
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:57,321
You think the poison was only in the tea?

144
00:13:57,321 --> 00:14:00,382
Your immunity to poisons is legendary.

145
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,661
But you have a habit
of inspecting all Marching Pills.

146
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:10,781
So this particular pill is coated with the deadliest toxin.

147
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,122
Cantharides Poison.

148
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:28,422
Do you think I'm the only one in the gang who wants you dead?

149
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,550
Who?

150
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:12,781
Feng Lang.

151
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:17,102
He calls me "Lucky Bag".

152
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:19,934
Get up.

153
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:29,821
While evading pursuers,
I killed a man and took his identity.

154
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,842
Surprisingly, Xiao Qiu Shui trusts me so much.

155
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:41,421
Song Ming Zhu, have you heard of the title Lucky Bag?

156
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:46,301
Never. Is it some official position?

157
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:52,742
Xiao Qiu Shui keeps using this term for me.

158
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:55,061
I wonder what he means.

159
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,681
No matter.

160
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:03,342
This identity lets me enter
the Xiao mansion before the Sword King.

161
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:07,281
His elaborate scheme with Purple Phoenix
to kill me went to waste.

162
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:12,941
You mean Purple Phoenix acted
under the Sword King's orders?

163
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:20,301
Whoever gets the Hero Token
for our leader claims supreme merit.

164
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,721
He and I have never seen eye to eye.

165
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:26,642
If he takes it, he'll surely suppress me.

166
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:34,561
But he's unwittingly given me an advantage.

167
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,622
Your fortune shines in meeting that Xiao boy.

168
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,281
They've formed some "Shenzhou Alliance".

169
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:44,481
Spouting righteousness. How funny.

170
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:50,941
In this martial world, righteousness vanished long ago.

171
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:56,202
Just hypocrites chasing
profit while feigning virtue.

172
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:59,202
They'll all kneel before our gang eventually.

173
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,401
The Huanhua Sect is impregnable.

174
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:07,401
Traveling with Xiao Qiu Shui
under this guise simplifies entry.

175
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,741
The Hero Token will soon be yours.

176
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:14,202
Then we'll bring the Xiao family to heel, and the Sword King won't be a threat.

177
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,841
The Xiaos aren't worthy.

178
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:24,421
We have unsettled business.

179
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:32,041
By the way, don't let the Sword King know where I am.

180
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,542
Xiao Qiu Shui does resemble our leader somewhat.

181
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:40,581
In the gang, only the eight kings have seen our leader's and my faces.

182
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:44,641
Even they wouldn't mistake him for our leader.

183
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:47,321
No reports needed. Await my instructions.

184
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,801
Understood. I'll await your word near Huanhua.

185
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:58,461
Qiu Shui, check this out. I think it's okay.

186
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,801
Thank you for saving me.

187
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:16,461
Mr. Feng, you seem recovered.

188
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:19,682
Much better now. My deepest thanks.

189
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,221
No need for formalities, Mr. Feng.

190
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:27,162
Qiu Shui was seeking someone
named Feng Lang. Fancy finding you.

191
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:30,221
A nobody unworthy of mention.

192
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:33,482
My earlier rudeness...

193
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:38,401
Your grace in overlooking it
and saving me repeatedly. I'm indebted.

194
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:42,842
Command me without hesitation henceforth.

195
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:44,762
These are small matters.

196
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,921
What matters is if you consider me a friend.

197
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:56,261
Am I your closest friend now?

198
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,421
You are my dearest friend.

199
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,898
Good.

200
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:09,381
Good.

201
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:15,482
Coincidentally, the Ironclad Constable asked me
to send a letter to him in Huanhua.

202
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,802
Now, we can go together.

203
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:23,394
Your poison's newly cured.
Residual effects may linger.

204
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:26,182
Here's what we'll do. Go to Huanhua with me.

205
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,994
I'll have
someone cleanse the remaining poison.

206
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,686
What do you think?

207
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,142
Okay.

208
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,782
Where's the wine?

209
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,461
No one leaves until I get the wine.

210
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,378
Fang.

211
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,998
Wait here.

212
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,194
Will this work, Qiu Shui?

213
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:13,642
Feng, don't be angry.

214
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:18,906
You're injured and have caught a chill.
This will turn serious if untreated.

215
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:22,202
Take this medicine now.

216
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:32,121
Are you Tang Fang from the Tang Sect?

217
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,841
Who are you?

218
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:50,710
I am Feng Lang, the Rain Sword.

219
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,922
You're that sickly guy who drained Drunken Styx!

220
00:20:56,862 --> 00:21:00,922
Let me make this clear.
You're involved in this too.

221
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:07,222
Fang.

222
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,390
The wine.

223
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:28,321
Fang!

224
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:31,461
You're fooling me! This is fake!

225
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:40,862
Tang Fang, I've tolerated you
long enough for Tang Rou's sake...

226
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:44,042
Listen well, if not for you people,

227
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,921
I'd have busted through the Clueless Gate.

228
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:51,461
Keep working. No sleep until it's done.

229
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,582
Miss,

230
00:21:55,582 --> 00:22:00,041
are you seeking Yu Zhi Liao
behind the gate for some information?

231
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,161
Perhaps I can assist.

232
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:05,722
You?

233
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,902
I have some acquaintance with him.

234
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,601
Give him this jade pendant.

235
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,062
It'll buy you one answer.

236
00:22:31,162 --> 00:22:34,661
You think one pendant can make him talk?

237
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,561
You're a fraud, too?

238
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:39,181
I'm heading to Huanhua with Mr. Xiao anyway.

239
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:41,741
If the pendant fails, come to me.

240
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,242
Better than wasting time here.

241
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:48,870
Fine. The Huanhua Sect's near our sect.

242
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,040
You can't escape me.

243
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,514
Hold it.

244
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:12,962
My friend helped you. Show some gratitude.

245
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:17,290
Fang, your Silver Butterfly Dart
is digging deeper.

246
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,062
Remove it now, or Qiu Shui may get hurt.

247
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:47,382
Tang Rou, you should avoid
such disreputable companions.

248
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:50,722
I'll take you home after finishing my business.

249
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,274
Fang.

250
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:55,190
Qiu Shui, you okay?

251
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,521
- You still touch me? 
 - I won't.

252
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,221
Bear with it. The pain will pass soon.

253
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:02,442
Relax. It's nothing serious.

254
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:09,841
Yu Zhi Liao can gather
martial circle intelligence.

255
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:12,782
That does sound impressive.

256
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:18,242
Mr. Feng, how did you build rapport with him?

257
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:21,214
Fate, much like how we became acquainted.

258
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:25,826
We strangers became
friends within days, didn't we?

259
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,714
Yeah.

260
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,782
I see.

261
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:33,661
Now then, I have a dilemma.

262
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:37,902
My elder brother's about
to become the Young Leader of Huanhua.

263
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:42,482
Mr. Feng, how do I
compete with him for this position?

264
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,646
You want to be the sect leader?

265
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:46,302
Exactly.

266
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:51,062
You're far behind your brother,
but there's a rule in Jinzhong.

267
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:55,142
A young hero with endorsements
from martial circle seniors

268
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:57,501
may challenge the successor.

269
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,042
Martial circle seniors...

270
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:08,942
Good.

271
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:17,280
 Clueless Gate 

272
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:33,542
I'm Tang Fang of the Tang Sect,
here to see Mr. Yu.

273
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,921
I bear an object from Mr. Yu's friend.

274
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:56,382
Could you please answer a question?

275
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:07,021
Truly my young master's craftsmanship.

276
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:10,302
Since you're a friend of the young master,

277
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,701
then go ahead and ask.

278
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:16,002
Where exactly is the Book of Oblivion?

279
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:19,062
The Xiao family of Huanhua.

280
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:22,554
The Xiao family.

281
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:28,622
 The rumors are true. 

282
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,802
 Madam Wu really hides with the Xiaos. 

283
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,981
Madam Wu.

284
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,421
Please, be seated.

285
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:06,522
Madam, has your health improved?

286
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:08,261
 Madam Wu 

287
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:12,081
Your shelter warms me.

288
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,782
I'm deeply grateful.

289
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:18,526
Just old ailments. Not worth mentioning.

290
00:27:18,526 --> 00:27:23,382
Madam, I've received
General Wu Jie's secret letter.

291
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:28,738
 
His men will go to Tongfu Inn in the town in seven days.

292
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:35,242
My wife and I will discreetly
escort you

293
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:37,841
to meet the general.

294
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:39,561
Thank you two.

295
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:44,502
Ever since Yan Kuang Tu entrusted me with the Hero Token,

296
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:49,342
the martial world's grown bloodier.

297
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:55,281
Even with Mr. Zhang's protection,
I've encountered dangers.

298
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:59,981
Thank you for hiding me here.

299
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:04,361
Otherwise, the Hero Token
might've fallen into evil hands.

300
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:07,002
Madam, you flatter us.

301
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:10,741
This is our duty as martial artists.

302
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,741
No secret stays buried in the martial world.

303
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:18,981
I wonder if we can keep my whereabouts a secret
for the remaining seven days.

304
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:23,941
Madam, the storms of the martial world
are borne by the martial artists.

305
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,862
There's no need for your concern.

306
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:30,302
We've arranged everything.

307
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:38,322
 
You were grounded, but you ran outside to fool around.

308
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,302
Seems my punishment was lenient.

309
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,862
You're forcing me to beat you. Right?

310
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:46,722
- Come on, stick out your bottom. Stick it out!
- Father!

311
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:51,102
This time, I wasn't playing around.
I had an important matter to do.

312
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:53,981
You... What important matter?

313
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,342
Upholding justice.

314
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:59,622
You uphold justice?

315
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:02,342
Lies! Fine lies you spin. I'll teach you to lie!

316
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:03,582
Father, really... Don't hit me!

317
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:06,342
See? Good deeds go unnamed.
Those who seek credit don't do good.

318
00:29:06,342 --> 00:29:09,181
Oh? You've truly grown accomplished now?

319
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,221
- Fine! I'll help you!
- Father!

320
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:14,482
Don't hit him.

321
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:16,941
Don't hit him.

322
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:18,782
Enough! What are you doing?

323
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:20,302
What am I doing? I'm teaching him.

324
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,801
He just returned, and you're hitting him again?

325
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:26,622
Your sister gathered rehmannia in the back hills.

326
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:31,202
I've already told the kitchen to make some chicken soup for your friends.

327
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:35,202
Stop gawking! Go help in the kitchen!

328
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:36,474
Go.

329
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,342
Where are you going?

330
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,561
I'm teaching him!

331
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,882
You. You keep ruining him like this.

332
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,841
Making him bolder each time.

333
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:47,102
You haven't understood the situation at all.

334
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:49,202
Qiu Shui truly wasn't fooling around this time.

335
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:52,841
I've asked Yu Han. They went
to Zihui for dragon boat watching.

336
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:56,401
Honoring Qu Yuan at the Dragon Boat Festival is a folk custom.

337
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:59,761
Recall your youth? You attended every year.

338
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:02,982
Once, you fell into the river. I was the one who fished you out.

339
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:05,342
Stop mentioning my youthful river fall!

340
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:07,142
I "fell into the river" all the time!

341
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:09,202
- Do I have any dignity left? 
 - Did you fall in or not?

342
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:11,582
Do you realize his sword is missing?

343
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:16,542
How can a swordsman lose his sword?
Shouldn't I discipline him?

344
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:19,261
I...

345
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,642
Who said you could stand?

346
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:23,142
- Kneel!
- I let him stand.

347
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:24,542
You! Kneel!

348
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,421
Step aside. You...

349
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:29,118
- Hit me instead. 
- You let him stand?

350
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,106
- Move!
- Hit me.

351
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:33,922
- Kneel!
- Hit me instead.

352
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:35,346
You...

353
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,941
Mother.

354
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:41,314
Don't think I won't!

355
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,066
Mr. Xiao.

356
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:48,622
You're here!

357
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,722
Your vigor in disciplining your son...

358
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:55,361
We haven't witnessed such in ages.

359
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,582
Youthful enthusiasm isn't a grave fault.

360
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:58,938
Mr. Xiao.

361
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,221
Enough, Mr. Xiao.

362
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,582
Let's go drink.

363
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:04,522
 
That's important.

364
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:06,102
Calm your anger. 
  

365
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:10,022
The Young Leader inauguration ceremony is being held outside.

366
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:12,762
We'll have much to manage shortly.

367
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,882
Qiu Shui! Come here quickly!

368
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,021
Hurry and say thanks to them.

369
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:19,382
Then we'll take our leave.

370
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:25,782
Why linger? Get moving!

371
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:29,582
Mother, I want to be the Young Leader.

372
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,488
 

373
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:37,442
 

374
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:40,801
Qiu Shui, what nonsense is this?

375
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,701
Would you compete with your brother?

376
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:48,774
Stop this foolishness! Leave.

377
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,542
Qiu Shui.

378
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:54,501
Are you listening? Making me angry again.

379
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:03,922
I wish to compete for the position
of Huanhua's Sect Leader.

380
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,382
With all of you present,
may I request your recommendations?

381
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,274
Qiu Shui.

382
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:24,461
I'm serious. Could you grant me this chance?

383
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:29,501
The youth indeed have drive.

384
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:32,782
But the Young Leader position
was already decided, do you know?

385
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:37,302
I think this matter needs careful deliberation.

386
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:40,118
Qiu Shui, no need for haste.

387
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:44,062
No, I truly am urgent.

388
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,461
Misters,

389
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:49,302
only if just one of you
provides a recommendation letter.

390
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:53,221
Please consider me. Give me this opportunity.

391
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,102
Qiu Shui, it's not that we don't want to.

392
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:59,782
But Yi Ren truly deserves this position.

393
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:03,458
I believe you'll be ready
to take on the challenge in five years.

394
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,278
Five years?

395
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:08,822
Seriously?

396
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,561
Qiu Shui, be serious.

397
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:15,301
Leave now. We have important matters to discuss.

398
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,726
Reflect on the mistakes you made today.

399
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:18,782
- Go.
- Father.

400
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:20,102
- Qiu Shui.
- Go now!

401
00:33:20,102 --> 00:33:23,158
- Let's go. Get up quickly.
- Mother.

402
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:25,538
We're leaving now.

403
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:26,701
We'll talk later.

404
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:29,110
- Mr...
- Let's go.

405
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:33,701
My unruly son has made a fool
of himself in front of everyone.

406
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:35,142
Now, take your seats.

407
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:36,634
- Come.
- After you.

408
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,586
Please, after you.

409
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:42,562
What happened? Is your shoulder injured?

410
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,582
Mother, it's fine. I'm okay.

411
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:48,302
- Let me check.
- Mother, really, it's nothing.

412
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:56,274
Mother, I promise I won't make you angry again.

413
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:58,822
And I won't pick fights recklessly.

414
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:02,302
You think I'm angry about that?

415
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:04,981
I'm angry that you tried to be a hero.

416
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:07,922
In the martial world, fights are commonplace.

417
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,762
But don't be a hero. It will get you killed.

418
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:15,342
My son should learn to admit
the pain when he's hurt

419
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:18,001
and learn to run away when he can't win. Don't play the hero.

420
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,981
Understand?

421
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:22,561
Yes, I understand.

422
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,501
Don't worry. I'm good at running away.

423
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:33,302
I never imagined you would have such thoughts.

424
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:35,061
Though it's quite impractical,

425
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,842
I really appreciate it.

426
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:40,782
I'm sorry! I forgot.

427
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:43,262
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

428
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:45,622
You must be hungry. I'll make you noodles.

429
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:47,862
- Okay.
- Wait here.

430
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,601
 Mother, 

431
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,621
 I will change our family's fate. 

432
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:17,762
When you were sick as a child,
you loved this. Eat up.

433
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:30,702
 Ming Ming, have some noodles. 

434
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,498
What's wrong?

435
00:36:16,662 --> 00:36:18,902
What's the matter, Qiu Shui?

436
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:21,721
Are my noodles too delicious?

437
00:36:27,782 --> 00:36:31,662
I haven't tasted this flavor for so long.

438
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:35,742
Silly, didn't I make this for you last month?

439
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:39,641
If you like it, I'll make it for you every day.

440
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,238
Thank you, Mother.

441
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,322
I've already instructed the kitchen.

442
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:52,066
Tonight, we'll treat your friends to a big meal.

443
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:53,721
Yeah.

444
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:55,421
Alright now.

445
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:59,342
You want to be the Young Leader. Eat.

446
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:01,914
I'm eating.

447
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:16,322
This is a Marching Pill.

448
00:37:19,302 --> 00:37:21,501
After consuming it,

449
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:25,782
one feels neither hunger nor thirst,
but becomes violent and manic.

450
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:30,642
Over a decade ago, the Herbal Valley created this,

451
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:34,362
trying to supply it to the Wastelanders
to destabilize Daxi.

452
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:40,742
Our righteous alliance destroyed them
and eradicated all the pills.

453
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:44,342
But after all these years,

454
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:47,241
someone recreated this.

455
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,282
It must be Herbal Valley remnants.

456
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:54,382
If the North Wasteland gets
this again, Daxi will face chaos.

457
00:37:55,166 --> 00:38:00,101
We should send people to investigate Guangling.

458
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:03,222
Your family maintains
an estate in Guangling, I recall.

459
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:06,482
You should make arrangements immediately.

460
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:10,101
I'll do it tomorrow.

461
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,142
- Qiu Shui, you've lost weight. Eat a lot.
- Mrs. Xiao.

462
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:14,422
Do you know how long I've waited for this day?

463
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,662
- Here.
- Thanks, then eat a lot.

464
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:21,241
This stir-fried pork with bamboo shoots
is my absolute favorite.

465
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:22,981
I think that's not right.

466
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,922
Every dish Mrs. Xiao made is my favorite.

467
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:28,830
Oh, you sweet talker.

468
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,822
Eat a lot.

469
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:32,702
Qiu Shui has been strictly raised by his father.

470
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:35,742
I worried he'd become timid and overcautious.

471
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:39,962
Luckily, he's got friends like you to run wild with him.

472
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:41,862
A toast to you all.

473
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,101
- Mrs. Xiao.
- Mrs. Xiao.

474
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:46,841
- Is it praise or criticism?
- That's just our family style.

475
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,921
Cheers.

476
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:51,862
- Cheers.
- Let's get drunk and wild.

477
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,782
Thanks.

478
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:04,541
Mrs. Xiao, try some.

479
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,558
I'll do it myself.

480
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:09,822
Mr. Feng Lang,

481
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:13,822
the Ironclad Constable mentioned
you assisted him greatly this time.

482
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:16,501
I see you are indeed a man of remarkable presence.

483
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,318
Let me propose a toast to you.

484
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:20,762
You flatter me, Mrs. Xiao.

485
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,681
Your lightness skill is allegedly exceptional.

486
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,601
You once raced a fine steed
for a full day and night without defeat,

487
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,030
and therefore, your fame spread.

488
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,426
You remember incorrectly.

489
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:37,342
In the watery south,
I actually raced against a small boat.

490
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:47,981
Qiu Shui, you see?
I'm getting old. My memory fails.

491
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:51,421
What poison afflicts you?

492
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:57,621
Mother, it's the Cantharides Poison.

493
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:00,501
It is truly rare.

494
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:05,382
Why would the Power Gang
resort to such brutality against you?

495
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:08,262
As I previously told Mr. Xiao,

496
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:11,002
I saw something I shouldn't have.

497
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:22,421
Have you heard about
the Everjoy Escort Agency massacre?

498
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:30,862
It happened days ago.
The news has spread throughout Jinzhong.

499
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,282
I was present during the massacre.

500
00:40:33,282 --> 00:40:36,001
I intended to hire them for a delivery

501
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:39,141
but stumbled upon
the Power Gang committing the atrocity.

502
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:42,541
Though I narrowly escaped, I was poisoned.

503
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:46,430
I heard Liu Sui Feng
of the Power Gang was there that day.

504
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,581
Surviving that demon's clutches
was no small feat, Mr. Feng.

505
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:01,742
Feng Lang, what were you entrusting
to the escort agency?

506
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:05,802
A letter from my master
meant for the Ironclad Constable.

507
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:09,461
I got lucky.

508
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:15,021
But I heard the Power Gang committed
this massacre to find someone important.

509
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:18,561
Has anyone heard any rumors during your travels?

510
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,182
We've heard nothing of the sort.

511
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:23,822
The escort agency was in Jinzhong.

512
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:26,902
Could this important person be there?

513
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,902
Mrs. Xiao, your sect's connections
run deep in Jinzhong.

514
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:33,141
Have you heard of any notable figures coming here?

515
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:37,842
Not that I know of.

516
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:47,581
These trivialities spoil the mood.
Let's speak no more of them today.

517
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,061
Tonight, we drink until we're thoroughly drunk.

518
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,822
- Yes, let's get drunk.
- Let's get drunk.

519
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:54,182
- Let's get drunk.
- Come on.

520
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:55,941
- Come on. Let's drink!
- Cheers.

521
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:58,181
Cheers, Qiu Shui.

522
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:01,850
- Thank you, Mrs. Xiao.
- Thank you.

523
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:10,980
