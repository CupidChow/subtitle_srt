00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:07,709
 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫ 

2
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:11,418
 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫ 

3
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:15,354
 ♫ At the end of the other shore,
the long night finally pales ♫ 

4
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:18,849
 ♫ Only then is this oath not sworn in vain ♫ 

5
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:23,002
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫ 

6
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,970
 ♫ My resolve has never wavered ♫ 

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,554
 ♫ Even after millennia,
I'll cleave mountains asunder ♫ 

8
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:38,426
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,
the dawn to break, and for you to come ♫ 

9
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,786
 ♫ Storms and turmoil rage ♫ 

10
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:49,594
 ♫ Turbulent waves surge ♫ 

11
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,357
 ♫ Trampling the dawn's light ♫ 

12
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:54,328
 ♫ Let us venture together ♫ 

13
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:58,266
 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫ 

14
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,949
 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫ 

15
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,466
 ♫ At the end of the other shore,
the long night finally pales ♫ 

16
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,689
 ♫ Only then is this oath not sworn in vain ♫ 

17
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,442
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫ 

18
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:16,186
 ♫ My resolve has never wavered ♫ 

19

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,298
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,
the dawn to break, and for you to come ♫ 

21
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,594
 

22
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,442
 

23
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:40,346
Lady Hong Xiu, someone is after us.

24
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:44,723
May we take shelter here for now?

25
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:49,563
Mr. Qiu Shui, everyone knows the Xiaos
are besieged. How could we refuse?

26
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:52,730
We hear your family is pursuing
a noble cause for the nation.

27
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,682
As a humble courtesan, I'm honored
to offer my modest assistance.

28
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,282
Thank you.

29
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:08,243
You're welcome. You're our regular.
Helping you is only natural.

30
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:12,322
I... I am not...

31
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,562
Sir, please don't misunderstand.

32
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:20,250
Mr. Qiu Shui only visited
to protect the girls here.

33
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,763
We're bullied often.

34
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:23,802
He's the only one who treated us as humans

35
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,923
and defended our dignity.

36
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:28,403
We're all deeply grateful for his grace.

37
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,922
I just did what's right.

38
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:35,763
By the way, this place is too conspicuous.

39
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:38,123
Let me take you somewhere safer.

40
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:42,298
How do we leave town now?

41
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:44,363
Leave the town?

42
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:47,443
The exits are all blocked by those people.

43
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:50,762
We need a plan to leave the town.

44
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:56,163
Right. Some clients outside town
requested entertainment girls today.

45
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,202
Maybe...

46
00:02:58,202 --> 00:02:59,962
Maybe what?

47
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:02,883
Maybe you can disguise yourselves as our girls.

48
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:09,002
- No.
- A-Absolutely not.

49
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:12,163
Well... then try the nightsoil cart.

50
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:14,002
The stench of the nightsoil cart

51
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:15,763
would deter inspections

52
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,962
and help you slip through.

53
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,346
I'll make inquiries.

54
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,522
Well...

55
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,923
Aren't you full of clever schemes?

56
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:28,003
Must we really hide in a nightsoil cart?

57
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,083
There is no time. The rendezvous point changed.

58
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,682
But Madam Wu and the others don't know.

59
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:41,322
I must leave the town and reach her soon.

60
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:48,002
Young Master,

61
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:52,282
I searched all roads from Xiao Residence
but found no trace of Madam Wu.

62
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,842
I don't know where she is now.

63
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:56,826
Cease searching.

64
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:01,163
Xiao Qiu Shui has clever ruses.

65
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:04,242
He has concealed her whereabouts even from me.

66
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,402
You won't find her.

67
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:08,083
My apologies for failing.

68
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,402
What's our next move?

69
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:12,402
The streets swarm with Sword King's men.

70
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:15,803
Now I understand his restraint at Huanhua Sect.

71
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:21,043
He was preserving strength for this ambush.

72
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,842
But Xiao Qiu Shui hasn't met up with Madam Wu yet.

73
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:27,162
What makes Sword King so confident?

74
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,402
He set up blockades instead of attacking.

75
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:33,123
It confirms Xiao Qiu Shui's guess.

76
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:36,162
There's another mole near Madam Wu.

77
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:40,803
All our moles took Better-Dead Pills
and are documented.

78
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,522
Only Qiu remains in the Xiao family.

79
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,483
It's the nameless one.

80
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:49,306
The Nameless Demon?

81
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:53,123
For years, among Sword King's people,

82
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:55,962
only Nameless Demon's identity has stayed hidden.

83
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,906
Follow me secretly.

84
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:03,258
Xiao Qiu Shui will lead us to Madam Wu.

85
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:07,482
When that happens,
the Nameless Demon will show up.

86
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:11,883
Then we'll unmask this mysterious Nameless Demon.

87
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:11,722
What happened? Why's fetching food taken so long?

88
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:17,683
Caution is needed with searchers about.

89
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:29,003
 

90
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:31,923
Why list these sects?

91
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:40,683
Mother taught me
they're our family's staunch allies.

92
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:44,683
After ensuring Madam Wu's safety,
I'll seek their aid.

93
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:49,082
Chivalry rules the martial world.

94
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:55,243
I believe they'll help us.

95
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:01,466
Don't be too optimistic.

96
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:05,683
Throughout history, men pursue two things:

97
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:07,763
power and profit.

98
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:10,323
Shared interests make allies.

99
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,763
Power Gang offers better incentives now.

100
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:17,883
So Huanhua Sect's allies may become theirs.

101
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:22,842
You think they'll abandon us?

102
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,243
The world hustles for gain.

103
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:28,730
Martial alliances form for profit.

104
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,603
It always has been so.

105
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,106
You're wrong.

106
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:45,763
I grew up reading tales of heroic chivalry.

107
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:49,642
But reality differs.

108
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:53,602
Now living it, I see

109
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,243
this is exactly the world I dreamed of,

110
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:01,563
where heroes rise above fear

111
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,642
to right injustices

112
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,563
and protect the weak.

113
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,410
But such people are few.

114
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,106
I don't know.

115
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:44,523
But my father once told me
a spark can ignite a wildfire.

116
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:47,362
Those who care for the greater good

117
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:51,242
will always find their way to each other.

118
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,323
That's why in the martial world,

119
00:08:55,923 --> 00:09:00,123
righteous gatherings define its essence.

120
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:03,483
Let's make a wager to see

121
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:10,162
whether the world is held together
by profit or by righteousness.

122
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:16,762
Deal.

123
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:20,762
I'll take that bet. What's your stake?

124
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:24,122
The winner claims
one cherished possession from the loser.

125
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,978
Cherished possession?

126
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,634
Just a suggestion.

127
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:33,722
It's to shock some sense into you
with a dramatic stake.

128
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:36,243
You can switch if you prefer.

129
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:41,642
No need. I accept your wager.

130
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,483
But you'll lose.

131
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:46,042
We'll see.

132
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,434
Mr. Qiu Shui.

133
00:09:55,203 --> 00:10:00,243
Zhang Si says our nightsoil cart
broke down. We can't leave town tonight.

134
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:03,642
But we must leave tonight.

135
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:10,714
Here's the plan, find me
a black cloak and secure a carriage.

136
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,506
How will you leave town?

137
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,203
By blending in.

138
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:16,378
Since the Power Gang hunts us,

139
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:20,538
we'll disguise ourselves as their members.

140
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,426
What?

141
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:26,330
Relax.

142
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,162
What's your plan exactly?

143
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:43,803
Tang Rou and the others compiled intel for me

144
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,722
on notable martial world figures.

145
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:49,403
The Power Gang has vast numbers

146
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:53,146
and spies everywhere but no unity.

147
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:58,842
So I deduce that Li Chen Zhou,
Zhao Shi Rong, and Liu Sui Feng

148
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:03,546
have few subordinates
who've seen their true faces.

149
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:07,482
Well? You'll play Li Chen Zhou?

150
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:08,722
Wrong.

151
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:12,523
That lofty leader wouldn't bother coming here.

152
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:15,723
I'll play Liu Sui Feng.

153
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,890
Hand it over.

154
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,803
If my memory serves,

155
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:45,802
Liu Sui Feng carries a white fan too.

156
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,922
Let me borrow this.

157
00:11:57,602 --> 00:12:01,523
But Liu Sui Feng's subordinate,
Song Ming Zhu, just entered town.

158
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:03,402
Won't you risk exposure?

159
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,882
Your poor observation skills show.

160
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:10,283
Tell me: which faction chased us here?

161
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,882
Haven't you noticed?

162
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:16,603
Our pursuers wear different colored uniforms.

163
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:20,123
Who should I impersonate then?

164
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,362
Zhao Shi Rong.

165
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:25,563
- No.
- There you go again.

166
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:29,306
Why don't you play Zhao Shi Rong
while I play Liu Sui Feng?

167
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:32,323
What a terrible memory!

168
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:35,523
You've antagonized Power Gang.
You're too recognizable.

169
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,203
Just stay hidden in the carriage.

170
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:40,923
Don't worry. I won't make you play a girl.

171
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:42,842
Nor female attire for you.

172
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:47,163
Your years in the martial world
gave you insights about them.

173
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:49,963
Just don't mess up when it counts.

174
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,762
Use the fan wisely.

175
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:12,877
 

176
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:17,602
Halt!

177
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:21,803
Are you deaf? No one leaves town.

178
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,803
You mangy mutts!

179
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,203
How dare you block this carriage!

180
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,363
Who dares speak insolence?

181
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:54,074
A plain fan with five-petal orchids.

182
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:59,642
Are you Master Liu, the vice leader?

183
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:06,402
Is the leader's wife, Lady Zhao, inside?

184
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:12,242
Is that your place to ask?

185
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:16,346
No disrespect, but my orders demand vigilance.

186
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,803
Few in the gang have seen
Lady Zhao and Master Liu's true faces.

187
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:25,523
Could you show me the vice-leader's token?

188
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:28,003
You've overstayed your lifespan.

189
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:41,843
Years ago, I glimpsed

190
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:45,522
Lady Zhao's silhouette by chance.

191
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,762
Insolence!

192
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,083
How dare you disrespect Lady Zhao!

193
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,922
No offense.

194
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:08,723
This is... Flow-Cloud Sleeve Technique!

195
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:10,962
It's truly Lady Zhao.

196
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,794
Scram, all of you.

197
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,922
I deserve death.

198
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:18,723
Clear the path!

199
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,042
Salute!

200
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:34,242
Thank you.

201
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:36,842
If you see Lady Hong Xiu again,

202
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,803
return this cloak to her.

203
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,786
Understood. But we need to thank you instead.

204
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,683
Without you, we'd be trapped

205
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:46,242
in Lingliang Town for a long time.

206
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,602
Then we'll take our leave.

207
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:50,746
Farewell.

208
00:15:57,642 --> 00:16:00,442
Qiu Shui, let's depart too.

209
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:06,882
I just saw you using Zhao Shi Rong's
Flow-Cloud Sleeve Technique.

210
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,683
You know this technique?

211
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:11,923
Just tricks to scare people.

212
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:13,803
Don't you call me 'Lucky Bag'?

213
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:16,243
I need to know some rare tricks, right?

214
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:19,483
It's getting late. Let's go.

215
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:28,203
 Does Feng Lang know all this? Never mind. 

216
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:30,242
 Meeting Madam Wu takes priority. 

217
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:33,362
 I wonder if Yi Ren has reached Guangling. 

218
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:38,762
 After this matter, I'll tell Yi Ren
to bring Shi Nian back to aid Huanhua Sect. 

219
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:44,602
You're so late. I thought you got captured.

220
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:48,442
We went through a lot to get out.
Did you see Madam Wu?

221
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,722
We've been watching all day.
People keep coming and going.

222
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:54,682
We only found Power Gang underlings.
Did you find the contact?

223
00:16:54,682 --> 00:17:00,202
He left a letter changing the location,
telling us to take Madam Wu to them.

224
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,763
Where should we go now?

225
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:07,450
They must've left markers along the way.

226
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,603
Finding those marks might lead us to Madam Wu.

227
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:15,194
Let's go.

228
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:20,890
 

229
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,362
Don't be afraid.

230
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:59,450
He fell unconscious from poison
invading his heart. He's awake for now.

231
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,882
You've worked hard.

232
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,706
Don't fear.

233
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,602
We're from the Huanhua Sect.

234
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:09,602
What exactly happened here?

235
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:14,922
They made alchemical pills here
and forced us to test them.

236
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:17,003
They killed those who refused.

237
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:19,483
Those who obeyed and took the pills

238
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:24,362
most ended up mad or violent

239
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:26,402
and dead from poisoning.

240
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,763
What kind of pills?

241
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,642
I only know taking those pills

242
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:38,003
eliminated hunger and sleep

243
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:39,882
and made people vicious.

244
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,323
Marching Pills, indeed.

245
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:44,842
Who exactly forced you to test them?

246
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:46,394
Could they be Wastelanders?

247
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,122
No.

248
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,723
They were... martial artists.

249
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:54,763
Their tokens had cauldron engravings.

250
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:56,986
Cauldron engravings?

251
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,602
Yi Ren, could it be Power Gang?

252
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,898
Any other survivors left?

253
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:05,786
Well...

254
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:09,162
Rest assured, my sister's
medical skills are excellent.

255
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,882
She can heal you all.

256
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:14,650
Please save us.

257
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,602
You have my word.

258
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:59,363
Just ahead. Let's go.

259
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:07,043
 

260
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:09,083
 

261
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,602
Yi Ren, Kai Yan, and Xue Yu.

262
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:13,882
Xiao Yi?

263
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,003
Xiao Yi, why are you here?

264
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:19,083
I knew you came to Guangling. I had to meet you.

265
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,083
It's been over three years since we last met.

266
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,474
How fares the Nan Gong family?

267
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,394
We are all well.

268
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,363
Yi Ren, your journey must've been arduous.

269
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:38,842
If we can uncover the truth about Marching Pills,

270
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,642
hardships mean nothing.

271
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:45,083
But this matter is indeed thorny.

272
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,083
Let's talk inside.

273
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:57,083
Yi Ren, perhaps you should abandon this.

274
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,803
Who dares provoke Power Gang nowadays?

275
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:04,482
Continuing the investigation
will only bring trouble.

276
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:09,283
But Yi Ren came because
the Xiao family must uncover the truth.

277
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:10,618
We can't retreat from adversity.

278
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:15,323
Indeed. But acting within one's means isn't wrong.

279
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:20,882
We take martial world affairs as our duty.

280
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:24,482
But this is Power Gang we're talking about.

281
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:33,043
Yi Ren, how about we consult Father?

282
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,563
Marching Pills are crucial.

283
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,723
Making enemies harms Huanhua Sect.

284
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:43,043
Send a messenger pigeon to Huanhua.

285
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,466
We'll decide after consulting Father.

286
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,290
Agreed.

287
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,323
- Young Master.
- Are our men safe?

288
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:02,162
Qiu Shui!

289
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:03,442
You finally came.

290
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:05,723
We found that Power Gang took Lingliang Town.

291
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:09,243
We had to turn to this ruin
and were worried you'd miss it.

292
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:11,963
I told you Qiu Shui wouldn't miss my marks.

293
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:17,323
What? You followed his orders
without even telling me?

294
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:23,162
Fang, I meant I trusted your skills
and Qiu Shui's strategy.

295
00:22:23,162 --> 00:22:24,402
Didn't everything work out?

296
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:25,882
Enough. No more words.

297
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:29,498
I got a letter at Tongfu Inn.
I must see Madam Wu now.

298
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:30,586
We leave immediately.

299
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,602
Qiu Shui.

300
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:37,722
Jie Sheng and I just found this place.
We were delayed.

301
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:39,642
Master Kang.

302
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:48,682
Luckily, Qiu Shui brought a message
from Lingliang Town.

303
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:52,963
Otherwise we might have missed
the rendezvous news.

304
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:56,122
How's the Xiao family now?

305
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,682
When General Wu's troops arrive tomorrow,

306
00:22:58,682 --> 00:23:00,922
I'll seek help from allies

307
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,283
and rescue the Xiao family.

308
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:05,882
Please rest assured, Madam Wu.

309
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:07,922
I'll keep track of the timing.

310
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,563
Good then.

311
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:16,883
All who escaped from the Xiao family
are finally gathered.

312
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:22,202
Madam Wu, the letter said
the rendezvous point is nearby.

313
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:25,763
It's already midnight. Let's head there.

314
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:28,162
Since it's close, we should rest first.

315
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:31,066
Everyone's exhausted.

316
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:33,050
Fine.

317
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:52,043
Qiu Shui, after everything concludes tomorrow,

318
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:55,002
I'll personally take you to seek help.

319
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,123
Thank you, Master Kang.

320
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:01,362
Master Kang, Young Master, the porridge is ready.

321
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:03,523
Serve the people inside first.

322
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:07,402
How's this blade? Look.

323
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:12,482
Madam Wu, Master Zhang, have some porridge.

324
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:21,498
You escorted me all the way.
Your efforts are appreciated.

325
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:23,402
Thank you, Madam Wu.

326
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,202
The porridge is drugged!

327
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:57,763
Master Zhang!

328
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,122
Madam Wu?

329
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,202
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

330
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:18,323
You've all taken Limbs-Weakening Powder.

331
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:20,883
Let's see how long you last.

332
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:23,882
Master Kang, you...

333
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:26,883
Stop calling him 'master' now.

334
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,122
You're quite the actor.

335
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:34,490
You're from Power Gang.

336
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,464
 

337
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:43,003
All these years, to solve the gang's problems,

338
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:45,642
I had to maintain my reputation

339
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:47,563
and walk on eggshells daily.

340
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:51,243
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
let you exploit loopholes

341
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:55,563
or recommended you as the young sect leader.

342
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:00,523
Xiao Qiu Shui, I'll kill you today

343
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:03,202
to avenge my humiliation.

344
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:07,283
Do you think just two of you can kill us all?

345
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:13,083
Who said there's only two of us?

346
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:20,218
Look out!

347
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:30,083
Take Madam Wu away first. I'll hold them off.

348
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,058
Okay.

349
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,442
What's that? Who's this demon rider?

350
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:56,602
 

351
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:58,642
It's Iron Cavalry Demon, Yan Gui Gui.

352
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:01,283
He's beastly, showing no mercy.

353
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:04,922
Protect Madam Wu!

354
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,714
Zuo Qiu! Yu Han!

355
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:45,723
Madam Wu.

356
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,963
It was Song Ming Zhu. She took Madam Wu's package.

357
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:49,842
- I'll chase her.
- Feng Lang!

358
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:52,243
Young man, don't pursue!

359
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:55,682
The Hero Token is in the Nieyuan Box.

360
00:28:55,682 --> 00:28:58,043
If opened incorrectly,

361
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:01,043
the corrosive liquid inside
will destroy the token.

362
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:04,122
Too much bloodshed already.

363
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:08,250
Let Hero Token melt then.

364
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:18,283
Your safety matters most, Madam Wu.

365
00:29:18,283 --> 00:29:20,603
Qiu Shui, I'll pursue.

366
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,674
Watch out!

367
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,963
A shorty?

368
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:33,363
Yan Gui Gui's armor has two people inside.

369
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,442
I've been the legs for ten years.

370
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,122
Thanks for killing my brother.

371
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,723
Now I'll be the head.

372
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:43,962
Guys, guard Madam Wu well.

373
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:50,483
You two want to kill me?
Are you looking down on me?

374
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:54,202
Yes. You're much worse than your brother.

375
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:32,922
Let's go.

376
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:58,843
Madam Wu matters most. Let's go.

377
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:05,946
Young Master.

378
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,162
It's indeed the Nieyuan Box.

379
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:20,843
I saw its design earlier.

380
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:24,202
Forcing it open will destroy the Hero Token.

381
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:29,763
Madam Wu is the mother of a general.
She won't reveal the method if forced.

382
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,363
So you'll trick her into opening it herself?

383
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:38,458
Young Master?

384
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:44,283
I wounded myself. It's not your fault.

385
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:47,994
Whatever happens next, don't intervene.

386
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,243
Freeze!

387
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:03,962
- Madam Wu!
- Zuo Qiu!

388
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:13,212
Madam Wu, we barely escaped
Zhang Lin Yi to reach here.

389
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:16,218
Now you say the Hero Token's gone?

390
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:21,602
Should I kill another person

391
00:32:21,602 --> 00:32:24,283
to help you remember?

392
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:27,043
- You...
- Kang Chu Yu! Stop!

393
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,938
- Qiu Shui.
- Fang.

394
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:44,083
Kang Chu Yu, you're truly despicable.

395
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,922
My father has known you for years.

396
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:48,563
Yet he failed to see your true nature.

397
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:52,563
Tell me, what did the Power Gang
give to corrupt you?

398
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:57,682
I've been a Demon of the Power Gang
since before my fame.

399
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:02,243
I merely hid my identity.
There was no 'corruption.'

400
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:03,963
You're the Nameless Demon?

401
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:07,523
Nameless yet renowned.

402
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:11,442
I become whoever the gang needs me to be.

403
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:14,922
Too cowardly to claim a name?
Yet you played the hero for years.

404
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:16,722
How laughable!

405
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,083
Mock all you want.

406
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,202
I only want the Hero Token.

407
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:28,523
Where is it? Where? Where is it?

408
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,602
- Tell me where it is.
- Stop yelling.

409
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:32,563
Song Ming Zhu took the Hero Token.

410
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,682
She abandoned you to claim the credit alone.

411
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,842
The Nameless Demon Kang Chu Yu

412
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,362
will be known throughout
the martial world tomorrow.

413
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:41,162
Not necessarily.

414
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:44,123
If you all die here today,

415
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:48,634
I'll remain nameless.

416
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:53,202
Kang Chu Yu, still defiant at death's door?

417
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:59,770
- Then I'll kill your friend first.
- You!

418
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,602
Wait!

419
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:06,042
The Hero Token's here. Don't harm anyone.

420
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,898
Why are you injured?

421
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:13,723
It's nothing.

422
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,746
Feng Lang!

423
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,163
Catch this!

424
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,370
Fang.

425
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,074
Qiu Shui!

426
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,083
Tang Rou!

427
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,242
Form ranks!

428
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,043
- Madam Wu, I arrived late.
- Madam Wu.

429
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:15,866
Tang Rou.

430
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,803
- Tang Rou!
- Tang Rou!

431
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:23,610
Tang Rou.

432
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,162
Jie Sheng!

433
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,834
Don't let these two villains escape!

434
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,643
Archers, loose!

435
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,923
Father, go quickly.

436
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:46,042
Go!

437
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,994
Jie Sheng!

438
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:52,203
Go!

439
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:11,610
Tang Rou?

440
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,403
Tang Rou.

441
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:16,346
- Tang Rou.
- Fang.

442
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:18,394
Qiu Shui.

443
00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:26,810
Mr. Feng?

444
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:30,003
Qiu Shui.

445
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,003
How's Feng Lang?

446
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:32,858
He needs treatment now.

447
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:38,682
Tang Rou? Tang Rou! Tang Rou!

448
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:40,122
- Tang Rou?
- Tang Rou!

449
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:42,010
Tang Rou...

450
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:45,466
Madam Wu, please save Rou.

451
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:47,354
Okay.

452
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:57,802
Madam Wu, Mr. Tang Rou's meridians
were severed by sword energy.

453
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:59,962
There's no saving him.

454
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,010
Qiu Shui.

455
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:25,658
Tang Rou.

456
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,138
Tang Rou...

457
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:35,418
Fang.

458
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,643
Fang.

459
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:45,282
Why were you so foolish?

460
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:47,706
Why did you take that sword strike?

461
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,658
Fang.

462
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:58,138
Saving my friend makes me happy.

463
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:05,922
Though I've angered you again.

464
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:09,626
You...

465
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:14,402
How will I explain this to Father?

466
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:21,163
The Tang Sect has jungle law.

467
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:28,963
In recent years, our branch's influence has waned.

468
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:31,442
I hoped to build our reputation

469
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:39,163
and make allies to share Father's burden.

470
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,482
But it seems this is where it ends.

471
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,346
Fang.

472
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,090
Fang.

473
00:39:01,762 --> 00:39:06,458
From now on, I leave it to you.

474
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,338
 ♫ As waterside blossoms wither ♫ 

475
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:27,610
Fang, I have words for Qiu Shui alone.

476
00:39:29,923 --> 00:39:33,146
What can't you say before me?

477
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:35,610
Fang.

478
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,047
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

479
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:41,555
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

480
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:48,634
 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

481
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:54,843
Tang Rou, don't talk nonsense.

482
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,962
You'll be alright.

483
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:00,698
You'll be alright.

484
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,022
 ♫ So many moments ♫ 

485
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:04,038
 ♫ Turned to endless miles ♫ 

486
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:08,038
 ♫ Wild weeds overgrow what was home ♫ 

487
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,163
I remember when we first met.

488
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:18,483
I asked why you helped me.

489
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:24,002
You said the martial world's like water
with unpredictable depth.

490
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:29,602
Only with swords as oars and chivalry as a boat

491
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,810
can we move forward.

492
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,410
 ♫ The broken sword wails, trapped in despair ♫ 

493
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,370
 ♫ This heart-piercing punishment ♫ 

494
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:44,026
Understanding these principles means a lot to me.

495
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:46,234
Tang Rou.

496
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:52,377
 ♫ Like a mournful farewell ode ♫ 

497
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:59,322
I'm sorry. I failed to protect you.

498
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:01,402
I'm sorry, Tang Rou.

499
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:05,442
Qiu Shui, don't say that.

500
00:41:07,194 --> 00:41:12,002
What you've protected
is the moral compass in our hearts.

501
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:19,243
After I'm gone, do me a favor.

502
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:23,483
Name it.

503
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:28,283
Whatever you need, I will make it happen.

504
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,746
My sister

505
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:39,242
always speaks harshly but means well.

506
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:42,522
Indulge her temper sometimes.

507
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:45,443
And take care of her for me.

508
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:49,466
Why say this? I can take care of myself.

509
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,354
Okay.

510
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:54,778
Okay.

511
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,314
 ♫ The bleak wind starts to blow ♫ 

512
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:04,443
 ♫ Like a mournful farewell ode ♫ 

513
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:08,634
Shenzhou Alliance is truly wonderful.

514
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:11,194
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

515
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:13,594
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

516
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:18,266
In twenty years, when I am reborn,

517
00:42:18,266 --> 00:42:24,723
this land will be filled with chivalry, right?

518
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:29,242
Tang Rou, from now on,

519
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:34,442
every reputation we earn will bear your mark too.

520
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:39,323
As Shenzhou Alliance stands, we remain together.

521
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:57,083
 ♫ As waterside blossoms wither ♫ 

522
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:02,106
 ♫ How brief this mortal journey goes ♫ 

523
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:04,455
 ♫ The bleak wind starts to blow ♫ 

524
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:09,598
 ♫ Like a mournful farewell ode ♫ 

525
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:11,925
 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

526
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,362
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

527
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:18,023
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

528
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:25,543
 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

529
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:30,823
 ♫ Regret remains wordless ♫ 

530
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:32,711
 ♫ Broken spears sink in sand ♫ 

531
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:36,955
 ♫ Yesterday's like an elusive dream ♫ 

532
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:38,279
 ♫ So many moments ♫ 

533
00:43:38,279 --> 00:43:40,295
 ♫ Turned to endless miles ♫ 

534
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:44,455
 ♫ Wild weeds overgrow what was home ♫ 

535
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,833
 ♫ Love, hatred, and debts unpaid ♫ 

536
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,664
 ♫ Grudges fall like rain ♫ 

537
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:51,855
 ♫ Endless regrets tangled like hemp ♫ 

538
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:55,479
 ♫ Missed chances at time's crossroads ♫ 

539
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:58,405
 ♫ This inescapable fate ♫ 

540
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:01,319
 ♫ A touch ripples the moonlit water ♫ 

541
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:05,184
 ♫ What remains ♫ 

542
00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:08,675
 ♫ The broken sword wails, trapped in despair ♫ 

543
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:12,837
 ♫ This heart-piercing punishment ♫ 

544
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:15,175
 ♫ As waterside blossoms wither ♫ 

545
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:20,263
 ♫ How brief this mortal journey goes ♫ 

546
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:22,407
 ♫ The bleak wind starts to blow ♫ 

547
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:27,750
 ♫ Like a mournful farewell ode ♫ 

548
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,023
 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

549
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:32,583
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

550
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,190
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

551
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:45,067
 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

552
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:48,519
 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

553
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,177
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

554
00:44:51,177 --> 00:44:54,855
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

555

 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

556
00:45:02,427 --> 00:45:11,495
 ♫ As flowers fall, so does the heart ♫
