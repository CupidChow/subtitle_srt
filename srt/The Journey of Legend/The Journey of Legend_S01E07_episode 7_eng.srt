21
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,754
 

22
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:36,375
- I told you!
- Yes.

23
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,855
An emergency!

24
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:39,454
The woodshed's on fire!

25
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:40,974
The woodshed's on fire?

26
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:42,454
Move!

27
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:43,935
- Come on!
- Go!

28
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,935
Come on!

29
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:50,054
Wait. This is a diversion.

30
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,589
- Let's head to Zhenmei Pavilion.
- Alright.

31
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,455
 
Let's go.

32
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,455
Well...

33
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,534
- What's happening?
- No idea.

34
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,214
Stop!

35
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:50,654
Why did he kill himself?

36
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:00,334
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:05,175
I came to retrieve my jade pendant
from Lady Tang. I never expected this.

38
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:08,175
I saw him sneaking, so I followed him.

39
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:12,175
Shockingly, he attacked me on sight.

40
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:17,774
Xi Lou, they're drugged with knockout powder.

41
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:22,665
Qiu served our family for years.

42
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:27,334
Yet he's Power Gang's mole all along.

43
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:34,814
Tell me what Qiu did today.

44
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,895
He's a cleaner of the Sword Retreat.
Today, he went to the woodshed.

45
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,895
He also helped Zhang water flowers.

46
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:47,415
Someone set the woodshed on fire to draw us there.

47
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:12,374
Father, Mother, he watered the flowers to poison.

48
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:16,455
Deliver my order. Don't get water from the well!

49
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:20,414
Go and check if the well water
is already contaminated.

50
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:22,214
Yes.

51
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:27,215
We only have one well.

52
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:32,414
The well water is poisoned.
All of us are targeted.

53
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,494
Oh no! I had someone get water from the well.

54
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,414
I made soup with it
and sent it to Zhenmei Pavilion.

55
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:39,214
What?

56
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:41,854
Go!

57
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,170
 
Master Zhang.

58
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,974
Mr. Xiao, what brings you here?

59
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:56,414
The well water is poisoned. The soup's lethal.

60
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,214
Mr. Xiao.

61
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:11,614
Don't worry.

62
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:14,854
I've not eaten your soup yet.

63
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,095
No more secrets then.

64
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,575
Get them all here.

65
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:25,695
Listen, this is Madam Wu.

66
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,615
Greetings, Madam Wu.

67
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:33,654
Nice to meet you all.

68
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,815
Everyone, be seated.

69
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:40,854
Thank you, Madam Wu.

70
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:53,575
Madam Wu, these brave people
resist Power Gang alongside my family.

71
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:58,815
When I hear of your valor against Power Gang,

72
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:02,458
I can't sleep or eat comfortably here.

73
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:08,534
I lost my appetite for the soup,
so I narrowly avoided death.

74
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:13,255
Why seek refuge here, Madam?

75
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,054
I planned to go to Xianren Pass to find my son.

76
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:21,294
Unexpectedly, some people
intercepted me at Jinzhong.

77
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:24,575
They demanded the Hero Token.

78
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:30,734
Luckily, Mr. Xiao saved and sheltered me.

79
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:35,414
Madam Wu, may I ask you a question?

80
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:37,934
Forgive my presumption.

81
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,054
Go ahead.

82
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:42,015
You're not from the martial world.

83
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:46,615
Why do they think you have the Hero Token?

84
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:54,015
13 years ago, North Wasteland's troops came.

85
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,695
They occupied our land

86
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,135
and marched into Daxi.

87
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:04,695
They pillaged and slaughtered our people.

88
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,294
People were homeless.

89
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,095
 Protect His Majesty! 

90
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,374
The emperor was forced to flee.

91
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:15,534
Daxi teetered on the brink of collapse.

92
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:28,534
Back then, the sect leaders of Shaolin, Wudang,
and Emei gathered men.

93
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,854
They forged the Hero Token with a celestial spar

94
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:36,015
and took a blood oath together.

95
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,854
 
Whoever saves Daxi

96
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:42,335
shall receive this spar.

97
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,654
One man achieved this.

98
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,534
You mean Yan Kuang Tu?

99
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:53,934
Yes, he broke into the North Wasteland's camp

100
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:56,934
and killed 37 elite soldiers

101
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,135
and nearly killed their commander.

102
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:22,734
Thus, he had the Hero Token.

103
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:27,014
But the martial circle hated his arrogance.

104
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:33,135
He vanished after an ambush on Mount Wuxing.

105
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:41,015
Until recently, a falcon took the token to me.

106
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:45,654
So, Yan Kuang Tu

107
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:50,014
intentionally gave the Hero Token to you?

108
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,814
Exactly.

109
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:59,734
Power Gang knew about that,

110
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,055
so they hunted me down.

111
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:06,735
Innocent blood spilled during the pursuit.

112
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:13,575
Mr. Xiao, how did things go?

113
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:18,134
Power Gang sent many killers.

114
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:24,175
But my place is heavily guarded.
They can't break in.

115
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,975
However...

116
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,934
Speak freely.

117
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:38,614
They poisoned our only well.

118
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:43,615
The water reserves will be depleted soon.

119
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:50,774
I endanger you all. I'm sorry about that.

120
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,494
Madam, no need to apologize.

121
00:09:54,494 --> 00:10:00,134
General Wu's loyal service to the nation
makes him a hero in all our hearts.

122
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,095
Throughout Daxi,

123
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:07,455
only General Wu deserves to hold the Hero Token.

124
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:10,575
My family considers it an honor

125
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:16,095
to ensure your safety this time.

126
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:19,854
If those villains kidnap you,

127
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:24,215
it will distract General Wu
and jeopardize frontline operations.

128
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:27,575
The enemy might take the chance to invade.

129
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:32,574
If so, we'll become sinners.

130
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:40,535
Mr. Xiao, just tell me what to do.

131
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,295
I trust you.

132
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:45,854
The Power Gang poisoned the well

133
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,614
to force us out of this place.

134
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:55,295
They've likely laid heavy ambushes outside.

135
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:56,734
Yet according to our arrangement,

136
00:10:56,734 --> 00:11:02,935
we must escort Madam Wu
to meet General Wu in two days.

137
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:08,774
We can't delay or remain passive.

138
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:27,614
Father, if some of us leave first,

139
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:30,815
how long will the remaining water last?

140
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,254
In that case,

141
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:38,375
the remaining water could sustain us for 20 days.

142
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,855
20 days.

143
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,215
Okay.

144
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,654
I see now.

145
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:52,894
Listen, we must escort Madam Wu
to meet General Wu on schedule.

146
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:56,935
Only then can we break this stalemate.

147
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:01,014
This gives sects time to help us.

148
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:04,055
United strength can crush the Power Gang

149
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,935
and lift the siege on my family.

150
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,734
But it's dangerous,
and the Power Gang has ruthless killers.

151
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:15,854
Wouldn't that be risking Madam Wu's life?

152
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:18,055
Moreover, in the martial world,

153
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:21,415
who dares oppose the Power Gang?

154
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:25,415
Your plan sounds delusional.

155
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:27,815
We just fought the Power Gang.

156
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,335
Have you forgotten?

157
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:33,175
Can the Power Gang
confront the entire martial circle?

158
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:37,295
We're all resisters against the Power Gang.

159
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:43,095
Madam Wu, I swear to protect you with my life.

160
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:48,254
Hui Shan often spoke of this child.

161
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:51,574
He truly takes after both of you.

162
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,014
Qiu Shui is right.

163
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:57,455
We should plan our breakout strategy.

164
00:12:57,455 --> 00:13:02,654
Right now, we're heavily besieged
by the Power Gang.

165
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:06,095
We can't ensure everyone's safe escape.

166
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:09,854
True. Breaking out blindly would be disastrous.

167
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,894
Our only advantage

168
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:16,815
is knowing they target Madam Wu.

169
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:22,174
How about we use a camouflage?

170
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,494
Have someone impersonate Madam Wu

171
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:30,934
as bait to mislead them.

172
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:37,215
To ensure Madam Wu's safe exit,

173
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:41,654
some of us do diversionary work.

174
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,935
That's it.

175
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:49,774
The rest will fight tooth and nail
for Madam Wu's safety.

176
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:56,015
But using someone else as bait for me

177
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,974
sits ill with my conscience.

178
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:03,135
Madam, let me draw them away.

179
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:06,055
Qiu Shui.

180
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,520
Mother, don't worry.

181
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,535
Since Yi Ren is away,

182
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:16,174
it's time for me to do something for the family.

183
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:05,535
Guys, the Power Gang's atrocities demand action.

184
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:10,175
We should fight rather than wait for death.

185
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:15,575
Let's break out and rally allies to destroy them!

186
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,295
- Yes!
- Yes!

187
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:22,455
Xi Lou, you're injured.
So, you stay and guard Sword Retreat.

188
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:27,694
We will help Madam Wu
and Qiu Shui break out safely.

189
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:37,894
This perilous mission demands utmost caution.

190
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:42,774
I'll await your return with liquor and tea.

191
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,855
- No problem!
- No problem!

192
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,975
Qiu Shui.

193
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:06,134
Mother.

194
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:10,694
Countless enemies await outside. Stay vigilant.

195
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:14,215
Don't worry, Hui Shan.

196
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:17,455
He has grown up.

197
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:23,095
He undertakes this mission with a purpose.

198
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,614
Trust his decision.

199
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:31,774
Our children don't make empty promises.

200
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:37,654
Father, Mother, I'm sorry
for not spending more time with you.

201
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:41,014
I promise I'll protect myself.

202
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:45,975
Besides, I still crave the noodles you cook.

203
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,534
Take this.

204
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:58,295
Besides the Triple Shameless Moves,
I'm giving you this Lucky Bag.

205
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:02,414
It contains trap mechanisms.
Remember how to use them.

206
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,615
Fight enemies ruthlessly with them.

207
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:11,894
She's right.

208
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:16,454
I've fallen for her traps before.

209
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:22,055
I deserve it.

210
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,815
Qiu Shui.

211
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,535
When we drank earlier,

212
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:31,575
you said you envied righteous heroes

213
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:35,255
because they could eliminate the evil
and help the weak.

214
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:39,095
But think about it.

215
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:45,174
Flesh-and-blood mortals should fear death.

216
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:51,694
But why does righteousness make them fearless?

217
00:17:54,894 --> 00:18:01,734
Because some things surpass life itself.

218
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:04,694
Look what happened today.

219
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:11,894
Many people are willing to bleed
and die for our family.

220
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:14,375
Remember this forever.

221
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,375
Father, Mother.

222
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,975
I will remember.

223
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,295
After Madam Wu's safe escape,

224
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:29,934
I'll seek help from Jinzhong's sects
to jointly repel the Power Gang.

225
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,014
Go now.

226
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:45,535
Stay safe. You must stay safe.

227
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,694
Father, Mother.

228
00:18:54,694 --> 00:19:01,135
Within 20 days, I'll surely gather aid
to rescue Sword Retreat.

229
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:06,095
Take care.

230
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,095
 ♫ As waterside blossoms wither ♫ 

231
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:19,118
 ♫ How brief this mortal journey goes ♫ 

232
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:21,467
 ♫ The bleak wind starts to blow ♫ 

233

 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

235
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:31,374
 ♫ How deep does sorrow flow ♫ 

236
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:35,035
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

237
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:42,555
 ♫ Let tears fall where maple leaves stay calm ♫ 

238
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:48,240
 ♫ A touch ripples the moonlit water ♫ 

239
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,105
 ♫ What remains ♫ 

240
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,596
 ♫ The broken sword wails, trapped in despair ♫

 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

247
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:20,815
Hui Shan, don't be sad.

248
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,575
Our son's grown into a responsible man.

249
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:29,255
Look, he has so many

250
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:35,894
courageous and loyal friends.

251
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:41,855
We should trust him
and let him roam the martial world.

252
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:44,775
Stop crying.

253
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:51,055
I just want one last look at him.

254
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:12,214
Go!

255
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:24,095
 After breaking out, we'll split into four groups. 

256
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:27,775
 Mr. Qu, Mr. Meng and Ironclad Constable
will lead the Group Dragon as a decoy, 

257
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:31,095
 buying escape time for the other three groups. 

258
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:34,095
 Madam Wu will hide under a black hat. 

259
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:37,854
 Others in black cloaks will escort her
through three routes, 

260
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:41,335
 confusing and dividing enemy forces. 

261
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,135
Move!

262
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:02,254
 Let them scatter for easier elimination. 

263
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:18,614
 Stall while keeping identities hidden. 

264
00:22:18,614 --> 00:22:22,095
 Buy more time for Madam Wu's group. 

265
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:31,335
This way!

266
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,934
 Tang Fang, Feng Lang, guard Madam Wu
with the Group Phoenix. 

267
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,414
 Break through the eastern woods. 

268
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,514
 Remember to wear gas masks. 

269
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:53,295
 You'll pass through the poisonous forest. 

270
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:55,374
 The Power Gang will hesitate there. 

271
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,575
 Plus, they'll assume Madam Wu 

272
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:01,414
 wouldn't separate from Master Zhang,
making your path safer. 

273
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:06,335
The poisonous forest is ahead. Masks on.

274
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:22,654
Go.

275
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,654
 Master Kang and I will lure Power Gang
into the depths of the forest. 

276
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:37,654
They're closing in! Get Madam Wu out first!

277
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:39,454
- Yes!
- Yes!

278
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:18,414
 In this case, let me draw you all here. 

279
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,414
Go!

280
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,495
 Tang Rou, Yu Han, Zuo Qiu, proceed cautiously. 

281
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:38,055
 Find a chance to head uphill. 

282
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:41,615
 Power Gang won't expect
you'd head in the opposite direction. 

283
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:48,934
Go.

284
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:08,414
Leave Madam Wu, and I'll spare you.

285
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,694
It's you!

286
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:18,894
You idiot.

287
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,535
Fooling me? You're dead!

288
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:23,894
Let's see.

289
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,694
Attack!

290
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,055
Don't!

291
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:23,855
Run now!

292
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,975
Go!

293
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:30,575
- Go!
- Go!

294
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:37,254
Guys, stop fighting!

295
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:42,015
Leave!

296
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,134
Come on! Let's go!

297
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:47,775
- Young Master, go!
- Let's go together!

298
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,575
Come on. Get up.

299
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:58,775
Your family protected me before.
Today, I repay you.

300
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,614
Enough! Let's go!

301
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:02,855
Leave!

302
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:09,095
Young Master, run!

303
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,135
Kong Yang Qin!

304
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:32,335
You're way below Fu Tian Yi.

305
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:36,495
You can't kill me!

306
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:38,815
You can't kill me!

307
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:14,654
Xiao Qiu Shui's gadgets work well.

308
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:19,854
- This is...
- Anti-poison gear. Take it.

309
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:22,895
Take one each. Safety first. Wear it.

310
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:36,694
- Protect Madam Wu!
- Yes!

311
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:30,214
The target's not here. Retreat!

312
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:41,894
What's going on? Where's Madam Wu?

313
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:45,535
I don't know. Mr. Qiu Shui
told me to dress like this.

314
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:48,185
 
 Father, Mother, though Qiu's dead, 

315
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:52,654
 Power Gang's cunning with many spies. 

316
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:58,254
 We changed plans last moment to fool them. 

317
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,934
 You'll impersonate Madam Wu
and leave with Feng Lang. 

318
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,654
 Should we inform Mr. Feng? 

319
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:07,614
 - No need.
- Yes. 

320
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:11,015
 Then what about the real Madam Wu? 

321
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:14,214
 I've made alternative arrangements. 

322
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:17,335
Why did Xiao Qiu Shui change plans?

323
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:20,095
Where would Madam Wu be?

324
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:23,535
Once we find Xiao Qiu Shui, we'll know.

325
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:31,375
Return to help.

326
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:42,414
What's your real purpose for coming to the Xiao's?

327
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:48,335
Xiao Qiu Shui once helped me.
Shouldn't I help him fight his enemies?

328
00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:52,854
But you haven't shown much concern
for Xiao Qiu Shui's safety.

329
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:57,495
By contrast, you seem more concerned
about Madam Wu's whereabouts.

330
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:59,454
Doesn't that seem suspicious?

331
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:06,254
Lady Tang, may I think you came
to the Xiao's for ulterior motives?

332
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:14,815
Why did you save me earlier?

333
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:18,014
For no reason. It's no big deal.

334
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:46,535
Run! Why did you stop running?

335
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:55,015
Let me carve your bones into guqin picks.

336
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:57,414
Fine.

337
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,214
I won't run anymore.

338
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:02,974
So, are you afraid of death?

339
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,974
Not exactly.

340
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:10,014
I'm going to kill you.

341
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:14,615
- Kill him.
- Yes.

342
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:11,335
You killed the disciples of my family.

343
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:16,694
Play your guqin in the underworld.

344
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:33,214
This cheap trick will get you killed.

345
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:36,374
The fun is just beginning.

346
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:38,335
Tell me about Madam Wu's whereabouts.

347
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:42,295
Otherwise, I'll feed your flesh
to my poison insects?

348
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:48,694
 Hua Gu Fen, the Poison Demon,
this place shall be your grave. 

349
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:30,774
 Tang Rou, you're excelled
in hidden weapons and mechanisms. 

350
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:33,895
 So, do me a small favor. 

351
00:34:34,694 --> 00:34:37,094
 Alright. What do you need me to do? 

352
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:44,614
 Qiu Shui, your recent actions
have become rather perplexing. 

353
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:46,414
 What do you say? 

354
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,494
 Fu Tian Yi's dead. The Xiao family's besieged. 

355
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:54,334
 Who knows what will happen next? 

356
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,494
 I'd better plan ahead. 

357
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,655
Are you alright?

358
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:13,895
I'm fine.

359
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:27,735
What about other guards?

360
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:53,695
You're poisoned by Hua Gu Fen's insects.
Let me neutralize the toxin.

361
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:56,134
No need.

362
00:35:57,015 --> 00:36:01,535
Xue Yu gave me antidotes.

363
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:04,454
I'll take one later.

364
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:09,134
What about Madam Wu and Tang Rou?

365
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:13,134
They should be safe by now.

366
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,694
 Tang Rou, escort Madam Wu and Master Zhang 

367
00:36:15,694 --> 00:36:19,294
 to the cliff behind the house
and depart from there. 

368
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:20,975
 How do we traverse the cliff? 

369
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:23,255
 Don't worry. I have a method. 

370
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:37,335
Remarkable! This stuff actually helped us fly!

371
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:41,694
Madam Wu.

372
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:44,455
Madam Wu, are you okay?

373
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:46,575
I'm good.

374
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:50,574
Qiu Shui's strategy worked!
Let's get Madam Wu to rest quickly.

375
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,375
Okay.

376
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,575
Luckily, Madam Wu is safe.

377
00:36:57,575 --> 00:37:01,335
Qiu Shui, why did you alter plans
at the last moment?

378
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:05,375
In this martial world,

379
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:09,455
Power Gang's spies lurk everywhere.

380
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:14,054
Their spies work covertly.
It's hard to guard against them fully.

381
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:18,494
I dare not gamble with Madam Wu's life.

382
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:21,494
So, I changed my plan.

383
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,375
It seems my parents

384
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:38,454
and other men have safely returned.

385
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:43,174
It's getting late.

386
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:47,015
We must swiftly join General Wu's troops.

387
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,815
Let's go.

388
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,254
Red Phoenix, you're here.

389
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:09,174
- You serve the Sword King?
- Correct.

390
00:38:09,174 --> 00:38:11,774
Who allowed you to meddle?

391
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:13,734
Do you know Madam Wu's whereabouts?

392
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:16,975
I was ordered to watch
the Xiao family. I never went in.

393
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:19,054
How should I know that?

394
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:22,175
I see.

395
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:45,454
 Sword King's men seek Madam Wu, too?
I must inform Young Master. 

396
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:21,694
These areas have all been infiltrated
by the Power Gang.

397
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:24,895
Once Madam Wu arrives,
she'll naturally need to rest.

398
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,375
Tang Fang, go meet her outside the town.

399
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:34,415
If you encounter Madam Wu, alert her discreetly.

400
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:38,095
I'll go to Tongfu Inn for more information.

401
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:40,855
Got it. Be cautious.

402
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:56,134
 
Do you dine or stay?

403
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,855
Any man from the west?

404
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,655
You are...?

405
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:07,855
 

406
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:11,494
No visitors, but I have a letter.

407
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:15,738
 

408
00:40:23,418 --> 00:40:26,490
 

409
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,134
Thanks.

410
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:45,175
Tomorrow afternoon's meeting location is changed.

411
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:48,895
Does Madam Wu's group know the new location?

412
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:52,934
They likely have alternative contact methods.

413
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,375
No time to waste.

414
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,375
Let's go.

415
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,494
Make way!

416
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,214
- Any clues?
- No.

417
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,055
Watch at the town's exits. No one leaves.

418
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:10,855
- Yes.
- Yes.

419
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:18,175
What's your next plan?

420
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,614
Go.
