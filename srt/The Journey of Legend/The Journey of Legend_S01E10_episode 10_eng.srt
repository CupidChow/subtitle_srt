 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫

 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫

5
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:23,002
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫

00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,970

 ♫ Let this long river boil,

 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,298
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,

21
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,608
 

22
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:37,203
I'm going to take you all on today.

23
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:41,763
If anyone can take the Hero Token from my hands,

24
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:44,243
I'll respect them as true heroes.

25
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:51,522
I'll give them both the token
and the Book of Oblivion.

26
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:06,483
If you can't defeat me, you'll all
obey my commands henceforth.

27
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,923
Anyone else?

28
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:49,883
Attacking with hidden weapons?

29
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:59,323
I'm done playing with you.

30
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:20,563
All heroes heed the divine token's call.

31
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:25,083
Sui Feng, do you know the meaning of this token?

32
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,242
Every martial artist knows this.

33
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,443
Exactly.

34
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:33,282
When the Shaolin, Wudang,
and Emei leaders forged this token,

35
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:37,122
 
they imprinted their fingerprints on it.

36
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:41,443
Look at these fingerprints.

37
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:48,602
There are no fingerprints. It's fake.

38
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,162
There's one more thing.

39
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:57,362
If only one Qiu is in Sword Retreat,
how can we be sure there isn't a second?

40
00:04:57,362 --> 00:05:00,922
Qiu Shui, you mean?

41
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:09,162
What I mean is everyone's trying to snatch
the Hero Token from Madam Wu.

42
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,963
To ensure absolute security,

43
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:15,282
you need a backup plan, Madam Wu.

44
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:22,344
It must be Xiao Qiu Shui.

45
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:30,203
Master, Liu Sui Feng is hailed
as an infallible strategist.

46
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,282
How could anyone deceive him?

47
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,482
He obviously hid the real token to mock you.

48
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:40,323
Master, we've suffered loss and gained nothing.

49
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:42,683
Shouldn't there be consequences?

50
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:00,282
Master!

51
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:06,003
Sui Feng's Sleeve Dimension has improved.

52
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,403
Tell me...

53
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:13,120
Should these petals remain on the branches

54
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,162
or be plucked into one's palm?

55
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,403
Master, plucked petals only flutter briefly.

56
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:31,203
Only on the branches can fragrance endure.

57
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:37,403
The Power Gang is a branch,
and we are but its flowers.

58
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:42,203
Conflict makes petals fall.
Clinging to the branch preserves beauty.

59
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,643
I believe it was just Sui Feng's oversight.

60
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:51,403
Years of overwork have drained his capabilities.

61
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:55,563
From today, let Sword King work with Sui Feng

62
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:58,243
to track the Hero Token's whereabouts.

63
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:20,523
 Master, I swear to reclaim the Hero Token for you. 

64
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,683
 Then I'll return to beg forgiveness. 

65
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:00,962
You're injured. Don't drink.

66
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:11,123
I lost my brother. I should be the one drinking.

67
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,643
Rou.

68
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,282
I failed to protect you.

69
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:31,402
The world's unpredictable.
What could you have done?

70
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,603
At first I thought

71
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,843
this martial world was simple.

72
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:46,402
With wit and caution,
any challenge could be overcome.

73
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:51,243
I believed righteousness ruled the martial world.

74
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,243
And true friendship

75
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:59,202
meant unconditional trust.

76
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:08,162
I thought I could change destiny.

77
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:16,562
But these were my illusions.

78
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,522
In the end,

79
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:30,003
I've achieved nothing.

80
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:39,802
Now I understand why Tang Rou trusted you so,

81
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:44,643
following you everywhere, never returning home.

82
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:50,602
Regardless of life, death, gain, or loss,

83
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:53,522
you do whatever you desire.

84
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:59,522
Xiao Qiu Shui, the way you live is truly enviable.

85
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,483
Yet so unreal.

86
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:09,322
Indeed. It's truly unreal.

87
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:16,648
This cruel martial world hides men's hearts.

88
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:23,602
Countless people scheme
relentlessly for their goals.

89
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:28,643
Few show your level of honesty.

90
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:37,722
I don't understand fate or destiny,

91
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:43,162
but I know Feng Lang kidnapped me,

92
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,563
and you risked everything to save me.

93
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:51,843
Or I wouldn't be here speaking with you now.

94
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:57,803
Don't forget your promise to Tang Rou.

95
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:03,363
We'll avenge him against the Power Gang together.

96
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,243
Master Zhang,

97
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:01,042
let martial affairs remain in the martial world.

98
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:12,843
Master Zhang kept the Hero Token
safe from Feng Lang.

99
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:17,803
This game isn't completely lost yet.

100
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,723
He served me for many years.

101
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:27,083
I understand his intentions best.

102
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:33,083
He's long grown indifferent to life and death.

103
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,922
His loyalty stemmed purely from righteousness.

104
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:45,562
Now he sees that virtue in you.

105
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:50,184
When he woke today, he told me,

106
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:55,282
"If I could have a disciple,
they should be like Qiu Shui."

107
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:03,522
This dagger was Master Zhang's personal belonging.

108
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:07,122
He entrusted me to pass it to you.

109
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:12,963
His wish is for you to become a true hero soon.

110
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:25,682
I'm deeply grateful
for your and Master Zhang's kindness.

111
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,043
Sword Retreat remains besieged.

112
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:43,083
My son's former cavalry troops
are in these mountains.

113
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:48,083
Ordering them to rescue Sword Retreat
could save the Xiao family.

114
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,882
Please don't.

115
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:56,083
Madam Wu, I do want to save my parents and family,

116
00:13:56,083 --> 00:14:00,443
but the Xiao crisis
is purely a martial world affair.

117
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,923
Deploying military cavalry recklessly

118
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:07,242
will make Jin City's garrison clash with them,

119
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:10,323
putting the civilians in the city into suffering.

120
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:14,963
And the imperial court
will grow more suspicious of General Wu.

121
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:22,522
Then what should we do about the Sword Retreat?

122
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:27,402
I'd like to ask you
to dispatch a horse-riding messenger

123
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:31,402
to send an urgent plea letter
to my eldest brother at Guangling Villa.

124
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:34,642
Tomorrow I'll head to Jinzhong
to seek aid from various sects.

125
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,363
Combined with reinforcements from my friends,

126
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:43,602
I'll spare no effort to rescue my family.

127
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:49,202
Okay. I'll send someone to Guangling
to deliver the letter to your brother.

128
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:55,682
After that, I'll strive to help my son.

129
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:01,123
May the Xiao family remain safe.

130
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:05,322
Thank you, Madam Wu.

131
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:50,242
Young Master, the Pine Stone Pills
greatly benefit your health.

132
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,042
Please try some.

133
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:05,802
Who do you think you are?

134
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:11,162
Focus on completing your assigned tasks.
Don't entertain any funny ideas.

135
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:15,802
Understood.

136
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,843
Shi Rong.

137
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,443
Still pondering Chen Zhou's words?

138
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:35,402
I wouldn't dare question orders.

139
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:39,163
Remember not to overextend yourself in missions.

140
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:43,762
One shouldn't bear ten thousand burdens
or errors are inevitable.

141
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,562
I acknowledge my mistake.

142
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:52,122
Heard you used Thunder Sting Technique.
That strains your body severely.

143
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:57,123
Take these Pine Stone Pills.
They'll help restore you.

144
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:03,122
Thank you, Shi Rong.

145
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,843
Rest well. I'll take my leave now.

146
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,523
Don't take matters into your own hands.

147
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,882
- Song Ming Zhu.
- Young Master.

148
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,083
Madam Wu only interacted
with the Xiao family members.

149
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,162
The Hero Token must be connected
to the Xiao family.

150
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:37,402
Investigate thoroughly
through Madam Wu's connections.

151
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:39,202
Understood.

152
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,202
 Tang Rou. 

153
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,442
 Qiu Shui. 

154
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,652
 What are you looking at? 

155
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:00,988
 ♫ As waterside blossoms wither ♫ 

156
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:04,043
 ♫ How brief this mortal journey goes ♫ 

157
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:07,643
 Do you believe in an afterlife, Qiu Shui? 

158
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,723
 ♫ Like a mournful farewell ode ♫ 

159
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,503
 Probably not. 

160
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,962
 ♫ When zither breaks, who'll sing along ♫ 

161
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,267
 Why ask this suddenly? 

162
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,832
 ♫ Gazing at the moon beyond horizons ♫ 

163
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:28,883
 If there's an afterlife,
I'd still be your sworn brother. 

164
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,762
Tang Rou!

165
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,323
 

166
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,202
 Spouting nonsense again. 

167
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:22,642
 I impersonated this demon once.
It doesn't mean I actually know him. 

168
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:26,402
 He's the vice leader of Power Gang.
How to redeem him? 

169
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:52,563
 Tang Rou died, and Feng Lang defected. 

170
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:57,083
 Then there's Kang Chu Yu.
The martial world's full of surprises. 

171
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,603
 Even worse, I stopped paying attention
after the escort of Madam Wu. 

172
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:07,563
 I need to tread carefully now. 

173
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:12,202
 Priorities now: save the Xiao family
and claim sect leadership from Father. 

174
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,762
 I can only turn things around
by following my Demon Codex's plot. 

175
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:43,922
Mr. Qiu Shui fears putting you all in danger.

176
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:47,402
So he departed alone without bidding farewell.

177
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:52,642
But he left word: the martial world
is perilous. Return to Tang Sect soon.

178
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,763
Once he resolves the Xiao family's crisis

179
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:59,563
and avenges Tang Rou,
he'll reunite with you at Tang Sect

180
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:02,883
to jointly pay respects to Tang Rou.

181
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:09,323
 
Get me the fastest carriage to Jinzhong.

182
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:10,803
When do you depart?

183
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,659
Now. Please be quick.

184
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:16,168
 

185
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,483
 Mother stuffed so much money. 

186
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:24,162
 Father, Mother, wait for me. 

187
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:28,202
 I'll find a way to save the Xiao family. 

188
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:32,922
No problem.

189
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,682
Er Zhu! Er Zhu!

190
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:36,083
- Yes?
- Quickly!

191
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,922
Take this guest to select a fine horse.

192
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,442
Yes. Please come, sir.

193
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:13,922
Wasn't white willow bark supposed
to be anti-inflammatory, like aspirin?

194
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:18,643
Nothing seems effective.

195
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,803
- The one in this carriage?
- Exactly. It's him.

196
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:41,843
He's carrying loads of money.

197
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:49,922
Such cliché storytelling.
Must every journey face bandits?

198
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:54,483
Unbelievably unlucky.

199
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:56,563
Get down! Hand over the money!

200
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:58,922
Come down! Now!

201
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:44,682
How could you leave without a word?

202
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,442
I have my own path.

203
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:56,962
You represent Tang Sect. Stay out of this.

204
00:23:56,962 --> 00:24:00,682
Xiao Qiu Shui, you once said,

205
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:05,323
"Gather through righteousness,"
and I believed that.

206
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:07,603
Are you afraid of implicating me?

207
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:13,323
Rou's dead.

208
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:17,402
I can't lose another friend.

209
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,122
What do you mean?

210
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:22,882
When you saved me from Feng Lang,

211
00:24:22,882 --> 00:24:26,002
did I vanish, fearing to burden you?

212
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:30,883
Put yourself in my place.
I don't leave debts unpaid.

213
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:39,482
Nor will I outsource my brother's vengeance.

214
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:44,483
Having chosen to be with the Xiao family,

215
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:49,323
I'll see this through, understand?

216
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:54,122
Enough talk.

217
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:57,202
You guys, come pull the carriage.

218
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,962
- Walk faster and steadier.
- Yes.

219
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:22,482
Apply the medicine.

220
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:31,922
 Is this how martial world folks behave? 

221
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:36,883
 She has a bad temper
but still upholds the martial code. 

222
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:42,723
Miss, the fire's lit.

223
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:44,563
The backup firewood is stacked.

224
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:47,043
Can you let us go now?

225
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:49,922
Just passable. Get lost.

226
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,722
Wait.

227
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:56,202
If I catch you committing atrocities again,

228
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:59,162
I'll gouge your eyes out, got it?

229
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,563
Yes! We hear you!

230
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:03,602
- Move.
- Hurry!

231
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:06,162
Shouldn't we have them cook before leaving?

232
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:10,602
- I'll call them back.
- Forget it. Don't.

233
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,242
They don't look like they can cook anyway.

234
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:16,363
I can't cook either.

235
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,843
Just wait.

236
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:32,643
Here.

237
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:45,162
Sweet milk?

238
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:51,682
When you're sad as a kid, sweets help. Right?

239
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:09,083
No appetite?

240
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,803
It'll be ready in an hour.

241
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:36,083
I remember the tough days back then in Tang Sect.

242
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:40,723
There was endless training every day.

243
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:45,803
If we failed the trials,
we got punished or starved.

244
00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:50,763
Tang Rou would raid the kitchen for leftovers,

245
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:54,523
mix them up, and heat them on the stove.

246
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:57,123
We'd huddle together to eat.

247
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:10,283
It's just like old times.

248
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:31,763
They say stars are people who've passed.

249
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:36,323
Tang Rou must be watching you from up there.

250
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:41,283
If you stay sad, he'll be sad too.

251
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:48,883
It's childish comfort talk.

252
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:56,776
That's what people say where I'm from.

253
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,003
Different groups of stars mean different things.

254
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:03,083
They're called constellations.

255
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,803
Constellations?

256
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:08,762
Aren't you from Jinzhong?

257
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,043
Yeah.

258
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,483
Then why haven't I heard of such things?

259
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:17,962
It's niche knowledge.

260
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:23,002
Too obscure. You wouldn't get it.

261
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:29,883
I bet Tang Rou was a Libra.

262
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:36,123
He was gentle, righteous, and kind.

263
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:44,442
He valued friends and was a true brother.

264
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:51,722
He's probably in that direction.

265
00:29:55,962 --> 00:30:03,242
Among those glittering stars, one is him.

266
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:11,123
He's been shining on us and watching over us.

267
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,122
So everyone has different constellation signs?

268
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,922
What's mine?

269
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:29,442
You?

270
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:34,722
You're stubborn, passionate, and reckless.

271
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:40,544
But also admirably brave

272
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:43,243
and pure-hearted.

273
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:46,843
You're like an Aries.

274
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,563
Interesting.

275
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,483
This is Libra's symbol.

276
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:08,682
Keep it. Like Tang Rou's with you.

277
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:36,602
 
Young Master, I learned nothing special.

278
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:39,323
Xiao Qiu Shui and Madam Wu split up.

279
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,362
Miss Tang Fang pursued him.

280
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:46,202
The Hero Token might be with Xiao Qiu Shui.

281
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:55,162
But someone like him won't
misuse the token even if he has it.

282
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:57,922
He'll seek allies along the way.

283
00:31:57,922 --> 00:32:02,883
Pity that Jinzhong sects
dare not oppose the Power Gang.

284
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,002
But Tang Fang will help him.

285
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:09,722
Contact Tang Song.

286
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:12,922
The Tang Sect dares to meddle?

287
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:17,803
Tang Song keeps currying
our favor for power in Tang Sect.

288
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,962
Don't you always despise him, Young Master?

289
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:24,162
Even trash has uses after all.

290
00:32:24,162 --> 00:32:28,563
Dangle some bait for Tang Song
and tell him to prepare.

291
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:30,363
Understood.

292
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:34,568
 

293
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:47,563
Let's see how your master became bedridden.

294
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,083
Is he trying to chicken out now?

295
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,563
Tang Fang, mind your manners.

296
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:58,722
Xiao Qiu Shui, have you brought
this rude girl here to cash in favors?

297
00:33:00,723 --> 00:33:04,483
Then do you plan to repay favors, Master Ding?

298
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,003
I simply don't want to act against righteousness

299
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:09,402
and aid schemers by mistake.

300
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:12,563
For all we know, maybe your family

301
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:16,843
angered Power Gang and invited trouble
by coveting the Hero Token.

302
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:18,803
Don't be insolent!

303
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:23,803
Master Ding, your self-preservation
is understandable.

304
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:26,122
But why slander my family?

305
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:31,122
What befalls the Xiaos today
may strike the Dings tomorrow.

306
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,122
Utter nonsense!

307
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:35,682
Are you forcing us to fight?

308
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,283
Ungrateful old eel!

309
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:42,563
Tang Fang, don't need to bother with this coward.

310
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,363
Let's go.

311
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:51,162
Don't beg that Ding guy.

312
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,243
He's spineless. Let's try other sects.

313
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:58,202
I fear everyone in the martial world
of Chuanjin feels the same.

314
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:04,322
Tang Fang, thank you for your assistance
along the way. Let us part ways here.

315
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:08,802
Wait, where are you going?

316
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:16,922
Madam Wu has already sent word
to my eldest brother.

317
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:20,962
Perhaps he can rally martial artists
to rescue my family.

318
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:24,203
I must return to regroup with them first.

319
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,362
There's one sect in Jinzhong
you haven't consulted yet.

320
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:34,403
You mean your sect, Tang Sect?

321
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:43,323
But Tang Sect never involves itself
in martial world affairs.

322
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:47,163
As you said, what befalls the Xiaos today

323
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,163
may strike the Tangs tomorrow.

324
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:52,123
Actually, Tang Rou once asked me

325
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,522
why the Tangs don't unite
to become the foremost clan,

326
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:58,562
instead letting Power Gang rats run rampant.

327
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:00,562
I still wish to persuade my father.

328
00:35:00,562 --> 00:35:05,563
If I fail, I'll go to Guangling
together with you. How about that?

329
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:14,123
Very well. Let's try this first.

330
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:19,362
Tang Fang, thank you for your righteousness.

331
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:25,563
I can't guarantee success, but I'll try.

332
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:32,571
 If I deviate from the mission path,
is there truly no alternative route? 

333
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:36,616
 

334
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,523
My lady.

335
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:46,763
- Where's my father?
- Master is in the inner hall.

336
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:48,563
Please go see him first.

337
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:53,043
Wait here. I'll fetch my father.

338
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:09,640
 

339
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:42,603
Sir, please be seated and enjoy some tea.

340
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:51,162
Thank you.

341
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:29,560
 

342
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,592
 

343
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:42,723
Tang Fang, long time no see.

344
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:46,283
Tang Song, where's my father?

345
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:50,083
Master is naturally managing affairs
in the inner courtyard.

346
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:54,163
Tagging along with your brother's mischief,

347
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:56,563
don't you fear Madam Tang's punishment?

348
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,203
You're the one acting recklessly.

349
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:04,963
Relying on Madam Tang's favor,
you dare disregard Tang Sect rules?

350
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,088
How will you talk back now?

351
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:15,123
Tang Fang, you dare bring outsiders
to seek Tang Sect reinforcements?

352
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:21,283
Yet you wrote 'reciprocating favors'
in your letter to Master. How laughable!

353
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:23,723
You dared read my private letter to my father?

354
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:27,323
You sought to exploit Tang influence
to relieve the Xiaos' predicament,

355
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:30,153
meddling in their feud with Power Gang.

356
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:32,283
This isn't 'private.'

357
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,962
I have my reasons.

358
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:38,083
If you take issue,
let's settle this before Madam Tang.

359
00:38:39,763 --> 00:38:46,163
Do you truly believe
she is unaware of our actions?

360
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:47,643
By detaining you now,

361
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:51,562
we merely discipline your promise
of aid to outsiders when unauthorized.

362
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,562
Should this reach Madam Tang,

363
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:58,963
your main lineage's
misappropriation of the treasure

364
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,323
becomes an inescapable crime.

365
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:03,843
I don't know what you're implying.

366
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,843
Truly stubborn.

367
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,482
I've received intelligence.

368
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:11,843
The Xiao family's siege by Power Gang
stems from the Hero Token.

369
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:15,082
And about the schemes
that Xiao boy you brought harbors,

370
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:20,362
surely you don't think Madam Tang is ignorant?

371
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:28,483
You'd better marry me obediently.

372
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:35,522
I might conceal your transgressions.

373
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:37,923
You grow more shameless by the day.

374
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:41,362
Why threaten without acting?

375
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:45,522
Let's go. Let's clarify everything
before Madam Tang.

376
00:39:45,522 --> 00:39:50,763
I'd relish seeing which of us she trusts.

377
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,803
No rush.

378
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:55,643
The Xiao boy outside is already in my custody.

379
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,923
Once I retrieve the Hero Token from him,

380
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:04,402
your guilt will be confirmed, Tang Fang.

381
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:09,123
Don't blame me for showing no mercy then.

382
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:13,962
 

383
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:18,082
Master! Master! Young Master has returned!

384
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,882
Father.

385
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:27,803
 
Couldn't survive after stirring trouble?

386
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:33,323
Now you remember you have a father and a home?

387
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:35,123
It's not true, Father.

388
00:40:35,763 --> 00:40:38,922
Enough. Report to the Reflection Hall first.

389
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:41,962
After five days of penance, we'll talk.

390
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:46,922
Father, I've returned
to seek aid for the Xiao family.

391
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:50,563
Power Gang is vicious, and they besieged
the Xiaos' Sword Retreat.

392
00:40:51,442 --> 00:40:55,843
So you know Power Gang is vicious?

393
00:40:55,843 --> 00:41:00,643
Yet you'd drag our entire clan
into conflict with them?

394
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:10,362
You never should have followed
that Xiao boy into provoking them.

395
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:12,962
But Master Xiao and Lady Hui Shan
are in grave danger.

396
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,723
How could I stand idly by?

397
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,763
Do you think hiding spares us from trouble?

398
00:41:17,763 --> 00:41:21,962
What if Power Gang invades Qianxi next, Father?

399
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:27,362
This matter exceeds you juniors' concerns.

400
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:29,162
Our Hailin Sect

401
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:34,920
entered the Central Plains martial world
to uphold justice through swordsmanship.

402
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,042
Though our family
is but a branch of the sect in Qianxi,

403
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:41,323
we've never forgotten our roots.

404
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:46,442
Father, since childhood you taught me,

405
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:50,002
"Both life and martial arts demand righteousness."

406
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:52,442
I've engraved this in my heart.

407
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:56,643
You and Master Xiao once shared camaraderie,

408
00:41:56,643 --> 00:42:00,043
traversing the martial world
and overcoming perils,

409
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:03,243
just like Qiu Shui and me today.

410
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:09,083
Why has caution replaced your courage?

411
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:19,723
If you won't act, I'll aid the Xiao family myself.

412
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:21,523
You...

413
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:24,362
Stop him!
