song title

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,509
 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫ 

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,318
 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫ 

4
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:15,254
 ♫ At the end of the other shore,
the long night finally pales ♫ 

5
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:18,649
 ♫ Only then is this oath not sworn in vain ♫ 

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:23,002
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫ 

7
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,770
 ♫ My resolve has never wavered ♫ 

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,654
 ♫ Even after millennia,
I'll cleave mountains asunder ♫ 

9
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:38,726
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,
the dawn to break, and for you to come ♫ 

10
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,786
 ♫ Storms and turmoil rage ♫ 

11
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:49,494
 ♫ Turbulent waves surge ♫ 

12
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:51,257
 ♫ Trampling the dawn's light ♫ 

13
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:54,228
 ♫ Let us venture together ♫ 

14
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:58,266
 ♫ Let this long river boil,
forging new mountains and seas ♫ 

15
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,749
 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫ 

16
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:05,466
 ♫ At the end of the other shore,
the long night finally pales ♫ 

17
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,489
 ♫ Only then is this oath not sworn in vain ♫ 

18
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,442
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,
frost and snow embrace me ♫ 

19
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:16,086
 ♫ My resolve has never wavered ♫ 

20
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:19,670
 ♫ Even after millennia,
I'll cleave mountains asunder ♫ 

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,040
 ♫ I'll wait for the fog to clear,
the dawn to break, and for you to come ♫ 

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,990
Title

23
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:33,370
 

24
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,714
 

25
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:43,480
 
Mr. Qiu Shui.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,100
 

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,506
Mr. Qiu Shui, Master ordered
that no one should approach his yard.

28
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:59,006
Since when has his yard
gotten guarded so strictly?

29
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,846
If it's urgent, I can relay your message.

30
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:08,907
Never mind. It's nothing important.

31
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:12,727
I just think you all looked overworked.

32
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,786
 Mother deliberately changed the subject earlier. 

33
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:31,707
 And now Father's yard is heavily guarded. 

34
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:35,467
 Could that important figure
really be in the Xiao Residence? 

35
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,026
 Madam Wu? 

36
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:47,746
 Is Madam Wu here? 

37
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,107
 I don't remember the exact details. 

38
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:55,306
 But I recall her carrying
the Hero Token, making her a target. 

39
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:58,227
 So the plot has reached this point. 

40
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:04,506
 If that's the case,
the current security might stop me, but not a true master. 

41
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,886
 I need extra safeguards. 

42
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,374
Come in.

43
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:21,267
Greetings, master.

44
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,506
What have you found?

45
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:26,674
Master, I haven't been with the Xiaos
long enough to move freely.

46
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:31,107
But recently, they've increased security
around Xiao Xi Lou's yard, Qianzhu Yard.

47
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:34,327
If they're hiding someone,
that's the likely location.

48
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,914
Qianzhu Yard?

49
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:40,506
 

50
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,660
&nbsp;

51
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:06,962
Master.

52
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:10,706
What's going on? Why all the sudden lights?

53
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:12,946
Mr. Qiu Shui ordered it.

54
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,627
- Where is he?
- Father. Mother.

55
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,626
I gave the order.

56
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,987
Qiu Shui, this place...

57
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,566
Is no place for your foolishness.

58
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,486
- Right.
- Mother. Father.

59
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,186
Right now, the martial world is in turmoil.

60
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:37,150
Hearing about Everjoy Escort Agency's
incident worried me deeply today.

61
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,626
Adding more guards won't help much.

62
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:44,378
The spotlights will eliminate all blind spots.

63
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:46,202
What lights?

64
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,027
Perpetual lights.

65
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:54,427
Constant light prevents sneak attacks.

66
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:58,726
Master, we failed to notice the wildcat
in the courtyard earlier.

67
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:01,527
Mr. Qiu Shui's lights scared it away.

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,510
&nbsp;

69
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,907
- Father.
- Yes?

70
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:18,667
See? I can be useful sometimes.

71
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:23,186
Actually, competing with Yi Ren
for the young sect leader position

72
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:26,787
w-wasn't really my intention.

73
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:30,654
I didn't punish you. Don't push your luck.

74
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:34,346
Go. You know what to do next, right?

75
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:41,726
Sleep!

76
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:47,526
You scared me. I'll sleep now.
Father, Mother, rest early too.

77
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:50,767
Look at him. He...

78
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:53,534
Madam.

79
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:57,090
Let's go.

80
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,450
 

81
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:06,562
Guard this area. No one enters.

82
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:08,250
Understood.

83
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:16,906
 If Madam Wu is truly here, she'll attract danger sooner or later. 

84
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:20,207
 Enough thinking.
I must become sect leader quickly. 

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,060
&nbsp;

86
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,587
You startled me.

87
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:49,787
Where are you going? Don't wander off.

88
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:53,854
Listen, I'm not familiar with this place either.

89
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,406
Walking.

90
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,746
Walking? Now?

91
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,427
What kind of midnight walk is this?

92
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:04,946
Get inside. I need to talk to you.

93
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,327
Hurry up.

94
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:09,246
Move. Get in.

95
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:26,567
My uncles refuse to endorse me.
I can't challenge Yi Ren.

96
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,806
Help me brainstorm solutions.

97
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:39,366
I've always wanted to ask. Why are you
so desperate to lead the Huanhua Sect?

98
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,907
Because...

99
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,366
without being the leader,

100
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:52,667
many things remain undone and unmovable.

101
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,667
I can't explain fully now.

102
00:07:55,667 --> 00:08:00,846
But desperation breeds failure in worldly matters.

103
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:04,466
If you won't help, at least don't discourage me.

104
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,107
We're alone here.

105
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:14,587
Stop pretending with me.

106
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,706
Show me your secret weapon.

107
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,066
Now. Hurry up.

108
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,886
What secret weapon?

109
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,574
None exists.

110
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,987
What about martial techniques?

111
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:30,067
You can't learn my style.

112
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:39,047
Strange. Aren't we friends now?

113
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:44,686
Don't you have anything to offer?

114
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,147
Only myself.

115
00:08:56,207 --> 00:09:00,607
Are you alright? Why the cryptic talk?

116
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:12,466
Answer me this, when you recover, will you help destroy Power Gang?

117
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,027
You must be joking. I lack such power.

118
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:25,207
True. Just a casual question.

119
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:34,142
Perhaps new friendship lacks strength?

120
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,998
So be it.

121
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,518
What are you doing?

122
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:06,307
Feng, here's the thing.

123
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:10,327
I've never enjoyed sleeping on floors.

124
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,787
Don't take it too seriously.

125
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:18,707
Moreover, there seem to be some issues
in our friendship.

126
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:22,026
We'll stick together day and night from now on.

127
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:24,387
Don't dwell on it too much.

128
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:28,790
Let's sleep. It's getting late.

129
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,902
Oh, blow out the candles before we rest.

130
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:34,890
Alright.

131
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:41,167
 This guy seems simple
and gullible at first glance, 

132
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,366
 but his unexpected actions
keep thwarting my plans. 

133
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:49,426
 It seems gaining his trust won't be as straightforward as I imagined. 

134
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:24,446
Finally awake? Come have breakfast.

135
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,414
I have no appetite.

136
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:33,346
No appetite? Skipping breakfast? That's strange.

137
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,167
What's the rush?

138
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:43,746
Tell me, do you have any plans for today?

139
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,840
No. Just wandering around to clear my mind.

140
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:51,650
To clear your mind sounds good.

141
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,360
You might come up with another plan.

142
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,006
Must you keep following me?

143
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:03,626
Honestly, I don't want to do it either.
But I've got no other choice.

144
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:05,070
Fine.

145
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,246
You need a hero's recommendation
to challenge Yi Ren, right?

146
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,150
Exactly. I've told you all this.

147
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,170
Will you help or not?

148
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:25,407
Kang Jie Sheng, son of Kang Chu Yu.

149
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,827
What about Kang Jie Sheng?

150
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:34,146
Three years ago, Kang Jie Sheng
was escorting disaster relief supplies

151
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:37,107
but gambled away all the funds during the journey.

152
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,807
The scandal should've ruined his fame.

153
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,210
Yet he still parades as a 'hero.'

154
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,120
Why do you think that is?

155
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,994
Master Kang must've covered it up for him.

156
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,450
You're smart.

157
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:55,146
Kang Chu Yu used his own money
to calm public anger.

158
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:57,504
This shows how much he dotes on his son.

159
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,967
Befriend Kang Jie Sheng,

160
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:03,566
and Kang Chu Yu's recommendation letter
will follow naturally.

161
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,574
That actually sounds like a solid plan.

162
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,030
Let's go.

163
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,947
Mr. Kang, I've made myself clear before.

164
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:21,440
We're not compatible.

165
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,300
Please take these gifts back.

166
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:29,307
Won't you look inside the chests first?

167
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:32,906
Since ancient times, treasures
suit heroes, and jewels beauties.

168
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:35,340
These are just a token of my esteem.

169
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Name anything you desire.

170
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,626
In time, we might grow compatible.

171
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,906
Affection should arise naturally.

172
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:50,786
If it's forced, as you suggest, it degrades both parties involved.

173
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:55,807
Xue Yu, give me a chance to know you better.

174
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:11,266
Mr. Kang, show some self-respect.

175
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,338
Scumbag.

176
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,167
Xiao Xue Yu, you're just
an adopted daughter of the Xiao family.

177
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,522
Why act so aloof?

178
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:22,967
I, Kang Jie Sheng,
am the only son of the Kang family.

179
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:26,674
My interest in you is your good fortune.

180
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:28,827
- Stop pointing.
- I...

181
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,846
Mr. Kang, you seem gravely injured.

182
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:34,267
Let me check your pulse.

183
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,467
What injury?

184
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,820
Your face is about to lose all its skin.

185
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,160
A severe injury indeed.

186
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,194
Or maybe you just discarded it
voluntarily.

187
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:45,850
- Right, Xue Yu? 
 - You...

188
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,950
Alright.

189
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,287
It seems yesterday's lesson
from your father wasn't harsh enough.

190
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:55,386
"Mother, I... I want
to become the young sect leader!"

191
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,386
Do you even deserve it?

192
00:14:57,386 --> 00:15:01,726
What? Need me to 'tighten your hide' again?

193
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:05,530
You've shown no manners here.

194
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,807
Seems you need another beating.

195
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,554
- Qiu Shui!
- I...

196
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:15,786
- Yi Ren.
- Yi Ren.

197
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:19,346
Yi Ren, he's bullying me.

198
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:24,307
Yi Ren, this Qiu Shui is utterly disrespectful.

199
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,687
Qiu Shui isn't at fault.

200
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,987
- This matter...
- I heard everything.

201
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:31,798
Mr. Kang, Qiu Shui is impulsive by nature.

202
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,526
I apologize for him.

203
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:37,687
However, your earlier conduct was inappropriate.

204
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,646
Xue Yu grew up in our family.

205
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,386
We regard her as our own.

206
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:46,766
Father said the younger ones' marriages
should be decided by themselves.

207
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:50,626
So, Xue Yu, your marriage
should follow your own wishes.

208
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:53,626
No one can force you.

209
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:58,807
Did you hear that, Mr. Kang?

210
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,970
You dare pursue my sister? Abandon that hope now.

211
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,007
Abandon that hope now.

212
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:06,926
Why don't you look at yourself?
You can't even make the waiting list.

213
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:10,606
- Xiao Qiu Shui, your tongue is vicious!
- Mr. Kang.

214
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:15,866
Morning tea is ready in the hall.
Your father awaits.

215
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,818
Don't keep him waiting.

216
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,410
Go.

217
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,162
Let's go.

218
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,187
Yi Ren, you know what?

219
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:34,526
That scoundrel doesn't speak a word of truth.

220
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,567
Enough. Hold your tongue.

221
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:43,147
Of course, as family, I'll always protect you two.

222
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:49,047
Though the Kang family upholds justice,
Kang Jie Sheng has a gambling habit.

223
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:52,954
A marriage alliance with him
would tarnish our sect's reputation.

224
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,578
Exactly.

225
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,502
Don't worry, Xue Yu.

226
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:02,734
I'll find you a match from a clan
equal to Huanhua in power and fame.

227
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:06,166
- Only such a person would deserve you.
- Yes.

228
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,006
Thank you, Yi Ren.

229
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:12,654
I'd be content staying with my parents
and roaming the martial world.

230
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:15,066
That's all I need.

231
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:18,050
- I'll brew the decoction.
- Okay.

232
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:26,270
Yi Ren, there are many ways
to establish mutual benefits.

233
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,110
Marriages should never be used as leverage.

234
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,787
I'd never let my own sister suffer.

235
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:36,666
Any marital alliance must happen
only if she approves.

236
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,946
I haven't even addressed your behavior yet.

237
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,626
Our family's reputation is at stake.

238
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:46,887
Even if you were right earlier, your impropriety was unacceptable.

239
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:51,306
Mother says you've been ambitious to aim at the young sect leader post.

240
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:54,307
Do you know why no one nominates you?

241
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:59,267
You're just impulsively hot-headed.

242
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:02,860
Go have tea with Kang Jie Sheng later.

243
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,074
Consider it mending fences.

244
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:07,806
I... I won't go.

245
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:10,486
Stop fussing. Go now.

246
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,227
Fine. I'll endure.

247
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,350
You've offended Kang Jie Sheng.

248
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,460
Even if
you offer tea now, he won't help you.

249
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:43,507
Having offended him
doesn't necessarily mean defeat.

250
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:47,667
Since the damage is done, why not do it thoroughly?

251
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,426
Besides, you'll help me anyway.

252
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:00,898
Gamble against Kang Jie Sheng?

253
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:01,910
Exactly.

254
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,150
&nbsp;

255
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,450
He offended Xue Yu.

256
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,060
I'll make him pay dearly for it.

257
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,666
Feng, lend me your peerless treasure,
the Hanhao Stone.

258
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,447
I'll gamble with him properly.

259
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:27,526
Qiu Shui, this stone is exceptionally rare.

260
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:32,574
Master Kang Chu Yu's sword
was forged with this very material.

261
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:35,426
That's how he performs his Sun Sword Technique.

262
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,586
I went through a lot to obtain this small piece.

263
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,154
Good.

264
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:53,047
Hand it over. Let me borrow it.

265
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,246
Let me borrow it.

266
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,726
Feng, no need to be stingy.

267
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,146
Such stinginess isn't honorable.

268
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,766
It's not exactly stinginess.

269
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,910
Hand it over.

270
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:27,706
Feng!

271
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:32,598
Rest assured, Feng.
I'll repay you double if I win.

272
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,866
Heavens! Truly a magnificent stone!

273
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:45,787
Kang Jie Sheng needs this ore
to use his father's techniques.

274
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,762
Rest assured. He'll desperately covet this.

275
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:51,880
This time, I'll fleece him properly.

276
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,860
I'll crush him.

277
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,306
But since it's gambling,
how can you be sure he won't win?

278
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,194
Hmph.

279
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:07,227
These mercury-loaded dice
roll whatever number I choose.

280
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:11,826
This time, he'll lose for sure.

281
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:21,507
You think this trifle is worth
wagering against my Hanhao Stone?

282
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:24,326
This is gold.

283
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:27,286
Gold? What's gold worth?

284
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,687
I have seen gold before.

285
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,426
Gold can't compare to my Hanhao Stone.

286
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:34,186
Let's go. The game's off.

287
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:37,067
Then name the stake you want.

288
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:49,186
That thumb ring of yours looks decent.

289
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:52,674
Add it to the stake.

290
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:59,146
Xiao Qiu Shui, this is my family heirloom
and the Young Sect Leader's Token.

291
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:02,547
Heirloom? What's your trinket worth?

292
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:06,307
My Hanhao Stone is the only one in existence.

293
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:08,967
Enough. Bet or walk away. Stop blathering.

294
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,858
- Let's go.
- Fine!

295
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,906
Let's gamble then.

296
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:28,046
One dice roll decides victory.

297
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,826
A single roll determines all.

298
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,210
&nbsp;

299
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:09,826
Double sixes! Twelve points!

300
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:13,507
Twelve points!

301
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:16,858
Twelve points. Your turn.

302
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:18,518
Impressive.

303
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,538
Decent luck.

304
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,426
Also twelve points!

305
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,446
- Mr. Qiu Shui is amazing! 
 - I've got twelve too.

306
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:35,946
Xiao Qiu Shui, do you admit

307
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,267
the martial world's gambling rules?

308
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,267
Of course I do.

309
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,507
That simplifies things.

310
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:46,246
Cheaters pay tenfold.

311
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:51,747
Your dice contain mercury.

312
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,666
What happened?

313
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,067
- There is no mercury.
- I don't see any.

314
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,438
None at all.

315
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,107
Where's the mercury?

316
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:04,547
Right. There's none there.

317
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,626
- There's no mercury.
- Where's the mercury?

318
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:11,647
What were you saying earlier?
Cheaters pay tenfold?

319
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,626
Mr. Qiu Shui won! Kang Jie Sheng cheated.

320
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:25,426
Impossible. This can't be!

321
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:27,286
How dare you frame Mr. Qiu Shui?

322
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:28,918
Utterly despicable.

323
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:31,322
Pay tenfold.

324
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:35,766
A cheater should have their tendons severed.

325
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,127
But I won't dirty my hands.

326
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,354
Mr. Feng, let's split the winnings.

327
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,447
Wait.

328
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:45,366
When did you swap my dice? Didn't you say...

329
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:51,386
Well, you two!

330
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:54,086
You actually set me up!

331
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,747
It's mealtime.

332
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:58,127
Let's end it here. Game's over.

333
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,058
- Okay.
- Xiao Qiu Shui!

334
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,547
Didn't you do all this just for Xiao Xue Yu?

335
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,947
You've done so much for her.

336
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:16,906
Don't tell me you've been
secretly involved all along?

337
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:20,686
- Nonsense! He's just lashing out now.
- Right.

338
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,154
I knew it. No wonder she wouldn't marry me.

339
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:30,307
So you two have been carrying on
behind everyone's back.

340
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,842
My Young Sect Leader's Token!

341
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,862
In this world,

342
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:49,267
some are born luckier than others.

343
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:52,507
They live comfortably without lifting a finger

344
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:55,967
and presume to look down on others without effort.

345
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,980
Over time,

346
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,180
they truly believe
they can belittle others at will.

347
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:12,227
Today I'll show you your ways don't work on me.

348
00:26:12,227 --> 00:26:16,894
Xiao Qiu Shui, you're courting death!

349
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,714
Jie Sheng!

350
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,280
&nbsp;

351
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,080
Father.

352
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,486
Yi Ren.

353
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:35,146
Father, Xiao Qiu Shui destroyed
my Young Sect Leader's Token!

354
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:37,067
I saw everything. Look at you.

355
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,946
You've totally humiliated me.

356
00:26:38,946 --> 00:26:42,707
I told you to have tea with Jie Sheng.
Why the gambling?

357
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:47,186
Return whatever money you took.

358
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,758
I-I didn't take any.

359
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,674
Chu Yu.

360
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,866
No need. Keep it.

361
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,447
Apologize to Master Kang.

362
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:09,498
Master Kang, I was disrespectful. My apologies.

363
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,326
I should be thanking you instead.

364
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:15,027
Jie Sheng usually keeps bad company.

365
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:21,406
I'd rather he befriends sincere people like you who can guide him.

366
00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:25,307
This matter is over.

367
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:29,006
After lunch, all Xiao family members gather here.

368
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,740
I have important news.

369
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,867
Dismissed.

370
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:35,246
- Understood.
- Chu Yu, my apologies.

371
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:38,014
- Thank you.
- Take care.

372
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:39,738
Let's go.

373
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,787
Let's go.

374
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:49,027
Did I say you could leave?

375
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,054
Not you.

376
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:57,726
Come here.

377
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:03,006
Father, I was wrong.

378
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:05,766
Will you hit me?

379
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:08,726
No, and I wouldn't dare.

380
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:14,927
You cause trouble daily. Punishment is due.

381
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:21,847
But your eloquent words earlier were quite pleasing to hear.

382
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,307
Remember not to grow arrogant.

383
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:27,906
The punishment is recorded for now.

384
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,782
Don't repeat this mistake.

385
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:32,026
Understood.

386
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:43,666
Master Kang should write me
that recommendation letter now.

387
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:46,490
Never mind.

388
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,140
It's done.

389
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,343
 

390
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:58,127
Kang Chu Yu wrote you a recommendation?

391
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:03,687
Back then, Master Kang
covered up his son's scandal

392
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:06,986
of embezzling charity funds
and indulged his son's gambling.

393
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:10,706
Today's cover-up follows the same logic.

394
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:15,627
The more his son does wrong, the more magnanimous he acts.

395
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:19,267
Though unwilling, he had to write this.

396
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:23,986
Now both he and his son must hate me deeply.

397
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,946
We've truly become enemies.

398
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:29,342
You know quite a lot.

399
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:32,858
Social etiquette, the first lesson on the job.

400
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,682
Job?

401
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:41,186
See? Our first collaboration
got this recommendation letter.

402
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:44,827
This strengthens our partnership.

403
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:47,547
And my settings will recover faster.

404
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:49,827
Alright. Enough talk.

405
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:54,326
I'll find my father now. And you stay put.

406
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,640
&nbsp;

407
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,906
The whole Huanhua Sect gathers today

408
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:11,827
for two announcements.

409
00:30:11,827 --> 00:30:15,986
First, Marching Pills

410
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,587
have been spotted in Guangling lately.

411
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:20,174
Marching Pills?

412
00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:23,426
Wasn't Herbal Valley destroyed decades ago?

413
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,246
How could the Marching Pills exist?

414
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,307
This is suspicious.

415
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:32,906
Righteous factions are investigating in Guangling.

416
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:36,867
Our sect must take responsibility too.

417
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:40,246
Yi Ren, tomorrow take Kai Yan

418
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:43,367
and lead the Tiger Guards and Shi Nian

419
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:49,594
to Guangling Villa
to investigate the Marching Pills.

420
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,107
- Understood.
- Understood.

421
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:55,027
Father, let me go with Yi Ren and Kai Yan.

422
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,326
Raised in the Huanhua Sect,

423
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:01,787
I vow to be a hero like you and Mother to serve the martial world.

424
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:05,886
My skills have matured, and I'm skilled in medicine.

425
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:07,887
I can be of help.

426
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:13,280
Does your mother approve?

427
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,547
Gaining more experience would be beneficial.

428
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:22,906
Good.

429
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:27,686
With your mother's approval, I'll give my consent.

430
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:34,166
Once the supplies are ready, you'll accompany your brothers to Guangling.

431
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,790
Thank you, Father.

432
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,280
&nbsp;

433
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:44,546
The second matter I want to address is a family affair.

434
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:47,666
I am now in my fifties

435
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:52,146
and have led the Huanhua Sect for many years.

436
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:55,666
Recently, Yi Ren
has been assisting me considerably.

437
00:31:55,666 --> 00:32:00,906
He now is even taking charge
independently at Guangling Villa.

438
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:04,906
I planned to hold
the succession ceremony in six days.

439
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:07,226
But since you're departing soon,

440
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:12,787
I'll give the young sect leader position
to you in advance.

441
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,890
Yi Ren.

442
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,067
Yes.

443
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:23,787
This is the Sect Leader's Token
of the Huanhua Sect.

444
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:27,846
- From now on, you shall be... 
 - Wait.

445
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:40,647
Father, this recommendation letter
comes from Master Kang.

446
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,887
I demand a fair competition for the position.

447
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,307
Upside down.

448
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:51,770
It's upside down.

449
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:58,650
Sorry, Father.

450
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,587
Please read it.

451
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,887
Just read it, Father. Mother, read it.

452
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:06,067
What's the harm in reading it?

453
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,566
Look. This is indeed
Kang Chu Yu's recommendation letter.

454
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:11,514
It's real.

455
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:16,707
Read it with your son.

456
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,547
Qiu Shui, I wouldn't dare challenge Yi Ren myself.

457
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:25,086
Where did you find such audacity?

458
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:29,107
Since Qiu Shui has obtained
Master Kang's endorsement,

459
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,166
it proves our family gains another promising hero.

460
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,787
I'm naturally happy.

461
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:38,426
- Whenever you're prepared, feel free to challenge me. 
 - Yi Ren...

462
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:42,906
Qiu Shui, all these years, Yi Ren has fulfilled
the young sect leader's duties.

463
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:46,107
If you're serious, gain more experience
in the martial world first.

464
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,967
Then you can properly challenge him later.

465
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,806
Mother, I truly can't wait any longer. I don't have the time.

466
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:54,027
- Qiu Shui.
- I...

467
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:57,326
You're still young. How could you have no time?

468
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,986
Yi Ren, could you let me
take the position for a year?

469
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,426
Even six months would suffice.

470
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:05,546
I'll return the position to you then.

471
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,026
- Is that acceptable?
- Qiu Shui.

472
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:10,667
The young sect leader position
isn't something to barter like this.

473
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:14,782
I thought you were maturing,
but you treat this as a joke.

474
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:16,478
I cannot permit this.

475
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:20,387
Alright, enough fuss. Don't disappoint me.

476
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,307
Yi Ren, I'm not fooling around.

477
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:27,858
This concerns the lives
of everyone in the Huanhua Sect.

478
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,822
- Yi Ren.
- What?

479
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,610
Yi Ren.

480
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:35,546
Father. Mother.

481
00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:39,206
Let's follow protocol. I'll challenge Yi Ren.

482
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,686
Very well.

483
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:49,607
Since you got the recommendation, we must honor your request.

484
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:50,586
Okay.

485
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:55,747
We'll arrange a duel between you
and Yi Ren before his departure.

486
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:58,170
- Agreed?
- What?

487
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,694
Understood.

488
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:05,082
Qiu Shui's determination is commendable.

489
00:35:05,082 --> 00:35:07,106
Prepare thoroughly.

490
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:11,927
Yi Ren, expedite the supply preparations.

491
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,642
Understood.

492
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,660
Let's go.

493
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,440
&nbsp;

494
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,727
Qiu Shui, are you truly challenging Yi Ren?

495
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:29,046
Qiu Shui, this is unwise.

496
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,946
Yi Ren's martial prowess
will make you a laughingstock.

497
00:35:32,946 --> 00:35:37,347
Let me persuade Father to call this off.

498
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:41,186
Kai Yan, thank you for your concern.

499
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:45,906
I have compelling reasons for this.

500
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:48,086
Don't worry about me.

501
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,486
I don't fear embarrassment.

502
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:53,206
Qiu Shui speaks wisely.

503
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,627
Since he's resolved, let him try.

504
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:58,130
He'll have no regrets even if embarrassed.

505
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,507
Kai Yan, rest assured. Yi Ren won't harm Qiu Shui.

506
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:07,767
- Come. Train with me. 
- Mother, where are we going?

507
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:11,042
No peeking, you two.

508
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,466
Let's go.

509
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:18,227
The tea is rather good today.

510
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:19,447
Indeed.

511
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,707
Why are you alone?

512
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:24,066
Master, all servants recruited within three years

513
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,546
were dismissed by the Xiao family before noon.

514
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,327
I only have until dusk for the handover.

515
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:36,386
Lately, Xiao Qiu Shui
has been occupying all my time.

516
00:36:36,386 --> 00:36:39,827
Why were you dismissed when needed by me most?

517
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:42,747
I don't know either. Mr. Qiu Shui gave the order.

518
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:45,927
But Master, after your investigation
at Qianzhu Yard that day,

519
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:49,707
the Xiao family sent a sedan
t-to the Sword Retreat.

520
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,546
- Did you see who they sent?
- No, I didn't.

521
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:59,066
You're about to get beaten by Yi Ren.
I'm really worried about you.

522
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:03,747
- Mother, do you also think I'll lose?
- Yes, I do.

523
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:11,626
That's why I've decided to teach you my secret skill.

524
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:16,267
Mother, stop joking.

525
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,106
Your secret skill is the Cross Wisdom Sword.

526
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,707
I can't master that in a single day.

527
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,347
I didn't mean that.

528
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:23,906
The Cross Wisdom Sword is just for show.

529
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:26,226
Before I met your father,

530
00:37:26,226 --> 00:37:30,226
I relied on this secret skill to remain undefeated in every duel,

531
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:32,046
though I didn't always win outright.

532
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,747
Undefeated in every duel?

533
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:36,106
Undefeated yet didn't win?

534
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:39,290
What's that technique?

535
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,178
Watch closely.

536
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:55,507
First move, Pheasant Ascends Roof,
for ground-level ambushes.

537
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:06,287
This is the second move.

538
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:09,466
The third move is crucial.

539
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,627
Xi Lou.

540
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:35,867
Mother, what's that smell?

541
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,747
What kind of underhanded trick is this?

542
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:41,846
Exactly. They're Triple Shameless Moves.

543
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:47,466
Back then, I couldn't defeat opponents
with these moves,

544
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,946
but they ensured my safe retreat.

545
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,027
If not for your father

546
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:55,707
insisting on being a righteous hero
and forbidding me to use this technique,

547
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:59,327
it might have become renowned by now.

548
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,266
Got it memorized?

549
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:06,286
Yes, Mother. They are truly shameless.

550
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:16,147
I know Yi Ren well.

551
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:20,066
Though reasonable normally,
he's extremely concerned with face.

552
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,707
I know you've got tricks,
but you need to be careful.

553
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:26,707
As my youngest son,
don't get injured by the eldest.

554
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,967
Or I'll be very sad.

555
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,654
Don't worry, Mother.

556
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,622
- Do your best.
- Okay.

557
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:40,827
Remember. If you can't win, surrender.
No reckless bravery.

558
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:50,113
 

559
00:39:55,906 --> 00:40:00,566
 Such tight security. She must be here. 

560
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:04,787
 Xiao Qiu Shui's disturbance
alerted Xiao Xi Lou that day. 

561
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:08,847
 They moved Madam Wu to Sword Retreat,
a troublesome place, overnight. 

562
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:15,390
 All that effort to buy time
by hastening Xiao Qiu Shui's duel was wasted. 

563
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,020
- Master Xiao, Lady Hui Shan.
- Master Xiao, Lady Hui Shan.

564
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,230
&nbsp;

565
00:41:01,106 --> 00:41:03,194
Let's begin.

566
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:25,026
I didn't expect you to be prepared so quickly.

567
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:28,586
Then I will spar with you today.

568
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:32,267
Yi Ren, I have a suggestion.

569
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:36,747
Real blades between family members isn't proper.

570
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:41,006
How about three smaller contests instead?

571
00:41:41,006 --> 00:41:42,787
Oh?

572
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:44,147
What kind of contests?

573
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:48,106
Internal energy, lightness skill, and precision.

574
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:58,027
Very well. As you wish.

575
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,906
Yi Ren, for the first round,

576
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:14,767
let's see who can attract more iron bars.

577
00:42:15,506 --> 00:42:20,667
Qiu Shui, you're challenging Yi Ren
to an internal energy battle?

578
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,066
What trick are you plotting now?

579
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:29,427
Fine. Let's proceed.

580
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,426
Impressive indeed.

581
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:47,407
Now my turn.
