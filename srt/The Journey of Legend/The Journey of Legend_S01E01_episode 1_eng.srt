♫  Let this river run hot,

♫  Let the torrents drench me, 
 frost and snow embrace me  ♫

20
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:19,670
♫  Even after millennia, 
 I'll split mountains apart  ♫

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,740
♫  I'll wait for the fog to clear,

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,990
   

23
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,950
   

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,649
 In the early Daxi Era, chaos plagued 
the martial world, and righteousness in decline. 

25
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:45,769
 The largest sect Power Gang 
dominated the martial circle 

26
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:49,609
 while Heavenly King Zhu from Waterway Sect 
 monopolized the waterways. 

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,249
 The two sects remained deadlocked.  
    

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,830
 North Wasteland armies rampaged, 
 driving refugees south. 

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,209
 The emperor was forced to flee the capital. 

30
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:07,190
 Meanwhile, the long-lost Hero Token resurfaced in the martial world.  
    

31
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,049
 Legend said the token 
held the secret of a treasure. 

32
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:14,469
 And this token resided with 
famous General Wu Jie's elderly mother. 

33
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,390
 Martial artists set ambushes 
along Madam Wu's journey 

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,490
 all the way to Jinzhong and cornered her. 

35
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,709
 At this critical moment, a young hero emerged 

36
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,049
 and saved Madam Wu from 
the Power Gang and Heavenly King Zhu. 

37
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,489
 He was Xiao Qiu Shui, 
the third young master of Huanhua Sect. 

38
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:45,150
 He had mastered the graceful 
Huanhua Swordplay to perfection. 

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,790
 With boundless internal energy 
and supreme lightness skill, 

40
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,270
 he wielded his sword swiftly 
with thunderous force. 

41
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,450
 Wielding the Sword of Changge, Xiao Qiu Shui 
single-handedly defeated the Power Gang 

42
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,489
 and earned his place in the martial world. 

43

44
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,789
I, Xiao Qiu Shui, pay respects to you, Madam Wu.

45
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,126
All right.

46
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:21,350
   

47
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,570
 Ming Ming. Get up quickly. 

48
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,929
 How's the adaptation 
of Heroes of Divine Land going? 

49
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:42,130
 I got you this beta access 
to fulfill your martial arts fantasy. 

50
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,450
 You need to set key plot points 
and characters in the Demon Codex. 

51
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,249
 The embedded AI in the Demon Codex 
system will handle all the details. 

52
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,409
 Welcome to the Demon Codex 
interactive writing system. 

53
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,050
 Since I'm adapting it, 
the character can use more buffs. 

54
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,749
 The protagonist must be 
an unrivaled martial artist 

55
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,990
 in lightness skill, internal energy, 
and swordsmanship. 

56
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:15,170
   

57
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,610
 Dashingly handsome, he was also extremely gifted 

58
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,010
 as a once-in-a-century martial arts genius. 

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,930
 He mastered the Xiao family's 
Huanhua Swordplay by age 12. 

60
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,810
 When he turned 18, Yan Kuang Tu planted 
the Boiling Blood Cocoon in him, 

61
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,790
 which could unleash immense power in crises. 

62
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,550
 When he turned 20, he found the supreme 
martial arts manual, 

63
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,229
 Book of Oblivion, and mastered unrivaled skills. 

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,880
   

65
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,930
 He crushed the Power Gang, 
defeated Heavenly King Zhu, 

66
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,629
 and became the martial circle leader 
at the age of 20. 

67
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:56,370
 He led his friends and allies against 
invading North Wasteland armies. 

68
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,050
 General Wu granted him 
the Hero Token in appreciation. 

69
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,230
 Thus, Xiao Qiu Shui unified the martial world. 

70
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:22,169
 Reign supreme for eternity. 

71
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:28,310
 At his prime time, Xiao Qiu Shui savored 
his privileged life as the protagonist. 

72
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,429
 Gazing at his territory, he uttered six words. 

73
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:35,750
 Wait, eight words. 

74
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,209
Unmatched in the divine land, 
such pure loneliness.

75
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:46,890
 Xiao Ming Ming, thank you for adapting 
Heroes of Divine Land with Demon Codex. 

76
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,010
 Integrate this into the system? 
  

77
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,700
 Li Cai suggested a nice Demon Codex.
 

78
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,480
This is not bad.

79
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,990
 System bug.  
    

80
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,409
 System bug. 

81
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,629
 Out Of Character alert. 

82
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,410
 Are you kidding me? 

83
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,829
- Nice. 
 - Nice.

84
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,890
Sir, this way please.

85
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,590
- Nice. 
 - Upstairs, please.

86
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,690
- Nice. 
 - Here's to you.

87
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,969
This way. One guest for upstairs.

88
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:05,490
Yeah, it's magnificent.

89
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,769
- Nice. 
 - Great.

90
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,889
One moment, please.

91
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,769
- Nice. 
 - Nice.

92
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,869
- This way, Young Master. 
 - Nice.

93
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,609
- Thank you. 
 - Great dancers.

94
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,809
Excellent taste, Sir.

95
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,090
Nice.

96
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,110
Young Master.

97
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,990
- Young Master. 
 - Young Master.

98
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,950
Young Master, wake up.

99
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,850
Why is he still asleep?

100
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,289
He has slept so long today.

101
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,190
Yeah, it's been hours.

102
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,929
- Young Master. 
 - Young Master.

103
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,690
Young Master, wake up.

104
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,350
Young Master.

105
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,769
 Young Master, wake up. 

106
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,590
He woke up.

107
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,529
- He woke up. 
 - Young Master, are you all right?

108
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,169
Young Master.

109
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,130
 I'm so dizzy. 

110
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,169
- Young Master. 
 - Great! He finally woke up.

111
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,929
That's right. Finally.

112
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,950
Young Master, are you having a headache?

113
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,850
How do you feel?

114
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,789
Young Master, are you all right?

115
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,300
 What's happening? 

116
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,950
Where am I?

117
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,029
Have some water first.

118
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,510
Who are you?

119
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,090
Where's Li Cai?

120
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:34,629
I see. You're some actresses he hired.

121
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,250
Actresses? What is that?

122
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,509
You challenged the underground casino 
and came here to celebrate yesterday.

123
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:48,169
Then, you got drunk and rested here, Young Master.

124
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,830
 Young Master? 

125
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:57,810
 Did I dream about Xie Xiao Feng 
from "Sword Master" I watched? 

126
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,630
 What a bizarre dream. 

127
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,069
Young Master, what's wrong?

128
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,990
 The props look so realistic. 

129
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,170
Is there a problem?

130
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,409
 Oh my, this is freaky. 

131
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,969
Young Master, what's wrong?

132
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,790
 No way. Something is wrong. 

133
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,100
   

134
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,730
Young Master Qiu Shui, be careful.

135
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,600
What did you just call me?

136
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,649
Young Master Qiu Shui?

137
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,350
Please stop teasing me.

138
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,509
Aren't you Xiao Qiu Shui, 
the third young master of Huanhua Sect?

139
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:19,010
   

140
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,960
Xiao Qiu Shui of Huanhua Sect.

141
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,900
Xiao Qiu Shui of Huanhua Sect?

142
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,350
Yes.

143
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,780
 This is not a dream? 

144
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,840
 Did I... did I travel into the novel? 

145
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,809
Wait... I-Is this the Daxi Era?

146
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,809
That's right.

147
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:57,070
 West of Jin City, along Huanhua Creek, 
lay the Huanhua Sect. 

148
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,790
 Xiao Xi Lou, head of famous Xiao family, 
enjoyed great prestige in Jinzhong. 

149
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,929
 Xiao Xi Lou had three sons and one daughter. 

150
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:10,950
 The youngest son, Xiao Qiu Shui, 
recently rose in the martial world. 

151
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,930
 Did I leap into my adaptation 
of "Heroes of Divine Land"? 

152
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,410
 I've become Xiao Qiu Shui, 
instead of Xiao Ming Ming? 

153
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,389
- Let's check over there. 
 - So lively.

154
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,689
Your private room is ready.

155
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,649
- Nice. 
 - Nice.

156
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:37,909
 In my adaptation, 
 Xiao Qiu Shui mastered peerless martial arts 

157
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,430
 and possessed the Boiling Blood Cocoon
when he was 20. 

158
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,509
 He is an unrivaled martial artist 

159
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,049
 in lightness skill, internal energy, 
and swordsmanship. 

160
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:48,569
 I guess my luck isn't that bad after all. 

161
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,290
 I became the protagonist 
 during his most glorious chapter. 

162
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:01,110
 What a dream come true, even if it's not real. 

163
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,909
Move aside.

164
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:04,450
Step aside.

165
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,609
Stop looking. The casino thugs 
came to kill you. What should we do?

166
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,990
- Move. 
 - Hurry. Move aside.

167
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,730
Easy.

168
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,290
I have a plan.

169
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,810
Sorry for the trouble.

170
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,509
 Let me show you the supreme lightness skill. 

171
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,629
 Swift as a bird, light as the breeze. 

172
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,330
 Something is wrong. 

173
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,749
 How's it supreme? 

174
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,229
Xiao Qiu Shui, stop there!

175
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,010
- Watch out. 
- Be careful.

176
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,250
Young Master Qiu Shui and his elder sister are here.

177
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,950
My elder sister?

178
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,160
   

179
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,590
Qiu Shui, you've caused trouble again?

180
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,690
Let's go home. Father will 
teach you a lesson. Let's go.

181
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,450
   

182
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:51,168
   

183
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:01,214
   

184
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,330
Look who is back.

185
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,800
In trouble again?

186
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,660
   

187
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,510
Raise your head.

188
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,400
Look at me.

189
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:31,470
Confess, and I might spare you the beating.

190
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,549
Now you're visiting brothels?

191
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,649
Do you even remember who you are?

192
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,549
Still drunk?

193
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,789
You stayed out drinking all night.

194
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:56,129
Don't expect anyone to plead for you 
when Father punishes you.

195
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,780
Father?

196
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,340
He's my father?

197
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,250
 In the original novel, Xiao Xi Lou 
disapproved of Xiao Qiu Shui's mischief-making. 

198
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,710
 I'd better lie low. 

199
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,410
Straighten up.

200
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,270
Ungrateful child.

201
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,230
Ungrateful child!

202
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,470
Qiu Shui. Qiu Shui.

203
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,389
F-Father, I'm sorry.

204
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,990
How strange. You're usually sharp-tongued.

205
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,929
But you apologized so fast today.

206
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:01,449
Father, Qiu Shui is just young and playful.

207
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:07,749
But he's been looking for the spies in 
North Wasteland armies as you requested.

208
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,190
Is that so?

209
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,770
In that case...

210
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:24,029
Father, you should ask him what he's discovered.

211
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,370
Well, speak up.

212
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,810
Qiu Shui, Kai Yan and I have been 
working hard these days.

213
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,130
I didn't expect you'd be idling about.

214
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,870
 You just had to speak up, huh? 

215
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,950
Let's take it slow.

216
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,670
Father, Qiu Shui has gone too far. 
He deserves some punishment.

217
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,549
 For real? 

218
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,849
 You're backstabbing me on top of that? 

219
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,109
Aren't you two my own brothers?

220
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,689
D-Do you have to add fuel to the fire?

221
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:10,269
Father asked me to discipline you. 
So, I have the authority.

222
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,230
Just as untrimmed trees grow crooked, 
untaught men remain talentless.

223
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,830
That's right.

224
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,150
Fine, prepare the family discipline now.

225
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,950
Brother Lou.

226
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,249
I'm also to blame for my son's faults.

227
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:35,630
Why don't you let me discipline my mischievous son? 
   

228
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,069
 Ming Ming, have some noodles. 

229
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,809
 Mom. 

230
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:45,310
Yi Ren.

231
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,490
- Give me the cane. 
 - Mother, let Yi Ren...

232
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,070
Yes.

233
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,349
Move aside.

234
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,349
 Mom, why did you show up here as well? 

235
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,009
 But why is Father someone else? 

236
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,809
What's so funny?

237
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:09,489
You brat, you're always causing trouble.

238
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:14,530
I'll teach you a lesson to stop your nonsense.

239
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,509
 You're really hitting me, Mom? 

240
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:20,409
Forgot your underpants?

241
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,470
Start running after this.

242
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,249
- Stop. Where are you going? 
- Mom. Be gentle.

243
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:33,730
- Stop running. 
- Please.

244
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,470
Where are you going? Stop.

245
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,570
- Stop running. I'll beat you senseless. 
- It hurts.

246
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,810
She's really hitting him?

247
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,320
   

248
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,510
Have some tea.

249
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:01,649
Mother, so this is what you mentioned earlier?

250
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:05,209
Of course. You keep upsetting your father.

251
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,430
I made these leather underpants for you.

252
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,890
This isn't ordinary leather. 
It's from a golden python.

253
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,910
Normal blades can't cut through.

254
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,010
Mother...

255
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,269
I thought I'd never see you again.

256
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:28,069
Silly child. Why are you jinxing me?

257
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,870
It's so good to see you, Mother.

258
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,409
Don't get all teary-eyed.

259
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,580
Mother.

260
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,990
What level am I at with my martial arts?

261
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,230
"Level"?

262
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,100
Like rankings.

263
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,030
The martial world has rankings, doesn't it?

264
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,789
I know I'm not the best, 
but I should make the top ten, right?

265
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,929
Are you having a fever?

266
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,589
No.

267
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,950
Ranking in the martial world?

268
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,250
Let me put it this way.

269
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,710
You're ranking fifth in this household.

270
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,370
Your father, me, Yi Ren, Kai Yan,

271
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,270
and then you.

272
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,990
But I-I thought I was gifted with rare potential.

273
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,549
True, you had great potential.

274
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:47,090
But you were too restless as a child.

275
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,489
So, your father and I didn't push you.

276
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:53,710
Instead of practicing Xiao's Swordplay, 
you created Qiu Shui Swordplay.

277
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:00,710
Did you lose a fight out there or something?

278
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,210
No.

279
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,969
Mother, how's my lightness skill?

280
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:10,990
It's always been your weakness.

281
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,110
- My internal energy? 
- Mediocre.

282
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:19,589
You're acting weird. Did you lose your memory?

283
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,889
So many questions.

284
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:27,069
This is not what I had in mind.

285
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:31,990
Mother, how far am I 
from the Power Gang's Li Chen Zhou?

286
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,649
Qiu Shui, you can joke about anything,

287
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:47,370
but remember your father's warning.

288
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,630
Never provoke the Power Gang members.

289
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:55,009
Those people dominate 
the martial world, killing at will.

290
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,950
Countless heroes have died 
by their blades for unexplained reasons.

291
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,610
You know the Nineteen Demons.

292
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,370
Every single one of them 
is a top- tier martial artist.

293
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,689
And their leader, Li Chen Zhou 
is unfathomably powerful.

294
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:19,229
Stop dreaming of instant fame 
and having unrealistic ideas.

295
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,409
Without martial prowess, 
I wouldn't dare challenge them.

296
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,129
What about Yan Kuang Tu?

297
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:31,409
Didn't he clear my meridians 
and unlock my potential?

298
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,390
You were just a kid when he vanished.

299
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,069
He hasn't shown up in the martial world for years.

300
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:44,889
It would certainly bring carnage if he resurfaced.

301
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,349
Let me do it, Mother.

302
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,670
Mother, do we have some great 
secret martial manuals?

303
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,050
Something that grants rapid improvement?

304
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,570
Never say this in front of your father.

305
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,530
You haven't even mastered 
Huanhua Swordplay yet. So forget it.

306
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,549
All right, Mother, one last question.

307
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,989
- So many questions? 
 - Please, just one more.

308
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:15,309
Is Xue Yu my biological sister?

309
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,710
Xue Yu is adopted.

310
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,560
She's had a hard life.

311
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,100
You must protect her.

312
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:25,169
I will.

313
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,910
Enough. Let's stop here.

314
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,560
I'll see your father.

315
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,029
Don't cause trouble and upset him.

316
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:34,309
All right, Mother.

317
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,709
- Eat your orange. 
 - Okay.

318
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,009
 Xiao Qiu Shui kept the setting 
from the original novel. 

319
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:52,530
 But my adaptation to Xue Yu remained. 

320
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,049
 Is this the interactive writing 
of the Demon Codex? 

321
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:02,130
 If I boost my combat stats, 
will I get back to my storyline? 

322
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,549
 Whatever. Let me have some gear first. 

323
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:12,680
   

324
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,670
 So many swords. 

325
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:29,390
 I skimmed through the novel back then. 

326
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,370
 I barely remember anything. 

327
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,029
 But I do recall the protagonist's amazing luck. 

328
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:39,409
 The martial arts manual 
Book of Oblivion that everyone desired 

329
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:41,409
 was hidden in this sword tomb. 

330
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,509
 I must find it. 

331
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,490
 But where is it? 

332
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,810
I didn't see it.

333
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:59,169
 Such a supreme manual 
 must be hidden in a secretive spot. 

334
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,430
In many martial arts novels,

335
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,430
the most powerful manuals 
are hidden in stone coffins like these.

336
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,869
Fine.

337
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,849
My apologies.

338
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:15,490
Why is it full of swords?

339
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,490
No Book of Oblivion?

340
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,140
 Welcome to the Demon Codex interactive 
writing system. 

341
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,649
Hello, dear user.

342
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,990
 You changed the character setting 
without permission. 

343
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,130
 Please start writing Heroes of Divine Land II. 

344
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,749
Demon Codex, huh? Come on out.

345
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,649
Stop hiding.

346
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:48,029
All right, let's have a proper discussion.

347
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,370
Tell me. Can't I improvise?

348
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,729
 Heroes of Divine Land is a martial arts 
masterpiece from the 1980s. 

349
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:59,810
 It's different from today's 
popular fantasy novels. 

350
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,970
 In this traditional martial arts novel, 
the protagonist is an ordinary man 

351
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,009
 who must endure hardships 
 to become a great martial artist. 

352
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,449
 Demon Codex will preserve 
the essence of the original work 

353
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,850
 and make reasonable adaptations. 

354
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,510
Oh my. Traditional martial art novels 
could use some renovation.

355
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,829
How can the protagonist survive without cheats?

356
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:25,749
Besides, life is annoying in reality.

357
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:28,549
Why should we suffer while reading, too?

358
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,549
Cat got your tongue? I'm talking to you.

359
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,570
Not talking? Fine, I'll quit and go back to work.

360
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,009
 You can't leave. You must complete the main quest. 

361
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:44,209
 Otherwise, you can't exit. 

362
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:48,009
This is how you want to play?

363
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,629
 Please start with Xiao Qiu Shui going to Zihui 

364
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:53,990
 and end with Xiao Qiu Shui 
becoming the martial circle leader. 

365
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,110
 Begin your creation. 

366
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:02,790
Wait, tell me.

367
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:08,649
This world is a mess with the Power Gang, 
the Heavenly King Zhu, and the Wastelanders.

368
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:12,449
How do I survive until next year's 
martial arts conference without cheats?

369
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:13,770
What nonsense?

370
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,029
 If you're the Huanhua Sect's leader, 
the story will unfold as you want. 

371
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,570
 Demon Codex will stop 
interfering with your creation. 

372
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,670
 Before that, beware of the minefields. 

373
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,090
 Revealing key plot points. 

374
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,489
 This pouch will constantly 
remind you of your progress. 

375
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:39,829
What if I refuse?

376
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:43,869
 Remember the Boiling Blood Cocoon? 

377
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:48,390
 It's been modified into 
a dormant poison in your hand. 

378
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,549
 If you step into the minefield, 
the Cocoon will be activated. 

379
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:57,570
 First warning, second time being lethal. 

380
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,449
You're despicable.

381
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:04,149
 Remember, this is a simple 
growth-through-suffering story. 

382
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:07,149
 Uphold justice with your martial skills. 

383
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:12,570
 Compose your own martial world stories. 

384
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,250
Are you serious? I refuse!

385
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,390
What the heck?

386
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,769
I'm sorry.

387
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,850
 In the martial world 
where the strong prey on the weak, 

388
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,689
 being a swordsman with no cheats 
 is way too dangerous. 

389
00:31:57,689 --> 00:32:00,929
 Forget next year's martial circle conference, 

390
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,250
 I may die before the Xiao family's siege. 

391
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:10,320
 It seems my only option now 

392
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,900
 is to lie low. 

393
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,860
 Don't stand out. 

394
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,140
 Survive until the finale. 

395
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:40,489
   

396
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:43,050
 Challenge the Jinyin Bank? 

397
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:46,810
 The Jinyin Bank in Zihui 
belongs to the Power Gang. 

398
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,929
 The Xiao family got massacred 
because of it in the original novel. 

399
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,910
 Challenge the Jinyin Bank? 

400
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,130
 I'm not suicidal. 

401
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,549
 I'll hide in the mountains. 

402
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:01,449
 As long as I avoid all the difficult plots, 

403
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:05,090
 no big or small demons will find me. 

404
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:20,660
   

405
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:20,750
   

406
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,980
   

407
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:55,010
 I'm still here? 

408
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,850
What's going on?

409
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:09,689
I can't get rid of this crappy system.

410
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,650
 This appearance. 

411
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:36,029
 This braid. 

412
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:41,410
 No way. It is reset? 

413
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,110
   

414
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,289
- Young Master. 
- Greetings, Young Master.

415
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:38,089
- Greetings, Young Master. 
- Greetings.

416
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,769
 So, this is what the martial world is like. 

417
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,429
 Boss. 

418
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,400
 Tang Xu, Deng Zhe, Li Chao Fan.
 

419
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,550
 They were also teleported? 

420
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,969
 Come on. 

421
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:29,969
 Boss. 

422
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:37,969
Boss, you said we were... roommates?

423
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:40,410
And the Instrument Society.

424
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,500
Is it for martial artists?

425
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,790
Qiu Shui, you've sobered up, right?

426
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,109
Boss, are you really so excited 
about seeing the dragon boats?

427
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,100
 Are you kidding me? 

428
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,620
 They look just like my friends. 

429
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,850
 Qiu Shui may not be a top martial artist, 
but has many friends. 

430
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:06,830
 They must be Xiao Qiu Shui's 
close friends from the original novel. 

431
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,009
 Why do they look 
exactly like my friends in real life? 

432
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:13,390
 What kind of bug is this? 

433
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,610
   

434
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,990
   

435
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:28,790
 I can't lie low nor escape this mess. 

436
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,990
 Since I must follow the original plot, 

437
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,890
 I guess I must stick with my buddies to survive. 

438
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,149
Seriously, Boss passed out drunk

439
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,990
at the doorstep 
and couldn't even find his own room.

440
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,269
- You should stop him from drinking. 
 - We...

441
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:47,590
- We wouldn't dare. 
 - I didn't let him drink.

442
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,809
Enough. Stop it.

443
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:09,290
Let me have some water. I'm thirsty.

444
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:15,809
Zuo Qiu, how's your grappling 
practice coming along?

445
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:22,470
Boss, why are you looking at him? 
    

446
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,929
Tang Rou.

447
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:45,650
Cheers.

448
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,360
   

449
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:58,189
Boss, I heard your father 
gave you a beating again.

450
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:01,649
Should we postpone our trip to Zihui?

451
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:08,810
Actually, I was about to discuss 
this very matter with you.

452
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:13,669
We're not going to Zihui 
for the Dragon Boat Festival.

453
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:20,569
We're going to take down the Jinyin Bank 
that preys on the vulnerable.

454
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,969
I knew Qiu Shui had bigger plans. 
Another fight is brewing.

455
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:27,790
You always think about fighting.

456
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,910
The four of us specialize in 
punishing such corrupt gangs.

457
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,490
Boss, just tell us what to do.

458
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,480
We're not fighting them this time.

459
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,380
We'll ambush them.

460
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,910
Ambush?

461
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,310
Boss, you're acting strange today.

462
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:54,410
Boss always has a plan. Let him finish.

463
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:08,730
Do you know who's behind the Jinyin Bank?

464
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:10,969
Who is it?

465
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,920
Fu Tian Yi, a Demon from the Power Gang.

466
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:25,040
