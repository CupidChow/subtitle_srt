 ♫ Let this long river boil,

5
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:23,002
 ♫ Let the torrents drench me,

00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,970

 ♫ Let this long river boil,

 ♫ Let the blade cut through the dust ♫

21
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,850
 

22
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,709
Impressive indeed.

23
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,830
My turn now.

24
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:08,589
 
Yi Ren, I won.

25
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,869
Hold out your hand. Now!

26
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,190
I agreed to this duel
thinking you'd gained some ambition.

27
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,590
Yet instead of rigorous training,
you resort to tricks.

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,870
Well, Yi Ren, don't get worked up.

29
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,389
Right now, the martial world is in turmoil.

30
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,870
In martial arts, there's always someone better.

31
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,389
Besides, isn't it a good thing
if our heir is a bit smarter?

32
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,710
I won through wits within the rules.

33
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,389
Father, Mother, even Yi Ren
must concede defeat, right?

34
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,629
Yes. Loss must be acknowledged.

35
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,550
Nonsense. How could sophistry
be the righteous path?

36
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,750
How shall we compare lightness skills next?

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,230
Whoever grabs the flower first wins.

38
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,990
Is Qiu Shui doing it on purpose?

39
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,149
He's trying to anger Yi Ren?

40
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,230
One, two, three, four.

41
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,869
What new trickery is this?

42
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,149
Qiu Shui, must all your duels
involve underhanded methods?

43
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,509
Our Xiao family's prestige
comes from genuine skills.

44
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,029
Your sophistry isn't the righteous way.

45
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,509
Where's your respect for our family rules?

46
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,110
If Qiu Shui persists, I'm afraid
Yi Ren will truly lose his temper.

47
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,430
Another punishment awaits him.

48
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,230
Relax. Hasn't Qiu Shui always
made trouble but avoided consequences?

49
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,790
A duel tests true skill. No more tricks!

50
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,350
Okay.

51
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,910
Wonderful!

52
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,389
Wonderful duel.

53
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,509
Mother's Triple Shameless Moves?

54
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,269
She taught Qiu Shui her signature move.

55
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,150
Yi Ren, watch out!

56
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,269
- Qiu Shui's reversing sword techniques?
- Isn't that reckless?

57
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,350
- Qiu Shui, are you okay?
- Qiu Shui.

58
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,389
- Did you hit your head?
- Qiu Shui.

59
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,189
Are you alright, Qiu Shui?

60
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,910
N-No, Mother. I'm fine.

61
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,029
Mother, I acted rashly earlier.

62
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,029
But Qiu Shui relies too much
on unorthodox methods.

63
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,550
If he persists, he'll suffer in the martial world.

64
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,110
I hope this lesson should steer him back
to righteous training.

65
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,030
No harm done then.

66
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:09,189
But Father, I didn't get it.

67
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,469
From now on, the Huanhua Sect's leadership token

68
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:29,110
shall be kept by Xiao Yi Ren.

69
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,350
But the heir position shall be decided later.

70
00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:01,029
Qiu Shui, you could've dodged
that strike. Why didn't you?

71
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,870
Xi Lou, how could Qiu Shui evade
that sword energy?

72
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,589
You think I wouldn't recognize
your Triple Shameless Moves?

73
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:15,034
He evaded the first two strikes.
He could've evaded the third too.

74
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,230
Qiu Shui, why didn't you evade it?

75
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,549
With Father, Mother, and everyone
behind me, how could I evade it?

76
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,829
Dueling through deceit is wrong.

77
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,550
This duel should be your loss.

78
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:42,869
But shielding others earned you a reprieve.

79
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:48,109
So, I make your brother
act as sect leader for now.

80
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:55,389
In six months, you two will face
each other again in a fair duel.

81
00:08:56,349 --> 00:09:00,069
No, Father. Six months is too long.

82
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,869
I'll...

83
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:15,230
To lead a sect, if you lack patience for
even half a year, you're unfit.

84
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,069
You just walk the path with clear conscience.

85
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:24,709
What isn't yours yet can't be rushed.

86
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:30,430
The Huanhua Sect bears all consequences.

87
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,710
Qiu Shui.

88
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,789
I was too harsh earlier. Don't hold it against me.

89
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,190
I-I won't.

90
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,710
In six months, let's duel properly.

91
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,869
Supplies are ready. Don't wait any longer.

92
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:01,390
Proceed to Guangling Villa at once.

93
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,470
- Understood.
- Guangling?

94
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,470
Yi Ren. Yi Ren!

95
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,950
Lost your sword?

96
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,430
Shattered your blade?

97
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,190
What can you use now?

98
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,350
We have fine swords in storage.

99
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,310
Choose one.

100
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,030
Father, lend me the Sword of Changge.

101
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,229
Qiu Shui.

102
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,310
Trying to push your luck?

103
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:52,109
That's the symbol of the sect leader.
Seeking power already?

104
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,909
N-No, not at all.

105
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,269
Focus on proper training. No more schemes.

106
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,310
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

107
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,029
You're tormenting him.

108
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,470
Rest well. I will check on you later.

109
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,589
Well, well. I'll fetch medicine.

110
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,389
Okay, Xue Yu.

111
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,549
You have no choice but to wait now.

112
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,509
I'll endure.

113
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,390
 Xiao Qiu Shui, you keep surprising us. 

114
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,749
 Given time, you'll surpass your father and Yi Ren. 

115
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,149
 Pity. I won't grant the Xiao family that time. 

116
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,670
Yi Ren's Huanhua Swordplay is formidable.
I must avoid direct clashes.

117
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,470
Qiu Shui.

118
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,550
Xue Yu, take a seat.

119
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,190
- Is it still hurting?
- It's fine.

120
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,029
I'm going to Guangling Villa with Yi Ren.

121
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,310
Remember to apply these ointments regularly.

122
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,469
Thank you, Xue Yu.

123
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:24,349
Yi Ren actually cares deeply about you.

124
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:26,430
When he learned I was coming,

125
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,350
though acting indifferent, he mentioned
herbs, hinting me to bring them to you.

126
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:37,590
I know he means well.

127
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,989
Oh, Mother asked me to bring gifts
from Zihui. Let me fetch them for you.

128
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:47,349
Qiu Shui, the carriage is ready outside.

129
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,749
Just give me those gifts after I return.

130
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:01,030
Why this sudden ambition to compete
with Yi Ren for family leadership?

131
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,229
Having goals is good anyway.
But don't just pay lip service.

132
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:11,430
Keep up your training discipline while I'm away.

133
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,190
Got it. Don't worry.

134
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:21,749
Qiu Shui. Among the younger generation,
Yi Ren truly stands out.

135
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,550
But don't rush yourself.

136
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,669
With more experience, our Xiao family
will have another renowned hero.

137
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,109
I understand.

138
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:40,030
By the way, Xue Yu, don't take
Kang Jie Sheng's words to heart.

139
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,710
Whatever kind of person you choose,
I'll support you.

140
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,749
He must be an upright hero
of unwavering integrity.

141
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,670
He has to be skilled in martial arts
and decisive in actions.

142
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,789
But moral character matters most.
He must be noble-hearted and righteous.

143
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,030
Good.

144
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,510
Xue Yu, your happiness should be
in your own hands.

145
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,109
No one should pressure you.

146
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,869
Alright, I get it.

147
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:11,630
Practice diligently during this period.

148
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,350
In six months, I'll join Master Qiu Shui
in roaming the martial world.

149
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:20,550
I must depart now.

150
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,669
Take care of yourself. Don't upset
our parents. Understood?

151
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,470
Xiao Qiu Shui, come out!

152
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:48,190
Yi Ren, Kai Yan? Xue Yu said you'd already left.

153
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,510
Eager to see us gone?

154
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,829
You're not even seeing us off to Guangling.

155
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:54,669
So eager to be rid of us?

156
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,590
My head feels dizzy.

157
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,230
Yi Ren's got something to tell you.

158
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:12,190
After we leave, properly care
for Father and Mother.

159
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,310
Obey them. Don't make them upset. Understood?

160
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,270
That hurts?

161
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,829
No.

162
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,589
Still resent Yi Ren?

163
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:29,229
Not really.

164
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:33,669
Rest assured. I'll take good care of them.

165
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,550
Train hard while we're away.

166
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,590
We'll have a proper duel when we return.

167
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,630
Stay out of trouble. No mischief.

168
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,390
Let's go.

169
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,469
- Be good.
- Yi Ren, Kai Yan, stay safe.

170
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,269
We will.

171
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,710
 Greetings. 

172
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:16,589
How's everything?

173
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,790
All forces near Chuanjin
have been mobilized to Jin City.

174
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,709
Awaiting your command.

175
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:25,670
Using Fu Tian Yi's vengeance as pretext,
we'll isolate the Xiaos.

176
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,069
The Sword King?

177
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,470
No movement since Purple Phoenix's ambush.

178
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:38,550
Keep alert. Stop him
from meddling with the Hero Token.

179
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,229
Understood.

180
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,778
Madam Wu has taken refuge in Sword Retreat.

181
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,869
They've noticed?

182
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:51,030
It's fine. You just
drive the Xiaos to desperation.

183
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,509
I'll breach Sword Retreat and find her myself.

184
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:57,469
Shall we inform others about your presence?

185
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:00,509
They don't know you. I fear it might disturb you.

186
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,590
They lack that capability.

187
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,430
Remember this. Show no mercy to the Xiaos.

188
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,309
Annihilate them completely.

189
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,710
Understood.

190
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:22,593
 

191
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,430
- Get me some noodles.
- Coming right up.

192
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:32,910
Some tea first, please.

193
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:36,109
Wonderful.

194
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,870
Excuse me. Where's the Huanhua Sect?

195
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,870
Oh, there? South along this road
leads to the Xiaos of the Huanhua Sect.

196
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,749
- Come take a look.
- Good.

197
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:46,949
Thank you.

198
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:49,069
Your noodles will be ready soon.

199
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:55,829
 With Tang Rou as my excuse, I can get
into the Xiaos to find the Hero Token. 

200
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,069
What's happening here?

201
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,589
It's broad daylight. What's going on?

202
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,430
What bad luck.

203
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,110
Bad luck.

204
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,150
Let me see.

205
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,950
Let me see.

206
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:20,749
Can't figure anything out.

207
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,805
Power Gang?

208
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,802
 

209
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,350
- This...
- A coffin?

210
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,150
Go take a look.

211
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,830
 

212
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,430
 Xiao Qiu Shui's sword?
The Power Gang targets the Xiaos. 

213
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,469
 
 Power Gang will attack? 

214
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,990
 They found out. 

215
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,910
Father! Mother!

216
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,590
Qiu Shui, why the panic?

217
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,670
Father, Mother, I...

218
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:25,070
The weather's fine these days,
just right for a trip to the mountains.

219
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,390
How about we go out sometime soon?
What do you think?

220
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:34,870
What are you scheming now?

221
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,150
Qiu Shui, what's going on?

222
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,830
Father.

223
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,830
Xiao Qiu Shui!

224
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,390
Sis! Sis!

225
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,430
Sis! Sis!

226
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,509
Xiao Qiu Shui, tell Tang Rou
to leave the Xiao residence immediately.

227
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:55,749
Don't drag my brother into your mess.
The Power Gang's blood coffin is here.

228
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,029
The Power Gang's blood coffins?
It means they're seeking vengeance.

229
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,230
Master Xiao.

230
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:11,110
Power Gang's blood coffins were found in Jin City.

231
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,870
The coffin contains Mr. Qiu Shui's sword.

232
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,829
- You may leave.
- Understood.

233
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,190
Wasn't that sword disposed of?

234
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,430
Qiu Shui, when did you cross the Power Gang?

235
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,870
 What can I do? I burned it. 

236
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,549
Qiu Shui, tell me everything.

237
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:03,269
- Qiu Shui killed Iron Demon Fu Tian Yi?
- Three years ago, Huizhou's Fuhu Blade

238
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,759
seized a Power Gang pawnshop.

239
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,509
Twelve people were killed overnight.

240
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,509
Heluo's Tongding Sect feuded
with them over port ownership.

241
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:17,910
Their entire clan was executed.
Bodies dumped in rivers.

242
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:23,910
Cross the Power Gang, and this is
your fate. They won't show mercy.

243
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,670
If they want revenge,
they should come for me alone.

244
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,830
What matters most now is that
everyone leaves Huanhua at once.

245
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,350
Father, Mother, I'll protect you.

246
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,456
What can you do?

247
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:50,070
Qiu Shui.

248
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:57,585
Where's your proof of collusion between
Jinyin Bank and Wastelanders?

249
00:21:57,585 --> 00:22:00,630
 

250
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,589
Father, see for yourself.

251
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,949
I've obtained evidence.

252
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:10,309
I planned to reveal it after the crisis.

253
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:18,029
Seems the rumors of Power Gang's
Wasteland ties are true.

254
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:21,670
Xi Lou, Jinyin Bank
is Fu Tian Yi's personal asset.

255
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,029
This letter alone can't prove
Power Gang's treason.

256
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:29,870
Fu Tian Yi's involvement is enough.

257
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:36,309
Qiu Shui didn't stir martial world conflicts.

258
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,762
He just eliminated a traitor
colluding with outsiders.

259
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:44,109
Why fear revenge for righteous action?

260
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:51,579
Today, my third son executed a traitor.

261
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,910
This brings honor to the Xiao family.

262
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,390
Our family bears responsibility
for any consequences.

263
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,190
You're all uninvolved in this. Please leave now.

264
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:15,749
If we survive, we'll drink together again.

265
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:17,670
Please leave.

266
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,989
Xi Lou, you play hero yourself
while telling us to flee?

267
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:25,070
You're insulting our honor.

268
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,989
I share your concerns.

269
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,749
Indeed, Xi Lou.

270
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:35,110
Our years of friendship demand
I stand with the Xiao family.

271
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,789
After drinking your tea for years,
how could I abandon you?

272
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,910
I stand with my father.

273
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,269
Master Xiao, as Qiu Shui's sworn brothers,
we won't retreat.

274
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,350
Are you crazy?

275
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,549
We swore to live and die together.
Please stay out of this.

276
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,190
Since my brother stays, I stay with him.

277
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,029
Defending the martial circle is my duty.

278
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:11,630
Master Xiao, Qiu Shui saved my life.
I'll share his fate.

279
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:18,110
Young heroes and everyone,

280
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,070
your loyalty touches me.

281
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,509
With so many warriors gathered,

282
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:31,190
even the Power Gang can be challenged.

283
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,549
Thank you all.

284
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,470
Master Xiao.

285
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,670
Outside...

286
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:03,994
 

287
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,190
Poison fog. Everyone, be careful.

288
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,989
 Plot still follows the original. 

289
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:20,350
 But I did save Tang Rou. 

290
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,789
 Does that mean I can save the Xiao family too 

291
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,349
 and save everyone from disaster? 

292
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:41,749
Formations!

293
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,070
Long have I heard,

294
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,870
the Power Gang's Nineteen Demons are all masters.

295
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,390
Since you are here in Huanhua today,
why not show yourself for a talk?

296
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,670
So I could host you properly.

297
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,509
Dead men can't play host.

298
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:32,950
 
You flatter yourself, Master Xiao.

299
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:41,110
You must be Kong Yang Qin,
the Ultimate Sword Demon.

300
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,594
I come for something from you.

301
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:47,229
Something?

302
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:51,150
Aren't you here for Fu Tian Yi,
who's colluded with the North Wasteland?

303
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:55,709
His life means nothing.

304
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:59,470
Master Xiao, give me the Hero Token.

305
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:11,230
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you. We don't have it.

306
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,229
Fine.

307
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:19,589
Then your whole family dies here.

308
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,349
Since we're in the martial world,
we'll face death bravely.

309
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,350
Good. Short lives meet bitter ends.

310
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,390
This melody shall be your requiem.

311
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,029
 I remember the siege involved 

312
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,509
 not only Kong Yang Qin and Sha Qian Deng, 

313
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,430
 but also the child-like Poison Demon
Hua Gu Fen, who's proficient in poison. 

314
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,910
 I need to locate him first. 

315
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,530
 

316
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:36,538
 

317
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,630
- Qiu Shui.
- Let him go. He's not a child anymore.

318
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:51,070
Mother, rest assured.

319
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,870
Be careful.

320
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,229
Qiu Shui, watch out for those puppet assassins.

321
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:09,990
They only know killing. Weapons won't work.

322
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:00,250
 

323
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,430
Form the sword formation!

324
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,870
Xi Lou, are you alright?

325
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,670
It's nothing.

326
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,269
Qiu Shui, are you alright?

327
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:52,749
I'm fine. What about you?

328
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:54,630
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

329
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:00,070
Attack!

330
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,709
Charge!

331
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:09,749
Charge!

332
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:13,470
Charge!

333
00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:27,870
- Xi Lou.
- Father.

334
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,670
- Are you okay, Xi Lou?
- I'm okay.

335
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,269
Fall back to Sword Retreat.

336
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,950
- Alright.
- Let's go.

337
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,670
Go.

338
00:32:57,949 --> 00:32:59,749
After them!

339
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,870
Master Xi Lou, Lady Hui Shan, how are you?

340
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,870
Hurry. Take everyone for treatment first.

341
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,590
Understood. Hurry. Follow me.

342
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,190
- Take it easy.
- Let's go. Slowly now.

343
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,630
Watch out.

344
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,069
Xi Lou, how long can we hold here?

345
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,100
Kang, rest assured.

346
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,090
When Sword Retreat was built,

347
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:36,509
we already planned that one day
when North Wastelanders come,

348
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,029
Huanhua Sect can resist them here.

349
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:44,749
It's impregnable with sufficient supplies.

350
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:51,029
We can hold out for months. Have no worries.

351
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:05,549
 Just as predicted, they've retreated
to Sword Retreat. 

352
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:15,910
Our Qiu Shui has matured.
He can handle things independently now.

353
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:21,029
Don't get arrogant. No more recklessness.

354
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,590
Father, Mother, I understand.

355
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:31,229
There's something urgent
I need to confirm with you both.

356
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:34,790
Is Madam Wu currently at our residence?

357
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,389
What are you...

358
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,630
With so many guards here,
Kong Yang Qin demanded the Hero Token.

359
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,870
Isn't that obvious?

360
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,070
Father, Mother, is Madam Wu safe now?

361
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,349
After your spotlight incident that day,

362
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:59,899
your father and I felt uneasy.

363
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:03,030
We moved her to Sword Retreat earlier.

364
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,030
She's now in Zhenmei Pavilion.

365
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,429
Seems we acted just in time.

366
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:12,150
Father, Mother, are there any
secret passages in our house

367
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,270
that could help us escape Huanhua unnoticed?

368
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:20,550
Sword Retreat is a fortress.
There are no secret passages.

369
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,150
Besides, the enemies
have surrounded us completely.

370
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,789
No way to slip through.

371
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:29,110
But don't worry too much.

372
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,870
This place is secure. Everyone's safe for now.

373
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:43,950
We planned to escort Madam Wu
to General Wu's troops in two days.

374
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,830
I'm afraid that must be postponed now.

375
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,429
Father, Mother, I can't figure out
Power Gang's plans.

376
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:57,829
They must have backup schemes.

377
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:03,029
If there are spies in Sword Retreat,
it won't be safe anymore.

378
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:10,709
Thorough thinking.

379
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:15,110
But rest assured. We've made arrangements.

380
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,150
Everyone's exhausted now.

381
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:23,750
After stabilization,
your mother and I will investigate.

382
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,829
Enough. Everyone's injured from today's battle.

383
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:32,550
Let's eat first before discussing next steps.

384
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,549
Your mother's right.

385
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,149
Come on, everyone.

386
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,950
Thank you all today.

387
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,070
- Come on.
- Thank you, Xi Lou.

388
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,910
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

389
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,229
Master Xiao, Power Gang's
surrounding Sword Retreat,

390
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:09,550
yet we're feasting inside.

391
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,350
This is...

392
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:19,269
- Emperor Taizong's army once panicked.
- Please drink.

393
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:24,389
Only General Li Ji kept calm
and commanded steadily.

394
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:28,990
That ensured Emperor Taizong's safe retreat.

395
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:36,430
Now we follow their example.
Let's maintain our heroism.

396
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,430
Pity the injured warriors missing this feast.

397
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,349
Speaking of Qiu Shui facing Power Gang today,

398
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:49,869
he showed courage and wisdom under pressure.

399
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:55,349
No wonder Master Kang
recommended him. A true young hero!

400
00:37:55,349 --> 00:38:00,670
Stop praising him. It'll go to his head.

401
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,550
You keep disciplining Qiu Shui.
You'll forge him into a master.

402
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,282
Come, Qiu Shui. A toast to you.

403
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,150
I don't deserve this.

404
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,549
Come on. Drink.

405
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:22,109
Master Zhu, I should toast
everyone's dedication to Huanhua.

406
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:28,829
I've read many chivalrous tales.

407
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,470
They always made me envious.

408
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:40,070
But I thought such heroism only existed in books.

409
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:46,150
Today you've proven real heroes exist,
risking everything for Huanhua.

410
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,882
More admirable than any book character.

411
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,629
This toast is for you all.

412
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,150
- Come on. I'll drink to what he said.
- Come on.

413
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,110
- Come on. Cheers.
- Cheers.

414
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,310
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

415
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,030
- Fine wine.
- Excellent!

416
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:13,229
- Pour me some.
- You pour it yourself.

417
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:14,470
Let's make a toast.

418
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,190
- Come on.
- Great wine!

419
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,709
Why aren't you finishing it?

420
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:19,309
- I...
- Penalty drink! I'll refill you.

421
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:21,909
- Fine wine.
- Penalty drink!

422
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:22,909
Come on, you two.

423
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:25,550
- Fill up.
- Thanks, everyone.

424
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,990
- Come on.
- We won't leave until we're drunk.

425
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,790
Come on.

426
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,470
- Fill it fuller.
- No rush.

427
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,990
- Come on.
- You're spilling it.

428
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,429
Got drunk already?

429
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,510
Cheers.

430
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,310
Come on.

431
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,229
Have more dishes.

432
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,109
Let me pour for you.

433
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:05,109
Lady Tang, a toast to you.

434
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,509
- Fang.
- What are you doing?

435
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,269
- Just eat already.
- Fine.

436
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:21,909
Fang, I thought in our Tang Sect,
only the strong preyed on the weak.

437
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:26,429
But you said you'd stay with the Xiaos
to save Jinzhong's martial circle.

438
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:28,309
That's when I realized

439
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,950
you were born with chivalry.

440
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,950
Fang, I toast you.

441
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,630
Right! We toast Lady Tang too.

442
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,430
We also toast Lady Tang.

443
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:44,310
Alright. Go drink.

444
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,349
Come on.

445
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,389
- Fish boosts brain power.
- Indeed.

446
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,910
Fish makes you smart. You should have more.

447
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,910
Come on.

448
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:01,029
 I stayed to find the Book of Oblivion.
You're just slow. 

449
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,670
Drink up! Come on, drink!

450
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,309
Cheers. Come on.

451
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:12,709
- Guys.
- Mr. Qiu Shui.

452
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:15,670
You've worked hard. I toast you all.

453
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,590
To Mr. Qiu Shui!

454
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,390
Come on.

455
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,829
- Everyone, take your seat.
- Okay.

456
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:26,829
Come on, guys.

457
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:28,030
I'll drink with you.

458
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,709
- Come on, guys.
- Come on. Let's drink!

459
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:32,269
Come on. Fill your cups.

460
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:33,950
Cheers. Refill.

461
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,750
This is living!

462
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:03,870
Please stop the bell.

463
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,470
Seems the Better-Dead Pill I gave you still works.

464
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:21,550
Thank you.

465
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,709
Rest assured. I'll never betray the gang leader.

466
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:31,950
You've been at Huanhua for years.
Now's your time to serve.

467
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:39,350
Yes, I will faithfully serve Power Gang
and never betray you.

468
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,150
Just as I thought.

469
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,190
Indeed.

470
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,229
Bad news! The woodshed's on fire!

471
00:42:48,229 --> 00:42:49,709
The woodshed's on fire?

472
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:50,869
Let's go!

473
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:51,950
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Quick!

474
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,670
- Let's go!
- Faster!

475
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,430
Wait. This is diversion.
