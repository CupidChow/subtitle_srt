1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,940
There's no way I can turn this in like this.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,100
Should I just scribble some line

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,020
and just say this is the Dream vs. Reality project?

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,180
I was dying to finish?

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,060
Why not?

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,660
If I were the professor,

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,660
I'd make you repeat the semester right away.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,980
Hey!

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,980
You're turning this in as your final piece?

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,700
Yeah... I guess?

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,500
Wow... so handsome.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,260
You really poured your soul into this huh.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,620
I mean... he does look pretty hot though.

14
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,620
But how is it Dream vs. Reality?

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,060
Feels like it's missing something.

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,420
Uh...

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,580
Well.

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,260
It's kinda complicated to explain.

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,940
It's like he's looking into himself.

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,900
And through the process of making him,

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,820
I ended up reflecting on who I am now.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,500
That's what I meant by "Dream vs. Reality".

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,740
You really are different from me.

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,380
You've got some depth.

25
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,100
Yeah totally.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,540
Shut up.

27
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,700
Alright enough, you two.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,940
Let's get back to work already.

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,700
I dressed it up with fancy words but

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,020
actually, this sculpture

31
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,060
is what my ideal type looks like.

32
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,540
The person I've dreamed of for so long.

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,780
While I'm busy chasing perfection,

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,420
in reality, I've never had a real relationship.

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,100
Maybe that's the gap between my dreams and reality.

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,900
What the!?

37
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,940
Where's my sculpture?!

38
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,540
Who are you?!
