1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,860
Huh!?

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,980
Who are you!?

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,900
Yeonwoo, I heard your sculpture's gone.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,140
What happened?

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,540
How does a sculpture even disappear?

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,820
Did you check the CCTV?

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,740
Or call the police?

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,420
I was about to start a new piece anyway.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,660
It didn't really fit the graduation project.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,580
Still, you should find out who took it.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,700
No, forget it.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,100
Don't worry about it, just do you.

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,340
Are you really the sculpture I made?

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,340
How is this even possible?

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,340
How can you even move?

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,740
Yeah, I'm the sculpture you made.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,260
You can't talk?

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,340
But you can move/

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,500
Use this, you'd be writing all day otherwise.

20
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,420
Can you answer me now?

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,860
Mind letting me put some clothes on first?

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,820
Hold on, I'll get you something to wear.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,860
Do you even know how to put that on?

24
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,820
Guess you do.

25
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,980
Put your leg through here.

26
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,740
Now answer me.

27
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,900
What exactly are you?

28
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,780
I am the sculpture you made.

29
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,300
You gave me a name once, Haon. Remember?

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,460
I'm still incomplete, so I can't speak yet.

31
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,060
I can only move at night.

32
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,820
But maybe someday, when I become fully human,

33
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,540
I'll be able to talk to you and go anywhere with you.

34
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,260
I'm back.

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,180
Dude, what's with this mess?

36
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,180
Why are you touching my stuff?

37
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,540
At least clean up after yourself if you do.

38
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,820
Hey, Baek Yeonwoo!

39
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,740
Oh, never mind.

40
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,220
Thought you were a friend.

41
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,020
Sorry about that.

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,980
Damn, he's hot.

43
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,660
Right?

44
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,420
I feel like I've seen him somewhere...

45
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,700
He looks familiar.

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,940
Totally.

47
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,180
Finally... done.

48
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,500
From now on, don't touch anything without asking first!

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,700
Wait... where'd he go again?

50
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,100
That's Yeonwoo for sure this time.

51
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,860
Hey, Yeonwoo!

52
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,860
Dude, I saw someone who looks like you.

53
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,380
He was dressed just like you.

54
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,500
Thought it was actually you.

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,460
Huh?

56
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,540
Do you know where he went?

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,580
He was heading that way earlier.

58
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,100
Thanks!

59
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,420
What was that about?

60
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,540
Come on, let's just go grab something to eat!

61
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,060
Hey!

62
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,140
You can't just wander around without my permission.

63
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,460
And with my clothes?

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,540
Come on, get inside.

65
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,300
What's taking you so long?

66
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,020
Huh?

67
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,580
Was I too harsh on him?

68
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,500
I never meant to upset you,

69
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,380
just... wanted to know what you like.

70
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,380
I just wanted to understand you better...
