1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,900
I never meant to upset you. I just... wanted to know what you like, what kind of things you're into, what you wear, what kind of views you like to see. I just wanted to understand you better... You're the one who made me. So... is it okay if I like you too?

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,180
Yeonwoo

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,380
Yeah?

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,220
That sculpture you were working on...

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,780
Did it turn into a person?

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,900
Huh?

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
How did you know?

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,780
I knew it.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,540
Actually...

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,300
The same thing happened to me once.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,100
You too?

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,620
So turning a sculpture into
a real person is actually possible?

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,260
Behind the plaster bust...

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,780
lies the secret of the sculpture.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,460
Read it and see for yourself.

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,340
To turn a sculpture into a person, one must give it all their love.
When that love is fully spent, the sculpture will finally become human. But one all love is given, the giver can never feel love again. I gave him everything, and he become human. But I no longer love him. No, I can no longer feel love at all. Why did I turn him human? Was this really the love I wanted?

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,940
Lose the ability to love?

18
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,780
I told you not to wander around.

19
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,260
You didn't come back for a while.

20
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,940
So I came to find you.

21
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,460
If I don't come back next time,

22
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,060
will you come find me again?

23
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,180
Back then...

24
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,340
my wish was to date someone perfect like you.

25
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,660
Just once in my life.

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,420
I mean, I'm not good-looking like you

27
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,300
or charming or anything.

28
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,900
I always wondered...

29
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,220
if I'd ever meet someone like you,

30
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,060
It was just something I dreamed about.

31
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,500
But now that,

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,700
you're standing right in front of me.

33
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,940
I know for sure.

34
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,100
You're just an ideal to me.

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,620
Someone I can never have in real life.

36
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,940
So to be with you

37
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,620
I'd have to lose my ability to love.

38
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,380
Guess that's how it is.

39
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,780
You and I could never be together.

40
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,900
Then...

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,380
if you can't feel love anymore,

42
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,780
I'll just love you twice as much.

43
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,820
Huh?

44
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,340
You are warm...

45
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,140
Are you becoming a human?

46
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,860
I think so.

47
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,700
When you said those words just now...

48
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,980
I could feel everything about love.

49
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,380
Not just love,

50
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:02,260
But worry, sadness, guilt, even resentment

51
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,780
and that I truly, deeply love you.

52
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,640
Yeonwoo!

53
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,580
Are you okay?

54
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,500
About what?

55
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,980
You didn't give up the sculpture?

56
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,180
Yeonwoo!

57
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,740
Oh my god...

58
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,060
So you choose love...?

59
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,020
See you around.
