00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,180
“Ashes of Love”

2
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,079
"Episode 11"

3
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,980
Hey, brothers!

4
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,460
Greetings to Lord Fire Immortal.

5
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,950
Your Highness, your
visit to this place...

6
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,160
has showered glory and
added colours around here.

7
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,960
Save your pleasantries.

8
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,160
Qiwu Palace has lost a servant.

9
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm here to look for her.

10
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,100
Did you see a very beautiful young
lady...

11
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,180
or a fairchild with grape vine?

12
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,520
- Have any of you seen her?
- No.

13
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,860
Your Highness,

14
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,040
we have never seen the person
that you're looking for.

15
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,140
This is weird.

16
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,820
Jin Mi's scent is clearly
strong around here.

17
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,240
Are all the Earth Immortals
in this area here?

18
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,860
Your Highness, an Earth Immortal
named Zhang Fude is not here yet.

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,140
Where is his area of jurisdiction?

20
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Over there.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,200
Since you've experienced "playing",

22
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,140
Now we've come to the last thing...

23
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,520
in the 4 greatest pleasures of life.

24
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,700
Let you have a taste of it.

25
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,880
This is the legendary
House of Springs.

26
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,460
Let me bring you there.

27
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,060
I'm sure you'll like it.
Let's go.

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,920
Look at these handsome men.

30
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,280
Hurry, please come in, come in.

31
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,780
Come in.

32
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,420
Receive the guests!
Receive the guests!

33
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,800
Where do you come from?

34
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,800
What is this smell? It stinks!

35
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,760
It's the scent of cosmetics.

36
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,320
Look at these girls.

37
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,360
They put cosmetics on their faces
and receive the guests.

38
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,080
Misters, do you know any girls here?

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,180
- Get us the most popular girl here!
- All right.

40
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Peony, Peachblossom, receive the guests!

41
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Peony?

42
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,040
Chief Peony is here.

43
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,280
Don't go!

44
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,380
Mister, where are you going?

45
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,460
Come back! Come back!

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
Where are you going?

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,280
If you're not fond of them,

48
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,300
we have Begonia and Daffodils too.

49
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,440
- What's the matter?
- They scared the hell out of me.

50
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,880
Didn't you hear what she say?
Mudan, Chief Peony.

51
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,100
If Chief Peony finds out,
and take me back, I'll be doomed.

52
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,220
I will be punished.

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,920
Luckily I was quick,
I ran straight away.

54
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
I was careless.

55
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,840
I forgot that you're a girl.

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,220
- My bad, my bad.
- I'm a girl...

57
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,960
Does this have anything
to do with my gender?

58
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,080
Of course it does.

59
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,620
Let me bring you somewhere else.
Let's go.

60
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,940
What is this?

61
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,160
This play is called "Dong Xian".

62
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,560
It is a story about Emperor Ai and his
favourite official, Dong Xian.

63
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,720
Let's go.

64
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,960
Mister, we're here.

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,900
What are you doing?

66
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,680
What is this place?

67
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,740
Mister, you're funny.

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,200
This is the theater.

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Ying Ge, let me take good care of you.

70
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,300
Jin Mi!

71
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
Phoenix.

72
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,720
Why are you here?

73
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,600
I know.

74
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,900
Are you here
to have some fun too?

75
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,040
Have fun? I'm looking for you.

76
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,940
Amazing, amazing.

77
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,960
What a heavenly looking man!

78
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,400
How did you know he's from the Heaven?

79
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,940
He knows you're from the Heaven.

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,140
Demon! Demon!

81
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,200
Lord Fire Immortal, are you trying to
give Jin Mi a hard time again?

82
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,700
I remember that,

83
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,300
she doesn't owe you
any magical prowess anymore.

84
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,780
I also remember I told you that,

85
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,760
if you ever dare to advance to
Qiwu Palace,

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,060
I will never let you get away with it.

87
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,300
Immortal Jin Mi is my important guest.

88
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,040
Yan You, you've always been a thief.
What now?

89
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,520
Are you trying to steal my guest too?

90
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,280
How am I supposed to take it?

91
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,300
I wonder am I the influential one,

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,920
or this little grape is
the influential one.

93
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,300
I get to see Fire Immortal and
Night Immortal...

94
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,520
two supreme immortals get together.

95
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Which show is the Night Immortal
performing tonight?

96
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,860
"The Gathering Of Heroes"?
"General and Premier Make Up"?

97
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,420
Xu Feng, leave with
Immortal Jin Mi first.

98
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,380
Yan You and I
would like to have a good talk.

99
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,680
- I...
- Come with me.

100
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,240
Phoenix, Phoenix.

101
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,140
Why have you come to the mortal word?

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,640
Are you bored?

103
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,560
That's why you've come here
to take a walk.

104
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,420
Take a walk? I...

105
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,260
Don't beat me.

106
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,200
Beat you?

107
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,020
I'd rather beat myself.

108
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,200
Fish Fairy.

109
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,400
That was quick.

110
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
I get to see 2
supreme immortals today,

111
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
I've lived a full life.

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,780
I couldn't find Jin Mi anywhere.

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,340
I didn't know that it was your trick.

114
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,020
You've put in so much effort...

115
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
in hiding Jin Mi's scent in the town.

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,540
Why is that so?

117
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,799
Jin Mi is an acquaintance of mine.

118
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,640
She was locked up,
I would definitely help her.

119
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,700
It is said that,
you live in seclusion.

120
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
Oblivious of your surroundings.

121
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,539
I didn't know that you'd be such a
warm-hearted and considerate man.

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,560
You have become her guardian,

123
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
yet I was wronged.

124
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,440
Chief Peony of Floral Realm
thought I kidnapped Jin Mi,

125
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,740
caused havoc in Qiwu Palace.

126
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,240
Do you know about it?

127
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,480
I'd never expected it to cause
such a great disturbance.

128
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,700
It's my bad to cause Chief Peony
wronged you.

129
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,480
If you really mean
to take care of Jin Mi,

130
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,980
that was a great help for me.

131
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,460
Who knows...

132
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,200
you'd even sent her to a brothel.

133
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,160
I wasn't aware that Jin Mi had gone
to the theater.

134
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,700
I was careless.

135
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,140
Chief Peony is looking for me again.

136
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,340
I mustn't let Phoenix sell me out.

137
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,660
You've been talking for a long time,
you must be thirsty.

138
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,720
I heard that,

139
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,260
the 4 greatest pleasures are eating,
drinking, playing and enjoying.

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,480
If you're thirsty,
I've brewed some osmanthus-flavored wine.

141
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,620
Would you like to give it a try?

142
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,460
Eating, drinking, playing
and enjoying?

143
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,980
Who taught you that?

144
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,400
I have come here to apologize
to Your Highness.

145
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,860
- What did you do wrong?
- I was wrong

146
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,300
I shouldn't have
hankered after wine,

147
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,660
let Yan You took
Mister Ling Guang away,

148
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,380
Brother.

149
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,700
It's said that there's a stockaded
village a thousand miles from here.

150
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
A gang of bandits lives there.

151
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Getting here is tough.

152
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,800
Why don't we enforce justice on behalf
of heaven and put an end to it.

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,920
- Good idea.
- No, no, no.

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,080
Those bandits
are the 36th generation heirs...

155
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,000
of my great grandson's children
of my mortal brothers.

156
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,100
Your Highness, please forgive me.

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I'm so thirsty, give me some water.

158
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,820
I'll be right back.

159
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Find a way!

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,980
Here, drink up.

161
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,660
Are you alright?

162
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,160
Hurry, find a way.

163
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,940
Make them drunk,

164
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,180
and help me to escape.

165
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,260
Is little bit of osmanthus-flavored wine enough?

166
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Are you kidding?

167
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,220
I stole the wine recipe
from the Wine Immortal

168
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,200
Even the Emperor wouldn't
be able to get on the boat,

169
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,920
the immortals
would fall on the cloud.

170
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,440
Don't worry, leave it to me.

171
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,360
What a righteous person.

172
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,240
Starting from tomorrow,

173
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,280
Go to Lord Lao's elixir chamber
and be a the servant who makes fire.

174
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,700
Your Highness.

175
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,280
Lord Lao's elixir chamber
is hot as an oven.

176
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm afraid of heat.

177
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm afraid,
before the elixir pill is cooked,

178
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,440
I will be cooked by then.

179
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,600
Can I have another punishment?

180
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,360
Another one?

181
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,960
Alright.

182
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,980
The Bian City Mansion
in Demon Realm...

183
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,020
still needs another soul hunter.

184
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,260
Why don't you work there
for a few years?

185
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,440
Lord Fire Immortal,
thank you for your kindness.

186
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,300
I'd rather make fire in Lord Lao's
elixir chamber.

187
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,980
Great.
Go there tomorrow.

188
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,880
Yes.

189
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,760
I was wrong, I was wrong.

190
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,820
What did you do wrong?

191
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,160
I shouldn't have taught Jin Mi
to gamble.

192
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,220
I have limited knowledge.

193
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,060
I heard something about
the 4 greatest pleasures in life.

194
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,060
But I don't know what is it.

195
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,020
I was drunk.

196
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,600
The 4 greatest pleasures in life...

197
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,540
are lyre-playing, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

198
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,660
That was a slip of the tongue.

199
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,460
In that case, We've wronged Yan You.

200
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,300
No, no, no.

201
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,420
My biggest mistake was to have brought Jin Mi
to that filthy place.

202
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,960
Supreme Immortals, great men like you
rarely stoop to pettiness.

203
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,820
Please let me off.

204
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,000
Luckily her immortal root
is still secure.

205
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,300
She wasn't polluted by
the filthy environment.

206
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,640
By the way,

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,500
you've done a great job in
brewing this wine.

208
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,680
Really?

209
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,440
If you like it,

210
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,980
I can give you the secret recipe
of brewing.

211
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,280
Deal.

212
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,260
The day when night-blooming
cereus blooms,

213
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,940
I will definitely clean my palace,

214
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,560
- wait for you to come and teach me.
- All right, deal.

215
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,760
Brother, it's been a long time,

216
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
since we last get together
and drink wine.

217
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,680
Here.

218
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,880
You're right.

219
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,380
Before, we always drank together.

220
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,360
Now that we're occupied
with the duties,

221
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,160
we rarely have a chance
to drink together.

222
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,380
Are you running out of wine?

223
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,840
I'll get you some wine.

224
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,480
Brother, you seem to
pay much attention to Jin Mi.

225
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,680
Fire Immortal, what do you mean?

226
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,020
Jin Mi is not someone
that we can hope for.

227
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm coming!

228
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,040
Today, let's drink until we're drunk.

229
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,160
Here.

230
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,700
This wine has a strong delayed effect.
Stop drinking.

231
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,600
Don't worry.

232
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
Even the mortals know,

233
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,040
a thousand glasses of wine are too
few when drinking with bosom buddies.

234
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
Here, drink up.

235
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,320
Cheers.

236
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,200
Fish Fairy, Fish Fairy.

237
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,220
- He's drunk.
- He's drunk?

238
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,900
Alright, let's drink.
Continue drinking.

239
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,900
There's no wine anymore.

240
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
You're also drunk.

241
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,180
I won't get drunk.

242
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,660
I don't get drunk even after
thousands of cups of wine.

243
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,740
Why are you still sober?

244
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,920
Phoenix.

245
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,780
Phoenix.

246
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,400
You...

247
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,740
Release me! You're vicious!

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Phoenix.

249
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,200
Who are you, little demon?

250
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,700
Phoenix, it's me.

251
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,960
Do you still remember that...

252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
you still owe me thousand years
of magical prowess.

253
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,200
If you have no objection,

254
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,760
that'd be a silent consent.

255
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,000
It is compulsory to return
things that you borrow.

256
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,980
I'll take it by myself then.

257
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,060
Darn Phoenix, he's drank so much wine,

258
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,319
yet he's still guarding
his magical prowess against me.

259
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,780
Forget it. Of all strategies,
retreat is the best.

260
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,700
Jin Mi.

261
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,280
I was going to make you
Flower Biscuits.

262
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,440
There's no need, I'm not hungry.

263
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,820
If you're not hungry,

264
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,880
should you give me the magical
prowess that you owe me?

265
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,400
- You're right, how much do I owe you?
- One thousand years.

266
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,480
Alright, come here.

267
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,720
Wait.

268
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,800
Phoenix, our prowess
contradicts each other.

269
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,420
Will giving me so much magical prowess
in such a short time harm me instead?

270
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,300
This Magic Water Pill will ease
the fire in my magical prowess.

271
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,120
That'd be great.

272
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,000
That's very kind of you.

273
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
The purity of Phoenix's
magical prowess...

274
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,060
is outstanding.

275
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,520
Phoenix.

276
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,960
Phoenix.

277
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,060
Could it be that
he wants to cultivate with me?

278
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,640
What an amazing day!

279
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,440
There are so many magical prowess
waiting for me.

280
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,900
In Fox Fairy's art book,

281
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,820
there are a lot of methods
of cultivation.

282
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,380
When in need, we'd regret for
not acquiring enough knowledge.

283
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
I should have studied them properly.

284
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,780
What did the man in theater do?

285
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,040
Ying Ge, let me take good care of you.

286
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,500
Phoenix.

287
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,080
Let me take good care of you.

288
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,480
It won't help...

289
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,800
even if you shout!

290
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,820
Phoenix.

291
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,140
Just do as I say.

292
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,220
The wind has blown us apart.

293
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,920
Separated from the heaven and earth.

294
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,940
They can't do anything to us.

295
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,100
As the moonlight
has linked our feelings.

296
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,780
This is a mistake.
These are all mistakes.

297
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,540
What's the mistake?

298
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,040
I know your feeling for me.

299
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,700
I feel the same.

300
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,940
But destiny fools people,
this is against the virtues.

301
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,940
If we insist to be together,

302
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,980
we will be punished by heaven and
perish like a smoke.

303
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,160
Just perish like a smoke then.

304
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm so sleepy.

305
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:14,320
In spite of the beautiful
natural view...

306
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,520
Why are you still being hung here?

307
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,280
Fire Immortal, are you confused?

308
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,160
None of you untied me.

309
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,980
Your Highness, when are you going
to release me?

310
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,260
Just stay here.

311
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,560
You have a beautiful girl
in your room,

312
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,820
yet you've come here
to waste your time,

313
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,280
and let out long sigh.

314
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,220
You've wasted a great gift
and a wonderful night.

315
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,220
You think everyone's a thief
when you're a thief.

316
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,220
Let me ask you.

317
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,220
Why do you still stick around Jin Mi?

318
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,500
Are you envious? Jealous? Or curious?

319
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,860
Do you wish to know the relationship
that we had?

320
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,340
If you wish to know, put me down.
I will tell you.

321
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,540
You care so much about Jin Mi.

322
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,920
Don't you want to know...

323
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,860
why she's so persistent when it comes
to magical prowess?

324
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,960
Luckily my face is fine.

325
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,960
Otherwise all the girls in six realms
will live in regret.

326
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
If you lie to me,

327
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,740
you will not have any girl
for your entire life.

328
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,700
That's a long story.

329
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,860
Rou Rou.

330
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,400
Jin Mi, run.

331
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,180
I will fight it out with you!

332
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,880
Rou Rou!

333
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,540
Look, a great immortal is here.

334
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,800
He will save you.

335
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,820
Great immortal.

336
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,080
Are you here to save my friend?

337
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,560
Don't worry. The great immortal
is going to save you, Rou Rou.

338
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,020
Your friend was hurt by
Qiong Qi's plague needles.

339
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
He also crushed her heart vessels.

340
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,520
I have limited magical prowess,
I'm afraid...

341
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,720
That's impossible.

342
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,440
Why would your magical
prowess be limited?

343
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,520
You are here to save her.

344
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,100
You will save her, right?
You must save her.

345
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,700
I can give you all my magical prowess.

346
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,860
I don't need my magical prowess.

347
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,600
I don't even need my life.

348
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,620
As long as you can save her.
I beg you, can you save her please?

349
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,060
You must never do that.

350
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,000
With your prowess,
you can hardly keep your own life,

351
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,800
not to mention saving
other people's life.

352
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,740
I don't care about my own life!
I just want to save her!

353
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,340
Great immortal, please save her!

354
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,060
Please save her!

355
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,780
You will save her, right?

356
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm here, Rou Rou.

357
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm very happy to have you by my side
by the past thousands years.

358
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,700
If...

359
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,140
If there's another life,

360
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,960
let's be friends again.

361
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,000
No way, Rou Rou.

362
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,000
You will be fine.

363
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,360
Rou Rou.

364
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,240
Rou Rou.

365
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,820
Are you okay?

366
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,980
The matter of life and death
is predestined.

367
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
If she's destined to be
an immortal,

368
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,760
your friend will cultivate and
gain a form to see you again.

369
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
That time,

370
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,600
you mustn't let her down.

371
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,860
She's always eager for
magical prowess,

372
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,600
because she wants to return my favour
as soon as she can,

373
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,340
and also wish to rescue
Succulent fairy..

374
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,780
She's stubborn.

375
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,340
She insists to pay me back
no matter what I say.

376
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,980
But,

377
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,080
that's what made her cute.

378
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,960
Otherwise I wouldn't be her friend.

379
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,880
She was attacked by plague needles,
her spirit has perished.

380
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,500
How can she revive?

381
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,720
I just made it up.

382
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,100
I just wanted to give her
the willpower...

383
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,360
to live.

384
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,280
I didn't know she had gone through
such a sad tragedy.

385
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,940
Why didn't she tell me?

386
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,820
Sometimes she seems heartless,

387
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,660
but sometimes, she's very considerate.

388
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,420
Based on my understanding,

389
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,380
she's considered you as her kin,

390
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,760
she doesn't want you to be sad.

391
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,320
All right, I won't interrupt
your night.

392
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:00,980
Good bye.

393
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,460
Fairy Jin Mi is so impassioned.

394
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,140
You're up.

395
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,360
The night breeze has made me sober.

396
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,700
I've heard your conversation.

397
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,200
Do you think...

398
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,560
what he said is true?

399
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,640
Just trust him for the moment.

400
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,780
Yan You...

401
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
isn't an ordinary man.

402
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
You're right.

403
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,240
Although 900 years ago...

404
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,620
eighty percents of Qiong Qi's power
had been sealed by Lord Doumu,

405
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,940
but he was still unbeatable with
the remaining power.

406
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,060
Yet Yan You managed to
chase him away on his own.

407
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,880
I tried to test him earlier.

408
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,020
His magical prowess is
pure and profound.

409
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,420
It's even greater than
the other 11 Zodiac Immortals.

410
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,480
I wonder where did he learn that.

411
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,940
That's odd.

412
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,780
When I was fighting with him earlier,

413
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:57,800
he surrendered himself
after a few moves.
When I was fighting with him earlier,

414
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,780
he surrendered himself
after a few moves.

415
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,360
I thought he has low cultivation.

416
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,560
Could it be that he had withheld
most of his magical prowess?

417
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,780
Could it be that...

418
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,700
he purposely withheld
his true capability?

419
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,180
He didn't hide it from
the God of Wars,

420
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,400
but he hid it from a Night Immortal.

421
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,380
That's rather strange.

422
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,020
He came to Qiwu Palace a while
back to look for Jin Mi.

423
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,960
He seemed to be familiar
with the surroundings.

424
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,340
He practices Water Spell

425
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,040
but he wasn't afraid of my
unrefined fire magical prowess.

426
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,260
Could it be him?

427
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,960
I'll go get him.

428
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,640
Don't alert the enemy.

429
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,200
Now that we know he's an immortal,
it's easier.

430
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,260
We'll wait and observe first.
See who is the mastermind.

431
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,020
We must never let
a dangerous man like him...

432
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,140
to get close to Fairy Jin Mi.

433
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,780
This is the last thing that
I can do for you.

434
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:18,860
From now on,

435
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,420
you must protect yourself.

436
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,740
Phoenix.

437
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Fish Fairy.

438
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,700
Have you slept well?

439
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,240
Very well.

440
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,320
Did the Osmanthus wine
make you suffer?

441
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,120
The wine that you brewed is rich
but not strong.

442
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
It's a great wine.

443
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Too bad I have low alcohol tolerance.

444
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,720
That's embarrassing.

445
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,300
Fairy Jin Mi, you've come at
the right time.

446
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,940
I was organising
the last match that we didn't finish.

447
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,719
The weather in this morning is good,

448
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
why don't we finish it?

449
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,020
That'd be great.

450
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,280
By the way, Fish Fairy.
Where is Phoenix?

451
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,600
Our mother's birthday is coming soon.

452
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,380
When I finished my duty
at 3 to 5 in the morning,

453
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,000
I saw Xu Feng left in a hurry.

454
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,460
I think he must have returned
to Heaven Realm to greet mother.

455
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,880
Fairy Jin Mi, your hairpin...

456
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,739
looks very unique.

457
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,540
I found it out of nowhere.

458
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,060
If you like it,

459
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,560
we are friends anyway,
I can give it to you.

460
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,760
But I think...

461
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,480
this phoenix feather looks striking.

462
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,300
It's not as elegant as
the grape vine that you used to wear.

463
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,480
You're really my confidant.

464
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,440
I think the grape vine is pretty too.

465
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,140
It's classic yet simple.

466
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,240
It doesn't catch attention,
yet it's splendorous.

467
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,560
If you like it,

468
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,940
I can give you one.

469
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,340
My pleasure.

470
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,980
Thank you for letting me win.

471
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,000
How about this?
Let me treat you to breakfast.

472
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,500
I won some yellow and
white stuffs yesterday.

473
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,020
I heard that it's very useful
in the mortal world.

474
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,320
We can use it to buy things
that we eat, wear or use.

475
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,140
We can pay to be an official,

476
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,460
we can also use it to get
a wife and kid.

477
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,560
Oh, I forgot.

478
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,680
You're already engaged.

479
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,260
Otherwise I'd get you some wives.

480
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,200
What a waste.

481
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,660
Thank you for your kind offer.

482
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,700
Breakfast sounds like a good idea.

483
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,400
just forget about
getting wives for me.

484
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,220
In the name of Grand Supreme
Lord Lao, I command you!

485
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,440
Change!

486
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,280
It works.

487
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,160
Turn into a bun. Turn into a bun.

488
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,000
Change!

489
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,200
Turn into a bun. Turn into a bun.

490
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,760
Turn into a bun!

491
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,300
It seems that the bun
has turned into a hail.

492
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,280
He's definitely startled by my spell.

493
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,640
Earth Immortal, how may I help you?

494
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,380
Greetings to Night Immortal.

495
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm going to report myself
at the mansion of Lord Lao.

496
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,340
I've come here to bid farewell to
Your Highness and Mister Ling Guang.

497
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,940
Unfortunately, Lord Fire Immortal and
Mister Ling Guang are not here.

498
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,440
And this fairy is?
