1
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,220
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,260
"Episode 5"

3
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,280
Jin Mi.

4
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,640
Jin Mi.

5
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,200
A fairy sister from
Nine Luminaries Palace...

6
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,720
told me to hand you this letter.

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,160
It's for you.

8
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,320
What?

9
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,560
Why is he so happy
while reading love letter this time?

10
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,540
If I had known earlier,

11
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,790
I'd have kept it for Sui He.

12
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,790
See.

13
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,430
How about it?

14
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
Smooth.

15
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,440
Sincere.

16
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,800
And beautifully written.

17
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,140
The only thing is
it's too long.

18
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,040
It's better to leave out some parts.

19
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Read it out.

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,830
Supreme Fairy Jin Mi,

21
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
The words are like me.

22
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,540
The letter is for me.

23
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,150
And she calls me Supreme Fairy.

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,720
The fairies nowadays...

25
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,800
have bad eyesight.

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,300
Someone's looking for Jin Mi.

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,980
You're even busier...

28
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,390
than me, the Fire Immortal.

29
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,160
Just go.

30
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,470
Here.

31
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,120
Hello, Supreme Fairy Jin Mi.

32
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,829
Hmm...

33
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,190
Hmm...

34
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
Do you agree?

35
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,240
Did you read...

36
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,630
the letter I wrote you?

37
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,420
The letter?

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,950
Yes, I did.

39
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,780
It was nicely done.

40
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,970
Genuine and sincere.

41
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,110
I'm deeply moved.

42
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,279
Really?

43
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,850
No one has ever...

44
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,640
written such a
touching letter to me.

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Thank you.

46
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,490
Here. Thanks.

47
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,159
Thank you.

48
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,830
- Thank you.
- Everybody gets 1 each.

49
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,880
Get in line.

50
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,210
Thank you.

51
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,390
There are so many rice dumplings.

52
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,840
I'll eat them one by one.

53
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,170
I'll definitely...

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,200
get the Dumpling King...

55
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
with 500 years of magical prowess.

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,270
There's only 1 year
of magical prowess?

57
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,710
But...

58
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,330
it tastes good.

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,200
It is fragrant and sticky.

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,140
Even if there's no magical prowess,

61
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,470
they're worth eating.

62
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,840
One year.

63
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,440
Seriously?

64
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
Seriously?

65
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,710
Twenty rice dumplings.

66
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,960
All with only
1 year of magical prowess.

67
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,400
This is unfair.

68
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,230
Extremely unfair!

69
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Jin Mi.

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,960
How many have you eaten?

71
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,940
Everyone has gone home.

72
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,600
Why didn't you come and
help Liao Ting and I to clean up?

73
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,190
Twenty.

74
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,550
I already ate 20 rice dumplings.

75
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,700
But each of them
only contained 1 year of prowess.

76
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,980
I was angry and stuffed.

77
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,280
Then I fell asleep.

78
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,740
I wonder
which one of them...

79
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,050
ate the Dumpling King...

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,470
with 500 years magical prowess.

81
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,980
Indeed, I haven't heard...

82
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,400
who ate it.

83
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,710
This means...

84
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,640
the Dumpling King with
500 years prowess...

85
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,690
is not yet eaten?

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,510
So where are the
remaining rice dumplings?

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,010
This is the first time
the Heaven realm makes such a thing.

88
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,260
There won't be anymore left.

89
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,830
Just give up your hope.

90
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,030
By the way,

91
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,630
the prince wants you
at Xichen Palace,

92
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,790
to practise transformation trick.

93
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
You'd better go there.

94
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,350
Could it be that the immortal who...

95
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,590
got it did not eat it?

96
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,560
Speaking of this,

97
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,200
the prince did tell me to...

98
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,440
bring one to Xichen Palace for him.

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,330
I don't know if he's eaten it or not.

100
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

101
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,159
I heard that...

102
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
you're moving to
house of marriage lately?

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,420
Says who?

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,050
You must have heard wrong.

105
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,240
You personally teach me...

106
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,850
such a powerful magical prowess.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,950
Why would I be so stupid...

108
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,480
and rely on others?

109
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Your Highness,

110
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,460
I'll get the ink ready for you.

111
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm reading today.

112
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,920
There's no need for ink.

113
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
Okay.

114
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
But it's late now,

115
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,690
I feel hungry.

116
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
Why don't you
heat up the rice dumpling...

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,670
using the spell I taught you...

118
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,470
so that I can eat it?

119
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,590
The mortals' dumplings...

120
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,360
taste really bad.

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,100
The wrapper...

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,480
smells funny.

123
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,630
And the rice inside...

124
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,190
are not the rice we normally use.

125
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
It's very soft.

126
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,710
Even if it's only a rice,

127
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,060
it has to be tough, right?

128
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,560
How can it be...

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
so soft?

130
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,490
And this is a big rice dumpling.

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,840
If you eat it at night,

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you might choke.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,270
If that's the case,

134
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,680
I'm more curious about
how it tastes.

135
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,960
Why did you say it tastes so bad.

136
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,550
Your Highness,

137
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,240
how about
I make you a flower cake?

138
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,360
It tastes a hundred times
better than the rice dumpling.

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,240
It'll melt in your mouth.
You won't choke.

140
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,700
Okay?

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,040
- Sure.
- Alright.

142
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,610
I'll make it right away.

143
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Wait for me!

144
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,330
Just one moment!

145
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,350
Dumpling King.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
Dumpling King.

147
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,220
Dumpling King.

148
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,090
Dumpling King with
500 years magical prowess...

149
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,810
is indeed extraordinary.

150
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,680
Flower cake.

151
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,790
This time,
I do have to thank the phoenix.

152
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,430
But,

153
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,680
he doesn't seem to like
flower cake very much.

154
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,740
Got it.

155
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,440
Your... Your Highness,
why are you here?

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,680
What are you doing?

157
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
Where's my flower cake?

158
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,170
But you don't like to eat flower cake.

159
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,680
Why do you want me to make it?

160
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,410
After a long thought,

161
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,030
I came up with a better gift...

162
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,980
which is 100 times
better than flower cake.

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,720
What's that?

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,520
The flower cake can satisfy my
hunger even if it tastes bad.

165
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,270
But what's the use
of a tree of flowers?

166
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,690
Leaves like phoenix's feathers.

167
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,090
Flowers like phoenix's crest.

168
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
Since you're a phoenix,

169
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,860
I'm giving you a red ebony...

170
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,120
as an appreciation gift.

171
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,340
It's also called Phoenix Flower.

172
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,450
Phoenix Flower?

173
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,510
It's said that Phoenix Flower...

174
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,800
blooms twice.

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,170
For the first time,
destiny arrives.

176
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,570
For the second time, destiny ends.

177
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,930
I've made the Phoenix Flowers here...

178
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,160
always bloom...

179
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,460
with my magical prowess.

180
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,690
Do you like...

181
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,910
the flower I give you?

182
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Destiny comes and go.
It's doomed to end.

183
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,150
While flowers are doomed
to wilt and return to earth.

184
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
So there's nothing...

185
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,990
to comment about.

186
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,340
Moon Immortal was right.

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,340
Fire Immortal is perfect,

188
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,080
except that he's unromantic.

189
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,350
You are not interested in...

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,460
these beautiful flowers...

191
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,950
nor those...

192
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,290
pretty fairies.

193
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,860
So of all the things in the world,

194
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,280
what exactly do you like?

195
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,250
You decided this on your own.

196
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,180
I haven't questioned you,
but you're questioning me already.

197
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,490
I got it.

198
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,120
The thing you like most is...

199
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,510
punishing others.

200
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,690
You...

201
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,850
Phoenix Flower?

202
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,490
Your Highness,
someone asks to see you.

203
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,720
Who?

204
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,870
A group of people.

205
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,190
Your Highness.

206
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,310
I'm Ji Du from
Nine Luminaries Palace.

207
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

208
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,370
What's the matter?

209
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm a rough fellow.

210
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,900
I came here today...

211
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,670
to ask for a marriage
with Fire Immortal.

212
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,280
Don't talk nonsense, Ji Du.

213
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
Your Highness,
princess, please don't be angry.

214
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,720
That's not what he meant.

215
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,680
He's here on behalf of Yue Bei...

216
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,480
to ask for a marriage
with Fire Immortal.

217
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,680
No, that's not the case.

218
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,190
He's here on behalf of Yue Bei...

219
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,210
to ask for the marriage with
Jin Mi who's in the prince's palace.

220
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,940
That's right.

221
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,600
A marriage with Jin Mi.

222
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,120
I didn't think that...

223
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,780
Jin Mi is good with girls.

224
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,180
Tell me.
What's the matter?

225
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,110
Judging from your appearance,
you're Jin Mi, right?

226
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,150
I heard that Yue Bei was...

227
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,320
disrespectful to you yesterday
outside Qi Wu Palace.

228
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,880
We from the Nine Luminaries Palace
dare to admit our mistakes.

229
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,230
These are the wedding gifts.

230
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,800
I think tthere's no need to
choose for an auspicious day.

231
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,310
Come with me...

232
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,840
to marry Yue Bei today.

233
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,360
Treated disrespectfully?

234
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,620
It was just...

235
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,070
a kiss on my cheek.

236
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,160
It's okay.

237
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,280
Doesn't matter.

238
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm afraid I have to refuse it.

239
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,450
Jin Mi...

240
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,530
can't marry Yue Bei.

241
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,070
Why so?

242
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,660
Do you dislike Yue Bei?

243
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,180
Why don't you ask...

244
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,790
Jin Mi's opinion first, Your Highness?

245
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Jin Mi,

246
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,290
do you like Yue Bei?

247
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,970
If both of you like each other,

248
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,050
just let us know.

249
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,040
Ji Du and I
will help you.

250
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you...

251
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,430
Do you like her...

252
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
or not?

253
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,640
We're friends.

254
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Of course I like her.

255
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,310
- But...
- Your Highness,

256
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,660
since Jin Mi said so,

257
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,290
we can set the marriage now.

258
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,430
Why would we separate the lovebirds?

259
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,190
Relax, Ji Du.

260
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
I didn't mean to stop you.

261
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,990
In fact, it's Jin Mi...

262
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,240
who is not capable of doing so.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,680
As the saying goes...

264
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,070
a natural couple...

265
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,020
is formed by a man and a woman.

266
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,520
Jin Mi is also a girl,

267
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,800
of course she can't marry Yue Bei.

268
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,120
How is that possible?

269
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,850
She was supressed by the
Prowess Supress Hairpin.

270
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,740
So it's normal for you and Yue Bei...

271
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,360
to mistake her for a man.

272
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,220
How did he know
this is a Prowess Supress Hairpin?

273
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,450
Not even I know that.

274
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,280
Jin Mi is my attendant.

275
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,200
Things are easier...

276
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,750
if she dresses as a man.

277
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,530
It is also my fault...

278
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,210
that the misunderstanding occurred.

279
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,470
Please don't be angry at me.

280
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
Jin Mi,

281
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,420
Your Highness,
sorry for disturbing you.

283
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,240
Let's go.

284
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Come on.

285
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
Hurry up.

286
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,820
Come here.

287
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,160
See what I've got for you.

288
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,460
What are these?

289
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,330
Xu Feng is so lucky.

290
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,550
He got a...

291
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,500
pretty girl
with just a random pick.

292
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,180
It was I who picked him.

293
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
That doesn't matter.
It's almost the same.

294
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,880
Anyway, both of you are one.

295
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,520
You're a grape elf,

296
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,910
so I purposely...

297
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,680
prepared this for you.

298
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,930
How? Do you like it?

299
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,050
- Get changed and let me see.
- No, I don't like it.

300
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,160
Not nice at all.

301
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,160
Are you questioning
my sense of beauty?

302
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,710
Not nice?

303
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,090
Impossible.

304
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,860
I mean, no way...

305
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,130
it's not nice.

306
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,190
The Moon Immortal's sense of beauty...

307
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,960
is of course good.

308
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
It's good.

309
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
A little girl
should look like a little girl.

310
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
If you don't like the purple one,

311
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,720
here, change into the red one.

312
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,880
Nice?

313
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,010
Yeah.

314
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,040
Nice.

315
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,810
It's her.

316
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
She... she's back.

317
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,160
I've always been here.

318
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,730
You look familiar,

319
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,040
but I can't remember...

320
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
Forget it.

321
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,540
As expected from Xu Feng's partner.

322
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,000
Red does suit you.

323
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,160
It just matches perfectly.

324
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,930
When Xu Feng sees this,

325
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
he'll be happy for sure.

326
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
If he's happy,

327
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,780
he'll be more kind to you.

328
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,460
People spare no effort to learn.

329
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
You fit perfectly...

330
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,700
to this saying.

331
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,640
They say you're very talented,

332
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
but who knows...

333
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
the effort you put in.

334
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,730
The annotations in the book...

335
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,420
are more detailed than the text.

336
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
I'm really impressed.

337
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,670
These aren't for me.

338
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,360
I wrote the annotations...

339
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,310
for that lazy Jin Mi.

340
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,590
If only she was thoughtful
and studious as you.

341
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,430
Then I don't have to worry so much.

342
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,060
Your Highness. Princess.

343
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,730
Why are you here?

344
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,520
There is a lot to do in Qi Wu Palace.

345
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,030
Instead of helping
Liao Ting and Fei Xu with the jobs,

346
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,970
you are attracting attention
in these clothes.

347
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
How can you do this?

348
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,880
Attract attention?

349
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,600
So, we share the same thought.

350
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,030
I think this is
attracting attention too.

351
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,510
It's really like attracting attention.

352
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,150
But I couldn't recall...

353
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,950
what do I look like dressed in this.

354
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,300
Now that I've seen you two,

355
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,660
it suddenly occurs to me that...

356
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,310
I look like...

357
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,900
a kind of bird in your tribe
very much, princess.

358
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,810
What is it called again?

359
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,560
It's very ugly,

360
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,950
with white spots
spread on its red feathers.

361
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,360
It's called...

362
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,560
crimson-bellied chicken!

363
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,080
That's right! That ugly chicken!

364
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,680
It's so ugly.

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,960
But there's nothing I can do.

366
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,030
The Moon Immortal made me wear this.

367
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,140
I've to follow what he
says as I'm younger.

368
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,050
Pity me.

369
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm a decent grape elf,

370
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,270
but now I have to
be a silly...

371
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,870
and strutting chicken for once.

372
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,360
- You...
- Sui He,

373
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm busy today.

374
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
I will talk to you
about spells another day.

375
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,570
Why are you standing there?

376
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,800
As an attendant,
you're really insensitive to your job.

377
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,970
Let's go.

378
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,450
Why do I feel like the
princess is angry?

379
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,110
The crimson-bellied chickens
and peacocks...

380
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,350
are of the same ancestry.

381
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
Sui He is related to them.

382
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
She's one who save face.

383
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,800
Why did you speak so carelessly?

384
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,690
Reflect on your mistakes
when we're back.

385
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,680
How many vermilion bird eggs
have you eaten?

386
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,520
Your nose bleeds so much.

387
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,130
Jin Mi,

388
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
Your appearance surely...

389
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,820
attracts others' attention.

390
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,750
This is what I do.

391
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,810
It's how it should be.
It's how it should be.

392
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,450
You're really shameless.

393
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,440
Why should I be embarrassed?

394
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,290
As flowers and fruits,

395
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,900
of course we have to attract
bees and butterflies.

396
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,830
If there is no bees or butterflies
to help in flowers' pollination,

397
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,130
how do we get fruits?

398
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,700
Without fruits,

399
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,160
there's no grape.

400
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,200
Being stupid is not your fault.

401
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,270
But being stupid
while looking so attractive...

402
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,870
is definitely your fault.

403
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,520
Your Highness.

404
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,150
What happened to your face?

405
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,490
Who bullied you?

406
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,540
Your Highness,

407
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
I wasnâ€™t bullied.

408
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,570
Maybe because it's too hot...

409
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,480
that there's too much heat in my body.

410
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,840
Go wash your face.

411
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Then recite the
heat-clearing chant.

412
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
You'll cool down when you're calm.

413
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Go.

414
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
Yes.

415
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,300
Hang on.

416
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
It's better if you use
the grape vine hairpin.

417
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,560
Why?

418
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,340
You don't want to?

419
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,040
I... I didn't mean to be
better looking than you.

420
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,380
It was just a coincidence.

421
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,620
Coincidence.

422
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,100
What did you say?

423
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I understand that.

424
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,690
I dressed like a man,

425
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,770
and Yue Bei...

426
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
wanted to marry me...

427
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,770
instead of you.

428
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,970
That's why...

429
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,580
you're unhappy.

430
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
But don't worry.

431
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,000
I will be more careful next time.
I will.

432
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,410
You heartless girl.

433
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,780
Alright.

434
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,040
I'll just be more careful.

435
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,600
You...

436
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,050
are more obedient to my uncle
compared to me, his nephew.

437
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,790
You changed your clothes when the
Moon Immortal told you to.

438
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,680
Why aren't you...

439
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,390
so obedient on other days?

440
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,280
Red does suit you.

441
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,120
When Xu Feng sees this,

442
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,560
he'll be happy for sure.

443
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,080
If he's happy,

444
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,880
he'll be more kind to you.

445
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Of course it's not because of
the Moon Immortal.

446
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,020
I did this for the spi...

447
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,420
I did this for you.

448
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,550
Look at me,

449
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,960
are you happy?

450
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,210
You're not answering my question.

451
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,760
I'll just ask you.

452
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,080
Do you feel happy...

453
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,410
when you see me...

454
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,560
dressed like this?

455
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,560
I see.

456
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,280
She did this for me.

457
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,780
Is she...

458
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,640
Is she into me?

459
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,640
Moon Immortal is indeed calculating.

460
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,930
Dressing like a chicken
actually has its use.

461
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
The phoenix's taste is really...

462
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,520
Never mind.
I made him happy,

463
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,200
so what if I have to
sacrifice a little?

464
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,550
Maybe when he gets happier,

465
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
he'll give me
some magical prowess.

466
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,320
By the way,

467
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,040
uncle told me to tell you...

468
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,790
in even days, in the morning,

469
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,500
there will be a show at
house of marriage.

470
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,090
Go take a look if you have time.

471
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760
Really? That's great!

472
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,360
I love watching opera.

473
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
If you have nothing to do,

474
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
concentrate on your practice.

475
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,480
Don't do wandering around.

476
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,720
Okay. So are you going
to the show by then?

477
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,270
By asking this,

478
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,590
do you want me to go...

479
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,150
or do you not want me to go?

480
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,560
- I don't want you to go.
- Why?

481
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,840
If you do,

482
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,540
you'll be surrounded by...

483
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,280
the female fairies.

484
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,420
Then,

485
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,150
I wouldn't be able to get a good seat.

486
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,760
Is she...

487
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,400
being jealous?

488
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,210
He's really afraid that
I'll steal the fairies away.

489
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,770
Foolish bird.

490
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,490
What would I want those fairies for?

491
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,830
It's better if you give
me some magical prowess.

492
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Follow me.

493
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,970
Open all the cabinets,

494
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,290
and clean them.

495
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,340
Doesn't he have hands?

496
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,880
Your Highness,
what treasure is this?

497
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,570
This is the tooth of Tao Wu.

498
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,150
This is my precious collection.

499
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,600
Be careful.

500
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,400
Clean it.

501
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,770
Then put it back.

502
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,790
What about this?

503
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
This is the rib of Gu Diao.

504
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,280
The beast resembles a bird.

505
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,590
It fed on mortals,

506
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,300
and looked like a bird with horns.

507
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,880
It had a baby's cry,

508
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,340
and had killed countless people.

509
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,680
But...

510
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,800
it was easily subdued by me.

511
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,200
Did he purposely tell me this?

512
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,830
These are Hun Dun's head and tail.

513
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,270
This is the tail of Chu Huai.

514
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,080
This is...

515
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,640
one of the 9 brains of Jiu Ying.

516
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,490
All of these were...

517
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,450
feracious beasts that
harmed the six realms.

518
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,980
But they're now my trophy.

519
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Look around.

520
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,800
If there's anything you like,

521
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,070
I can give it to you...

522
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,800
as a decoration.

523
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
But if it's the heads...

524
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,460
of the ancient beasts that you want,

525
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,320
I can think about it depending on...

526
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,590
your performance.

527
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,760
No need.

528
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
You're indeed the god of war,
Your Highness.

529
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Amazing.

530
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Awesome.

531
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
The cabinets are almost full.

532
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,730
I'll need a new one.

533
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,120
This works.

534
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,740
When she's looking at
my great achievements,

535
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
her eyes are shining...

536
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,080
with admiration.

537
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,440
He is clearly warning me.

538
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,300
Such a narrow-minded bird.

539
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,880
How did I offend him?

540
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,960
Why is he scaring me?

541
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,800
Is it Jin Mi?

542
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,760
The little girl
brought up by Xu Feng...

543
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,720
has changed a lot.

544
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,810
You've become prettier as time passes.

545
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,940
He's really narrow-minded.

546
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,020
He is afraid that...

547
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,910
I'll steal his title of "The Most
Handsome Guy in Six Realm".

548
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,100
In case there's misunderstanding,

549
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,440
I've kept my grape vine
in magic-repressing bag.

550
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Xu Feng is the best in six realms.

551
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,320
And Jin Mi,

552
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,710
you're extraordinarily beautiful.

553
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,320
You and Xu Feng...
make the perfect match.

554
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,640
Moon Immortal,

555
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,220
you're getting slimmer.

556
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,060
Seems like your diet works.

557
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,880
Congratulations.

558
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,820
Was I very fat?

559
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah.

560
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,170
It was bird tribe's fault.

561
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,440
Lately, the chickens they provide...

562
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,180
are even smaller than a pigeon.

563
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,570
They were terrifyingly thin...

564
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,780
that I couldn't get enough
food everyday.

565
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,880
I even wake up at night due to hunger.

566
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,770
Could it be plague caused by chickens?

567
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,910
No.

568
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,370
This is a long story.

569
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,840
They ought to know
who they're bullying.

570
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,210
The Flora realm is biting
off more than they can chew.

571
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,680
They even
go against the bird tribe now.

572
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,120
Aunt, don't be angry.

573
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,960
And you.

574
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,040
Why are you
only telling me now?

575
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,240
You're the mighty
princess of bird tribe.

576
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,570
The leader of the tribe.

577
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,940
Chief Zhang is nothing.

578
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,240
She's just temporarily
taking charge...

579
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,630
of the Flora realm for Flora Immortal.

580
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Who is she to
tell us what to do?

581
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,990
I thought this was a small matter.

582
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,120
Morover, the prince went missing...

583
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,480
and Demon realm was advancing.

584
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
I didn't wish to argue with her.

585
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,350
That was why I yielded.

586
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,080
When I returned home,

587
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,590
I interrogated everyone in the tribe.

588
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,230
No one did what she mentioned.

589
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,720
But unexpectedly,
Chief Zhang won't let this go.

590
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,200
She insisted that...

591
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,920
a bird took away...
an elf from Flora realm.

592
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,920
Why is the elf...

593
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,480
so important?

594
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,190
I find it strange too.

595
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,120
But I couldn't trace
the flower elf.

596
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Yet she said I tried to cover up
for my subordinate and got mad.

597
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,990
She even gave out Luoying order...

598
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,030
and started
to not provide us with food.

599
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,530
She said if the bird tribe
doesn't hand over the elf,

600
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,940
Flora realm will never
provide us food.

601
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,340
How dare she!

602
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,610
Besides worms,

603
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,280
our main food...

604
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,890
is flora and grains,

605
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,120
and also seeds.

606
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,550
Aren't they...

607
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,560
going against us by doing this?

608
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,860
The newly borns...

609
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,860
are looking very thin.

610
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,080
I do pity them.

611
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,400
That's why I'm here to
ask for your help, aunt.

612
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,130
The Flora realm is so arrogant...

613
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,360
because the Heavenly Emperor
is being soft with them.

614
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,510
But we...

615
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,640
can't lower ourselves to beg them.

616
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,370
Pass my order.

617
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,180
Open up the
8 granaries of Heaven realm.

618
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Yes.

619
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,560
As for that flower elf,

620
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
there must be something
mysterious about her.

621
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,560
Tell someone to check it out secretly.

622
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,050
Find out who she is,

623
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,920
and keep me up to date.

624
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,080
Yes.

625
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,140
As fox,

626
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,040
we can't live without chickens.

627
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,000
They were originally
provided by bird tribe.

628
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,260
But now,

629
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,650
we're running out of food.

630
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,780
The chickens who are able to
grow into the size of a pigeon...

631
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,270
had struggled a lot.

632
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,480
This is tortuous. How tortuous.

633
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,160
I wonder which unlucky
flower elf that is.

634
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,720
If I were still in Flora realm,

635
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,310
I'll persuade Chief Zhang...

636
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,630
to never stop...

637
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,710
providing them food,

638
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,850
but substitute all...

639
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,080
with croton.

640
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,320
Hey you,
why did you barge in?

641
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,590
I told you, my master
is having a guest today.

642
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,360
Mr. Hu.

643
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,530
She is...

644
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,340
More?

645
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,740
No.

646
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,160
Hong Hong,

647
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,680
I am terrified.

648
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,080
Do you know what did I
run into just now?

649
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,540
Is it the jade rabbit
from Guanghan Palace?

650
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,600
It is.

651
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,770
I've never seen
that rabbit for thousands of years.

652
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,360
It has become a lot fatter.

653
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,130
How many carrots do
you think it ate...

654
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,850
to grow into how it is now?

655
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,200
I wonder what
is it that...

656
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,690
brings you here...

657
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,840
to experience such suffering.

658
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,600
Let's not talk about it.

659
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm so unlucky today.

660
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,410
Chief Zhang chased me
out of Flora realm.

661
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,970
After a long thought,

662
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,760
I think it's better to...

663
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,240
come to your place.

664
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,680
Why did she chase you out?

665
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,110
This is...

666
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,440
It's me.

667
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,670
Little grape.

668
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,220
Little one?

669
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,780
Oh my girl,

670
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,680
I found you at last.

671
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,670
You've troubled me a lot.

672
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

673
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,950
My carrot skin...

674
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,520
was almost peeled by the chiefs...

675
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,690
because of you.

676
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,920
They even
accused me of...

677
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,570
failing in protecting you,

678
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,560
and ordered me to look
for you immediately.

679
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,680
If I couldn't find you,

680
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,910
they'll throw me
into a rabbit's nest.

681
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,600
This is great.

682
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,280
I finally found you.

683
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,700
I didn't think that...

684
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,140
Chief Zhang who was always
strict with me...

685
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,520
has left me...

686
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,040
an important place in her heart.

687
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,650
Hurry up, go back with me.

688
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,420
I'm finally safe.

689
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,650
Wait a moment.

690
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,920
Where are you...

691
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,160
taking my nephew's wife to?

692
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,560
Your nephew's wife?

693
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,130
Little one,

694
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,480
are you...

695
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,800
wrongly matched...

696
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,730
by this bad-sighted fox?

697
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,840
His nephew...

698
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
looks like he'll have a lot of lovers.

699
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,800
He'd have at least 8 wives
if not 10 in the future.

700
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,620
How can you
And his nephew...

701
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,840
You... you...

702
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,460
Let's look for Supreme Lord Tao...

703
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,990
and borrow his sword...

704
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,790
to cut off the matching red line.

705
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,210
What're you talking about?

706
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,320
I'm here to learn from the phoenix.

707
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,760
Really?

708
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,120
That's better.

709
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,360
But you should go back now.

710
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,800
Otherwise there'll be a chaos.

711
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,780
Either the bird tribe...

712
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,650
or the Flora realm will extinct.

713
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,920
Let's go back...

714
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,080
and report to Chief Zhang.

715
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Mr. Hu,

716
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,080
Xu Feng is still training
the soldiers.

717
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,380
Why not wait for him to...

718
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,760
We've no time for that.

719
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,239
Come on, let's go.

720
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,730
Wait for me!

721
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,840
- Mr. Hu.
- Hurry up.

722
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,060
Slow down. Relax.

723
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,760
- You...
- Relax.

724
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,480
- Jin Mi.
- Fox fairy.

725
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,840
Hong Hong,

726
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,159
don't cause any more trouble.

727
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,280
We're running out of time.
If this is delayed,

728
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,850
Flora realm will be going into

729
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,280
a war with bird tribe.

730
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,830
Wait a second.

731
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,400
Could the lost flower elf
be Jin Mi?

732
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,290
That's it.

733
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,140
A... A... Am I not...

734
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,330
a grape elf?

735
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,690
Flower elf or grape elf,

736
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,750
what's the difference?

737
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,040
You're still elf, anyway.

738
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,240
Do you know that...

739
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,930
when Chief Zhang learnt that...

740
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,400
you were taken away by a big bird,

741
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,810
she was extremely furious?

742
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,160
Come on, go home with me.

743
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Hang on.

744
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,400
What's so special about Jin Mi?

745
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,560
Why does Chief Zhang treat
her so differently?

746
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,090
I've never heard that...

747
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,080
she has a child.

748
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,400
Is Chief Zhang saving Jin Mi...

749
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,880
for another man?

750
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Hong Hong,
don't talk nonsense.

751
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,780
Jin Mi...

752
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,670
was brought up by Chief Zhang.

753
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,110
Of course she cares about her.

754
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,130
Won't you help
your neighbour...

755
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,570
to find her lost child?

756
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,070
Somehow, I think that
something is fishy here.

757
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,800
That's why, you can't
just take Jin Mi away.

758
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,830
I didn't expect
I'm still quite important...

759
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,350
in Chief Zhang's heart.

760
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,520
Hong Hong,

761
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,990
don't you old man mind...

762
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,480
the matter of...

763
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,700
Flora realm.

764
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,290
Who's old now?

765
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
Look into the mirror.

766
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,520
All these years,

767
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,320
my skin is better
taken care of than yours.

768
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,730
Mr. Hu.

769
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,040
Let me ask you.
If I follow you back now,

770
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,020
will Chief Zhang
peel my grape skin off?

771
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,180
She'll punish you for sure.

772
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,580
It suddenly occurs to me that...

773
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,240
there's something
I haven't completed...

774
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,440
in Heaven realm.

775
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,480
I'm going back that way.

776
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,920
- Bye, Mr. Hu.
- Come back here.

777
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
Little one,

778
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,530
you'd better think carefully.

779
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Are you going back
with me now...

780
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,680
or do you want...

781
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Chief Zhang...

782
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,440
to come find you in her anger?

783
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,570
Be wise.

784
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,900
I'd better leave with you now.

785
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,800
Fox fairy,

786
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,960
I caused this,

787
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,590
so I must go back.

788
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
But worry not.

789
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,990
After apologising,
I'll be back in no time.

790
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,940
Help me keep an eye on
the Golden Daluo Immortal.

791
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,230
But you're Xu Feng's attendant.

792
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,550
No matter what,

793
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,390
you have to wait for Xu Feng
to return from the training...

794
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,560
and bid him
good bye in a decent way.

795
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,460
There's no time for that.

796
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,530
Mr. Hu.

797
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,160
Xu Feng has never...

798
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,800
mistreated Jin Mi.

799
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,560
So the courtesy...

800
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,890
must be followed.

801
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,290
Forget it.

802
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
We're running out of time.

803
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,850
Let's go.

804
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,960
Rou Rou!

805
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,330
Why are you standing there? Run!

806
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,880
I'm going to avenge Rou Rou!

807
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,060
Jin Mi.

808
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,300
Little one, you...

809
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,990
- Run.
- Fish Fairy.

810
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,690
Fish Fairy.

811
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,850
I'll help you.

812
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,000
Jin Mi.
