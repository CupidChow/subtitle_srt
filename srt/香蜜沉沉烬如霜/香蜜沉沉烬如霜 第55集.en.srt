4
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,120
There is really someone
trespassing the Cave of Jiu Ying.


5
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,700
Go and report to Princess Sui He.


6
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,300
OK.


7
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,320
Little one, let me see where you are.


8
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,760
Let me see where you are.


9
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
Little one.


10
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
Don't sway. Don't sway.


11
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,140
You are making me dizzy.


12
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,900
Let me see where you are now.


13
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,020
Don’ sway your hands.


14
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,000
Little one, you are so clever


15
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,480
that you make me help you in this way.


16
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
Mr. Hu,


17
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
this underground palace is so big.


18
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,200
Where is the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying?


19
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,460
The Internal Dan of Jiu Ying


20
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,900
is in the Cave of Jiu Ying,


21
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,600
which is the innermost part
of the underground palace.


22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,280
Yes.


23
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,860
That’s the right path.


24
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,060
Go along this path.


25
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,360
Go straight to the inside.


26
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,160
Move along.


27
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,160
Move along. Move along.


28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,900
Move along. Move along. Move along.


29
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,840
Move along. Move along.


30
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
You are at the door now, right?


31
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,180
That’s the door.


32
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,160
Outside the door is the ward.


33
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,960
The fire of supreme yang


34
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,600
or the water of supreme yin can break it.


35
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,220
Little one,


36
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,100
you have only one hour.


37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,220
Hurry up.


38
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,160
Otherwise, you will be in danger.


39
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,180
It’s here.


40
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,420
The Internal Dan of Jiu Ying is in the cave.


41
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,220
Open it.


42
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,720
OK.


43
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,260
Little one, time is running out.


44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,100
Little one.


45
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,659
Break the ward.


46
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,460
OK.


47
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,120
I guessed you would come here
to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying


48
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
in order to save Yan You.


49
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,340
Jin Mi,


50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,340
Today, I will


51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,180
let you die here.


52
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,000
My Lord,


53
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,440
the soldiers reported


54
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,500
they saw Water Immortal and Princess Sui He


55
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,920
enter the underground palace one after another.


56
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,460
Little one.


57
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,420
Hurry. Let me check.


58
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,980
The Wall of Jiu Ying.


59
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,460
That's it.


60
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,180
It has nine eyes.


61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,100
That red one is the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying.


62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
Take the Internal Dan before it wakes up.


63
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,200
Otherwise, you will be in danger.


64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Got it.


65
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,659
Red...


66
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,940
Which one is red?


67
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,620
What?


68
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
You can't even tell which one is red?


69
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't piss me off. OK?


70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,820
You have only one chance.


71
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,040
You must get the real Internal Dan.


72
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,680
Otherwise,


73
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,640
you will be swallowed up by the soul of Jiu Ying.


74
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,900
Hurry up.


75
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,860
Time is almost up.


76
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
I know,


77
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,540
but I don't know which one is red.


78
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,700
Let me check for you. Let me check for you.


79
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,600
Mr. Hu,


80
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,340
check which eye is red for me.


81
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,820
I was dazzled


82
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,700
by a shiny thing just now.


83
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
I can't see anything clearly now.


84
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,320
What?


85
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Dear, I have been trapped here
for thousands of years.


86
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,780
Please help me out.


87
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,700
Another one who wants to take my Internal Dan?


88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,060
You are bringing about your own destruction.


89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,920
Why are there always some daredevil people?


90
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,940
You have one. I have one.


91
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,940
Guess where the Internal Dan is?


92
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,700
Little one,


93
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,740
Jiu Ying has been awake.


94
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,900
Get out immediately.


95
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
Jin Mi, get out.


96
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
Get out immediately.


97
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,700
The Internal Dan is its vital part.


98
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,400
When in danger,


99
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,020
its reaction must be the most obvious.


100
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,420
I found it.


101
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
No one can take away my Internal Dan.


102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,920
How do you know


103
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,800
that the green one is my real Internal Dan?


104
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,320
Shut up!


105
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,820
The green one is not my Internal Dan.


106
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,180
Everyone knows that the red one is my Internal Dan.


107
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,320
If you take the wrong one,


108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,920
you will be inhaled to my soul


109
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,600
and become one part of me.


110
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,740
Are you really going to take the risk?


111
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Are you really going to take the risk?


112
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,900
Are you really going to take the risk?


113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,980
Are you really going to take the risk?


114
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,920
Are you really going to take the risk?


115
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,820
Are you really going to take the risk?


116
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,660
Are you really going to take the risk?


117
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Are you really going to take the risk?


118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,540
Are you really going to take the risk?


119
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,240
Mr. Hu,


120
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,480
did you see it?


121
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I found it.


122
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,940
It’s the red Internal Dan.


123
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,060
Red?


124
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,060
Is it true that


125
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,460
I have become color-blinded?


126
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,780
I will talk with you later.


127
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
It is a surprise that you got it.


128
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,620
It seems that I underestimated your ability.


129
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,860
What are you doing here?


130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,940
Give me the Internal Dan, right now.


131
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,440
What do you want it for?


132
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
I won’t let you get the things


133
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,840
you want.


134
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,560
OK.


135
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,040
I’ll give it to you.


136
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,960
Take it.


137
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,220
Sui He, get out of my way.


138
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,620
Good birds never stand in the way.


139
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,820
I’ll take this chance to kill her


140
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
and remove the cause of future troubles.


141
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,940
How come you can use Glazed Pure Fire?


142
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,980
Auntie.


143
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,420
I have given you all of my power.


144
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,980
With Glazed Pure Fire,


145
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,820
you must revive Bird Family


146
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,660
and help my son, Xu Feng
to become Heavenly Emperor.


147
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,100
It’s worthwhile for me to have
curried favour with you for so many years.


148
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Now I have so much magic power.


149
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,440
I wonder who dares to stand in my way.


150
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,220
Tell me.


151
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,780
Did you,


152
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,900
Did you kill my daddy?


153
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,820
Yes, I did. So what?


154
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,480
I also know that Xu Feng was saved by you.


155
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,400
But now he thinks it’s me who saved him.


156
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,840
Jin Mi,


157
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,860
it’s impossible for you and Xu Feng
to be together again.


158
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,100
Today


159
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,820
I’ll take revenge for my daddy and auntie Lin Xiu.


160
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,300
It’s her.


161
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,400
It’s her who killed my daddy.


162
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,420
My Lord, help me.


163
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,560
Little one.


164
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,600
What the hell is this?


165
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,040
It’s as unreliable as Honghong at critical moment.


166
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,340
Your Majesty.


167
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,160
Why do you look so flurried?


168
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,880
Where is Mi?


169
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,500
Little one has gone to the
underground palace of Demon Realm.


170
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,520
After she took the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,


171
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,680
I lost contact with her suddenly.


172
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
I don’t know what’s going on now.


173
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,820
She has already admitted


174
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,060
she killed my daddy and auntie Lin Xiu.


175
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,560
Phoenix,


176
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
we both were cheated by her.


177
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,000
Nonsense!


178
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,260
If I could kill the past Water Immortal,


179
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,980
I wouldn’t have been hit by you.


180
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,360
You used Glazed Pure Fire just now.


181
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,500
It’s you who killed my daddy.


182
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,040
It’s you who framed Xu Feng.


183
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,060
It’s her.


184
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,060
It’s her who has been framing you.


185
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
Frame?


186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,520
Is it her or you


187
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,440
who hurt me?


188
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,480
My Lord,


189
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,140
this woman is so vicious.


190
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,440
She killed you.


191
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,240
And she is angry with me
because I brought you back to life.


192
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,480
She’s determined to kill me.


193
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,640
It’s Run Yu who asks you


194
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,900
to sneak into Demon Realm again and again. Right?


195
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,860
Don't think that I’m as gullible as I was before


196
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,380
so that I will be fooled by you again.


197
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,920
Today,


198
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
if you hurt Sui He,


199
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,780
I will kill you.


200
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,720
My Lord has offered you a chance.


201
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,980
Get out of here. Right now.


202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,840
How to repay parents' love.


203
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,160
Even you betray me, too.


204
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
No, please.


205
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,820
No, please.


206
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,180
No, please.


207
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,000
I have only one phoenix hairpin.


208
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,260
I gave it to you.


209
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,800
Can't you still understand my affection?


210
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,220
Put on this phoenix hairpin.


211
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,540
Let it help me protect you from dangers.


212
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,620
No, please.


213
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,140
No, please.


214
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,200
Mi,


215
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
hold on a little bit more.


216
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,940
I’ll take you back.


217
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,340
They really work in collusion.


218
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,500
My Lord, are you really
going to let them go like this?


219
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
Why are you here?


220
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,820
I consumed much magic power
in order to bring you back to life.


221
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
I heard that the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying
can increase magic power.


222
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,700
So I’m here to take it.


223
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,460
I didn’t expect that Jin Mi was here, too.


224
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
And she was going to kill me.


225
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
If you wanted the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,


226
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,260
you could have told me.


227
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,100
Why did you come here to take it yourself?


228
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I just don't want you to worry about me.


229
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,960
You may go first.


230
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,420
Are you still obsessed with her


231
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,120
and missing her?


232
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,520
Won’t you sop


233
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,340
until you are killed in collusion


234
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,740
by them two?


235
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
Xu Feng does believe me.


236
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,440
He does.


237
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,680
Little one.


238
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,420
Little one.


239
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,020
Little one.


240
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,000
Little one.


241
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,120
Mr. Hu.


242
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,840
Come here.


243
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,640
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.


244
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
How is Lord Puchi?


245
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,040
Don’t worry.


246
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,240
His Majesty is sending the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying


247
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,540
into his body.


248
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,820
He will wake up soon.


249
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,660
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.


250
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,880
That's good.


251
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,540
Little one.


252
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,460
What's wrong with your eyes?


253
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,380
My eyes?


254
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,640
What's wrong with my eyes?


255
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,160
I’m asking you.


256
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,140
What?


257
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,180
Are you going to hide this from me?


258
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,100
That stinks.


259
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,980
I asked you to take the red Internal Dan.


260
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,940
But you took the green one.


261
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,400
Did I take the green one?


262
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,160
Don’t you know this?


263
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,740
Little one,


264
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
can’t you


265
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,800
distinguish colors?


266
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,800
I see.


267
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,380
Why are you so silly?


268
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,480
For that phoenix,


269
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,620
you even gave up your ability to distinguish colors.


270
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,860
Little one,


271
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,060
you are the daughter of the Floral Immortal.


272
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,000
Alright. Alright.


273
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Don’t tell Chief Peony about this.


274
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,140
You know her.


275
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,380
If she knows this,


276
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,960
she will nag at me for a hundred years.


277
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,820
Mr. Hu, what happened?


278
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,220
Don't scare me.


279
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,680
Are you crying?


280
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,700
No, I’m not crying.


281
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,740
Aren’t you crying?


282
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,380
I haven’t seen you crying
in the previous thousands of years.


283
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,580
My tears are carrot-colored.


284
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,620
Look.


285
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,480
Unfortunately, you can't distinguish colors now.


286
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,100
Don't cry, Mr. Hu.


287
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,980
Carrot color


288
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,380
is quite unusual.


289
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,080
But it’s no pity not to see it.


290
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,840
Right?


291
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Although I can only see black and white,


292
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,640
I think


293
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
the world of black and white


294
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,380
is not bad.


295
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,320
I’m not afraid of the sunlight.


296
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,120
What’s more, I got a blessing in disguise.


297
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,560
Well, what you said does make sense.


298
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,680
Fortunately, you don’t have
the ability to distinguish colors.


299
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,840
Otherwise, you may


300
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,340
have died in that Cave of Jiu Ying.


301
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,440
In these years, many people with strong power


302
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,420
have died for the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying.


303
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,400
According to the stories


304
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,640
and what is mentioned in books,


305
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,420
the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying is red.


306
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,680
This is where Jiu Ying is sinister.


307
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,480
It plays diversion trick


308
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,060
so that


309
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,320
many immortals and demons
have become the its sacrificial offerings.


310
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
Where am I?


311
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,640
Why am I here?


312
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
Has he run away again?


313
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,020
I thought it would take much effort to catch you.


314
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,340
I didn’t expect you to be so weak.


315
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,200
But with your remaining magic power,


316
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,080
you can make one more
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow. Right?


317
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,960
Don’t even think about this.


318
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,520
Sorry, Liuying.


319
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,880
I am afraid I can’t keep our appointment
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.


320
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,200
Commit suicide? It’s not easy!


321
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,620
I will let you


322
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,200
make one more Spirit-Vanishing Arrow willingly.


323
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,120
Lord Puchi, you are awake now.


324
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,280
You're awake finally.


325
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,360
Mi,


326
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,920
I heard that you had risked your life


327
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,880
to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying for me.


328
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,600
I’m very moved.


329
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,040
Beauty, I knew there is a place for me in your heart.


330
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
You are welcome.


331
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,940
It’s good that you are OK now.


332
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,380
Yan You,


333
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,580
which jerk did this to you?


334
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,700
Fox Fairy,


335
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,680
why are you here, too?


336
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,880
Mi.


337
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,180
I let Lian Qiao ask Fox Fairy to come over


338
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,960
as a witness.


339
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,240
This time my injury


340
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
was caused by Sui He’s Glazed Pure Fire.


341
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,680
On that day, I went to Demon Realm with Jin Mi


342
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
to see that proud phoenix.


343
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,000
But she disappeared suddenly.


344
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,240
I met Sui He when I was looking for Jin Mi.


345
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,100
Why are you following me?


346
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,740
I heard you said you were


347
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,520
the Demon Lord’s life saver.


348
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,600
I thought I was very shameless.


349
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,620
But when compared with you,


350
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,240
my shamelessness is nothing.


351
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,960
We both


352
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,900
know that it’s Jin Mi who saved Demon Lord.


353
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,080
You falsely claim the contribution as your own.


354
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,720
Aren’t you afraid that Xu Feng will blame you


355
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,920
when he knows the truth one day?


356
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,720
How do you know that
it is Jin Mi who saved Xu Feng?


357
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,840
I went to the Snake Mountain with Jin Mi.


358
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,340
I have seen how


359
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,900
she risked her life


360
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,360
to get the Light of Xuanqiong,
the guiding medicine of Jiuzhuan Golden Elixir.


361
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
This time,


362
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,320
I will not let you ruin my happiness


363
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,580
like I did in the Human Realm.


364
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,460
You haven’t changed at all in these years.


365
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,900
You are still a shrew.


366
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,740
You are only good at bluffing.


367
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,420
Today, I will let you shut up forever.


368
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,660
How can you use Glazed Pure Fire?


369
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,240
Were Water Immortal and Wind Immortal


370
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,060
killed by you?


371
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,260
You are not that stupid.


372
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,920
Yan You,


373
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,200
nowadays you are no match for me.


374
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Today, you came on your own.


375
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,780
I will get even with you


376
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,800
for what you did to me in Human Realm.


377
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,020
I never expected


378
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
that I have suffered a series of setback by you


379
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,440
Sui He,


380
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,740
I used to love you with all my heart.


381
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,500
I could do anything for you.


382
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,260
But now


383
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,880
you are going to kill me.


384
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,580
Even so,


385
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,480
I still can't forget you.


386
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,960
I hate myself.


387
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,540
I hate that I can’t forget your charms.


388
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,720
and your every twinkle and smile.


389
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,640
I laugh at myself for being too shallow.


390
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,900
I hate myself for being humble.


391
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,740
But I still can't forget you.


392
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,840
You turn a blind eye to me,


393
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,080
and want to hurt me


394
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,400
and kill me


395
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,460
But I still...


396
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,500
I still love you.


397
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,800
Leave it.


398
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
If I’m killed by you,


399
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,400
I will die without anything to regret
and with my dream fulfilled.


400
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,340
I only hope that


401
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,920
one day you will remember that


402
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,080
a snake named Yan You loved you so much.


403
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,120
For the sake of my love for you,


404
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,600
could you fulfil my last small wish?


405
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,760
Go ahead.


406
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,940
Step forward a little bit.


407
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
I’m running out of strength.


408
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,020
Damn it.


409
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,460
You used Evil Ashes, playing the same trick of Run Yu.


410
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
Having been hurt by my Liuli Fire,


411
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,400
you won’t be alive for long


412
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,220
even if you can run away,


413
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,200
Who should I turn to?


414
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,360
Lord Puchi.


415
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,840
Lord Puchi.


416
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,060
Lord Puchi.


417
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,980
Fortunately, I’m smart enough.


418
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,680
Otherwise, it’s unlikely for me to run off


419
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,980
after being hurt by Sui He’s Glazed Pure Fire.


420
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,240
Fortunately, Jin Mi made the summoning spell.


421
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,620
Otherwise, I would have been caught and killed


422
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,800
by Sui He.


423
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,000
Wait.


424
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,740
What do you mean by


425
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,800
saying you can’t forget Sui He?


426
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,940
I’m ashamed of this.


427
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,420
When I started to become a fairy,


428
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,100
I was a pure and cute snake.


429
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,340
Your Majesty, I’m Sui He, from Bird Family.


430
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,460
This is Yi amber.


431
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,360
It’s made from the eyeballs of colorful-feathered birds.


432
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,780
It not only has a unique radiance


433
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,980
but also means eternal love.


434
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,100
I take this occasion to present to you, Your Majesty.


435
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,300
Your name is Sui He. Right?


436
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,720
You are so considerate.


437
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,800
According to the rules of seniority,


438
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,900
you should call Tu Yao auntie.


439
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,720
Really?


440
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,380
I don’t remember that I have such a relative.


441
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,440
I’m going to take a seat first.


442
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Miss Immortal,


443
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,920
I’m Yan You.


444
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,140
Your smile


445
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,520
is really unforgettable.


446
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,940
What a nuisance!


447
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,219
Yan You,


448
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
why are you so smart?


449
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,699
This is the flower I picked in the Human Realm.


450
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,639
Here you are.


451
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,540
It’s so beautiful.


452
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,960
There have been no flowers
in Heavenly Realm for thousands of years.


453
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
Did you pick it specially for me?


454
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,659
Well...


455
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,400
The flower and me...


456
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,600
Which one is more beautiful?


457
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,260
Your eyes are brighter


458
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:59,200
than a thousand luminous pearls put together.


459
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,240
Yan You,


460
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,100
would you take a walk with me


461
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,520
in this garden tomorrow?


462
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,780
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>


463
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,580
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>


464
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,260
<i>The memory haunts me</i>


465
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,300
<i>making me grieved.</i>


466
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,180
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>


467
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,420
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>


468
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,000
How dare you!


469
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,900
How dare you do such a licentious thing
in Heavenly Realm!


470
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,360
Your Majesty. Sui He.


471
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,440
This matter is not the way it seems.


472
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,540
There must be some misunderstandings.


473
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,100
Take them away.


474
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,940
Go.


475
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,180
Your Majesty.


476
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,060
Sui He.


477
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,380
Believe me.


478
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,020
I can definitely explain it clearly.


479
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,080
Go.


480
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,620
Snake Fairy Yan You and Fairy Qi Yao


481
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,580
are licentious and shameless.


482
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,420
Yan You, now you are devoid of your fairy identity.


483
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,240
Qi Yao, you are demoted to be a human being.


484
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,360
And you are not allow to
be promoted to be a fairy forever.


485
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,620
Your Majesty,


486
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,240
there are some misunderstandings.


487
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,540
Let me explain.


488
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,860
Explain?


489
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,460
It’s a guilt deliberately imposed on us.


490
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,700
How can you explain this clearly?


491
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,940
Just because Fairy Qi Yao and
Heavenly Emperor made eyes at each other,


492
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,680
Heavenly Empress takes her as the pain in the neck.


493
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,940
Sui He perceived Heavenly Empress’s thoughts.


494
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
So she played this trick


495
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,660
to make Fairy Qi Yao get out of the way


496
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,720
in order to please Heavenly Empress.


497
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,780
Because of this, she


498
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,700
gradually becomes the leader of the Bird Family.


499
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,000
But originally


500
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,620
I intended to fulfill her wish.


501
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,720
So I didn’t mention this thing to anyone.


502
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,260
Since then,


503
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,000
I have never dared to fall in love with anyone again.


504
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,060
I am afraid that one day


505
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,100
my heart will be trampled on the ground again.


506
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,880
Everyone thinks Yan You is a playboy.


507
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,260
But nobody knows that


508
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,980
it’s because you were hurt by your loved one.


509
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,780
Who didn’t do some stupid things


510
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,740
when he or she was young?


511
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,480
We have to experience a lot


512
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,060
so as to become mature.


513
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,740
But it’s OK. I am not that stupid now.


514
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,640
By the way,


515
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,360
when I went to the Cave of Jiu Ying,


516
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Sui He also used Glazed Pure Fire
when fighting with me.


517
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,380
I think she went there


518
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,980
in order to take the Internal Dan


519
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,720
and make you devoid of the chance to wake up.


520
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,960
Why does Sui He have such a strong magic power?


521
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,320
And why can she use Glazed Pure Fire?


522
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,700
Is it Sui He


523
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,320
who killed Luo Lin and Lin Xiu?


524
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,020
That's right.


525
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,260
It’s her.


526
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,140
She admitted it to me in person.


527
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,040
It’s really her.


528
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,020
Then tell Xu Feng immediately.


529
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,080
Kill this vicious woman as soon as possible.


530
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,020
I told him.


531
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,420
But he didn’t believe me.


532
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,060
I used to lie to him and hurt him.


533
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,760
How is it possible that he would trust me again?


534
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,820
Mi,


535
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,420
if you don’t clear the misunderstandings,


536
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,800
then phoenix


537
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,040
is really going to get married with Sui He.


538
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,420
By that time,


539
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,480
if that vicious woman becomes Demon Empress,


540
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,760
there will be no peace in the six realms any longer.


541
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,860
He’s right.


542
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,260
Jin Mi,


543
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,680
there are some misunderstandings
between you and Xu Feng.


544
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,020
You should clear them early.
