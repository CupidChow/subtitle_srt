
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 21"



00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,660
Make a sound.



00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,140
I, I' m here.



00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,870
You violated the rules.



00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,550
No, I didn’t.



00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,760
You must have moved your body.



00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,190
You have stepped back at least one foot.



00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,290
And the ball of red threads has also fallen down.



00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,940
My head is not square.



00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,220
How can this round object stand still on my head?



00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,860
Then measure the gap.



00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,310
Before I threw the dart,



00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,730
We were at least one Zhang apart,



00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,760
namely, ten feet apart.



00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,680
Your thread is too short, which is not accurate.



00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,060
This one is one feet long.



00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,630
Old fox,



00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,230
you must have cheated in the read tread.



00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,030
Devil Ji.



00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,530
Didn’t you cheat?



00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,840
You never score a hit with darts.



00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,240
You know clearly about this.



00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,180
If I hadn’t stepped



00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,090
a little just now,



00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,460
there would have been a
bleeding hole in my throat now .



00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,140
So you admit that you violated the rule.



00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,360
I am not



00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
the human beings in your Cause and Effect Plate,



00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,530
who are at your control.



00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,630
If you don’t wanna be at my control,
then don’t play with me.



00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,550
What a nuisance!



00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,550
Yeah, it’s boring.



00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,370
Neither Xu Feng nor Jin Mi is here.



00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,420
I feel so bored,



00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,010
so lonely and so empty.



00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,360
Even match-making can’t lift my spirit.



00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,380
Human beings have always been at my control.



00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,720
Since these two guys are gone to
experience hardships in the Human Realm,



00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,950
I, a dignified Xuanqing Jiuzhen Destiny Fairy,



00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,700
have been reduced to being at others’ control.



00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,260
How boring!



00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,040
Is Moon Immortal here?



00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,500
Little Jin Mi, you are back finally.



00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,980
Was everything OK in your hardship experience?.



00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,840
Where’s Xu Feng?



00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,340
Didn't he come back with you?



00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,780
Did you lose your mind?
Or are you blind?



00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,480
She is Immortal Tai Si’s daughter,



00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,079
Fairy Kuang Lu.



00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,740
There’s nothing wrong with my eyes.



00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,959
It’s just that little Kuang Lu



00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,920
looks so much alive with little Jin Mi.



00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,440
You are really dim-sighted from old age.



00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,980
I remember that in my eldest nephew’s Xuanji Palace,



00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,920
there is also a girl named Kuang Lu.



00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,920
You are retentive, Moon Immortal.



00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,580
I’m the Kuang Lu from Xuanji Palace.



00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,040
I’m also from Mansion of Tai Si.



00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,820
Come here,



00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,580
little Kuang Lu.



00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,220
What can I help you?



00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Are you here to inquire about
marriage or to ask for a red thread?



00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,860
Today's my father's birthday.



00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,159
Under my father’s order,



00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,700
I’m here to invite you two



00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,940
to drink wine and listen to dramas
at the Mansion of Tai Si.



00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,140
It’s so hasty.



00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,860
We haven’t prepared any birthday gifts.



00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,659
Actually, it is a just a modest birthday.



00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,200
My father doesn’t want to go in for it in a big way.



00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,340
He just wants to invite some close friends spend som time together



00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
and have fun.



00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,500
To receive gifts is against my father’s intention.



00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,940
Immortal Tai Si is so thoughtful.



00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,400
We feel so bored now.



00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,560
It’s really a lucky coincident.



00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,660
Then we’ll go there, if you insist.



00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,200
Let's go.



00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,860
Wait.



00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,240
Old fox, what tricks are you playing now?



00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,820
What a sin Run Yu is commited!



00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,060
You are such a beautiful and bright girl



00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,760
with such tender skin.



00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,060
But in order to match with



00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,460
his cold and pale style,



00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,340
you have to be dressed in such a plain color.



00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,220
It’s so infuriating.



00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,380
It has nothing to do with His Highness.



00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,040
It’s out of my own will.



00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,680
Alright. Stop.



00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,580
People who understand this



00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,320
know that you just came back from Xuanji Palace.



00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
People who don’t understand this



00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,360
must think that you are hastening home for the funeral.



00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,360
Immortal Tai Si will feel very unhappy



00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,420
if he sees his only daughter is dressed like this



00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,220
on his birthday.



00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,920
Pooh!



00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,360
A cracked bell can never sound well.



00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,200
Quiet but elegant colors are fashionable in Heavenly Realm.



00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,480
Who is like you,



00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,000
always dressed in a showy way?



00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,080
Tawdry.



00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,500
You are dressed elegantly,



00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,900
looking like a patch a fog if seen from afar
and a patch of smoke if seen from near.



00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,140
You look like neither a male nor a female.



00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,980
In these thousands of years,



00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,960
you have never been concerned with
love an romance, which is OK for me.



00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,300
What’s worse, you have always visited me here.



00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,480
My fame



00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,580
is going to be ruined by you.



00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Devil fox.



00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,360
Do you want me to throw you



00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
into the Cause and Effect Plate



00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
and make you experience the pain
of being apart from your loved one?



00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,860
Mister Immortal is right.



00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,640
After all, it’s my father’s birthday.



00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,420
I’d better get dressed in bright colors.



00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,080
Then you two go there first,
Mister Immortal and Miss Immortal..



00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
I’m going to get changed.



00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,980
Wait.



00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,900
I have a ready-made dress here.



00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,600
Breathtaking!



00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,340
Come here.



00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,280
Your eyes are so bright and
your smile is so charming.



00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
After all, you are young.



00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,400
You are charming with either light
or heavy make-up.



00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,400
Do you like it?



00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,740
Yes, I like it.



00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,200
Thank you so much,
Mister Immortal and Miss Immortal.



00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,900
Alike.



00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,700
So alike.



00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,980
Aren’t you really Jin Mi’s long lost sister?



00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,840
I wonder what kind of girls



00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,840
Night Immortal likes.



00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,340
I just remember that Fish Fairy said he liked me.



00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,340
Do I really look like her?



00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,560
Whoever is dressed in red
looks good and looks all the same



00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,920
in his eyes.



00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Stupid.



00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
Leave him alone.



00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,500
How come?



00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,200
Fairy Jin Mi is the most beautiful
girl in the six realms.



00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,260
She is both beautiful and kindhearted.



00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,840
I envy her so much.



00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,060
I’m really flattered



00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,060
that you compare me with Fairy Jin Mi.



00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,940
You look very pleasing to my eyes.



00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,780
Here’s a red thread for you.



00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,420
Although I’m not in charge of fairies’ marriages,



00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,159
it can bring you good luck.



00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
Thank you, Mister Immortal.



00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,900
Can you give me one more thread?



00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,520
What happened?



00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,020
Am I OK now?



00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,240
I’m fine.



00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,820
I just had a slight tumble.



00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,240
I am coarse-skinned, having got used to it.



00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,740
I’m OK.



00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
I didn’t expect that



00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,760
we have got some connection during these days.



00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,200
You came along the instant I had a tumble.



00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,200
It seems that you slept well last night.



00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,520
I added some medicine that can relieve
uneasiness of your mind and improve your sleep.



00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
I saw that you were deep asleep.



00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,540
Unlike the usual case, you didn’t



00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,500
or kick around this time.



00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,560
You finally had a good sleep.



00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,640
you must have had a hard time



00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,860
living a life in danger everyday.



00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,940
Stop it.



00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,160
Stop it.



00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Go inside.



00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,720
I can do it myself.



00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,260
Go inside and take rest.



00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,000
Go.



00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,750
How are you?



00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
How are you feeling today?



00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I have been missing for many days.



00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,760
At the moment, there must be a chaos outside.



00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,000
If she knows that I can speak,



00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,160
she will ask me many questions.



00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,160
The present situation is very complicated.



00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,780
I don’t know much about her.



00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,140
And it’s not good to get her involved.



00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,540
So the less she know about me,
the safer she will be.



00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,440
Just like yesterday.



00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,820
Did you hear anything?



00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,980
I have been studying medicine for 15 years.



00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,580
I’m very good at using the right antidote .



00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,340
Normally, he can recover within three days



00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,180
with this prescription.



00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,290
It’s been ten days.



00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,840
How come there’s still is no sign of his recovery?



00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,560
Did I make a diagnostic error?



00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,760
It’s a pity that I’m not able to
do justice to your kindness.



00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,180
Don't worry.



00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,860
It’s a coincidence to save your life in the mountain,



00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,140
Doctors treat their patients equally.



00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,400
As long as you are willing to do good deeds,



00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,040
I will help you recover soon.



00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,700
Gods and Buddhas,



00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,600
Crow goes astray.



00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,260
If he can recover,



00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,860
Your believer, I will persuade
him to stop doing misdeeds



00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
and to straighten up.



00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,280
Why are you looking at me?



00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,620
Why do you wear veil all day long?



00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,600
I look so beautiful.



00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
If I put off the veil to show you my face,



00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,100
and if you grow some evil thoughts
after seeing my face,



00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,420
I will bring about my own destruction.



00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,020
You are making mountain out of a molehill.



00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,380
I’m ugly and look disgusting.



00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,280
Where are you from?



00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,940
Have you lived here for a long time?



00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,100
You go so far as to doubt my medical skills.



00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,440
I won't tell you



00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,600
that I am the Saint Girl of Saint Doctor Family.



00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,620
Unfortunately, I know this now.



00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,300
But it’s really a surprise that your the Saint Girl.



00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,540
Is there no one else in Saint Doctor Family?



00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,540
I come from where I should come from,
and I’m going to where I should go.



00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,040
I’m here today, but I may be gone tomorrow.



00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,840
May I have your name?



00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,880
It’s very rude for you to ask my name.



00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
You are really a bad-mannered bandit.



00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Alright. You can’t here anyway.



00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
My name is Jin Mi.



00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,780
looking for peace among the blooming flowers;



00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,000
leading a life of floating clouds and water.



00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
My name is awesome, right?



00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,910
I have no name.



00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,700
It’s just an experience of living
in the mortal world temporally.



00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,360
When will it be sunny?



00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,180
So that I can go to collect herbs for you.



00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,500
Jin Mi.



00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,180
Are you missing Mi, too?



00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,260
Don’t worry.



00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,040
She will be back soon.



00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,580
Naughty boy.



00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
Alright.
Go and play on your own.



00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,660
Why are you dressed like this?



00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,440
Today’s my father’s birthday.



00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
I just came from Mansion of Tai Si.



00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,340
I had asked you for leave, Your Highness.



00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,220
Go back and take rest.



00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,300
And



00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,220
don't be dressed like this tomorrow.



00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
It’s too loud.



00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
Your Highness, do you think



00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,900
this red dress



00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,980
is not beautiful?



00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,060
I don't like red.



00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,600
This is the red...



00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,120
red yeast rice wine made by my father.



00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,860
He asked me to bring this to you.



00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,200
I appreciate his kindness.



00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,200
But I’m not a good drinker.



00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,060
Keep it for yourself.



00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,300
This wine



00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,520
cannot compare with the
osmanthus wine made by Fairy Jin Mi,



00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,800
but it has another connotation.



00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,960
This wine is also named Heart of Jade.



00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,400
Heart of Jade, loyal heart...



00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,460
Since Immortal Tai Si shows his loyalty in this wine,



00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,460
it would be disrespectful to refuse it.



00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,920
These fancy carps are so beautiful.



00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,200
They are just like



00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,740
the dragons flying in the sky.



00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,740
Fish is a fish.
Dragons are dragons.



00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,640
How can they be alike?



00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,380
They both have scales and tails.



00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,599
And there is a saying about
fish leaping over the dragon gate.



00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,380
Maybe dragons are derived from fancy carps.



00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
Hearsay.



00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,819
Did you ever see a real dragon?



00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,819
Yes, I did.



00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,920
I see him everyday.



00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,760
I just haven't seen his real body.



00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,460
But the dragon I know



00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,460
is a real gentleman.



00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,060
He keeps modest so as to
cultivate his moral character.



00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,680
He helps others



00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,040
and also learns from others.



00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,040
He is like jade, warm and tender.



00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,900
I think you are badly drunk.



00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,640
So I’ll blame you for your bad manners.



00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,980
Why are you laughing?



00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,820
Your Highness, you get angry finally.



00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,780
Go back and sober up.



00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
I’m not drunk.



00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,980
Your Highness, I have been with you for so long,



00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,160
but I rarely saw you be happy or unhappy.



00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,220
Only when Fairy Jin Mi was with you



00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,580
would you show your cheerfulness.



00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,140
When your were not happy,



00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,540
you never let Fairy Jin Mi know.



00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,120
You would stay alone



00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,160
and swallow the bitterness.



00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,520
Every time I saw you like this,



00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,960
I felt very upset.



00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,100
Now you are showing your anger in front of me.



00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,180
You no longer keep your feeling to yourself.



00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,180
It’s a good thing.



00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
Your Highness, I hope you can often



00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,360
release your true temperament,



00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,200
and no longer keep your pains and worries



00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,660
to yourself.



00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,120
You can even criticize me



00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,120
and lose temper in front of me.



00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,780
I will be very happy if you can be like this.



00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,000
You are spying on an immortal.



00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,120
Do you know your sin?



00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,760
Yes, I do.



00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,300
You can punish me as you wish, Your Highness,



00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,440
as long as you are happy.



00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,240
I will let it pass this time.



00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,280
But listen.



00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,480
I haven’t been reduced to



00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,700
being pitied by you.



00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,900
Of course.



00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,020
Your Highness, you are a dragon,



00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,020
the son of the Heavenly Emperor,



00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,780
the most noble



00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,780
and the most powerful presence in the six realms.



00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,080
So you don’t need pity from others.



00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,180
It’s OK



00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,260
even if you reach a deadlock



00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,260
and can’t play an important role.



00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,460
One day, the darkness will end



00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,780
and you will succeed.



00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,360
The Red String of the House of Marriage.



00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,320
What do you mean?



00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,320
I asked Moon Immortal for this.



00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,260
It has no special meaning.



00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,440
It’s just a sign a good luck.



00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,020
May you get what you want



00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,860
and get where your heart is.



00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,160
May you get married with Fairy Jin Mi early.



00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,540
Uncle.



00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,520
Uncle.



00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,020
Uncle.



00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,580
Uncle..



00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,020
Look. Centipede.



00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,680
How do you feel?



00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,240
Scared stiff?



00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,540
Frightened, right?



00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,500
It’s a centipede.



00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,000
I’m going to use it to...



00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,540
to make medicine for you some days later.



00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,080
You swallowed it.



00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,020
You ate it.



00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,400
Are you a cock?



00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,760
It’s OK.



00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,140
It’s more effective compared with the dried ones.



00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,240
Two years ago, when we were at war with Liangguo,



00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I was trapped in the Poison Valley for eight days.



00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
With centipedes and scorpion as the only food source,



00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,220
I won the natural barrier,Yunling Mountain.



00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,420
Scare me? No way.



00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,520
Today, I caught some funny little things



00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120
on the cliff.



00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,800
Although it has a hard shell,



00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,960
it’s body is very tender and soft.



00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,580
It seems to taste good.



00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,460
I’ll make it as the guiding medicine
and let you have it with the medicine.



00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,920
I forgot that you can't hear.



00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,580
This one.



00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Snail.



00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,660
It’s a surprise that you are afraid of snails.



00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,700
You are afraid of the poisonless one
instead of the poisonous one.



00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,960
You are really funny.



00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,560
Alright. Alright.



00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,140
Then this one will the guiding medicine.



00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,780
Long time passed, but you haven’t recovered yet.



00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,540
Try this medicinal bath today.



00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,160
OK.



00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
You, a bandit



00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,860
should be coarse-skinned and rude.



00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,480
But why do you look so attractive?



00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,600
What are the words that describe
a person like you in books?



00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,700
Yeah, yeah.



00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,040
Natural red lips,



00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,780
natural black eyebrows,



00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,040
soft and tender skin, and rosy cheeks.



00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,480
These words can be used to describe you.



00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,940
Definitely.



00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,940
What’s more, you are also literate.



00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,720
In your stockade,



00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,720
maybe you are not the head,



00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,460
but your rank can’t be lower than that



00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,740
of an inept adviser



00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,800
or a wife of the head.



00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,060
I am really smart.



00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,140
No, no.



00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,420
Your need to bathe a bit more



00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,720
so as to remove the residual toxic in your body.



00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,920
Bathe a bit more.



00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,920
Remove the residual toxic completely.



00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,560
Sword, spear, two-edged sword and halberd



00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,420
Axe, battle-axe, hook and fork.



00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,320
Whip, hammer, rod and long spear.



00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,460
Iron stick.



00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
How many fights have you got involved in



00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,180
to collect the scars caused by so many different weapons?



00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,840
I dragged you out of the dead heap.



00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
And it took a lot of effort to cure you.



00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,620
Now your life is very precious.



00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
You wasted so many herbs.



00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,140
So you must cherish your life.



00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,700
That day, I made a wish.



00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,800
When you recover completely,



00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,220
I must persuade you to be kind



00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
and stop doing misdeeds.



00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,920
OK.



00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,460
You are so verbose.



00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,440
When will you stop touching me?



00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,120
This is winterworm summerherb.



00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,360
It’s good for kidney and lung.



00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,360
It can sustain and enhance
your body resistance to diseases.



00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,720
You can’t hear.



00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,560
They grow on the mountains.



00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,940
In half of their life, they are worms.



00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,400
And in another half of their life, they are herbs.



00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,020
The winter worms die,



00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,900
but when summer solstice comes,



00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,320
they can turn into a good herb
for treating diseases and saving people.



00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,220
They break through the soil.



00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,680
Compared with flowers and butterflies,



00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,600
they achieve the real rebirth



00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,960
and “breaking the cocoon and becoming butterflies”.



00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,700
Let's go.



00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,240
Do you feel lonely during
the long stay in the mountain?



00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,540
Time flies.



00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,140
All things are floating clouds.



00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,500
What is loneliness?



00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,920
I have to recite a lot of medical knowledge everyday.



00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,100
And I also have to try herbs and make medicine.



00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,620
And I have to fool the elders and aunties in my family.



00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,880
I don’t have time to feel lonely.



00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,600
Only those literati and poets



00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,220
like to make a fuss about an imaginary illness.



00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,330
Does she know that I am
pretending to be deaf and dumb?



00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,900
Crow, I find that only when I’m with you



00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,720
can I feel so comfortable.



00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,080
Probably it’s because you can't hear.



00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,740
So I can talk freely.



00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,800
And I don’t have to pretend to be serious,



00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,560
maintaining the authority as the head of a family.



00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,560
And I have to talk in a very serious way



00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,880
and think much before uttering words.



00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,120
Crow,



00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,300
you are the best listener in the world.



00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,720
So strange.



00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,780
How come I have always palpitated in these days ?



00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,740
"House of Marriage"



00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,760
I haven't come to the wrong place.



00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,720
Uncle.



00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,020
I was forced to



00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,700
drink several cups of wine just now.



00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
I can’t walk steadily.



00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,460
So I thought I came to your palace.



00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,860
You like being alone.



00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,860
Why are you here today?



00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,600
You can’t stand the loneliness



00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,680
and then come here to
ask me for Red Strings, right?



00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,780
I’m here to return the Red String.



00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,960
Kuang Lu is young knows little about the manners.
So she asked for the Red String.



00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,560
It’s my fault.
I didn’t teach her well.



00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,140
Uncle, please forgive me.



00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,300
It’s just a Red String.



00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,280
You can keep it for yourself.



00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,280
You can give it to the one you fall in love with.



00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,820
Uncle, you are kidding again.



00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,160
In the Heavenly Realm,



00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
who doesn’t know who I love?



00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,980
My herbs.



00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,980
I asked you to keep your eyes on them.
Why did you fall asleep.



00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,260
Fortunately, the ash is cool.



00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,900
After being stewed for one night,
now this aconite is hollow inside,



00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,900
which means most of its toxic has been removed.



00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,140
There is still a little toxic in them.



00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,440
We still need to be steam them for seven hours



00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,000
to remove the residual toxic in them.



00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,320
I haven’t realized that being a doctor is not easy.



00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,800
People say that we doctors



00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,910
treat diseases and save people.



00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,160
Actually, we compete for people.



00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,440
We compete with the heaven,
the earth and all things in the world.



00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,000
We compete with the King of Hell and time.



00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,500
Everything in the world
contains the essence of medicine.



00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,440
However, it is not easy to take
the essence from these things,



00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,040
such as toxic things like aconites and centipedes.



00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,120
We can do nothing but try our best.



00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,060
Why am I telling you so much about this.



00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
After all, you can't hear.



00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,460
Crow, you can hear me.



00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,760
Crow, can you hear me?



00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,900
You can’t hear.
So why are you beating them.



00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,280
Since you like beating so much,



00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,880
you should be a musician.



00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,880
It’s a pity for you to be a bandit.



00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,740
You are really very concerned about me.



00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,380
When the toxic in these aconites



00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,460
is removed completely,



00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,220
I will be able to make new medicine for you.



00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,159
Three heavy sounds and
one light sound of the hooves.



00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,699
And the horse don’t run fast.



00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,600
Warm-blooded horses.



00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,639
It is the Chilian Troop of Duke Nanping .



00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,000
Search.



00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
They seems to be soldiers.
Go.



00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,400
Don’t care about these.



00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,680
We’ll take a shortcut.



00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,380
Be quick.
Search carefully.



00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,560
Yes.



00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,160
You guys go there.



00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,760
What are you doing?



00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,340
Have you searched that area?



00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,080
Yes.



00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,600
Nobody lives here.



00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,020
Only hunters and the members
of the Saint Doctor Family



00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,320
come here occasionally.



00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,320
Search the nearby villages and towns.



00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,640
Kill the ones



00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,440
who pretend to be His Majesty.



00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,400
Withdraw.



00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,880
Yes.



00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,920
Pretending to be me?
