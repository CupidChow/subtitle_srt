
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 54"



00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,860
Give me one more chance.



00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,620
If you bloom,



00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,960
I’ll go to meet him again.



00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,520
If you don’t,



00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,579
I’ll no longer meet him all my life.



00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,700
<i>Hope I won’t feel regret in the rest of my life. </i>



00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,060
<i>Fly away with the fragrance of the flowers.</i>



00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,540
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>



00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,340
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>



00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:06,440
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>



00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,100
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>



00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,040
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>



00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,160
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>



00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,660
<i>The flower in my heart has withered. </i>



00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,600
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>



00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,660
<i>The memory haunts me,</i>



00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,880
<i>making me grieved.</i>



00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,460
<i>Hope I won’t feel regret in the rest of my life. </i>



00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,260
<i>Fly away with the fragrance of the flowers.</i>



00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,120
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>



00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,500
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>



00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,340
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>



00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,659
<i>I look back and taste the
aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>



00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,280
Now Feng is alive



00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,560
and becomes Demon Lord.



00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,960
I can be relieved.



00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,840
Your Highness,



00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,340
have you considered



00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,740
being with Xu Feng in the future?



00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,380
What do you mean?



00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,460
You know



00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,820
I’m dying.



00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
I certainly hope that



00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,100
some man like Xu Feng can look after you



00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,820
in the future.



00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,440
No need.



00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
You know I only love you.



00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,100
Of course I know it,



00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,960
but…



00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,460
Mu Ci,



00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,380
what’s wrong with you?



00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,360
I’m all right.



00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,640
Promise me.



00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,040
After my death,



00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,860
go on living, OK?



00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,460
Promise me.



00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,940
But you have to promise me



00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,740
whatever happens,



00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,100
you can’t leave without telling me.



00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
For the rest of your life,



00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,360
no matter you have ten years,



00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
one year,



00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,080
one month,



00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
or one day,



00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,900
we must be together.



00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,920
OK, I promise you.



00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,340
Mu Ci,



00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,020
marry me.



00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,540
The sixth day of the sixth lunar month
is a auspicious  day.



00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,160
Let’s get married here,



00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,700
with the heaven and earth as the witnesses.



00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
OK?



00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,140
You don’t want to?



00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,840
No,



00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,900
but…



00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,260
Mu Ci.



00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,940
But…



00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,840
Mu Ci.



00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,360
Mu Ci.



00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,480
What’s wrong with Mu Ci?



00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,520
As he just removed Autopsy Wild Silkworms,



00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
his magic power is disappearing gradually.



00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,840
Now he is



00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,700
as weak as a mortal,



00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,340
so he has a high fever.



00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,800
Don’t worry.



00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,080
He’ll get better gradually



00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,240
after taking some medicines.



00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Mu Ci, don’t be afraid.



00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,420
I’ll accompany you.



00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,700
Demon Lord never
takes a look at these tributes.



00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,700
Why does he ask us



00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,280
to take out this Moke Color Cloak
sent by Leader of Western City?



00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,440
Demon Lord gives a banquet



00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,120
to celebrate Princess Sui He’s
birthday in Yujiang Palace,



00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,400
and this cloak is the gift to Princess Sui He.



00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,380
I heard Princess Sui He saved Demon Lord.



00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,760
Will Demon Lord marry her



00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,800
to repay her life-saving grace?



00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,840
Stop talking about it.



00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
My Lord,



00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,559
we have placed the gift on the table.



00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,100
You can leave.



00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,980
Yes.



00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,960
Xu Feng,



00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,180
I hear that you’re busy checking and
approving official documents recently,



00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,760
so I make some flower cakes.



00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,920
Even if you’re busy,



00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,480
you can eat them to satisfy your hunger.



00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,780
Sui He,



00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,840
tomorrow is your birthday, right?



00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,560
You remember it?



00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,740
This is the flower cake, not osmanthus wine.



00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,280
I don’t get drunk, so I remember it.



00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,780
Today is the fifteenth day.



00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,360
Tomorrow is the sixteenth day
when the moon is the fullest.



00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,380
I have ordered to prepare
the birthday party for you.



00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,120
Let’s celebrate your birthday
in the Yujiang Palace,



00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,240
OK?



00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,480
Your fever seems to be gone.



00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,460
What’s wrong with me?



00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,100
As your magic power is disappearing gradually,



00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,800
you have a fever like a mortal.



00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,860
You haven’t answered my question yet.



00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
What’s your question?



00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,780
I don’t want to ask you again.



00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,780
But, Your Highness,



00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,660
you know more clearly than me that



00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,480
I’ll lose all my magic power



00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,080
and be dying like a mortal soon.



00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,340
Even so,



00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,840
you’re still willing to marry me?



00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,420
Have you recovered now?



00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes.



00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,900
Now I tell you how willing I am.



00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,140
When will we get married?



00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,800
On the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.



00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,120
Where?



00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,860
In the place where we went steady.



00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,300
"Qizheng Hall"



00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Your Majesty,



00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,020
I don’t know



00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,260
whether I should tell you something.



00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,040
What do you want to say?



00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,700
Water Immortal,



00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,560
she...



00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,720
She goes to Demon Realm again?



00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,640
Water Immortal goes to
Demon Realm so frequently.



00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,380
Will she have danger?



00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,820
If those demons catch her to threaten you…



00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,400
Now she has recovered



00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,080
and regained her magic power.



00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Common demons can’t hurt her.



00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,540
No need to stop her.



00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,400
She’ll give up soon.



00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,680
It's fine as long as you come back.



00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,520
Mi,



00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,940
what should I do?



00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,540
If I free you,



00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,900
I worry you’ll run away.



00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,420
If I lock you up,



00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,380
I worry your heart will run away.



00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,180
When can you stop tormenting me?



00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
If he dies,



00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,700
will you belong to me thoroughly?



00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,660
Demon Lord has given
the Palace of Gu City to me.



00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,300
Clean it up for me.



00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,820
Yes.



00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,840
You can leave.



00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,820
Delicious.



00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,580
Do you want it?



00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Do you want it?



00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,880
Here you are.



00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,640
No.



00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,200
Fairy.



00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,080
Fairy.



00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,540
My dad asks you to accompany me?



00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,020
Don’t touch me.



00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,040
I kill you.



00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,500
My Lord, kill them,



00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,540
turn their bones into ashes and scatter them.



00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,660
Take them away.



00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,220
Fairy.



00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,700
Now King of Gu City has run away.



00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,980
We must kill them to dash his hope.



00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,940
They’re sons of King of Yan City.



00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,680
King of Gu City fed them
medicines to make them mad



00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,040
and imprisoned them here



00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,660
to threaten the past
subordinates of King of Yan City.



00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,940
They’re poor enough.



00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,700
No need to kill them.



00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,720
Just now that cad wanted to molest me.



00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,940
Don’t you mind it at all?



00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,340
He is mad.



00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,280
You should forgive him.



00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,880
In your heart,



00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,840
I’m even not more important than
these two mad sons of King of Yan City.



00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,420
I thought



00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,820
I would become important in your heart



00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,680
after sparing no effort to bring you back to life,



00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,060
but it’s just my own wishful thinking?



00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,140
Sui He,



00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,600
I never forget your grace.



00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,980
In your heart,



00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,980
I’m just a woman who saved you?



00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,220
These days,



00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
you’re always temperamental,



00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,980
so I’m always worried.



00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,060
Do you know how happy I am



00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,300
when you’re kind to me



00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,940
and how sad I am



00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,380
when you’re cold and heartless like this?



00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,800
What sort of man are you?



00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,980
Why can’t I see through you?



00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,160
You should know



00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,320
I neither want to just be your benefactor



00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,260
nor want you to repay my grace.



00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,140
I just want to be your wife, stand beside you



00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,480
and share the pleasure, anger,
sorrow and joy in the world with you



00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,780
Are these difficult?



00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,940
Sui He,



00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,020
now Demon Realm isn’t stable.



00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,060
After I deal with everything…



00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,140
You still can’t forget Jin Mi, right?



00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
Don’t mention her.



00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,359
If you really forget her,
you won’t avoid mentioning her.



00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,520
She betrayed, cheated and even killed you,



00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,800
but you still can’t forget her.



00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,700
Shut up!



00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,079
I paid so much for you,



00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,560
but I gain nothing.



00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,140
Today is your birthday.



00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,440
Don’t upset yourself about these things.



00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,180
I won’t kill those two fools.



00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,960
I will be kind to them.



00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,500
Xu Feng,



00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,700
I’ll definitely let you love me thoroughly.



00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,200
Let’s go.



00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,860
We can leave?



00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,340
So?



00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,940
We stay here to accompany them?



00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,740
Did these two mad sons of King of Yan City



00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
offend Princess Sui He?



00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,940
If Demon Lord didn’t stop her,



00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,360
they would be killed.



00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,320
They’re already miserable enough now.



00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,660
With such a woman,



00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
we’re unlucky.



00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,440
-So is Demon Lord.
-Let’s go.



00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,460
Go.



00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,180
Don’t leave.



00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
I want to eat rice.



00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,200
Rice.



00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,400
I want to eat rice.



00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,240
My Lord,



00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,980
it’s late.



00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,700
You may catch cold.



00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,400
Thank you.



00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,020
No need to thank me.



00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,460
Today I was fooled by those two fools,



00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,900
so I was impolite



00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,140
and made an indiscreet remark.



00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,440
Don’t mind my words.



00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,220
Be relieved.



00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,560
I understand you.



00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,340
My Lord,



00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,660
you really hate Jin Mi?



00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,040
She killed me,



00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,800
so I hate her.



00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,800
Hate means that you still remember her.



00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,220
I hope you can forget her thoroughly.



00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,520
Only in this way can I enter your heart.



00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,340
Sui He,



00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,180
I have told you that



00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,580
I keep everything you did for me in mind.



00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,800
Don’t mention her in the future.



00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,280
Otherwise, our spirits will be damped.



00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,680
I never enjoyed



00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,740
the beauty of Wangchuan River before.



00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,880
Today I find it’s so beautiful.



00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,560
It may be because you’re accompanying me.



00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,520
I really hope that



00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,480
we can be always together in the future.



00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,180
If so, I’ll be content.



00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,600
OK.



00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,820
We’ll come here often.



00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,980
Tonight we prepare a birthday banquet for you.



00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,740
Let’s go back.



00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,880
Phoenix,



00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
although you only love Sui He,



00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,220
I still want to meet you.



00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,260
We wish Princess Sui He happiness,



00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,920
longevity and eternal youth.



00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,760
You can leave.



00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,160
Yes.



00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,800
My Lord, thank you



00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,860
for celebrating my birthday today.



00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,760
Glad you like it.



00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,040
Stop.



00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,040
It’s cold at night.



00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,540
You may get cold.



00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,460
My Lord.



00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,960
Don’t stand on ceremony.



00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,900
No need to call me Lord.



00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,800
You can call me Xu Feng.



00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,740
Xu Feng.



00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,100
You’re really a perfect couple.



00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,000
My Lord, you’re outstanding and
have a high status in the six realms.



00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,500
Even the ordinary rabbit admires you.



00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,340
How do you know this rabbit admires me?



00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,300
After entering the door,



00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,980
it keeps staring at you.



00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,800
This rabbit looks so beautiful.



00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,520
It’s covered with snow-white hairs.



00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,000
Xu Feng,



00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,640
could you give it to me?



00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,540
I want to tame it as my spirit pet.



00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,540
Some things can’t be tamed.



00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
If you raise it,



00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,200
maybe some day it’ll hurt you.



00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,080
It’s just a rabbit, and it’s docile.



00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,520
It won’t hurt me.



00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,520
Docile?



00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,480
Let me see



00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,260
whether it’s really docile.



00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,060
In Demon Realm, you act as my maid,



00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,880
and I’ll protect you
from being caught by demons.



00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Do I look lovely?



00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,360
Do I look lovely?



00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,500
No, I can’t be found by Phoenix.



00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,200
Xu Feng,



00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,140
are you OK?



00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,980
Phoenix, sorry.



00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,180
Not only fierce tigers bite.



00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,080
We never expect a rabbit to bite,



00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,280
right?



00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
Beast, you hurt Demon Lord.



00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Sorry, we shouldn’t let it in.



00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,120
Give it to me.



00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,720
It’s difficult to tame this rabbit.



00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,220
I worry it’ll hurt you.



00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,800
I won’t raise it.



00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,040
I just want to kill it to revenge you.



00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,460
It’s too lenient to kill it.



00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,420
I think



00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,500
we should remove its hairs and fur,



00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,240
pull out its tendon, cut it into pieces



00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,380
and roast it on the wooden support.



00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,500
Take out the wooden support.



00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Yes.



00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,500
Wait.



00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,820
I will roast the rabbit for you to go with wine.



00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,460
Xu Feng,



00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,680
you’ve changed.



00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,380
You become horrible.



00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,220
Xu Feng,



00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,080
I’m tired.



00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,620
I want to go back to have a rest.



00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,100
You don’t want to eat this rabbit?



00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,400
I have known your mind.



00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,320
You can enjoy it alone.



00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,840
Be careful not to have a cold.



00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,920
Have a rest early.



00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,940
Lord, sorry.



00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,520
We’ll catch it.



00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,640
No need.



00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,740
You can leave.



00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,660
Yes.



00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,260
"Yujiang Palace"



00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,960
Phoenix,



00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,900
do you really hate me so much?



00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,000
You hate me so much,



00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,340
but I miss you so much.



00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,460
I miss you every day.



00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,920
I really miss you so much.



00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Sorry, Phoenix,



00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,740
I don’t mean to hurt you.



00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,560
Water.



00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,660
What?



00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,280
Water.



00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,420
Water.



00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,660
Do you want water?



00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,840
I’ll get some for you.



00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,640
<i>Write a love letter as the starting.</i>



00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,820
<i>A paragraph for ten thousands years </i>



00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,300
<i>and one line for a thousand years.</i>



00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,640
<i>We won’t forget each other</i>



00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,260
<i>for thousands of years.</i>



00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,100
Sui He.



00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,720
<i>No matter how panic the world is,</i>



00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,260
<i>From the love letter, </i>



00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,020
<i>I find the places where we fell in love in each life.</i>



00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,740
<i>I will wait for you there</i>



00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,640
<i>to enjoy the sunset together.</i>



00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,060
<i>From the love letter, </i>



00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,060
<i>I find the places where we fell in love in each life.</i>



00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,740
<i>I will sing there,</i>



00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,580
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>



00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,260
<i>From the love letter,</i>



00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,620
<i>I find the places where we made wishes in each life.</i>



00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,140
Sui He.



00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,640
They’ve been so intimate.



00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,840
I know it very well.



00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,100
I know it very well.



00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,460
Why did I come here?



00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,880
Why do I bring disgrace on myself?



00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,980
Where should I go?



00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,220
Who should I go for?



00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,440
Lord Puchi.



00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,020
Lord Puchi.



00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,060
Lord Puchi.



00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,760
Go back to Floral Realm first.



00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,320
-Glazed Pure Fire.
-Glazed Pure Fire.



00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,780
Glazed Pure Fire?



00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,680
He survived after burning by Glazed Pure Fire.



00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,400
Luckily, Jin Mi saved him in time.



00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,400
His primordial spirit is saved,



00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,700
so he is safe now.



00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,680
Who?



00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,180
Who ever hurt Lord Puchi?



00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,360
Only Fire Immortal and the late
Heavenly Empress use Glazed Pure Fire.



00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,300
The late Heavenly Empress is dead.



00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,700
Has Fire Immortal got quarrel with Lord Puchi?



00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
If Xu Feng didn’t kill my father,



00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,820
then who killed my father?



00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
I won’t tell you.



00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,640
The Beast of Dreams didn’t go to the Qiwu Palace.



00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,380
It stayed in my room.



00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:57,900
Jin Mi,



00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,420
someone must cause trouble.



00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,280
It isn’t Fire Immortal.



00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,040
It can’t be him.



00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,020
It’s someone else.



00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,220
It must be someone else.



00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,760
The person killed my father



00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,420
and made me kill Xu Feng mistakenly.



00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,760
You’re an obvious target to that person.



00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,460
Jin Mi,



00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,380
you must be careful.



00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,340
After Lord Puchi recovers his consciousness,



00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,980
the case will be entirely cleared.



00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,460
I won’t forgive that person



00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,380
as he killed my father



00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,880
and misled me to kill Xu Feng.



00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,140
It seems that you’ve been



00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,420
well-treated all these days.



00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,400
Even all your magic power has been eliminated.



00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,320
Sui He,



00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:38,020
you’ll get what you deserve someday.



00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,740
Don’t be stubborn.



00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,700
What did you say?



00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Get what I deserve?



00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,960
As you mentioned it,



00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,320
you’ll get it now.



00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,820
I’ve kept thinking



00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,460
what the most wonderful
result is for you, the traitor.



00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,500
It’s easy to kill you.



00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,620
Today, you’d rather die than live.



00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,900
Let me go.



00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,960
Let me go.



00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,440
Let me go.



00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,179
What do you want to do?



00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,980
What do you want to do?



00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,199
Let me out.



00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,719
My food is coming.



00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,239
Let me go.



00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,800
What’re you doing? Let me go.



00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Let go.



00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,540
Let me go.



00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,940
Let me go.



00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,040
You two are really friends in adversity.



00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,740
He saved you back then,



00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,120
while you saved him now.



00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,300
Mr. Hu,



00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,780
is there really no other way



00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,160
to save Lord Puchi?



00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,860
There is still one,



00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,460
but it’s too dangerous.



00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,020
Tell me.



00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,300
Have you heard of ancient evil beast Jiu Ying?



00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,960
It’s said that



00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,120
it’s the monster of water and fire



00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,860
with the property of water and fire.



00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,780
The essence of its Internal Dan
is quite marvelous.



00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,520
No matter whether one is internally hurt by



00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,520
water magic or fire magic,



00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,320
he can be cured by its Internal Dan easily.



00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,860
Is it true?



00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,720
Anyway, that’s what I heard.



00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,300
I also heard that



00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,500
about more than 1,000 years ago,



00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,480
it was eliminated by Heavenly Emperor



00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,040
and the Demon Realm.



00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,880
However, the essence of its
Internal Dan was so powerful



00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,160
that its spirit remains though its body vanished.



00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,200
It’s said that



00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,980
it is still locked in the
underground palace of Demon Realm.



00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
You can’t go.



00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,680
Don’t keep it in mind.



00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,860
Those who went for the
Internal Dan never returned.



00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,740
If anything goes wrong with you,



00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,280
I’ll be killed



00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,840
by Heavenly Emperor and Chief Peony.



00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,260
I’ll think about it again.



00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,780
I’ll look for other ways to save him



00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
in the Encyclopedia of Six Realms.



00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,580
Mu Ci,



00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,960
what’re you doing?



00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,920
No... Nothing.



00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,980
Nothing?



00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,780
You were furtive.



00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,760
What did you hide?



00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,400
In fact,



00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,620
I’m just preparing a gift for you.



00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,720
It’ll be ready



00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,580
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.



00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,520
I’ll give it to you personally



00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,400
on our wedding day.



00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,800
Really?



00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,220
Mu Ci,



00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,580
do you know why I choose



00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
to marry you that day?



00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,120
Certainly because...



00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,780
Because



00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,360
I kissed you for the first time that day.



00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,240
What? You forget it?



00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,840
Of course not.



00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,680
I keep such an important day in my mind.



00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
I won’t forget it.



00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,400
I dare you.



00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Little one.



00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,900
Mr. Hu.



00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,980
Where are you going?



00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,260
Go back to Heaven Realm.



00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,640
Go back to Heaven Realm?



00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,560
Stop kidding.



00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,300
You must go for the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,



00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,100
right?



00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,260
Lord Puchi is my friend.



00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,900
He saved me back then.



00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,900
In any case,



00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,560
I have to try my best to save him.



00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,860
No. No.



00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,940
Do you want to die?



00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,360
I shouldn’t have told you back then.



00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,940
-I shouldn’t...
-Mr. Hu,



00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,460
you always ask me to
let the matter of Rou Rou go.



00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,700
However, only when I save him



00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,840
with my own power,



00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,020
I can completely let the past go.



00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,840
Please don’t stop me.



00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,700
If Chief Peony asks you,



00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,220
tell her you know nothing.



00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,320
I won’t get you into trouble.



00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,960
No. No



00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,760
The underground palace is extremely dangerous.



00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,320
If you insist,



00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,780
I’ll go with you,



00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,220
so we can help each other.



00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,120
No.



00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,460
You have limited magic power.



00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,960
I have to protect you if you go with me.



00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,940
I'm worried to let you go alone.



00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,400
Give me your Mortal Observation Mirror.



00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,200
What for?
