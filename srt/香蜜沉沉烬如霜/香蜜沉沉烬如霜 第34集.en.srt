00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,540
"Episode 34"


3
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,880
What to do?


4
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,420
It has been all day long.


5
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,500
Jin Mi,


6
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,100
you know what,


7
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,240
I ordered to tailor


8
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,160
this phoenix robe for you


9
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,540
when you just came.


10
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,040
Every once in a while,


11
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,860
I would have it altered according to
the measurement of your figure with my eyes.


12
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,760
It has been altered for ten times now,


13
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,940
because,


14
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,220
because I was afraid that it wouldn’t fit you.


15
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,100
I didn’t expect that


16
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
it fitted you well.


17
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,100
My measurement is accurate, isn’t?


18
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,060
I have never helped any girl make up.


19
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,280
If I make you look ugly,


20
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,200
don’t blame me.


21
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,360
Originally,


22
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,300
you’re the most beautiful without makeup


23
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
in my mind,


24
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
but today


25
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,380
it’s our wedding day.


26
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,360
Bear it,


27
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,740
okay?


28
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,340
After we get married…


29
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,080
Your Majesty,


30
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,300
well…


31
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,520
There is a letter on the desk.


32
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,420
Give it to Minister Fu.


33
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,340
Your Majesty.


34
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,870
"Imperial Mausoleum"


35
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Originally,


36
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,980
the wine was for you.


37
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Now,


38
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,100
we have changed our positions.


39
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
You didn’t keep your promise,


40
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,500
but I can’t break mine.


41
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,180
I’ll do


42
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,740
what I promised you


43
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,220
one by one.


44
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,040
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>


45
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,500
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>


46
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,840
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>


47
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,680
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>


48
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,360
<i>The memory haunts me,</i>


49
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,460
<i>making me grieved.</i>


50
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,420
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>


51
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>


52
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,860
<i>A pot of clear wine…</i>


53
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,500
You can’t


54
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,080
drink it.


55
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
Let me drink it for you,


56
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
okay?


57
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,659
Anyway, you have
tortured me for such a long time.


58
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,440
This life is of no exception.


59
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,980
This life…


60
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,040
You look like a crow.


61
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,860
I’ll call you Crow afterwards, okay?


62
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,560
Crow, what are you doing here?


63
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,560
Your Majesty, the one who
loves morality just like loving a beauty.


64
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,660
Your Majesty, please be self-possessed.


65
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,960
And I look…


66
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,360
You look ugly and are disliked by all people?


67
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,600
I don’t care.


68
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,920
After I come back,


69
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,780
be my queen, OK?


70
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,780
Thank you


71
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,360
for letting me know


72
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,600
the meaning of being alive


73
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,340
in my humble and insignificant
life for the first time.


74
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,080
I know you must think


75
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,600
I give up Huaiwu willfully as its king.


76
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Don’t worry.


77
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,300
I have arranged everything properly.


78
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,940
Yuan Xi, my cousin’s son,


79
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,500
is smart and brave.


80
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Minister Fu will assist him in succession.


81
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Huaiwu will be strong in the future.


82
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,740
I didn’t expect that


83
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,740
I would be buried with you


84
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,760
at last.


85
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,720
I feel satisfied.


86
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,360
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>


87
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,680
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>


88
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,360
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>


89
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,140
Now,


90
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,400
you finally become my ugly wife,


91
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
but


92
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,480
I have never seen such a beautiful wife.


93
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,000
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>


94
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,540
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>


95
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,140
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>


96
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:30,180
<i>I know clearly all these
births and deaths in my memory.</i>


97
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,680
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>


98
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,920
You can lean on my shoulder.


99
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,580
How can


100
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,080
you do that?


101
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,060
Take good care of me afterwards.


102
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,480
Your Highness.


103
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,980
Fairy Jin Mi is indeed outstanding.


104
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
What you experienced in the Human Realm


105
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,380
has beyond my ability.


106
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,740
Don’t bother to explain.


107
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,320
I’m sure you can’t make such an amazing plan.


108
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,600
Your Highness,


109
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,740
you’re broad-minded and smart.


110
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,940
It impresses me.


111
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,300
His Majesty has been waiting for you


112
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,620
in the palace for long.


113
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,240
Please.


114
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,780
What’s wrong?


115
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,680
Nothing.


116
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,620
I didn’t expect that


117
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,700
Qiang Huo was Rou Rou.


118
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,710
What on earth


119
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,280
has perished his primordial spirit?


120
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,280
Don’t worry.


121
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,400
I’ll find out the truth.


122
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,960
Xu Feng,


123
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,000
Jin Mi,


124
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,480
you’re finally back.


125
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,960
Fox Fairy.


126
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,640
I saw what happened to you in the Human Realm


127
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,580
through the Mortal Observation Mirror.


128
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,960
It was really pathetic with ups and downs.


129
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,780
Xu Feng’s infatuation


130
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,000
was impressive.


131
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,500
Even I was touched.


132
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,820
Xu Feng,


133
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,000
you don’t


134
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,540
let me down.


135
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,060
I feel gratified.


136
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,560
Well,


137
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,560
if I write an opera


138
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
based on your story,


139
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,560
it must be popular in the six realms.


140
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,560
Yuan Ji, what do you think?


141
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,880
We’d better go in.


142
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Don’t keep His Majesty waiting.


143
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,300
Well, Xu Feng,


144
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,620
His Majesty is angry as you left privately.


145
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,940
I have to warn you that


146
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,600
you must conduct yourself well


147
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,000
in the palace later.


148
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,380
I see.


149
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,240
Your Majesty, don’t underestimate
what happened at Dongting Lake.


150
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,040
Su Li intended to rebel


151
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,520
and let her son Night Immortal


152
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,100
be the emperor.


153
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,360
Water Immortal sheltered
her for thousands of years.


154
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,840
He must have vicious intentions.


155
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,780
Night Immortal must be involved.


156
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,620
Water Immortal
shouldn’t have sheltered Su Li,


157
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,440
but Su Li was lonely and helpless,


158
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,100
so he just kept her
at the bottom of Dongting Lake.


159
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,380
It’s known to all in the Heavenly Realm that


160
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,860
he lives in the seclusion of his own home over the years,


161
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,220
so he wouldn’t conspire with Su Li.


162
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,420
Moreover,


163
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,800
Night Immortal didn’t know that his mother


164
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,480
was kept at the bottom of Dongting Lake until recently.


165
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,720
Don’t haste to make the final conclusion.


166
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,220
Rat Fairy is the conclusive evidence of their collusion.


167
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,100
Enough.


168
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,220
Now Su Li has been dead,


169
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,780
I don’t want to dredge it up.


170
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,760
Water Immortal is the cornerstone of the Heavenly Realm.


171
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,820
Night Immortal is my son.


172
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
I trust him.


173
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
Don’t guess wildly,


174
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,200
or others will laugh at us.


175
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,100
Well,


176
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,510
Water Immortal has high prestige


177
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,840
in the Heavenly Realm.


178
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,180
Don’t ruin the whole situation


179
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,060
because of some trifles.


180
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
Do you think


181
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,700
I’m not worried about their disloyalty?


182
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,880
I want to find out the truth,


183
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,880
so I make this plan.


184
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,080
You didn’t see


185
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
Run Yu wanted to kill me


186
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
when I killed Su Li.


187
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,120
He actually forgot that I brought him up.


188
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
How ungrateful he is.


189
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,800
Look what you have done.


190
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,460
So many troubles are left.


191
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,940
Enough.


192
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,820
Don’t mention it.


193
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,540
Fire Immortal comes.


194
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,320
Your Majesty.


195
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,580
Father. Mother.


196
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
You’re back.


197
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,220
You suffered in the Human Realm.


198
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,560
As the saying goes,


199
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,660
April showers bring May flowers.


200
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,119
Though you suffered bitterly,


201
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,740
you’ll succeed at last.


202
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,220
Yes.


203
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,880
Jin Mi is back.


204
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,550
Where is Water Immortal?


205
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,960
Water Immortal and Wind Immortal come.


206
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,000
Daddy.


207
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,540
-Mi.
-Daddy.


208
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,360
-Auntie Lin Xiu.
-Mi.


209
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,880
Your Majesty.


210
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,660
Jin Mi suffered


211
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,640
in the Human Realm.


212
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,520
It’s time to succeed to
the post of Floral Immortal.


213
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,340
Your Majesty, although Jin Mi is back,


214
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,340
the fate changed this time.


215
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,540
She didn’t experience the aging sorrow
among the seven sorrows in the Human Realm,


216
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,280
so she didn’t succeed.


217
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,460
She isn’t qualified to
come back to the Heaven Realm


218
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,900
and succeed to the post of Floral Immortal.


219
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,360
According to the law,


220
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,540
she should be a human again.


221
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,760
After experiencing the seven sorrows,


222
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,760
she can enter the immortal class


223
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,400
The fate of experiencing hardships
changed caused by an immortal


224
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,000
who went to the Human Realm
without authorization


225
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,000
to change Jin Mi’s fate.


226
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,140
Water Immortal, what do you mean?


227
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,140
For fairness,


228
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,380
you should ask Fire Immortal.


229
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,180
I jumped to the Cause and Effect Plate
without permission


230
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,060
changing Fairy Jin Mi’s fate.


231
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,580
It’s my fault.


232
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,080
It has nothing to do with Fairy Jin Mi.


233
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,060
Father, hope you can


234
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,940
promote Jin Mi as you promised.


235
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,620
Please punish me


236
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,800
for my mistake.


237
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,880
Xu Feng, you’re Fire Immortal,


238
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,480
but you ignore the general interest.


239
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,820
You have to to
reflect on your misdeeds in private


240
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
according to the heavenly rules.


241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
You can’t step out of the Qiwu Palace


242
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,720
in half a month.


243
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes.


244
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,000
And Jin Mi…


245
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,480
It’s true that Jin Mi has
failed in experiencing hardships.


246
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,240
If you still promote her,


247
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,580
it’s against the law in the Heaven Realm.


248
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,180
Fairy Yuan Ji.


249
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,140
Yes.


250
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Although Jin Mi just experienced


251
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
six sorrows in the Human Realm,


252
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,960
she suffered bitterly.


253
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,420
If she is promoted,


254
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,480
will there be abnormal celestial phenomena?


255
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,480
According to the law in the Heaven Realm,


256
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,200
Fairy Jin Mi


257
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,400
did fail this time.


258
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,820
Yuan Ji, out of the mouth comes evil.


259
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,940
But I calculated carefully just now.


260
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,960
Although Fairy Jin Mi


261
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,860
didn’t succeed completely this time,


262
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,400
every sorrow she experienced


263
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,400
is the bitterest hardship.


264
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,940
Her soul has become pure.


265
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,740
If she is promoted,


266
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,840
I don’t think it’ll do harm
to the immortality doctrine


267
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,600
or cause abnormal astrology phenomena.


268
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,220
Good.


269
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,200
Your Majesty, it’s related to
the immortality doctrine of the six realms.


270
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,900
Jin Mi,


271
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,680
now I announce that


272
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,810
you have entered the immortal class


273
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,310
and been promoted to be an immortal.


274
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,700
Then,


275
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,380
you should succeed to
the post of Floral Immortal.


276
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.


277
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,700
But over the years,


278
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,820
Chief Peony manages
the Floral Realm methodically.


279
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,120
Moreover, I’m fond of play and inexperienced.


280
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,760
If I become Floral Immortal,


281
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,780
I’m afraid that I have to
stay in the Floral Realm every day.


282
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,340
I want to accompany my father


283
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,100
and enjoy the happiness of family union.


284
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,940
Your Majesty, please let me do what I want.


285
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,880
Jin Mi, you don’t want to


286
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,520
be Floral Immortal?


287
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,060
Fine.


288
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,760
Anyway, you’re still young.


289
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,100
After you get married and want to settle down,


290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,780
you can succeed to the post of Floral Immortal.


291
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,220
Well,


292
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,140
we should set a wedding day


293
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,500
for Run Yu and Jin Mi.


294
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,160
-Your Majesty.
-Father.


295
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,980
Your Majesty,


296
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,360
the hardships in the Human Realm


297
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,500
have consumed much energy of Jin Mi.


298
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,820
Moreover, she was just
promoted to be an immoral.


299
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,300
She should have a good rest.


300
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,020
Moreover, when I
experienced hardships this time,


301
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,360
my good friend in the Floral Realm


302
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,740
died for my sake.


303
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,680
So I don’t want to get married now.


304
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,480
I just want to find out
the murderer as soon as possible


305
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,060
to avenge her.


306
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
Really?


307
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,520
Don’t worry.


308
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,280
I’ll make a thorough investigation.


309
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,800
But it doesn’t conflict with the wedding day.


310
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,760
Your wedding is the first priority.


311
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,420
Well,


312
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,340
choose a good day for Jin Mi and Run Yu


313
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,660
three months later.


314
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,840
What to do?


315
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,840
How about Xu Feng?


316
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,460
Well,


317
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,400
you can leave.


318
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Your Majesty, I also leave.


319
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,180
Water Immortal,


320
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,180
stay.


321
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,440
I want to talk to you.


322
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,560
Your Majesty, what’s the matter?


323
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,560
Nothing serious.


324
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,340
I just want to tell you that


325
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,960
I trust you.


326
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,300
We have been friends for long


327
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
and as intimate as brothers.


328
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,520
Moreover, our children will get married.


329
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,140
We have to help each other afterwards.


330
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,620
Sure.


331
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,180
"Zifangyun Palace"


332
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,920
You actually failed in such a good chance.


333
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,260
What a good-for-nothing.


334
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,240
Sorry to let you down. Please punish me.


335
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,400
Punish you? It’s useless.


336
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Forget it.


337
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
Bring Sui He here.


338
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,720
Yes.


339
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,120
Your Highness.


340
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,700
Your Highness, you’re back.


341
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,200
"Qiwu Palace"


342
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,160
Your Highness, you’re finally back.


343
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,640
Your Highness, Fairy Jin Mi,


344
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,480
no,


345
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,880
Immortal Jin Mi buried some
osmanthus wine beside Liuzi Pond


346
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,880
before experiencing hardships
in the Human Realm.


347
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,180
Do I need to go to take it out?


348
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,980
No need.


349
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,360
Prepare something to eat and tea.


350
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,360
OK, Your Highness.


351
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,600
Moon Immortal.


352
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
They’re so bold.


353
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,480
Xu Feng, you can’t indulge them.


354
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,700
At least, you should teach them


355
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,100
to be as steady as Lord Liaoyuan.


356
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,420
Uncle.


357
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,420
Now that you mention Lord Liaoyuan,


358
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,260
I wonder


359
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,700
why he went to the Human Realm.


360
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,320
Xu Feng.


361
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,860
Your Highness.


362
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,020
Lord Liaoyuan.


363
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,440
Maybe Lord Liaoyuan worried about you,


364
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
so he went to the Human Realm with you.


365
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,960
I really admire Lord Liaoyuan


366
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,820
for his loyalty.


367
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,600
Now I’m not allowed to go out of Qiwu Palace,


368
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,960
so I want you


369
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,580
to go to the Human Realm


370
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,580
to pick up Lord Liaoyuan for me.


371
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,400
OK, I’ll do it.


372
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,860
Oh,


373
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
I almost forget it.


374
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,760
Xu Feng,


375
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Jin Mi’s wedding day has been set.


376
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,040
What’s your plan?


377
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,220
I’ll make a prefect plan


378
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,660
to let Jin Mi


379
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,740
get rid of her unwanted marriage.


380
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,620
Uncle, don’t worry.


381
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,620
Good.


382
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,840
I’m relieved.


383
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,840
I’m going to pick up Lord Liaoyuan.


384
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,160
Thank you, Uncle.


385
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,160
Mi, look around.


386
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,040
Mi,


387
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
you just return from the Human Realm.


388
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,520
Just stay here tonight.


389
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,140
I’ll tell you as soon as
I get any news about Rou Rou.


390
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,260
You should have your own room
in the Heaven Realm


391
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,260
after becoming an immortal.


392
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,860
so your daddy prepares this room for you.


393
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,520
I didn’t know you would come back in advance,


394
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,160
so I decorated it in a hurry.


395
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,480
Auntie Lin Xiu, I like it very much.


396
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,680
Thank you.


397
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,400
Thank you, Daddy.


398
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,640
Now Jin Mi has become an immortal.


399
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,760
and her wedding day
with the first Prince has been set.


400
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,460
With these two happy things,


401
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,220
why are you worried


402
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,200
and unhappy?


403
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,120
You’re worried about


404
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,680
what happened between the second Prince and her


405
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,840
in the Human Realm?


406
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes.


407
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,800
The second Prince indeed behaved impulsively.


408
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,660
Others must gossip,


409
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,660
but I believe


410
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,660
Jin Mi is sensible.


411
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,220
What’s more,


412
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,480
the first Prince and her loved each other.


413
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,920
After some time,


414
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
she’ll know


415
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,020
what happened between the second Prince and her in the Human Realm


416
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,120
is just a dream.


417
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,900
After deep consideration,


418
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,260
she’ll make a right decision.


419
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,260
I hope so.


420
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,500
Now Jin Mi hasn’t known


421
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,920
Heavenly Empress killed her mother.


422
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,180
If she’s with the second Prince,


423
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,740
given her characters,


424
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,280
she won’t definitely face this truth.


425
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,860
We’d better not tell her about it.


426
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,980
Just see her decision.


427
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,320
No,


428
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,980
it’s inhuman.


429
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,180
Your Majesty,


430
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,120
you still love her?


431
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,900
Impossible.


432
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,660
Your Majesty, don’t mention the past things.


433
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,320
But she wanted


434
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,140
to overturn our governance.


435
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,940
She asked Rat Fairy


436
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,120
to kill Xu Feng during his nirvana.


437
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,560
In this battle of Dongting Lake,


438
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,960
I verify she privately maintained
tens of thousands of picked soldiers,


439
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,820
attempting to overturn our Heaven Realm.


440
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,820
It’s horrible.


441
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,460
Although Su Li committed heinous crimes,


442
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,880
exterminating her whole family


443
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,780
is a heavy punishment.


444
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,120
In this way,


445
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,380
our Heaven Realm will be discredited.


446
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,120
Your Majesty, you should know


447
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,140
the whole Arowana Family was eliminated


448
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,780
except Su Li thousands of years ago,


449
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,140
but then,


450
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,500
she created so many disturbances again.


451
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,200
If you’re still so tolerant


452
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,600
and let the remnants of Dongting Lake go,


453
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,440
they’ll become powerful enemies,


454
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,440
and,


455
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,960
now Su Li’s son


456
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,960
lives with us.


457
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,420
If they collaborate…


458
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,240
Run Yu has been living
with us since his childhood.


459
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,940
You know his characters well.


460
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,840
Current innocence can’t
ensure the eternal innocence.


461
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,100
You should know


462
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,980
the wild ambition can be developed,


463
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,480
as long as the time comes.


464
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,960
If you want to protect two sons,


465
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,540
you must make up your mind


466
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,280
to eliminate her whole family.


467
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,240
I should accept


468
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,240
your kindness,


469
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,560
but the Heaven Realm always advocates peace.


470
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,380
Such a heavy punishment is objectionable.


471
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,160
You don’t need to do it personally.


472
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,280
Leave it to me.


473
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,280
I worry


474
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,100
it’ll


475
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
discredit you.


476
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,760
For the sake of two sons


477
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,200
and our Heaven Realm,


478
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,860
I’m willing to be a demon.


479
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,920
I see.


480
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,940
Xu Feng,


481
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,700
I’ll eliminate all your enemies.


482
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,860
"Memorial Tablet of Immortal Su Li"


483
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,380
Your Highness.


484
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,780
You come just in time.


485
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,640
Invite Li and Yan You here


486
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,080
to kowtow to mom.


487
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,380
They’re caught by soldiers.


488
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,680
What?


489
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,580
Heavenly Empress wants to
kill those 30,000 living beings of Dongting.


490
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,980
When will she do it?


491
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,120
Maybe Thunder God and
Lightning Goddess have been on their way.


492
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,740
Father.


493
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,380
Father.


494
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,160
30,000 living beings in Dongting Lake


495
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,420
are innocent.


496
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,400
Now that my mom...


497
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,220
Su Li is dead,


498
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,160
Heavenly Empress doesn’t
need to do such a merciless thing.


499
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,080
Please


500
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,220
save them.


501
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,740
I guarantee


502
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,460
they won’t create any disturbance again.


503
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,140
Heavenly Empress is right.


504
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,600
Su Li rebelled and committed heinous crimes.


505
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,560
She should be punished according to the law,


506
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,800
though I’m also loath


507
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,800
to kill so many living beings.


508
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,100
Now that Heavenly Empress
actively issues an order to kill them for me,


509
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,840
I can’t refuse her.


510
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,840
As my eldest son,


511
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,380
you can’t take the lead to break the law.


512
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,440
But, Father…


513
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,980
Stop that.


514
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,880
Just leave.


515
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,960
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess
aren’t in the execution ground


516
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
but the Empyrean Cloud Palace.


517
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,980
I seem to be the real criminal


518
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,840
Mother wants to punish.


519
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,200
Those 30,000 remnants of Dongting


520
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,260
should be killed,


521
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,840
but they did that for you,


522
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,360
so you should also be punished.


523
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,400
They’re all weak and innocent living beings.


524
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,760
Please let them off, Mother.


525
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,200
Mother?


526
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,630
That day,


527
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:21,600
when you wanted to kill me to revenge your mom,


528
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,680
how imposing and insolent you were.


529
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,100
What’s wrong with you today?


530
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,540
You’re not insolent


531
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,280
I’m wrong.


532
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,900
Just punish me,


533
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,520
but 30,000 living beings of Dongting


534
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,340
are innocent.


535
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,580
Those 30,000 remnants and your mom


536
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,500
hatched a sinister plot


537
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,200
and wanted to overturn the Heaven Realm.


538
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,380
They deserve more than death.


539
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,460
Punishment should


540
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,360
fit the crime.


541
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,920
Even if my mom hated you,


542
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,920
she never really rebelled,


543
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,580
but you first…


544
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,580
Shut up.


545
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,219
You plotted to kill Xu Feng
and privately maintained picked soldiers


546
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,420
to rebel.


547
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,980
You deserve death.


548
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,639
I should directly kill you!


549
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,900
Yes.


550
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,699
I’m wrong.


551
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,920
Please let us off.


552
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,460
Night Immortal,


553
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,400
you’re not wrong.


554
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,840
Brother.


555
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,880
Li.


556
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,199
Yan You.


557
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,960
Mother.


558
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,219
Thunder God, Lightning Goddess,


559
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,620
how to deal with these remnants?


560
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,160
According to the law,


561
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,120
they should be killed
by Heavenly Thunder and Lightning Fire.


562
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,080
OK.


563
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,680
Execute.


564
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,380
Wait a minute.


565
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,100
I’m wrong.


566
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,100
I’m ungrateful.


567
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,780
I shouldn’t offend you,


568
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,420
but,


569
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,020
but my mom is dead.


570
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,580
They can no longer pose a threat to you.


571
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,960
Please


572
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,840
let them off.


573
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,560
I wonder


574
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,820
whether you’re virtuous and kind-hearted


575
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,440
or hypocritical.


576
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,200
Su Li plotted to kill Xu Feng.
She committed a heinous crime,


577
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,000
so she should be punished,


578
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,760
right?


579
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
Right?


580
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,900
Yes.


581
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Run Yu,


582
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,960
Damn you!


583
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,120
Foster mother always
cared for you in the past thousands of years.


584
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
You’re not qualified to be her son.


585
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,640
So, you beg me as Night Immortal,


586
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,180
a remnant of Dongting


587
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,860
or the left orphan of Arowana Family?


588
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,740
I,


589
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,320
I,


590
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,100
Foster mother never accepted you.


591
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,340
Leave here right now.


592
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,800
Yan You.


593
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,660
I’m responsible for my mom’s crimes.


594
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,840
I’m willing to be punished for my mom.


595
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,060
Please don’t transfer your anger on others.


596
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,940
Forget it.


597
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,480
I’m reasonable.


598
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,760
Two choices.


599
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,880
Make a clean break
with these remnants of Dongting,


600
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,940
and execute the punishment personally,


601
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,880
or, take the blame for the remnants


602
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,700
and to atone for your mom.
