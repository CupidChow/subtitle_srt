1
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,390
“Ashes of Love”


2
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,980
"Episode 13


3
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,900
Thanks for your favour, Fairy Jin Mi.


4
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,920
I like you, too.


5
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,100
How come you and the Night Immortal...


6
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,820
Do you know who is Jin Mi?


7
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
Do you know why Jin Mi can create flowers?


8
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,520
Do you know about the Liuzi Pond in my Qiwu Palace?


9
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,840
Do you know the name of the past Floral Immortal?


10
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,500
Do you know that Jin Mi is water by nature?


11
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,280
Do you know that the past Floral Immortal’s real body
is a piece of water lily?


12
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,840
Do you know


13
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,720
you, me, and Jin Mi


14
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,060
are half-siblings?


15
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Oh my God.


16
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
How come I, a grape


17
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,340
have so many


18
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,420
birds and beasts relatives?


19
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,800
If this is true,


20
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,300
then the Heavenly Empress would be my stepmother.


21
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,720
So horrible!


22
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,960
It’s OK.


23
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,160
Even though we three are siblings,


24
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,860
the situation is not bad.


25
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,680
Fairy Jin Mi, tell me.


26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Besides me,


27
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,560
do you like Xu Feng?


28
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,160
Yes, I like him.


29
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
What about the Moon Immortal?


30
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,640
Of course.


31
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,420
What about Yan You?


32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Yes.


33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,280
What about Liao Ting and Fei Xu, the servants of Qiwu Palace?


34
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,120
Yes.


35
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,060
What about Chief Peony?


36
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,220
If Chief Peony


37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,180
won’t be so hard to me in the future,


38
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,620
I will like her all the better.


39
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,460
Forget it. You are so heartless.


40
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,640
If you still want to be alive,


41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
then go back to the Floral Realm with me.


42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,960
No. I don’t want to.


43
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,380
I’m useless.


44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
I didn’t expect that His Highness would be bewitched by Jin Mi to such a degree


45
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,420
that he ruined your birthday.


46
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,519
That sprite went to the banquet in disguise, so I don’t blame you.


47
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,820
But she dared


48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,820
to show her real body in front of Heavenly Emperor and Highness who is in charge of water.


49
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,280
What’s her intention?


50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
The Heaven Realm is a quiet place,


51
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,640
but the Rat Fairy even brought a rat to the banquet,


52
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,360
making such a mess.


53
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,620
Although it is unintentional, it is really absurd.


54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
So funny.


55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,780
The Snake Fairy went to the banquet with a sprite.


56
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,840
And the sprite was scared by the Rat Fairy.


57
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,000
I’m not sure.


58
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,940
I will check it out.


59
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,640
To say something improper,


60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,280
His Highness and the Night Immortal


61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,880
have unusual relationship with this girl.


62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,780
If left unrestrained,


63
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,720
I’m afraid they will make the same mistake as the Heavenly Emperor


64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,720
and Water immortal.


65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,800
In addition, the Snake Fairy,Yan You, has always been infamous.


66
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,220
Aunty, don’t forget


67
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,660
why he was demoted thousands of years ago.


68
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,240
Is it possible


69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
that another Zi Fen exists in the six realms?


70
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,240
I don’t allow


71
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,280
something that can bring disasters and chaos to the Heaven Realm to happen again.


72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,760
Leave it. Go back and take some rest now.


73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,080
Yes, aunty.


74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Your Majesty.


75
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,140
Go and check the information


76
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,780
about those lower-level fairies who came to the banquet today,


77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,640
especially the twelve zodiac fairies.


78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,440
Check it carefully.


79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,540
I’m wondering


80
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,520
which sprite dared to ruin my birthday banquet.


81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,180
Yes, Your Majesty.


82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,680
How is Jin Mi?


83
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,420
She’s fine.


84
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,860
Besides, her magic power is stronger.


85
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,180
I cooked some soothing medicine for her.


86
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,280
Let her drink it and go to bed early.


87
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,940
This time Jin Mi showed her real body in the Heaven Realm.


88
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,840
I am afraid that her birth information will be uncovered.


89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,900
It’s ridiculous that the Fire Immortal


90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,180
thinks he is Jin Mi’s half brother,


91
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,260
closest relative.


92
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,100
He?


93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,180
He doesn’t deserve it at all.


94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,300
There is nothing wrong about making him misunderstand and give up the hope completely.


95
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,680
Don’t forget


96
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,820
how the past Floral Immortal died.


97
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,820
This is a deadly feud.


98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,420
No matter what happens,


99
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,580
Jin Mi shouldn’t have any connection with the sons of Heavenly Empress and Heavenly Emperor


100
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
any more.


101
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,280
Do you know who is Jin Mi?


102
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,780
Do you know why Jin Mi can create flowers?


103
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,420
Do you know about the Liuzi Pond in my Qiwu Palace?


104
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,900
Do you know the name of the past Floral Immortal?


105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,120
Do you know that Jin Mi is water by nature?


106
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,180
Do you know that the past Floral Immortal’s real body is a piece of water lily?


107
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,300
Do you know


108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,380
you, me, and Jin Mi


109
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,780
are half-siblings?


110
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,960
What is the connection between Liuzi Pond and my ability to create flowers?


111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,600
What is the relation between the past Floral Immortal’ s real body and name and me?


112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,280
How come we three become half brothers and sister


113
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,760
in a blink of an eye?


114
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,280
The Heavenly Empress becomes my stepmother.


115
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,080
Phoenix’s thinking is really leaping.


116
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,080
The past Floral Immortal wanted Jin Mi to be a free and happy fairy


117
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,580
without getting involved in any worldly


118
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
romantic relationship.


119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,220
We should definitely keep this secret


120
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,660
as long as possible.


121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,780
What's more,


122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,300
Jin Mi haven’t experienced her destined disaster.


123
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,440
So it is really improper for her to leave the Floral Realm.


124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,920
From now on,


125
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,220
we take turns to spend the night on watch, staying in the courtyard.


126
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes.


127
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,539
But now,


128
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,200
everyone has seen Jin Mi’s real body.


129
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,760
I am afraid that the Heavenly Emperor will come and ask for explanation.


130
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,260
How dare he!


131
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
If he dares to ask about this,


132
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,100
then let him go to the Floral Immortal’s Mausoleum and reason with the past Floral Immortal.


133
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,960
What a close call!


134
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,040
I can’t hear clearly what they were saying,


135
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,740
but I think it is something good for me.


136
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,060
Although it’s very boring to practice in Water Mirror,


137
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,000
it’s better than being taken and killed


138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
by the God of Thunder and the Goddess of Lightening.


139
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,660
What do you think, Rou Rou?


140
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,220
So sleepy.


141
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,120
I have run away.


142
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,760
But he still catches me back in my dreams.


143
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,360
Why is Heavenly Emperor so stingy as his wife is?


144
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,440
I venture to take you


145
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,240
to this Fantasy Land.


146
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,200
I hope that you don’t mind.


147
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,160
Not to condemn me...


148
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,500
Your Majesty, you are too modest.


149
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
I didn’t expect that


150
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,660
I would actually meet Your Majesty in the dream.


151
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,140
This is Fantasy Land


152
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,480
a place where the Immortals travel and practice.


153
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,120
Occasionally the illusion appears in the Human Realm.


154
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,660
Human beings would call it “Mirage”,


155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
thinking that it is formed .


156
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,940
by the breath of toads in the sea.


157
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,020
When I first heard this,


158
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,420
I couldn’t help but laugh,


159
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,360
thinking that human beings were ignorant.


160
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,980
Until 90,000 years ago,


161
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,760
when I traveled here at night


162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,140
and saw her stepping on the water


163
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,680
with lotus following after her every step.


164
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,800
Removing the mist


165
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,540
that hid her face when she glanced back,


166
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,700
I started to know what is fantasy,


167
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,660
and what is mirage.


168
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,920
I’m Taiwei, from the Heaven Realm.


169
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,220
May I have your name?


170
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,980
Since she passed away,


171
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,940
there have been no flowers in the Heaven Realm.


172
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,760
I haven’t been here for a long time.


173
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,580
So alike.


174
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,260
Just now in the mist,


175
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,380
I nearly got the wrong person.


176
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,260
But when I look at you carefully,


177
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
I find nothing alike.


178
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,380
She didn’t like laughing.


179
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,260
During the 90,000 years when we knew each other,


180
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,800
I saw her laugh only ten times.


181
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,740
Her occasional laughing wouldn’t last long.


182
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,640
She is not as bright and sweet


183
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,140
as you.


184
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,120
If without me,


185
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,080
during these 90,000 years,


186
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,100
she would have laughed a lot,


187
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,200
and wouldn’t have ended her life in loneliness


188
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,940
like this.


189
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,420
The dead person has gone.


190
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,820
Please restrain your grief, Your Majesty.


191
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,660
There have been no plants in the Heaven Realm and this Fantasy Land


192
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,300
for over four thousand years.


193
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,440
I heard that you can create flowers.


194
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,540
You might as well plant some green lotus here.


195
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,660
Why did he suddenly mention planting flowers?


196
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,020
He’s really Phoenix’s father.


197
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,080
Even his thinking is so leaping, too.


198
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,620
According to Phoenix,


199
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,760
he seems to be my father, too.


200
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,540
So I should fulfill my filial duty.


201
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,860
OK.


202
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,100
Sure enough.


203
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,520
Sure enough.


204
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,060
Please retrain your grief, Your Majesty.


205
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,420
I can only do this


206
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,560
to comfort you.


207
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,720
Do you know who I was talking about?


208
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,100
I’m still so young, and I have stayed in the Water Mirror for long time.


209
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,380
The people I know


210
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,640
are some


211
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
vegetables and fruits.


212
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,600
I really don’t know any reserved person


213
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,640
who only laughs once ten thousand years


214
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,800
like you talked about just now.


215
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
But as for those shallow ones who laugh ten times a day,


216
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,700
there are plenty of them.


217
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,880
Please don’t mind my lack of experiences.


218
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,280
I don’t know who you were talking about, Your Majesty.


219
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,980
The person I talked about just now


220
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,940
is the Floral Immortal Zi Fen.


221
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,680
You are more than four thousand years old.


222
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,700
Is it possible that you have never seen Zi Fen?


223
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Never.


224
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,620
I didn’t expect that


225
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,380
she actually hated me so much


226
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,940
that she even didn’t want to see her child.


227
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,540
Your...Your Majesty.


228
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,580
You..you can’t say something that is not true.


229
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,720
This dream is too strange.


230
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,560
Why does the Heavenly Emperor


231
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
come to my dreams?


232
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,260
The past Floral Immortal is a piece of lotus.


233
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
And I am a grape.


234
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,460
How come she is my mother?


235
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,060
The father and the son’s thinking


236
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,740
are so leaping.


237
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,260
No, this is my dream.


238
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,220
It seems that my thinking is leaping.


239
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,880
It’s Phoenix’s fault.


240
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,880
In the daytime, he always talks about things that are not real.


241
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,620
I’m dreaming so deeply. It’s time to wake up.


242
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,880
It seems that it is not a common dream.


243
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,040
Forget it. Since I’m in dream now, I should enjoy it.


244
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
I don’t have many chances to meet the Heavenly Emperor.


245
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,760
It’s better to ask him for some magic power.


246
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,700
To have a dream of getting much magic power


247
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,540
is so worthwhile.


248
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,480
Your Majesty.


249
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,380
If you like to watch me plant flowers,


250
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,040
I can often plant flowers for you.


251
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,600
And it’s also OK if you assign me to be a gardener in the Heaven Realm.


252
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,460
But...


253
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,560
But..


254
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,960
What’s wrong?


255
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,660
If you have any difficulties, let me know.


256
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,640
My magic power is not strong.


257
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,480
Although I have practiced hard


258
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,120
I’m still an elf.


259
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
I know some tricks of planting flowers and grasses,


260
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,180
but I still need the power from the outside


261
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,340
to create them.


262
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,680
So you have seen my poor performance, Your Majesty.


263
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,600
Zi Fen must have sealed your spirit.


264
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,040
How about this?


265
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,460
I’ll give you some magic power.


266
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,000
And you go back and practice for 49 days.


267
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,920
Then your real body will show up.


268
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,040
How can I afford to the magic power you give me,


269
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,940
Your Majesty?


270
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,260
Good girl.


271
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,160
You don’t have to be so distant to me.


272
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,780
It is a matter of righteousness


273
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,720
that I give you some magic power.


274
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,660
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.


275
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,960
But your power is not strong,


276
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,300
so I can only give you five thousand years’ magic power.


277
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
Five thousand years.


278
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,000
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.


279
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,160
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.


280
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
If I hadn’t make that mistake tens of thousands of years ago,


281
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,440
the Chiefs of Floral Realm wouldn’t have considered the Heaven Realm as enemy.


282
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,600
And we wouldn’t have had to see each other in dreams at night.


283
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,060
Sorry to make you feel wronged.


284
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,500
I don’t feel wronged.


285
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,000
Not at all.


286
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,900
You give me five thousand years of magic power in one night.


287
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,400
You don’t even feel wronged. Why should I feel wronged?


288
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,780
I hope this is not just a dream.


289
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,520
As for what I owe Suifen,


290
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,800
I will slowly make compensation for you.


291
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,740
But you should keep one thing in mind.


292
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,040
Go ahead, Your Majesty.


293
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,740
I will do whatever you ask me to do at all costs.


294
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,600
You should keep in mind


295
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,100
that you can’t have any romantic relationship


296
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,880
with Xu Feng and Run Yu.


297
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,080
Understand?


298
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,200
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.


299
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,340
It’s easy.


300
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,460
It’s easy.


301
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Are you thinking about the grape elf


302
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,620
who appeared at the birthday banquet of the Heavenly Empress?


303
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,960
That elf and she do have some resemblance.


304
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,180
For when I saw that elf


305
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,820
I keep thinking about Zi Fen.


306
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,540
In these years,


307
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,680
you never mentioned Zi Fen in front of me.


308
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,100
But I know,


309
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,800
in your heart


310
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,960
she has never left.


311
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,080
Linxiu,


312
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,240
it’s really unfair for you


313
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,420
to marry me.


314
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,400
I’m not blaming you.


315
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,960
In these years, we have respected each other like guests,


316
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,320
living a peaceful life. I’m already satisfied.


317
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,380
It’s just that seeing your heart still closed,


318
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,740
I feel sad for you.


319
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,160
Linxiu.


320
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,160
If you miss her,


321
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,280
then just go to see her.


322
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,540
OK.


323
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,460
All right.


324
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,820
It’s too late now.


325
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,680
Go to bed early.


326
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,020
You, too.


327
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,980
You took action first without my permission,


328
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,340
letting that sprite go back to the Floral Realm.


329
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,860
And then you come to report your guilt now.


330
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Mother, please don’t be angry.


331
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,180
You, the Fire Immortal


332
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,640
are the noble son of the Heavenly Emperor.


333
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,180
Everyday so many people watch you.


334
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,000
But you make friends


335
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,700
with that bad-mannered sprite who even hasn’t entered the immortality.


336
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,020
And because of her,


337
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,340
you even argued with me in public.


338
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,360
How can I feel relieved?


339
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,440
Jin Mi has saved my life for many times.


340
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
And because her power is weak,


341
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,080
I have to help her.


342
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,560
Jin Mi is young and ignorant, knowing little about the manners and rules.


343
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,460
But she is not malicious.


344
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,100
Tell me.


345
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,120
Do you really just want to repay her?


346
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,880
Or you already have affection for her?


347
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,580
No.


348
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,380
Good.


349
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,560
Then promise me


350
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,380
that you will never see that sprite again.


351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Then I will forgive her.


352
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,980
Yesterday I promised Chief Peony


353
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,860
that I will not see Jin Mi again.


354
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,420
Mother, you can feel relieved now.


355
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,980
Relieved?


356
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,960
Only when you really become the Heavenly Emperor,


357
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,700
leading the Heaven Realm,


358
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
marrying Sui He and having kids


359
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,960
can I really feel relieved.


360
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,100
You’re thinking too much, Mother.


361
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,780
I have to go to the drill ground and train the soldiers.


362
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,280
I need to leave now.


363
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,560
If I hadn’t have thought much,


364
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,020
how can you enjoy the current status?


365
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,860
Your Highness, you just rested for a little while after the night patrol.


366
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,060
Why bother to go to Floral Realm in a hurry,


367
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,020
making yourself tired?


368
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,020
I heard that Chief Peony has always been strict with younger generations.


369
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,680
This time, I secretly took Jin Mi to the Human Realm without her permission,


370
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,820
and even nearly made a disaster in the Heaven Realm.


371
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,020
I am afraid that Chief Peony will not forgive Jin Mi easily.


372
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,540
I am going to the Floral Realm.


373
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,820
You don't have to follow me.


374
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,020
Yes, Your Highness.


375
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,140
Oops!


376
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,360
She will not forgive Jin Mi easily.


377
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,800
The Heavenly Empress have already borne grudge against you, Your Highness.


378
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,360
At this time, if you go there hastily,


379
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,920
I am afraid things will get worse.


380
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,080
And the problems will be more difficult to solve.


381
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,460
Xu Feng was so sure yesterday


382
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,960
that Jin Mi is Father’s daughter.


383
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,940
The way Father looked at Jin Mi yesterday


384
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,900
was really unusual.


385
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,800
I’m going to ask Father for help.


386
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,760
OK.


387
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,880
Then I’ll go to the Floral Realm to make a thorough inquiry.


388
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,360
Be careful.


389
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,700
I, Jin Mi, a fruit elf


390
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,960
pretended to be a descendant of the past Floral Immortal


391
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,220
and got five thousand years’ magic power from the Heavenly Emperor.


392
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,780
You are a great person and won’t care about the faults of the petty ones.


393
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,280
You won’t blame me, right?


394
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,280
I don't know what you like to eat.


395
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,900
If you need anything,


396
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,120
you can tell me in my dreams.


397
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,240
I will take good care of you


398
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,060
at all costs.


399
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,940
Here, I would like to express my thanks to you.


400
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,900
In fact, I should celebrate such a lucky thing


401
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,620
with everyone.


402
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,720
But I am not in the Heaven Realm,


403
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,920
so I can only invite Lord Puchi to celebrate this thing with me.


404
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,080
Heavenly...Heavenly Empress.


405
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,080
I could call Lord Puchi before with small part of my power.


406
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,440
I didn’t expect that I would be able to call Heavenly Empress


407
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,880
after my magic power gets much stronger.


408
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,720
Your Majesty.


409
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,500
Why are you here?


410
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,440
Before you die,


411
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,460
I would like to teach you some manners.


412
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,560
Your Majesty.


413
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,620
What are you doing?


414
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,220
What manner?


415
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,280
I don't care who you are.


416
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
And I don’t care what relationship you have


417
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,200
with Xu Feng and Runyu.


418
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,120
Just because of your face,


419
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,320
I would like to kill you thousands of times.


420
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,420
You and Zi Fen really have a bond.


421
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,940
You will die a worthy death here.


422
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,380
I don’t know what you mean.


423
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,320
How long ago?


424
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,740
It’s been half an hour.


425
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,160
Mother, please don’t be impulsive and angry.


426
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,420
If Father you are a bit late, I am afraid that Jin Mi will...


427
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,340
Jin Mi is my child.


428
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,820
If I go to stop Tuyao hastily,


429
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
she won’t let Jin Mi go easily.


430
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,640
How about this?


431
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,360
You pass on my order quickly.


432
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,580
Ask your Mother to come back, telling her that there are things to discuss


433
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,820
about rewarding fairies and forgiving the sins in the Heaven Realm


434
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,300
after her birthday.


435
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,480
Since Jin Mi is Father’s child,


436
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,160
she is also my sister.


437
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,440
Please don’t worry, Father.


438
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,940
I will try my best to protect her.


439
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,000
Mister Water Immortal.


440
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,960
Don't you know the law of superiority and inferiority ?


441
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,500
Why are you here to interfere with me


442
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,420
instead of going to making wind and rain?


443
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,860
I certainly know the law of superiority and inferiority.


444
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,180
But the past Floral Immortal and I are old friends.


445
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,300
Today, I’m here to show my worship.


446
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,500
But I didn’t expect that


447
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,620
this child was almost killed by someone.


448
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,620
I’m here to punish a little floral elf.


449
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,020
It’s none of your business.


450
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,760
Jin Mi is an elf of the Floral Realm.


451
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,600
Since it is in the Floral Realm,


452
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,760
only the Floral Immortal and Chief Peony have the right to decide who is guilty and deserves punishment.


453
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,760
Zi Fen has passed away.


454
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,560
In front of her tomb,


455
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,400
how can you bear to lay murderous hands


456
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,260
on such a low-level elf?


457
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,820
You said you knew the law of superiority and inferiority.


458
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,400
But actually,


459
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,080
you are here just for the sake of Zi Fen.


460
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,480
You do this,


461
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,880
just because this sprite


462
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,120
looks a little like Zi Fen, right?


463
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,320
In view of the public and personal concerns,


464
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,820
I can’t let you do this.


465
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,420
Do you think you can stop me?


466
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,540
Mother, I’ve been looking for you for long time.


467
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,780
Fish Fairy.


468
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,120
Mister Water Immortal.


469
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,320
Fish Fairy, please save me.


470
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,200
Mother.


471
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,160
I haven’t allowed you to stand up.


472
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,340
Mother,


473
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,280
I’m here just to perform Father’s order.


474
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,280
He asked you to go back to the Empyrean Heaven quickly


475
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,800
to discuss things about rewarding fairies and forgiving sins in the Heaven Realm.


476
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,120
Your Majesty, you are a motherly model in the Heaven Realm.


477
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,040
So you should assume your personal command in the Heaven Realm, minding your words and behaviors.


478
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,060
If you disturb the Chiefs of Floral Realm,


479
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,740
bringing the arguments to His Majesty,


480
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,140
I am afraid it will damage your good reputation


481
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,080
of virtue and kindheartedness.


482
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,900
Very good.


483
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,400
Night Immortal, you can do things independently now.


484
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,000
You are more and more powerful,


485
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,920
daring to conspire against me with others.


486
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,860
I don’t dare.


487
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,020
Mother,


488
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,560
please.


489
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,820
Mister Water Immortal. Fairy Jin Mi.


490
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,620
See you.


491
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,420
Thank you so much, Mister Water Immortal.


492
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,500
Fairy Jin Mi, are you here to accompany Zi Fen by her tomb?


493
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,960
It’s just a trivial thing.


494
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,140
Jin Mi...Jin Mi.


495
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,040
looking for peace among the blooming flowers;


496
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,740
leading a life of floating clouds and water.


497
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,040
These are two lines of poem


498
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,900
that hung in front of Zi Fen’s desk when she’s alive.


499
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,980
I copied these two lines of poem, mounted and hung them for her.


500
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,720
I didn’t know


501
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,480
Zi Fen still has a child left in the world.


502
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,240
Mister Water Immortal.


503
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,800
According to what you said,


504
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,940
am I really the child


505
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,480
of the past Floral Immortal and the Heavenly Emperor?


506
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,040
Lord Puchi


507
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,160
Jin Mi.


508
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,120
Can you improve your accuracy?


509
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,580
You will get my bone broken sooner or later.


510
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,660
I’m being so rude. Mister Water Immortal.


511
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,200
Yan You, are you here to play?


512
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,500
No, no, no.


513
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,320
I never go about in the hope of finding girls.


514
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,060
I trespass the Floral Realm,


515
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,340
just because Jin Mi called me.


516
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,220
Your magic power becomes stronger.


517
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,220
Is it you who called Mister Water Immortal?


518
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,740
When you call Yan You,


519
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,080
what spell do you use ?


520
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,440
My magic power is weak.


521
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,620
I just use the common call spell.


522
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,680
The real body of Yan You is a water snake.


523
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,260
Can you call water?


524
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,920
The Fire Immortal said that my body constitution is coldness-oriented.


525
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,100
So he let me practice some water-related magics.


526
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,660
I created hail stone twice.


527
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,620
But I have never tried to call water.


528
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,280
Then try it.


529
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,640
Me?


530
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,480
Now?


531
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:08,840
Fine.


532
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,320
Then I’m going to try it today


533
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,080
in front of Mister Water Immortal.


534
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,640
Call!


535
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,320
You still can't call water with your magic power.


536
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,120
I’ll try again.


537
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,000
Call!


538
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,880
Jin Mi, you are just a common elf.


539
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,020
Why parade your ability?


540
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,880
How about this?


541
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,920
Such a big cloud.


542
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,260
It’s so dark.


543
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,540
Jin Mi


544
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,440
Chief Peony.


545
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,520
Mister Water Immortal, what’s wrong with Jin Mi?


546
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,280
Look!


547
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,100
It’s snowing.


548
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,500
I can call snow.


549
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,160
I can call it.


550
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,940
Your Highness.


551
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,380
Why did Highness who is in charge of water go to the Floral Realm?


552
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,880
It seems that he went there to worship the past Floral Immortal.


553
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,659
The Heavenly Empress was going to kill Jin Mi


554
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,260
and destroy the past Floral Immortal’s Mausoleum.


555
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,280
I didn’t expect that Mister Water Immortal would arrive in time


556
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,179
and save Jin Mi’s life,


557
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,360
even at the cost of offending the Heavenly Empress.


558
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,460
Water Immortal has never cared about the worldly things.


559
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,199
But when he saw Jin Mi


560
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,179
his reactions were too unusual.


561
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,219
I’m going to the Floral Realm again.


562
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,699
If the Heavenly Empress attempts to hurt Jin Mi again, inform me quickly.


563
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,660
How is Jin Mi?


564
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,980
Is it because of too much lost of magic power?


565
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,460
That heavy snow was called by Jin Mi.


566
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,220
If Jin Mi is not water by nature,


567
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,820
how can she call Yan You?


568
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,840
What’s the real identity of Jin Mi?


569
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,600
If Jin Mi is just a common elf,


570
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,060
why are you and Chief Begonia


571
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,560
being so nervous?


572
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,460
I’m just a floral fairy of the Floral Realm.


573
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,520
Water Immortal, don’t you


574
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,380
know what you have done?


575
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,240
Do you need others to tell you the truth?


576
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,520
Jin Mi looks like Zi Fen so much,


577
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,960
but she said she was a grape.


578
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,020
I really can't figure out the reason for this.


579
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,280
Jin Mi has been taken care of by you since she was born.


580
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,580
Today, only the Chiefs of Floral Realm


581
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,660
can tell me the truth.


582
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,480
I said that Jin Mi’s tendency to be confused is born by nature.


583
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,220
It turns out that there is some reason for this.


584
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,560
Did you say...


585
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,020
Is Jin Mi really...


586
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,180
Don’t ask me, Water Immortal.


587
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,940
I can’t tell you everything.


588
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,740
We Chiefs swore in front of the Floral Immortal.


589
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,120
If we leak out anything about Jin Mi’s birth,


590
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,280
we will destroy our souls.


591
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,840
Please forgive me, Water Immortal.


592
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,960
The essential Qi in Jin Mi’s body is in disorder.


593
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,500
Did you give Jin Mi magic power?


594
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,980
This is the first time I privately met Jin Mi.


595
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,520
The magic power in Jin Mi’s body is so strong


596
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,520
and overwhelming.


597
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,720
With my ability,


598
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,740
I can't dissolve it.


599
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,540
For the sake of Jin Mi’s life,


600
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,280
we don’t have other choices .


601
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,400
How is Jin Mi?


602
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,260
The Yang Qi in Jin Mi body is very strong.


603
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,200
I don't know who


604
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,560
gave her so much Yang Qi,


605
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,200
which contradicts her Yin nature.


606
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,480
If I weren’t here today,


607
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,060
I am afraid that she would be in danger.


608
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,160
Thank you so much, Mister Water Immortal.


609
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
If something wrong happened to Jin Mi,


610
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,020
how


611
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,120
can we explain to the past Floral Immortal?


612
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,480
Jin Mi


613
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,460
turns out to be my child.
