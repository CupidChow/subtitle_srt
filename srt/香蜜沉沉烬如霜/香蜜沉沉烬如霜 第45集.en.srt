1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 45"


3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,340
Anyway


4
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,760
I won’t let you marry him.


5
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Black hair


6
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,400
represents lingering affection.


7
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,260
I’m afraid that


8
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
it’s impossible for us to be together again now.


9
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,079
Here you are.


10
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,120
This black hair can present my affection.


11
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,860
I wish your heart is just like mine.


12
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,580
Don’t worry. I have a plan.


13
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,920
But you must wait


14
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
before the end of the wedding ceremony


15
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,579
in three days.


16
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,079
Exercising government by means
of virtue is like the Polaris.


17
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,079
It’s in its place with all the stars twinkling around it.


18
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,640
The proud loong repents but goes its own way.


19
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Being close to courtiers and alienating virtuous
ministers are the faults of Heavenly Emperor.


20
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,480
Heavenly Emperor is brutal


21
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,240
and the Polaris lacks virtue and losses its brilliance.


22
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,880
What should we do?


23
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,060
Decide the right path and correct the wrong path.


24
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
Bring order out of chaos


25
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,950
and choose anther wise ruler


26
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,080
to replace him.


27
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,580
The son manages the army of the father,
but doesn’t know where to stop.


28
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,060
Run Yu is wrong.


29
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,660
Your Highness, what should we do?


30
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,680
Clean up the world


31
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,230
and help the six realms in distress.


32
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Fight to win or die and storm the enemy's den.


33
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,500
Conquer qian with kun and seize qian yuan first.


34
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,420
Li is above and kan is below.
Control the north gate in the middle.


35
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,660
Replace gen with dui.
Stabilize the west route in the rear.


36
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,400
Ziwei guards the Polaris.


37
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,400
Tanlang breaks Yaoguang.


38
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,020
Wuqu solves Tianquan.


39
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,760
The Heaven Realm is falling into decadence.


40
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,860
We should take a drastic measure to deal
with it instead of cutting off flesh to cure a boil.


41
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,660
Enduring the pain for the time being
and destroying the old and establishing the new


42
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
comply with the mandate of heaven.


43
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,200
Every change in power


44
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,480
will be bloody


45
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,670
and people will be plunged into an abyss of misery.


46
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,050
I cannot bear to see that.


47
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,720
Even if I must act against the trend,


48
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,090
I’ll stay the course.


49
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,040
Your Highness, we don’t stand a great chance.


50
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,820
Why does he go his own way


51
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,340
even if he has no hope of winning?


52
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,960
We have a slim chance.


53
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,820
Why do you make a risky move


54
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,560
in this case?


55
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Yanyue.


56
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,340
Yanyue.


57
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,159
The star behind the bright moon


58
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,480
can’t be controlled but can perish the world.


59
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,840
In this unrestrained gambling of the universe,


60
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
I must make a last desperate effort.


61
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,940
Is there any other chip in his hands?


62
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,710
"Xuanji Palace"


63
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,260
Mi loves drinking osmanthus wine.


64
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,039
I made some recently.


65
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,299
You came at the right time.


66
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,320
I’m just going to drink this pot of wine tonight.


67
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,820
Thank you.


68
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,980
Do you remember


69
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,960
I drank the first drop of wine


70
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
with you?


71
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,060
Come.


72
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,220
Hurry up.


73
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
Hurry up.


74
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,860
What is this?


75
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,900
This is wine.


76
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,960
I want to drink it.


77
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,620
You’re too young to drink it.


78
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,640
I want it.


79
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Drink a little bit.


80
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,020
Look up.


81
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,140
Is it good?


82
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,320
Is it good?


83
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,380
Give it to me.


84
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,940
No.


85
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,860
No.


86
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,980
-Give it to me.
-No.


87
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,960
I was your shadow


88
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,660
in our childhood.


89
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,540
We fought together after we grew up.


90
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,940
We were really care-free in those days.


91
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,240
Those good memories for you


92
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,140
may just be


93
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,780
nightmares for me.


94
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,760
Xu. Xu.


95
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,560
Your Highness, what happened?


96
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,400
Get up. Don’t cry.


97
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Don’t cry, Your Highness.


98
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,920
Don’t cry.


99
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,920
What did you do?


100
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,020
I,


101
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,500
I just didn’t want the fire to hurt him.


102
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,960
Mother.


103
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,660
Mother.


104
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,860
Come here.


105
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,580
Mother.


106
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,520
Mother.


107
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,240
I will protect him in the future.


108
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,700
I won't hurt him.


109
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,180
Mother, I beg you.


110
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,000
Let go.


111
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,640
Let me out, Mother.


112
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,200
Let me out, Mother.


113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,280
Mother.


114
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,520
Let me out, Mother.


115
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,480
Let me out, Mother.


116
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,920
From that day on,


117
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,520
I knew I must be cautious in the Heaven Realm.


118
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,220
I’m sorry.


119
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,220
Tomorrow is the wedding day of Jin Mi and me.


120
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,220
You’re not here


121
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,020
to recall the past late in my Xuanji Palace, right?


122
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,140
Promise me


123
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,300
not to do anything


124
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,000
you may regret tomorrow.


125
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,640
I’ll give you whatever you want.


126
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,480
Jin Mi.


127
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,220
You know I didn’t mean Jin Mi.


128
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,240
Xu Feng,


129
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,060
I have nothing


130
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,780
and want only Jin Mi.


131
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,520
I gave you anything


132
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,800
since I was young.


133
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,060
But I won’t give up


134
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,620
this time.


135
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,180
Do you have to do that?


136
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Don’t you care about parental upbringing


137
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,420
and brotherhood?


138
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,660
If not,


139
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,260
how can I keep the one I care about?


140
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,840
So you’ll do that


141
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,980
at the cost of everything?


142
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,600
Get everything


143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,980
or lose everything.


144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,900
I’ve had it too long.


145
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,540
You know


146
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
I won’t turn a blind eye to it.


147
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,660
I’d like to


148
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,060
invite you to the wedding of Jin Mi and me


149
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,360
tomorrow.


150
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,060
You and I are good brothers.


151
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,340
I really don’t want to


152
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,400
see us get there.


153
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,440
Let me repeat it last time.


154
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,180
You can take everything


155
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,660
except Jin Mi.


156
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you,


157
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,300
but


158
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,020
I don’t need charity.


159
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,180
Good wine.


160
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,340
What can I do for you


161
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,780
before your wedding day?


162
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,900
Yan You,


163
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,500
are you willing to


164
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,140
follow me to that path


165
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,520
and complete our mother’s wishes together tomorrow?


166
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,380
It seems that you insist on


167
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,140
taking a road of no return.


168
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,580
I’m sorry but I cannot keep you company.


169
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,920
You refuse me


170
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,920
because you fear failures, right?


171
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,980
I fear nothing


172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
in the world.


173
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,340
Both of us actually


174
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,500
fear the same thing.


175
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,280
We’re afraid of being abandoned.


176
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,340
In order not to be abandoned,


177
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,080
I chose to be obedient


178
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,940
and you chose to be cynical formerly.


179
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,720
But I know you’re not such a man.


180
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,860
You face the world jokingly


181
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,400
because you don’t dare to have wild wishes


182
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,080
and you’re afraid that


183
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,840
even if you spare no pains


184
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,340
to strive for it,


185
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,000
you’ll still fail.


186
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,020
Don’t act like you know me well.


187
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,460
I’m here to tell you


188
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,080
I won’t attend the wedding tomorrow.


189
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,920
The reason why I won’t keep you company anymore


190
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,920
is that we have our own rules


191
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,920
and I don’t agree with you.


192
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,760
You always think you know me well


193
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,760
and know everything well.


194
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,380
In fact, you know yourself least.


195
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,200
If anything happens tomorrow,


196
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,280
I’ll take care of Li.


197
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,200
Daddy.


198
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,680
Jin Mi.


199
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,220
When in the mortal world, you promised to marry me.


200
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,660
Will you keep your promise?


201
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,660
I’ll keep my promise.


202
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,840
Get up.


203
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,660
Go. Go.


204
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,460
Xu Feng.


205
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,200
There isn’t such a happy event in Floral Realm


206
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,320
in tens of thousands of years.


207
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,660
I’m kind of not used to it.


208
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,660
I’ve finally lived up to the great trust of the late lord.


209
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
It isn’t a good match.


210
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,550
What a pity.


211
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,380
What a pity.


212
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
It is not a pity!


213
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,280
Now you’re Water Immortal.


214
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,020
How can you kneel before us?


215
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,760
She is expressing her gratitude.


216
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,380
Jin Mi, get up.


217
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,710
It’s inconvenient for us to send you there


218
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,480
due to the former resentment
between Floral Realm and Heaven Realm.


219
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,580
As the brother of the Heavenly Empress,


220
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,580
Moon Immortal will escort you and
preside over the wedding ceremony in person.


221
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,480
It shows that Heaven Realm
doesn’t look down upon you.


222
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,320
Chief Peony and other Chiefs.


223
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,640
Thank you for protecting


224
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,640
and taking care of me


225
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,740
for so many years.


226
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,400
I was ignorant before.


227
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,960
As long as you’re safe and happy,


228
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,260
we will be relieved.


229
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,580
If Night Immortal doesn’t treat you well


230
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,500
or you’re bullied in Heaven Realm,


231
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,960
you can come back and live here.


232
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,900
Yes.


233
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,200
Even if you’re happy, you can also come back often.


234
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,820
I’ll roast the rabbit for you.


235
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,340
Take good care of yourself.


236
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,040
It’s time to get changed.


237
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,320
You must be very beautiful in the wedding dress.


238
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,880
I’ll come in first.


239
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,530
Jin Mi.


240
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,320
Jin Mi.


241
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,220
Xu Feng has given you Phoenix Hairpin.


242
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,800
Do you really have no regrets?


243
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,580
Fox Fairy,


244
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,060
please help me give it back to Phoenix.


245
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,560
Jin Mi, how can you be so fickle and unfaithful,


246
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,140
shift your love to another person


247
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,740
and kick down the ladder?


248
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,940
What can poor Xu Feng do?


249
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,960
You love the new and loathe the old.


250
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,700
It’s time for the couple to come to the hall.


251
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,580
<i>The left hand controls the earth, </i>


252
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,460
<i>and the right hand controls the heaven.</i>


253
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,960
<i>The palm print cracks lighting from all directions.</i>


254
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,500
<i>After the flying time is converted into year,</i>


255
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,620
<i>3,000 years disappear.</i>


256
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,810
<i>The left hand pinches a flower, </i>


257
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,520
<i>and the right hand wields a sword.</i>


258
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,780
<i>Thousands of years of snow
drops between the eyebrows.</i>


259
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,260
<i>A tear...</i>


260
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,200
Where is Xu Feng?


261
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,500
How come I didn’t see him?


262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,820
The wedding of Night Immortal and Water Immortal


263
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,180
is a great event of Heaven Realm.


264
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,800
I think the Empyrean Cloud Palace must be crowded.


265
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,060
My nephew Xu Feng must have been


266
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,620
blocked on the way to the wedding.


267
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,200
How about waiting for him?


268
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,820
The auspicious time can’t be delayed.


269
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,180
Never mind.


270
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,100
Let’s begin.


271
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,940
Father.


272
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,840
You brought me up


273
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,500
and taught me.


274
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,060
What’s more,


275
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,000
you granted this marriage to me.


276
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,220
I’d like to express my gratitude to you


277
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,960
with Sparkling Aqua-essence.


278
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,700
What a filial son!


279
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,320
The wedding begins.


280
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,140
Worship the heaven.


281
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,380
Wait a moment.


282
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
The classical opera is so true.


283
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,980
Mr. Right will surely grab a bride.


284
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,360
Father.


285
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,700
Xu Feng, what are you going to do?


286
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,580
You still didn’t listen to me.


287
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,720
You will certainly fail.


288
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,480
If you insist,


289
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,580
the Empyrean Cloud Palace will


290
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,580
be daubed with blood of
innocent officers and soldiers.


291
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,580
Give it up.


292
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,400
I’ll try my best to help you get Father’s pardon.


293
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,820
Your Highness,


294
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,000
our men are ambushed by Fire Immortal.


295
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,900
Lord Liaoyuan,


296
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,720
tell me what happened outside.


297
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,400
Your Majesty,


298
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,720
the 100,000 heaven troops
of Night Immortal wait in ambush


299
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,320
outside the Empyrean Cloud Palace.


300
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,760
As long as the proper time arrives,


301
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,380
Night Immortal will beat a drum ordering them
to capture the Empyrean Cloud Palace.


302
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,220
Is what he said true?


303
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,240
Your Three-Direction Heaven Troops


304
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,520
have been disarmed by me.


305
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,200
Your Majesty, I’m here to save you.


306
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,820
Run Yu, I’ll give you a chance to defend yourself.


307
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,180
What else can you say?


308
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,540
Nothing.


309
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,790
When a mantis is trying to catch a cicada,


310
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,080
a canary is behind it.


311
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
Winner takes all and loser makes only one mistake.


312
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,520
You’re always smarter than me


313
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,460
and your merit and tactics are greater than mine.


314
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,300
I don’t understand why
you take this road of no return.


315
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,280
I have a clear conscience.


316
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,020
Run Yu,


317
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,280
I placed great hopes on you


318
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,160
and never expected that


319
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,620
you’re such an unfaithful and unjust rebel.


320
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,350
Today numerous immortals are present.


321
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,310
With ironclad evidence,


322
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,400
If I don’t punish you,


323
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,740
how can I explain to the six realms?


324
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,480
Father,


325
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,700
although Run Yu made a great mistake,


326
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,460
luckily he didn’t lead to a disaster.


327
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,080
Please be generous and forgive him.


328
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,800
Enough.


329
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,400
All the heaven troops, listen to my orders.


330
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,400
Escort this unfaithful and unjust rebel


331
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,080
to Pisuo Jail right now.


332
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,220
You’re an unfaithful, unjust and unfilial man.


333
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,000
How can you ask others to be so?


334
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,640
To ascend the throne,


335
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,460
you killed your brother,


336
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,220
dumped Floral Immortal,


337
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,940
married an evil woman, insulted my mother
and abandoned your own son,


338
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,600
while my brother


339
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,480
always wanted to take my wife.


340
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,260
The mortals think the heaven is the best place,


341
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,920
but they don’t know


342
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,820
this is the dirtiest, cruelest place of hypocrisy


343
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,320
in the six realms.


344
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,820
Shut up.


345
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,560
Father.


346
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,300
Tell me


347
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,080
what I drank just now.


348
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,300
Just some Evil Incense Ashes.


349
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,960
You’ll be lacking in strength for only four hours.


350
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,060
You…


351
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,480
Run Yu, I know you’re deep,


352
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,060
but I didn’t expect


353
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,860
you can be so heartless and cruel.


354
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,860
Heartless and cruel?


355
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,540
When His Majesty killed his brother,


356
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,640
allowed the dethroned Heavenly
Empress to kill Floral Immortal,


357
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,140
insulted and killed my mother
and wiped out the Arowana Family,


358
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,140
wasn’t he heartless and cruel?


359
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
What happened today


360
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,420
is just the natural retribution.


361
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,600
What I did


362
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,560
doesn’t seek to live up to the heaven and the earth,


363
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,680
but I have a clear conscience


364
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,920
and live up to the upbringing of my late mother.


365
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,900
Upbringing.


366
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,780
Even if you hate Father,


367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,800
he also brought you up.


368
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,360
Winner takes all.


369
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,800
I fear no death.


370
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,860
Escort Night Immortal.


371
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,600
You such rebellious ministers and villains.


372
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,880
Don’t you fear the wrath of heaven?


373
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,880
Heavenly Emperor and the
dethroned Heavenly Empress lack virtue.


374
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,600
Now


375
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,120
His Highness Night Immortal has disclosed the crime of Heavenly Emperor


376
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,600
at the risk of the criticism of the six realms.


377
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,440
This is the good fortune of Heaven Realm.


378
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,280
Now it’s time for Heaven Realm
to destroy the old and establish the new.


379
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,670
We are willing to enthrone Night Immortal


380
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,360
to solve the chaos and build
prestige of Heaven Realm again.


381
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,200
We’re willing to pledge loyalty to Night Immortal.


382
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,200
We’re willing to pledge loyalty to Night Immortal.


383
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,260
How,


384
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,400
how dare you betray me!


385
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,040
Heavenly Emperor and the
dethroned Heavenly Empress are brutal


386
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,040
and all immortals and Buddha
have a grudge against them.


387
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,400
Fire Immortal, don’t you understand?


388
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,100
Yin Que, how dare you
act in collusion with Night Immortal!


389
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,780
I’ll get rid of you today.


390
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,220
Someone,


391
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,060
capture Fire Immortal and his men.


392
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,360
OK.


393
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,960
Take care of His Majesty.


394
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,900
Lord Liaoyuan.


395
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
Lord Liaoyuan.


396
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,460
I can’t


397
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,020
protect you anymore.


398
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,380
Xu Feng, If there is an afterlife,


399
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,620
I wish I could exist without you.


400
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,240
Jin Mi.


401
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,700
Jin Mi, save me.


402
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,880
Save me.


403
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,100
Jin Mi, save me.


404
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,760
Jin Mi.


405
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,300
Jin Mi.


406
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,560
Xu Feng!


407
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,040
Why?


408
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,780
Why?


409
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,860
You know it!


410
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,600
You killed my dad


411
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,100
and Auntie Lin Xiu!


412
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,700
Xu Feng!


413
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,580
Have you


414
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,440
loved me?


415
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,260
Never.


416
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,440
Xu Feng!


417
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,060
As expected, you attached my hair


418
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,740
to the essence of Internal Dan.


419
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,020
Jin Mi,


420
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,620
I’ll kill you.
