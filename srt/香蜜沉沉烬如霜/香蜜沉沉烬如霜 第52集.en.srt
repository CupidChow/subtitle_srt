00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 52"


3
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,220
Xu Feng,


4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,960
no need to look for it.


5
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,079
My mother was the motherly model
of Heaven Realm for thousands of years.


6
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,720
You can’t insult her after she died.


7
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,460
She was unqualified


8
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,240
for the Xianxian Hall.


9
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,120
You can’t defame


10
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,060
my mother’s achievements.


11
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,160
Achievements?


12
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Father and your mother deceived the public
to build up a reputation for thousands of years.


13
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,800
What were their achievements?


14
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,040
They brought six realms


15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,440
just endless slaughter


16
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
and dominating suppress.


17
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,720
If it isn’t for the whole situation,


18
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,480
Father’s memorial tablet


19
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,760
isn’t supposed to be placed here.


20
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,600
You are not qualified to talk about


21
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,140
our parents’ merits and demerits.


22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Even though Mother was evil,


23
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,520
she was your legal mother


24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,220
who raised you for several thousand years.


25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
After you killed your parents,


26
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,720
you really feel no shame?


27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,700
I was so blind


28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,140
that I regarded you,


29
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,640
an ungrateful and cruel hypocrite,


30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,640
as my brother.


31
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,220
If I’m unqualified,


32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,020
are you?


33
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,020
You know clearly


34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,460
how Father played politics,


35
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
how domineering Tu Yao was,


36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,420
how they led to the death of


37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,180
many innocent people


38
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,960
and how painful I was


39
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
in the past several thousand years.


40
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,500
In the current situation,


41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,740
don’t be so high-sounding


42
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,760
to cover your diabolical ambitions.


43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,579
Xu Feng,


44
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,340
you took it for granted that


45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,720
you were specially privileged
under the protection of your parents


46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,520
for several thousand years.


47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,540
Have you ever seen clearly


48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
what the Heaven Realm is like?


49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,180
Have you thought about


50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,360
the reason why Water Immortal
preferred marrying Jin Mi to me than you?


51
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,020
Why can I, a traitor,


52
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,180
ascend the throne


53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,260
successfully as I started a rebellion?


54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Why did no one in the
whole Heaven Realm say anything


55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
as your mother jumped off the Linyuan Tower?


56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
I can tell you.


57
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,420
It wasn’t because


58
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,440
I’m calculating and dictatorial,


59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,880
but because they were reactionary


60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,440
and deserted by their followers.


61
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,000
Nonsense.


62
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
You lie!


63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,720
As the Heavenly Emperor,


64
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,940
I own the whole Heaven Realm,


65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,660
including Jin Mi certainly,


66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
while you have nothing.


67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,420
Why should I lie to you?


68
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,640
The Heaven Realm is
well-administrated and harmonious now.


69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,020
Everything is fine.


70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,600
So is Jin Mi.


71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,520
We don’t need you at all.


72
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,220
Why do you come back?


73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,040
Stop!


74
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,600
Don’t mention her.


75
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,200
Xu Feng,


76
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,140
you died.


77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,380
I’ve even arranged a grand funeral for you,


78
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,340
while you come back to invite humiliation,


79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,820
which is quite disappointing.


80
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,640
Fine.


81
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,140
Since I could kill you with Jin Mi,


82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
we can kill you again.


83
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,060
Remember what you said today.


84
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,420
You’ll regret.


85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,940
Wait and see.


86
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,620
They are your former subordinates


87
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,220
who were promoted and braved
countless dangers with you in the past.


88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,360
Now they’ve abandoned you for me.


89
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,140
"Who said that we have no clothes?


90
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,100
I can share the robe with you."


91
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,520
You’re just in time.


92
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,640
Congratulate for serving the emperor


93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,460
and getting promoted continuously.


94
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
God of War is unparalleled in the world.


95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,140
Show the six realms


96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,340
how you’ll kill your brother


97
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,620
and deal with former fellow officers.


98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
All generals,


99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Xu Feng trespassed the
forbidden area of Heaven Realm.


100
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,980
Death will atone for his offence.


101
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,500
Catch him.


102
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,480
Stop.


103
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,060
Don’t come over.


104
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,700
Mi.


105
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,180
I killed you back then.


106
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,580
No hatred without cause.


107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,300
You can kill me.


108
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,240
You


109
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,620
do love Run Yu so deeply


110
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,260
that you even protect him with your life.


111
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,200
I wonder whether he loves you


112
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
as deeply as you do.


113
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,460
Leave.


114
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,280
Leave.


115
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Stop pretending.


116
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,100
You even want to protect Heavenly Emperor


117
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,880
and me at the same time?


118
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,980
What are you doing now?


119
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,120
Play cat and mouse?


120
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,559
Mi.


121
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,059
Come here.


122
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,419
Please.


123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,559
Leave.


124
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,420
Don’t come over.


125
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,820
Let her go


126
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,060
and I’ll let you go today.


127
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
Don’t come over.


128
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,800
Don’t come over.


129
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,420
Leave now.


130
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,480
Leave now.


131
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Our tree


132
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,620
is dead.


133
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,100
Chase him.


134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,260
Yes.


135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,680
No.


136
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,680
No.


137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,680
Your Majesty,


138
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,680
you said you’ll let him go just now.


139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Please don’t go back on your words.


140
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,940
I promised you nothing just now.


141
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,080
My patience isn’t endless.


142
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,100
Don’t challenge my bottom line
time and again.


143
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,260
If you don’t let him go today,


144
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,580
I’ll die with him.


145
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,220
Calm down.


146
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,320
Mi.


147
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,040
If you come over,


148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,020
I’ll kill myself.


149
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
I mean it.


150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,900
Please let him go.


151
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,900
His Majesty ordered


152
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,420
to kill him.


153
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,120
Do you want to rebel?


154
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,220
Immortal Tai Si,


155
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,600
but for the kindness of His Highness,


156
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,400
you won’t be here today.


157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,800
Your Highness,


158
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,380
when we subdued Tao Wu back then,


159
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,640
I was saved by you from Tao Wu.


160
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Please, Your Highness.


161
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,660
When I fell into Wangchuan River, you saved me


162
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,100
in the third War between
the Heaven and the Demon,


163
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,460
or I would have lost my legs.


164
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,860
Please, Your Highness.


165
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,980
You saved my brother in Yu Abyss.


166
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,540
Please,


167
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,700
Your Highness.


168
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,060
Please, Your Highness.


169
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,300
Please, Your Highness.


170
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,780
Please, Your Highness.


171
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,320
After we part here today,


172
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,820
Your Highness,


173
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,340
please take care of yourself.


174
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,780
I came back to worship my parents today.


175
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,860
Thank you very much


176
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,460
for making an exception for me.


177
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
However,


178
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,660
as we take different paths,


179
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,700
we can’t work together.


180
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,060
I cut my robe to break off our friendships today.


181
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,040
Our connection comes to an end.


182
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,940
If we fight against each other later,


183
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,160
show no mercy.


184
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,860
Your Highness.


185
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,940
Your Highness.


186
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,600
Though so many people tried to stop him,


187
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,700
Fire Immortal escaped safely.


188
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,560
If someone didn’t let him go,


189
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,220
he wouldn’t have escaped easily.


190
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,540
Your Majesty,


191
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,300
I let him go.


192
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,660
Please punish me.


193
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,000
Po Jun,


194
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
why did you go against my order?


195
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,800
Your Majesty,


196
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,440
His Highness saved me twice


197
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,140
on the battlefield in the past.


198
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,480
I owed him great favors.


199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Po Jun,


200
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,120
you abused your power for personal interests.


201
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,460
Have you ever thought of


202
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,680
His Majesty and the law of Heaven Realm?


203
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,800
I’m guilty.


204
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,100
Please punish me, Your Majesty.


205
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,400
We’re guilty too, Your Majesty.


206
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,240
I said I’ll use


207
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,740
virtuous and talented people


208
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,880
regardless of their past.


209
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,980
You returned Xu Feng’s


210
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,400
favor with a favor.


211
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,060
I admire you for your loyalty.


212
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,100
The law cannot be enforced
when everyone is an offender in this case.


213
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
However, you can never go on like this.


214
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,940
There is the law in Heaven Realm.


215
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,240
Just this once.


216
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,040
I hope you can strictly observe your duty


217
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,980
and be loyal to Heaven Realm.


218
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,400
Yes, Your Majesty.


219
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,520
Rise.


220
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,940
Thanks, Your Majesty.


221
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,760
Po Jun,


222
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,500
you’re the Palace General,


223
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,160
and my safety depends on you.


224
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,380
Though he saved you twice,


225
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,800
the favor is returned now,


226
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,740
or


227
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
you’ll owe me.


228
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,120
It won’t happen again.


229
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,180
Immortal.


230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,100
Is His Majesty in there?


231
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
His Majesty said he won’t see anybody.


232
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,340
Please go back.


233
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,160
Immortal.


234
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,440
Immortal.


235
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,960
Your Majesty,


236
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,400
Xu Feng just came to worship his parents.


237
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,420
Please be lenient with him.


238
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,440
You have the whole Heaven Realm,


239
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,160
while he has nothing.


240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,200
I beg you, Your Majesty.


241
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,040
Your Majesty,


242
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,540
I beg you.


243
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,440
Immortal.


244
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,000
Immortal.


245
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,460
Please go back.


246
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,700
Immortal.


247
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,240
Your Majesty.


248
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,500
Your Majesty, Water Immortal is outside.


249
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,360
I won’t see her.


250
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,720
But,


251
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
but, but...


252
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,440
I underestimated his prestige in Heaven Realm.


253
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,700
Though he is alone,


254
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,660
he owns what I value most,


255
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,540
the support of the masses.


256
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,360
He made a scene in the Xianxian Hall today,


257
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
entering and leaving easily.


258
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,800
Even Po Jun


259
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
took the lead in letting him go.


260
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,680
If it goes on like this,


261
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,360
are the 1,000,000 heaven troops
going to change their side?


262
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,880
Your Majesty,


263
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
you think too much.


264
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,760
If they were disloyal,


265
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
they would have gone
with the second Prince just now.


266
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,840
They were trained and promoted by him


267
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,760
and braved countless dangers with him,


268
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,280
so there is a deep connection between them.


269
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,599
You’re right.


270
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,319
It’s time for them to cut the connection.


271
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,680
Kuang Lu, you can leave.


272
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
I’ll think about it.


273
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,280
Yes.


274
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,860
Mi,


275
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,880
you only care about Xu Feng


276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,160
heart and soul.


277
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,780
No matter what I’ve done for you,


278
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,620
even though I was badly injured


279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,680
and my lifetime was reduced by half,


280
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,060
you ignored them.


281
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,900
All of you


282
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,820
betrayed me for him.


283
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,220
In this case,


284
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
don’t blame me for being merciless.


285
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,460
The Spirit Fire Beads are Father’s token for Mother.


286
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,980
She loved it most before death.


287
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,240
Let me build her cenotaph here with the beads.


288
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,620
Please accept my condolences, Your Highness.


289
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,280
As a bystander,


290
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,500
what do you think about my mother?


291
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,660
Was she really as evil as what others said?


292
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,520
Your Highness,


293
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
just let her rest in peace


294
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
and let it go.


295
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,920
It seems that what he said is true.


296
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,260
In the past,


297
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,300
under the protection of my parents,


298
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,380
I thought they were the supremacy of Heaven Realm,


299
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,260
so all their orders were certainly correct


300
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,180
and others should submit to them.


301
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,160
I haven’t doubted and self-reflected at all.


302
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,280
However, now it seems that


303
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,900
I should be responsible for their tragedy


304
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,760
as I didn’t try to persuade them


305
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,900
when they made mistakes.


306
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,980
Don’t blame yourself, Your Highness.


307
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,060
You shouldn’t be blamed


308
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,260
for the mistakes of your parents.


309
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,500
There are causes


310
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,120
of good and evil.


311
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,700
When I was the shadow guard of the Zifangyun Palace,


312
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,160
I often saw the late Heavenly Empress


313
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,260
weeping alone secretly and sadly.


314
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,180
If I didn’t see it personally,


315
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,400
I wouldn’t believe that


316
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,140
a commanding senior with high status


317
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,400
was just a poor and miserable woman


318
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,580
in the end.


319
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,820
Both Father and I are to be blamed


320
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,480
for making Mother act like that.


321
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,860
When she was alive,


322
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,900
I didn’t have a meal


323
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,420
or talk with her attentively.


324
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,840
Now,


325
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,740
even though I want to support her, she was dead.


326
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,460
As I went back to Heaven Realm today,


327
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,860
I found everything has changed.


328
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,580
Facing Run Yu,


329
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,340
I suddenly felt helpless.


330
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,740
He talked confidently,


331
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,120
while I couldn’t refute him.


332
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,060
I couldn’t defend


333
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,140
the last dignity of my parents.


334
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,480
It was so strange to me there.


335
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,920
It is no longer my hometown.


336
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,240
Even the phoenix tree...


337
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
Now I’m homeless like you.


338
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,720
Your Highness,


339
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,520
you’re wrong.


340
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,700
When I kept watch on the late Water Immortal


341
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,660
by the order of the late Heavenly Empress,


342
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,880
I overheard something


343
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,660
said by him with emotion.


344
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,340
I think it still makes sense to me now.


345
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,700
What is it?


346
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,420
Wherever makes me feel at ease


347
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,300
is my hometown.


348
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,920
Wherever makes me feel at ease


349
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,060
is my hometown.


350
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,880
Perhaps you have no idea.


351
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,820
Many years ago


352
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
when I lost my parents,


353
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,000
other members in the family


354
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
and my hometown,


355
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,120
I was always afraid of


356
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,400
facing the rising sun at dawn.


357
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,060
I was supported


358
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,240
by hatred back then.


359
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,760
However,


360
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,560
after countless sleepless nights,


361
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,900
I understood gradually


362
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,020
my parents and others in the family


363
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,080
protected me with their lives


364
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,960
as they hoped that I could have a good life,


365
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,180
rather than live with hatred.


366
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,420
Because I was the only hope to them.


367
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,380
I’m the whole family alone.


368
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,300
I must try hard to live on.


369
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
Eventually,


370
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,980
I’ve been supported by hope until now.


371
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,380
Freeze.


372
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,400
Where are you going?


373
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,420
It has nothing to do with you.


374
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,500
I don’t have to tell you.


375
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,160
You behaved furtively.


376
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,820
I’m afraid you’ll hurt Feng.


377
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,280
Liu Ying,


378
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,100
just be easy on Sui He.


379
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,960
She won’t hurt me.


380
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,140
I’ll get some tonics for you.


381
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,360
Thank you.


382
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,000
I thank her for taking care of you.


383
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,640
However, I’m angry at the sight of her.


384
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,200
Forget it.


385
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,320
When I was betrayed and killed,


386
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,600
Sui He and you saved me


387
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,840
and gave me another life.


388
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,840
As she made me reborn,


389
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,640
I owe her a favor anyway.


390
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,720
Xu Feng,


391
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,080
Mu Ci, my father


392
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,440
and I’ll be your family members.


393
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,700
Thank you.


394
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,920
Take a seat.


395
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,400
Xu Feng, how do you feel?


396
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,880
Fine.


397
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,860
What does it mean?


398
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,480
Have you gained stronger magic power


399
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,260
or a better appetite?


400
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,720
You only care about these?


401
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Focus on others.


402
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,460
No need.


403
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
It’s most important to be happy


404
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,860
whether as an immortal or a demon.


405
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
That makes sense.


406
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,340
After surviving a great disaster,


407
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,140
you are bound to have
good fortune in later years.


408
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,680
Here you are.


409
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,440
It’s helpful to improve your magic power.


410
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,340
The egg of rosefinch.


411
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,160
You little demon.


412
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,060
Your body is cold in nature.


413
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,020
You can only be nourished by water.


414
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,900
How dare you eat the eggs of my rosefinch.


415
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
I’m a grape.


416
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,500
I grow on the ground.


417
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,840
Not in the water.


418
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,840
I thought rosefinch was related to pig.


419
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,440
Unexpectedly, it’s related to fire.


420
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,600
Stop it.


421
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,760
I’m dizzy to hear that.


422
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,700
You nearly sacrificed your life for
mere 300 years worth of prowess.


423
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,820
Stupid.


424
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,840
You gave me the rosefinch
when celebrating the birthday


425
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,040
of the late Heavenly Empress back then.


426
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,300
Thank you.


427
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,800
What’s wrong with you, Xu Feng?


428
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,180
Nothing serious.


429
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,680
But you’ve just recovered,


430
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,160
you still need to take good care of yourself.


431
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,200
Remember that


432
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,420
don’t be too hasty when practicing.


433
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,140
Don’t worry.


434
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,960
I’ve died for once.


435
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,400
My life is valuable.


436
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
I’ll cherish it,


437
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,540
or I’ll let you down.


438
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,480
Run Yu is so cruel.


439
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,260
We should respect the dead,


440
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,020
while he is so heartless.


441
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,720
How poor Xu Feng is!


442
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,780
In fact, I think it’s a good thing


443
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,640
to Xu Feng instead.


444
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,360
Getting to know his parents, facing the past


445
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,140
and seeing the truth,


446
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,380
he can really achieve nirvana and rebirth.


447
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,660
Why did he talk with you?


448
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,640
Apparently, I’m more familiar with him.


449
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,620
What did you talk about?


450
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,780
Nothing.


451
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,920
Just some topics between men.


452
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,300
What are they?


453
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
If I tell you, they won’t be


454
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,680
topics between men.


455
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,480
If you’re free,


456
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
go to talk with Princess Sui He.


457
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,840
Her?


458
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,540
Come on,


459
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,940
I'd have nothing to say with her.


460
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,220
I prefer you to her.


461
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,300
Mu Ci,


462
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,860
what’s wrong with your hair?


463
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,900
Hair?


464
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,160
Mu Ci,


465
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,400
do you know?


466
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,960
I’ve always liked those
who are mature and earnest.


467
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,980
It’s great that you have grey hair,


468
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,940
so you won’t look like
toy boys in the mortal world.


469
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,280
No need to pacify me.


470
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,120
I didn’t.


471
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,320
I like you.


472
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,860
Actually,


473
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,800
I know it very well


474
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,940
I’ll keep aging like this,


475
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,160
and it won't take long
before I get sick and die


476
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,440
like a mortal,


477
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,160
and even forget you gradually.


478
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,100
Even so,


479
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,640
will you still like me?


480
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,780
Cicadas and dayflies have short lives,


481
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,140
but they live happily.


482
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,160
We’re much luckier


483
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,540
as we have 10 years.


484
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,000
Mu Ci,


485
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,540
remember that


486
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,920
we’ll face it together


487
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
no matter how you change,


488
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,480
OK?


489
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:48,960
OK.


490
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,980
Your Majesty.


491
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,380
Your Majesty,


492
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,880
I beg you.


493
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Please let Xu Feng off.


494
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
Stand up.


495
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,560
No.


496
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,500
I won’t


497
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,560
if you don’t promise me.


498
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
I beg you.


499
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,420
Do you have to do that?


500
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,740
I beg you.


501
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Please let him off.


502
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,340
OK.


503
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,940
I agree.


504
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,220
Stand up.


505
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.


506
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,700
Mi.


507
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,820
Mi.


508
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,940
Mi.


509
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,380
Mi.


510
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,820
Your Majesty,


511
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,560
why do you summon me late in the night?


512
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,220
Announce to the six realms.


513
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,020
Fire Immortal Xu Feng
trespassed the Xianxian Hall,


514
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,160
which is great disrespect
for the late Heavenly Emperor


515
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,020
and violates the rule of Heaven Realm.


516
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,420
I command that


517
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,000
his immortal register is cancelled now


518
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,500
and he can never enter Heaven Realm.


519
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,880
Well.


520
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,380
Yes, Your Majesty.


521
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,580
Kuang Lu.


522
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,260
Kuang Lu,


523
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,540
what happened?


524
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,860
Who set the ward?


525
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,900
Immortal,


526
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,480
His Majesty is so anxious


527
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,380
that he won’t allow you to take risk outside.


528
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
Before you recover,


529
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,540
please recuperate in Xuanji Palace.


530
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,920
His Majesty has paid and sacrificed


531
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,400
so much for you.


532
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,780
Please understand his pain.


533
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,380
Kuang Lu,


534
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,200
let me out.


535
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,140
Beauty,


536
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,140
I was drawing the portrait of beauties at home.


537
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Someone forced me to come here with anger.


538
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,540
What’s wrong with you?


539
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,660
Why do you stand still here?


540
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:24,980
Be careful.


541
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,220
There is a ward.


542
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,740
Did Run Yu set it?


543
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,540
He is crazy.


544
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,020
Can you break it?


545
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,940
Beauty,


546
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,720
he was pissed off by you,


547
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,020
so he used much magic power


548
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,620
to set such a strong ward?


549
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,720
Don’t talk nonsense.


550
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,960
Just tell me


551
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,460
whether you can break it.


552
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,880
But I’ll figure out a way


553
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,060
By the way,


554
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,500
it’s said Xu Feng came
back to life in Demon Realm.


555
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,400
You did it?


556
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,179
I guessed it.


557
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,800
Only you would do such a thing.


558
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,820
No wonder Run Yu was so furious.


559
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,860
He has announced to the six realms


560
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,100
that Xu Feng’s immortal register will be cancelled


561
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,780
and he can’t enter Heaven Realm forever.


562
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,340
That’s what he meant to let him off.


563
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,880
He is no longer


564
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,020
the previous peaceful Night Immortal.


565
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,820
After seeing his birth mother


566
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,179
being killed by the late Heavenly Empress,


567
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,580
there was the hatred of his
mom’s death between him and Xu Feng.


568
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,739
You should be considerate of him.


569
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,980
Sometimes


570
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,820
I really miss the first 100 years


571
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,780
when I just came to Heaven Realm.


572
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,700
I come to Heaven Realm for the first time.


573
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,200
I want to enjoy the beautiful scenery.


574
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,440
I’m not a monster.


575
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,580
I’m really a grape spirit.


576
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,760
Take these...


577
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,940
OK. I see.


578
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,220
I’ll take them away now.


579
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,400
Don’t pad the table with such books.


580
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,780
No sleep tonight as a punishment.


581
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,960
Practice transformation magic.


582
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,940
I’ll check it tomorrow morning.


583
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,880
Whose fairchild are you?


584
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,140
I’m not a fairchild.


585
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,200
I’m just a half-fairy.


586
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,340
Half-fairy?


587
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,080
Only she will


588
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,860
make an fairy rank for herself.


589
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,440
Back then,


590
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,440
we cared nothing about


591
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,640
parents’ hatred, love and anger.


592
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,340
I was just a Page Boy


593
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,440
to grind ink for Phoenix


594
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,500
in the Qiwu Palace.


595
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,940
Who will add tea and grind ink
for me if you leave now?


596
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,540
Do what you’re supposed to do.


597
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,400
Rice dumplings of the
mortal world aren’t very tasty.


598
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,340
My flower cakes


599
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,520
are much tastier than them.


600
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,860
They just melt in the mouth and won’t choke.


601
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,940
Is it OK?


602
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,220
Yes.


603
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,380
I made rice dumplings with magic power,


604
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,100
planted flowers and grass,


605
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,060
practiced without distractions


606
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,280
and was proud of being a fruit spirit.


607
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,220
I remember


608
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:29,340
Phoenix was still arrogant and mighty.


609
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,360
I’m afraid of nothing in heaven and earth.


610
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,780
And Fish Fairy


611
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,560
was gentle and kind.


612
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,040
I’m Run Yu.


613
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,220
What’s your name?


614
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,980
I’m Jin Mi.


615
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,800
Here is the Red String for you.


616
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I hope that someone will
keep your company afterwards.


617
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,820
Thank you, Fairy Jin Mi.


618
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,740
What a wonderful time!


619
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,160
It’s a pity that we can’t go back.


620
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,000
Now,


621
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,520
now even the phoenix tree is dead.


622
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,360
If you are given another Yun Elixir now,


623
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,860
will you take it?


624
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,460
Yun Elixir is the cause


625
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,500
of what happened now.


626
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,860
I have never regretted
spending those days with Phoenix.


627
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,760
However,


628
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,300
I let him down.


629
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,980
I...


630
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,340
Stop.


631
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,100
What do you want to do?


632
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,440
No one wants to listen


633
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,140
to the past of you and Phoenix.


634
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,580
I’ll look for someone to break the ward.


635
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,380
Bye.


636
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,400
Thank you,


637
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,060
Lord Puchi.


638
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,380
What’s wrong?


639
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,500
Your Highness.


640
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,860
Your Highness.


641
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,500
What’s wrong with you? Your Highness.


642
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,420
I think I’m too hasty.


643
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,820
My breath was unstable just now.


644
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,620
It doesn’t matter.


645
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,020
Don’t worry.


646
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,020
Well,


647
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,660
I saw a decree issued


648
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,780
by Heaven Realm in the demon market today.


649
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,120
What is it?


650
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,820
Your immortal register has been cancelled


651
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,540
and you were banished from Heaven Realm.


652
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,280
Run Yu,


653
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,820
Run Yu is going to eliminate you.


654
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,120
Get away.


655
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,860
You can’t enter.


656
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,220
Do you know who I am?


657
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,480
Get away.


658
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,520
No entry.


659
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:57,960
Run Yu.


660
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,580
Run Yu,


661
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,020
tell me


662
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,180
why you cancel Xu Feng’s immortal register.


663
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,940
You’re Heavenly Emperor already.


664
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Why can’t you just let him off?


665
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,220
He is your brother.


666
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
You killed him once.


667
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,880
As Xu Feng is so proud,


668
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,720
your cancellation of his immortal register


669
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,580
is crueler than killing him.


670
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,320
How can you do that?


671
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,300
Immortal,


672
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,660
it isn’t the right place to talk about it here.


673
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,240
Shut up.


674
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,580
Immortal,


675
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,280
he trespassed the Xianxian Hall


676
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
and fought with His Majesty.


677
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,160
You forced him.


678
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,940
He just came to worship his parents.


679
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,720
Why did you stop him?


680
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,780
He threatened His Majesty with a sword.


681
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,940
If Immortal Jin Mi didn’t


682
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,900
stop him again,


683
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,480
His Majesty would have been killed.


684
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,820
Jin Mi.


685
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,460
It’s her again.


686
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,120
Did she help you to deal with Xu Feng again?


687
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,820
Yes,


688
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,920
she did.


689
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,000
They are finished.


690
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,160
You can give up, uncle.


691
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,900
You can’t treat him like this.


692
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,760
He did nothing to you.


693
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,240
Someone.


694
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,140
Yes.


695
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,980
Who dares?


696
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,720
Take him away.


697
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,480
Yes.


698
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,720
Run Yu.


699
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,400
Your Majesty. Run Yu.


700
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,200
Run Yu,


701
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,320
those demons in Demon Realm


702
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,320
hate him so much.


703
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,140
If you don’t allow him to come back,


704
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
you’re killing him.


705
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,160
Run Yu,


706
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,880
he is your brother.


707
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,560
My Lord,


708
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,940
someone wants to see you.


709
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,980
Where is he from?


710
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,720
King of Bian City.


711
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,540
Your Highness.
