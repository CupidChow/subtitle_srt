1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 41"


3
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,400
Now Heavenly Empress is in jail,


4
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,560
while the effect of Autopsy
Wild Silkworms is getting stronger.


5
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,220
What should I do?


6
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Am I doomed to die?


7
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,060
Thank you for saving me.


8
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,220
Follow me.


9
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow


10
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,040
is made with bones and blood


11
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,060
of the Spirit-Vanishing Family.


12
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
It has taken almost all my bones and blood


13
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,820
to make it all these years.


14
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,440
Although I’m barely supported
by the magic power of Heavenly Empress,


15
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,780
I’m already useless.


16
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,280
I’m afraid I can’t assist you


17
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,320
in doing a great cause.


18
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,220
Please allow me to live in seclusion


19
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,079
for the rest of my life.


20
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,420
Auntie and the Bird Family


21
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,800
just lose influence for the time being,


22
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,440
are you going to leave us


23
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,700
like other snobbish immortals?


24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,320
I dare not do this.


25
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
If Her Majesty didn’t save me back then,


26
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
I wouldn’t be here now.


27
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,620
I’m really grateful


28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
for her help.


29
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,820
I’ll repay her favor next life.


30
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you going to find your old flame


31
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,380
Princess of Bian City?


32
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,280
Liu Ying and I...


33
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,840
No.


34
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,740
Princess of Bian City and I


35
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,380
have been strangers long before


36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
and our love is gone.


37
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,840
Make


38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,060
another Spirit-Vanishing Arrow for me


39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,460
and I’ll eliminate Autopsy Wild Silkworms for you.


40
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
Thus you’ll be free


41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,940
to find your Princess of Bian City


42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,080
to continue your former love.


43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,380
OK?


44
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,900
You don’t believe me?


45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,740
I’ve transferred all my cultivation this life to you.


46
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,840
With the help of Glazed Pure Fire,


47
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,380
you must rejuvenate the Bird Family


48
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,080
and help Xu Feng to be the Heavenly Emperor.


49
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,380
I see.


50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Take good care of both Xu Feng and the Bird Family.


51
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,800
Don’t let me down.


52
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,260
Your Highness Night Immortal is really brilliant.


53
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,460
I’ll fail


54
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
no matter how hard I try.


55
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,180
Do you give up now?


56
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
Even if I try,


57
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,520
nothing will change in the end.


58
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,220
I fail.


59
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,260
It’s my honor to play chess


60
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,780
with a master like you.


61
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
What?


62
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,440
Nothing is left in the barn of the Bird Family?


63
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,400
Since the Floral Realm stopped
the supply for us last time,


64
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,080
we have been on bad terms with each other.


65
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,940
Although they still


66
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,860
supply flowers, grass and grain,


67
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,400
the amount is much smaller.


68
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,700
We can’t accumulate food all the time.


69
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,960
You should have reported it earlier.


70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,420
Elder Yin Que asks for a visit.


71
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,280
Let him come in.


72
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.


73
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,740
You can leave.


74
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,880
Yes.


75
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,980
Here is my respect, Leader.


76
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,760
Have you heard of


77
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,680
the grain shortage of the Bird Family recently?


78
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,760
What do you mean?


79
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,980
As the leader of the Bird Family,


80
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,360
certainly I know it.


81
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,900
That’s fine.


82
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,500
I worry that you forget us


83
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,580
as you linger in the Heaven Realm.


84
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,180
Since you have known it,


85
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,280
why don’t you take action earlier?


86
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Birds of the family are dying.


87
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
I’ll deal with it.


88
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,940
The deposed Heavenly Empress
appointed you as the leader


89
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,240
and helped you manage the
affairs of the Bird Family back then,


90
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,320
so we’re prosperous.


91
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,060
However, as she loses her influence now,


92
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
elders worry


93
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,179
whether you can assume the task


94
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,840
to protect us safe and sound.


95
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,920
I’ll solve the grain problem properly in three days.


96
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,620
I’ll prove


97
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,780
I deserve


98
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,460
the post of the leader.


99
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,920
Then


100
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,580
I’ll wait and see.


101
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,520
Wait.


102
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,700
Don’t you have other matters


103
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,040
to report?


104
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,880
What do you mean?


105
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,360
Surely, it’s about your meeting with Demon Lord


106
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,640
in Demon Realm.


107
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,480
Is it necessary to report a meeting of old friends?


108
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,000
If you have spare time,


109
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,940
you’d better solve the grain problem earlier.


110
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,920
Xu Feng is in charge of the Mansion
of the Five-Direction Heaven Troops


111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
and controls the gates of the Heaven Realm,


112
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,480
which is heavy responsibility.


113
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,900
However, Xu Feng is ill-behaved and perverse.


114
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
I worry much about it.


115
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I’ll temporarily


116
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,100
hand his position over to you.


117
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,300
Reported by Sui He of the Bird Family.


118
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,140
The Bird Family has been living on flowers and grain.


119
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,280
Though the Floral Realm has resumed supply,


120
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,300
there are fewer things left in our barns


121
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,980
due to years of food shortage.


122
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,340
Now the Bird Family is in danger,


123
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,420
so please offer us grain to relieve us


124
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,260
from the pressing situation.


125
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,560
We are begging for your approval.


126
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,120
Leader.


127
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,180
Is there news from the Heaven Realm?


128
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
No.


129
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,620
No.


130
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,460
I have to go to the Heaven Realm personally


131
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,760
to borrow grain with Heavenly Realm.


132
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,040
But Elder Yin Que and other elders


133
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,520
are waiting for you to have a meeting in the hall.


134
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,500
It’s inappropriate for you to leave now.


135
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,980
They can’t wait to see me


136
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,940
making a fool of myself.


137
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,960
That’s impossible.


138
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,980
Yin Que,


139
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,500
I’ll get even with you


140
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,980
for your meeting Demon Lord.


141
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,020
If she still can’t borrow grain from Heaven Realm...


142
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,220
The Leader is coming.


143
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,880
...we’ll be in deadly danger.


144
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,780
Yes.


145
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,180
It has been three days.


146
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,580
Have you got any idea


147
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,540
to solve the grain problem?


148
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,260
I’ve reported to the Heaven Realm,


149
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,580
but they slow to lend us grain.


150
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,580
I think you’re to blame, Elder Yin Que.


151
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,380
The Bird Family is hit by grain shortage


152
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,960
and the Heaven Realm refuses to lend food.


153
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,860
Does this have anything to do with Elder Yin Que?


154
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,240
He met with Demon Lord


155
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,220
in the Demon Realm several days ago.


156
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,460
His Majesty heard of that


157
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,420
and was very unsatisfied.


158
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,340
He thought we may rebel.


159
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,240
If I didn’t told him


160
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,100
we’re loyal to the Heaven Realm,


161
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,400
he would have sent troops to suppress us.


162
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,380
Well.


163
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,280
I don’t know my meeting with
Demon Lord in Demon Realm


164
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,600
even results in such a case.


165
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,880
If His Majesty really doesn’t
want to lend food because of this,


166
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,540
I would like to clarify it


167
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,680
to him with you,


168
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,860
so as to dispel his doubts


169
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,380
and make him lend us food earlier


170
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,960
to relieve us from the pressing situation.


171
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
That really makes sense.


172
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,640
Please go to the Heaven Realm


173
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,420
with Elder Yin Que


174
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,760
to handle the matter now.


175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,280
Do you have any evidence to prove that


176
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,240
you haven’t colluded with the Demon Realm?


177
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,260
As they didn’t send troops,


178
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,020
it shows


179
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,780
they have no evidence of
my collusion with the Demon Realm.


180
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
You fail to borrow grain.


181
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,820
Are you going to blame it on me now?


182
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,880
In the last thousands of years,


183
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,740
I have been devoting myself to the Bird Family


184
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,580
to make it increasingly prosperous.


185
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,300
I try my best to save


186
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,960
the suffering Bird Family now.


187
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,880
Elder Yin Que’s improper behavior


188
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,880
led to grudges between the Heaven Realm and us.


189
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,080
I want to know


190
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,020
whether we can borrow grain from


191
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Demon Realm.


192
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,020
Leader,


193
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
Elder Yin Que,


194
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
it’s useless to quarrel here.


195
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
It urgent that you should go to


196
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
the Heaven Realm


197
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,300
to tell Heavenly Emperor our loyalty,


198
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
so as to borrow grain earlier.


199
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,200
Night Immortal is coming.


200
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,640
Here is my respect, Your Highness.


201
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,200
Your Highness.


202
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,400
I don’t think you just


203
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,840
come to play chess with me today.


204
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,400
I heard you met Demon Lord secretly recently.


205
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,620
I wonder what you talked.


206
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,500
You come for it.


207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,100
I just talked about the past with him.


208
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,860
We discussed nothing.


209
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,860
No one knows what you talked about.


210
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,120
However, it has been reported to the Heaven Realm.


211
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,440
It’s inevitable that if there are


212
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,380
some fictitious guesses.


213
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,140
If His Majesty misunderstands you,


214
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
it’ll be bad for the Bird Family.


215
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,140
His Majesty asked me to investigate it thoroughly.


216
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,120
How do you think


217
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,360
should I answer give?


218
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,860
I’m sorry.


219
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,680
I don’t know what you mean.


220
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
I know


221
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,760
Heaven Realm has overly controlled the Bird Tribe


222
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,640
After the Arowana Family was eliminated back then,


223
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,220
the deposed Heavenly Empress
let the Bird Family take over


224
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,360
the rich Lake Taihu.


225
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,040
The Bird Family has been much
more thriving and prosperous


226
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,220
than before in the last several thousand years.


227
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,000
You should be satisfied.


228
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,040
Just speak out what is


229
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,780
in your mind.


230
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,920
I don’t like to beat around the bush.


231
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,640
In this case,


232
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,300
I’ll speak it out.


233
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,960
In fact, I come


234
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,020
to ask for your favor.


235
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,820
As a powerless elder of the Bird Family,


236
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,180
I don’t think I can help you.


237
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,060
If the Bird Family knows


238
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,599
its top-secret force deployment defense plan


239
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,280
was revealed by you,


240
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,640
will they allow you


241
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,560
to stay in the Bird Family later?


242
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,000
With His Majesty’s order, today I escorted grain here


243
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,700
to help the Bird Family


244
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,880
as a special envoy of the Heaven Realm.


245
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,420
Thank you, Your Highness.


246
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,900
The whole Bird Family thanks you very much.


247
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,040
I come here to solve


248
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,400
another matter today.


249
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,680
What is it?


250
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,180
I would like to help you.


251
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,340
Elder Yin Que secretly met Demon Lord


252
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
in Demon Realm not long ago,


253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,840
which I think you should have known it.


254
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,340
He secretly met Demon Lord


255
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,780
with hidden evil.


256
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,660
If you want to punish him,


257
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,340
I’ll assist you fully.


258
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,460
However, the Bird Family is
always loyal to the Heaven Realm.


259
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,080
Please believe us.


260
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,700
It seems that you can’t wait


261
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,660
to punish him.


262
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,800
Princess Sui He once applied to the Heaven Realm


263
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,380
for the heaven troops to
set things right in Yimiao Continent.


264
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,540
However, His Majesty believed the Bird Family is loyal


265
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,980
and asked me to investigate it.


266
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,900
I come here


267
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,140
to tell you the result of the investigation.


268
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,100
Elder Yin Que went to the Demon Realm


269
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,340
just for personal reasons.


270
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,920
Don’t hurt the relation between


271
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,320
the Bird Family and the Heaven Realm for it.


272
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,120
His Majesty didn’t want to suppress us.


273
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,500
It was you, even asked for troops
to deal with Yin Que.


274
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,840
I made such a proposal


275
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,160
in a moment of desperation.


276
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,140
That’s true.


277
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,760
Luckily, no big mistake has been made.


278
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,640
However, you ignored the grain shortage


279
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,360
of the Bird Family


280
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,240
and dealt with Elder Yin Que instead.


281
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,080
You have got your priorities back to front.


282
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,560
I didn’t ignore the grain shortage of the Bird Family.


283
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,980
I wrote to the Heaven Realm


284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,680
for borrowing grain three days ago.


285
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,820
The Heaven Realm hasn’t received your report.


286
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
That’s impossible.


287
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,160
If Elder Yin Que didn’t report it personally


288
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,580
to the Heaven Realm yesterday,


289
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,520
we may have no idea of it all the time.


290
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,500
Sui He,


291
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,600
you are unqualified for the leader of the Bird Family.


292
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,340
Yes.


293
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,460
You are unqualified for it.


294
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,900
Yes.


295
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,560
You are unqualified for it.


296
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,640
Princess Sui He,


297
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,680
just as what elders said,


298
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,020
you suppressed your enemy


299
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,640
and Elder Yin Que


300
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,480
while ignoring the lives of the Bird Family,


301
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,140
which has let His Majesty down.


302
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,780
His Majesty ordered me


303
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,020
to handle this matter with full authority.


304
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,640
However, I think


305
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,920
I should discuss it


306
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,900
with all elders of the Bird Family.


307
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,660
Your Highness, as you’re
deeply believed by His Majesty now,


308
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,120
we have no doubts.


309
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,300
What’s your opinion, Your Highness?


310
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,860
I think


311
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,880
now that Princess Sui He


312
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,380
doesn’t want to manage the Bird Family,


313
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,740
ask a virtuous and talented person to help her


314
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,160
deal with affairs of the family.


315
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,140
It’s just a suggestion.


316
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,220
The final decision


317
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,480
should be made by you.


318
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,820
Elder Yin Que did a great thing


319
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,880
by borrowing grain from
Heaven Realm for the Bird Family.


320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,680
Moreover, he has always cherished the Bird Family.


321
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,840
I’m sure he’ll work to bring benefit to the Bird Family.


322
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,920
I recommend him


323
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,220
to deal with the family’s affair for the time being.


324
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,340
We also recommend him to deal with


325
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,500
the family’s affair.


326
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,260
Please take care, Your Highness.


327
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,140
Elder Yin Que,


328
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,800
the Bird Family will be managed by you afterwards.


329
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,640
I admit that I fail.


330
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,440
Since I’ve known your trick,


331
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,340
I won’t change my mind.


332
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,920
That’s fine.


333
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,520
Barns of the Bird Family will be empty for two days.


334
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,580
Sui He will ask the Heaven Realm for help,


335
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
while her report


336
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,720
will disappear.


337
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,200
I hope you can borrow grain personally by then.


338
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,220
With this chance,


339
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,420
I’ll help you to gain the real power of the Bird Family.


340
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,720
It seems that I can’t refuse.


341
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,260
As long as you support me with the Bird Family,


342
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,980
you’ll be leader


343
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,240
of the Bird Family some day,


344
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,480
so you can do anything


345
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,340
you want to.


346
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,560
Leader?


347
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,940
What your status will be in the future?


348
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,040
Your Highness Night Immortal is really brilliant.


349
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,440
I’ll fail


350
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,840
no matter how hard I try.


351
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
Yin Que,


352
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,020
you colluded with Run Yu


353
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,800
instead of Demon Lord.


354
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,380
Everything I’ve done is


355
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,660
for the future of the Bird Family


356
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,940
rather than the selfish desire like you.


357
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,300
Don’t worry.


358
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,100
I’ll help you deal with


359
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,900
the affairs of the Bird Family with full authority.


360
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,640
Go. Go. Go.


361
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,300
Finally, we’re here in time.


362
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:30,780
Yes.


363
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,440
Look.


364
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,420
Listen, it needs 7 years of magic power.


365
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
Mu Ci,


366
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,820
wherever you’re,


367
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,440
I’ll find you.


368
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,000
Run now.


369
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,720
Is Mu Ci making Spirit-Vanishing Arrow again?


370
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,540
Does he still want to hurt Jin Mi?


371
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,800
Your Highness.


372
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,220
Go to Heaven Realm


373
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,380
to kill Run Yu now.


374
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,960
Night Immortal is the son of Heavenly Emperor.


375
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,440
So what?


376
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,300
He has destroyed what I’ve worked hard for


377
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,740
in thousands of years,


378
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,000
I’ll kill him.


379
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,660
He has strong magic power.


380
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,600
However, most of my magic power has
been used to make the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.


381
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,540
I can’t defeat him


382
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,120
even if I have Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.


383
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,880
I’ll go with you by then.


384
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,480
If foster mother knew you miss her so much,


385
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,960
she would be very pleased.


386
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,500
Why are you here?


387
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,580
I heard that the power of the Bird Family


388
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,080
has been taken over by Elder Yin Que.


389
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,420
I think


390
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,960
it must have something to do with you.


391
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,780
It seems that you begin to take action.


392
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,460
I just want to


393
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,380
fulfill my mom’s wish.


394
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
However, she made many mistakes


395
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,840
for this wish.


396
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,620
What on earth do you want to say?


397
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,660
I just hope that


398
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,340
you don’t follow her footsteps.


399
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,640
I’m afraid you can’t stay true to the mission


400
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
after making too many mistakes.


401
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,100
I can’t make any mistake on this way.


402
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,860
With just one mistake,


403
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,120
I’ll lose the whole game.


404
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,000
I have nothing to lose.


405
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,280
But when choosing this way,


406
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,660
have you thought about Jin Mi?


407
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,500
She is innocent.


408
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
She shouldn’t be used


409
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,020
or hurt by you.


410
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,380
The Xuanji Palace.


411
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
It went the Xuanji Palace?


412
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,580
Yes.


413
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,740
Go to have a look with me.


414
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,220
Fish Fairy.


415
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,200
Fish Fairy.


416
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,940
Fish Fairy, are you here?


417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,900
Well, thank you for saving me.


418
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Today, I specially come for you,
but you’re not here.


419
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,320
I’ll just leave it here.


420
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,020
I didn’t expect Run Yu isn’t here,


421
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,920
while you come by yourself.


422
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,140
That’s great.


423
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,940
What a rare chance!


424
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,200
Kill her with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow now.


425
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,340
The stem of noble dendrobium is very nourishing.


426
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
It can help you restore
magic power as soon as possible.


427
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,140
I hope it can cure you wound


428
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,220
to help you.


429
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,120
Let’s be an ordinary couple


430
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
in the mortal world.


431
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,900
I told you if you hurt Jin Mi again,


432
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,100
you’ll be my enemy.


433
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,720
Don’t do things that are against your conscience.


434
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,540
I know you aren’t that kind of person.


435
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,420
Shoot her now.


436
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Your Highness.


437
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,960
Jin Mi.


438
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,280
Jin Mi.


439
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,540
Take care of her.


440
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,200
Yes.


441
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,080
Your Highness.


442
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,100
Your Highness,


443
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,120
you still care about me.


444
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Jin Mi was hurt by fire magic just now.


445
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,700
Why did you do that?


446
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,980
You know the reason.


447
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,120
You love her,


448
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,700
while she sent tonic to Night Immortal.


449
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,300
I was so furious.


450
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,800
Mi.


451
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,040
What happened?


452
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,700
Someone wanted to hurt Fairy Jin Mi.


453
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,320
Luckily, the Second Prince saved her in time.


454
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,440
Where is he?


455
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,660
He ran after that person.


456
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,900
Go to help him now.


457
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,580
I’ll protect her.


458
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,820
OK.


459
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,200
Mi.


460
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,660
Mi.


461
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,900
Mi.


462
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,020
Fish Fairy.


463
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,440
What happened just now?


464
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,320
I specially sent you tonic just now.


465
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,100
When I was going to leave,


466
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
I was somehow hit


467
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,800
to the ground.


468
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,980
Then I remember nothing.


469
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,380
Did you save me, Fish Fairy?


470
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,280
No,


471
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,920
it was Xu Feng.


472
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,120
It happened in the Xuanji Palace,


473
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,160
so did they want to kill me?


474
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,280
But when choosing this way,


475
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,180
have you ever thought about Jin Mi?


476
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
She is innocent.


477
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
She shouldn’t used


478
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,060
or hurt by you.


479
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,920
It’s my fault.


480
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,719
I promise,


481
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,639
you won’t be hurt again


482
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,639
afterwards.


483
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,500
Thank you, Fish Fairy.


484
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
I’m fine.


485
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:31,840
Your Highness,


486
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,540
I didn’t mean to hurt her.


487
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,960
It was Qi Yuan.


488
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,260
He is the one who wanted to
kill her in the mortal world.


489
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,760
I know.


490
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,120
He is a friend of Princess of Bian City.


491
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,699
I’ve promised Liu Ying


492
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,880
I won’t kill him.


493
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,380
But he is perverse.


494
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,960
He must want to kill her today.


495
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,120
We can’t spare him.


496
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,719
Liu Ying said


497
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,320
he is kind.


498
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,639
I believe her.


499
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,960
Thank you, Xu Feng.


500
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,720
Mu Ci.


501
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,180
Where is Jin Mi?


502
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,600
Is she all right?


503
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
She is fine.


504
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,640
But he didn’t come to kill her.


505
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,440
Xu Feng,


506
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,900
Autopsy Wild Silkworms planted in him


507
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,300
require regular feeding.


508
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,460
Someone uses Mu Ci with it.


509
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,120
He has been forced to do all things before.


510
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,540
He has no choice.


511
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,380
Autopsy Wild Silkworms?


512
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,260
Did my mother do it?


513
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,480
Auntie saved her.


514
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,500
He chose to do work for auntie.


515
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,100
Auntie is still in jail,


516
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,760
while you want to disassociate from her.


517
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,720
How ungratefulness!


518
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,220
Sui He.


519
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,920
Now that my mother has been punished


520
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,620
and in jail,


521
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,220
I hope you can forgive her.


522
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,720
As you forgive Mu Ci,


523
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,180
I’ll ask for nothing else


524
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,220
but to take him back


525
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,100
and stay with him forever.


526
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,060
I’ll make atonement


527
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,840
for him.


528
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,580
From now on, no matter what the reason is,


529
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,200
if you hurt Jin Mi again,


530
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,880
I won’t let you go.


531
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,640
I’ll keep my promise in the mortal world that


532
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,720
I’ll save you when you’re in danger,


533
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,180
but don’t ever try to


534
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,000
touch my bottom line.


535
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,060
I want to meet Jin Mi.


536
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,920
She is sleeping.


537
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,100
She is all right.


538
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,000
I heard you saved her today.


539
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,600
Thank you.


540
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,100
Did you catch the murderer?


541
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,400
Sui He lost her temper and hurt Jin Mi.


542
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,840
Sui He?


543
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,100
This is not trivial.


544
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
Report to Father earlier.


545
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,760
No need.


546
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,800
Sui He...


547
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
It’s because of me.


548
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
I’ll deal with her.


549
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,860
Let me see her.


550
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,500
Xu Feng,


551
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,440
because of you,


552
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,500
Heavenly Empress and Sui He
hurt Jin Mi in succession.


553
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,720
Do you want to


554
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,840
kill her?


555
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,040
I have sent Kuang Lu to ask
Water Immortal to pick her up.


556
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,660
Please go back.


557
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,980
Xu Feng,


558
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,940
I have paid so much for you


559
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,940
and even my power was taken away now.


560
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,740
I’ve lost everything,


561
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,580
while you still just love Jin Mi.


562
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,000
Why?


563
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,660
Why?


564
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,620
Xu Feng.


565
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,240
Jin Mi.


566
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,160
I hope to meet you


567
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,540
at the midnight in the hall


568
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,260
to talk something about Jin Mi.


569
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,120
When will you let me go?


570
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,300
Never.


571
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,520
You’re the princess of the Demon Realm.


572
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,060
Why do you waste time on me?


573
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,040
You deserve it.


574
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,880
I,


575
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,220
I didn’t hurt your friend,


576
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,980
so


577
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,840
I won’t let you look down upon me.


578
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,700
Finally, you’re the Mu Ci I know.


579
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,680
Where have you been these days?


580
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,760
Why did you make another Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?


581
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,900
Originally, I wanted to kill Jin Mi


582
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,360
to deal with Autopsy Wild Silkworms
by Heavenly Empress.


583
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
However, at the last moment,


584
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,520
suddenly I felt that


585
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
I would rather die


586
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,500
than let you down.


587
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,540
I...


588
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,640
Don’t worry.


589
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,520
I’ll try to save you.
