
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 37"



00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,440
"Qizheng Hall"



00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,450
According to Her Majesty’s instructions,



00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,020
Your Highness,



00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,060
when you’re in mourning,



00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,540
you can stay in Xuanji Palace



00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,380
and don’t need to go out
to be on night duty for star arrangement.



00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,710
Yes.



00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,079
Her Majesty shows solicitude for you.



00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,940
so we’re specially ordered



00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,000
to send you two kinds of different mourning dresses



00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,140
for selection.



00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,200
Put them down.



00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,740
Her Majesty said,



00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,340
you can decide



00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,970
to choose the one of Heaven Realm
or that of Arowana Family,



00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,020
and then we need to take the other one back.



00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,220
According to the custom of the Arowana Family,



00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,570
I should wear the funeral raw jute clothing
to observe mourning for my mother.



00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,140
Her Majesty loves you dearly.



00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,220
The raw jute cloth is rough.



00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,450
You’re delicate, so you can’t bear it.



00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,250
The funeral linen clothing of
Heaven Realm is more suitable.



00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,770
You’re supposed to resist against



00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,400
the Heavenly Empress and the Bird Family afterwards.



00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,600
We have to go back to report to Her Majesty.



00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,370
We take our leave.



00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,420
Is it a mourning rule in the Heaven Realm



00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,650
to throw away the funeral clothing?



00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,170
Why is the first Prince angry?



00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,820
As ruled in the Heaven Realm,



00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,000
one has to wear the funeral linen clothing
when observing mourning,



00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,050
but in our family,



00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,000
the funeral raw jute clothing should be worn.



00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,770
So he made a wrong choice?



00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,740
I’m useless.



00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,880
Don’t blame yourself.



00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,080
Keep filial piety in your heart.



00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
Your mother knew that.



00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,700
It’s very hard for you to observe mourning for her



00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,310
under the great pressure from
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress.



00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,540
I believe she would smile in the underworld.



00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,740
It’s far from enough.



00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,680
I won’t settle down



00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,310
if I don’t avenge my mother.



00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,380
Why not leave everything behind



00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,860
and go away with me and Li?



00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,710
Now,



00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,380
I’m afraid



00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,770
it’s an extravagant hope
to be as unworldly as wild stock.



00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,600
What’s your plan in the future?



00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,370
No haste, be patient.



00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,570
Your mother once asked me



00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,220
to give it to you



00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,620
if the situation changed.



00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,740
What’s in it?



00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,510
I have never opened it.



00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,450
Check it yourself.



00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Force Deployment Map
of the Bird Family on Yimiao Continent



00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,620
Your Majesty,



00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,420
the first Prince chose the funeral linen clothing.



00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,910
You can leave.



00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,050
Yes.



00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,110
Auntie, you’re a genius.



00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,250
You sound Night Immortal out
with the funeral clothing.



00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,850
Now you know whether
he follows the Heaven Realm



00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,680
or the Arowana Family.



00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,420
He is smart,



00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,450
loyal and sensible.



00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,110
Don’t underestimate him.



00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,170
When he was young,



00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
he scaled himself cruelly



00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,280
and dared to take the Fumeng Elixir I gave him.



00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,510
He was devastated



00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,280
when Su Li died.



00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
I’m sure that he won’t leave the matter at that.



00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,909
But



00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,200
he is His Majesty’s son.



00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,740
I won’t go too far.



00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,170
I just sounded him out



00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,800
as a warning.



00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,020
Auntie, you’re circumspect and farsighted.



00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,800
I must learn from you more.



00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,820
It’s the birthday of Moon Immortal today.



00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,110
Send my gift to him.



00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,820
Yes.



00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,540
"House of Marriage"



00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,600
Mister Immortal,



00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,250
we come to celebrate your birthday.



00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,620
May your fortune
be as boundless as the East Sea.



00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,200
May you live a long life
as the pine tree in the Southern Mountain.



00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,820
The same congratulations.



00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,770
Are you blind?



00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,340
I’m young



00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,710
with delicate features.



00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,620
Don’t compare me to the wrinkled old pine tree



00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,940
in the Southern Mountain.



00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,020
Yes.



00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,540
What’s this?



00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,450
His Highness is still grounded



00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,020
to reflect on his misdeeds in palace today,



00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,710
so he ordered us to present the birthday gift.



00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,909
You gave an irrelevant answer.



00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,880
I asked you what it was,



00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
but you talked rubbish.



00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,680
Forget it. You can leave.



00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,570
Mister Immortal, we're leaving.



00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,710
It’s a brilliant idea



00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,480
to collect those treasures.



00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,570
I’m flattered.



00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,340
It’s to cater to Moon Immortal’s pleasure.



00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,460
Thy are the most fashionable story-telling scripts



00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,310
in the Human Realm.



00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,800
Moon Immortal



00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,740
must be happy.



00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,049
I don’t praise you.



00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,850
It seems you ignored your
proper occupation in mortal world,



00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,280
and always ran irrelevant business
with your fellows.



00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,169
If you didn’t hinder me,



00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,110
I



00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,620
I would have pacified the world



00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,110
and created a flourishing age in mortal world.



00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,880
Sorry.



00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,140
But



00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,680
you indeed become smarter



00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,020
after the experience in mortal world.



00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,140
I’m praising you.



00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,020
Mister Immortal.



00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,650
Jin Mi,



00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,370
here you are.



00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,650
Mister Immortal, you make a mistake again.



00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,570
I’m not Fairy Jin Mi.



00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,850
Kuang Lu.



00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,620
What’s up?



00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,480
Why do you get a nosebleed?



00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,280
I get inflamed.



00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,250
Come.



00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,110
Xu Feng



00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,450
sent a box of pornographic scripts.



00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,650
They’re new.



00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,110
Let’s read them together.



00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,020
Well,



00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,370
I come to you for something else.



00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,000
His Highness can’t go out
as he is observing mourning for his mother,



00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,510
so he ordered me to come
to celebrate your birthday.



00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
May you be young forever.



00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,510
You’re clever.



00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,140
It’s a good thing.



00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,420
It’s shining.



00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,740
With it,



00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,770
I can read the scripts



00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,450
Xu Feng sent at night.



00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,170
Wonderful.



00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,600
Run Yu is poor.



00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,220
Give him my thanks



00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
and consolations.



00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,880
I will.



00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,140
Thank you, Mister Immortal.



00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,510
Well,



00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,510
Run Yu can’t attend my birthday banquet.



00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,770
Kuang Lu, come.



00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,600
Let’s drink and enjoy ourselves.



00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,450
I’m a low-level fairy.



00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,000
I’m afraid…



00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,850
Water Immortal will bring Jin Mi.



00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,850
Ask your father to bring you.



00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,510
Or,



00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,710
I’ll be lonely at the banquet.



00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,250
I’m unhappy.



00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,080
Then I’ll come.



00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,910
Thank you, Mister Immortal.



00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,250
Good girl.



00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,200
I’m taking my leave now.



00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay.



00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,650
Wind Immortal, Water Immortal,



00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,050
Immortal Jin Mi come.



00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,940
Amazing.



00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Water Immortal.



00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,340
Jin Mi.



00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,310
Come on.



00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,540
Help yourselves.



00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,850
Don’t stand on ceremony. Come on.



00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,140
Make yourselves at home.



00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,060
Eat whatever you like.



00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,420
Do you know what my gift is?



00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,400
What is it?



00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Something from the mortal world.



00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,080
Try it.



00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,910
So clear!



00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,180
I can see things more clearly.



00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,580
Do you like it?



00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,620
Wonderful.



00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,680
With this treasure,



00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,140
I can read 100 scripts in a day.



00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,200
Jin Mi,



00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,820
it turns out that you’re
more beautiful than what I imagined.



00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,050
Princess Sui He comes.



00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,110
Fairy Yuan Ji comes.



00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,740
Mister Immortal,



00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,000
I come on behalf of Her Majesty.



00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,020
Okay. Good girl, help yourself.



00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,370
Yuan Ji. Yuan Ji.



00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,970
Good girl. I don’t want to eat it.



00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,340
Yuan Ji,



00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,710
you’re so stingy.



00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,570
You come without bringing a gift.



00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,620
I was thinking



00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,280
how to continue the
second life of the white snake



00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,250
after the collapse of
Leifeng Pagoda these days.



00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,970
I wanted to



00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,080
make her a fruit elf in the Floral Realm,



00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,850
and you could decide
her destiny and marriage.



00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,620
But it seems that



00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,220
you don’t like my gift.



00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,420
Yuan Ji,



00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,280
I know you care about me.



00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,250
It’s



00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,710
an excellent gift.



00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,250
Go. Let’s drink.



00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,880
Go.



00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,340
Eat it.



00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,680
Thank you, Daddy.



00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,110
I still think it’s unusual.



00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,770
I feel the same way.



00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,310
Jin Mi.



00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,940
It has to be talked about at length.



00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,740
By then…



00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,310
Daddy.



00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,450
Go.



00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,570
Besides me,



00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,510
do you like Xu Feng?



00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes.



00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,570
How about Moon Immortal?



00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,940
Yes.



00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,370
And Lord Yan You?



00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,020
Yes.



00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,940
If Jin Mi is a piece of barren land,



00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,740
no matter what seed is sowed
and what fertilizer is applied,



00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,620
no matter how you water it
with the utmost care,



00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,080
it won’t blossom in return.



00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,940
Falling in love with her
is like a stone dropped into the sea.



00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,080
There will be no respond from her.



00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
It takes time and energy.



00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,340
Are you afraid?



00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,510
Jin Mi is essentially a good girl,



00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,170
but she is cold and heartless from childhood.



00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
She doesn’t like anyone,



00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,110
not to mention love.



00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,740
She used to be cold,



00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,710
passionate but ruthless.



00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,620
Now she is heartless but single-minded.



00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,020
Why does she



00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,000
change so dramatically?



00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,400
I took Floating Dream Pill before,



00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,170
so I forgot my mother and childhood memory.



00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,880
Is Mi controlled?



00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,650
Mi,



00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,710
which one is the real you?



00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,420
Yun Elixir?



00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,510
His Majesty comes.



00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,740
Your Majesty, welcome.



00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,220
Your Majesty, welcome.



00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,480
Your Majesty, welcome.



00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,970
Don’t stand on ceremony.



00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,080
It’s the birthday banquet
of Moon Immortal today.



00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,510
Make yourselves at home.



00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,620
Your Majesty, you have to
deal with a host of problems every day.



00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,200
Why brings you here today?



00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Moon Immortal, do you blame me
for coming without being invited



00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
or complain I haven’t come for long?



00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,110
Not at all.



00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,340
My humble house is honored by your presence.



00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,020
Our family members have come.



00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,400
There are not many people,



00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,540
so it’s sort of deserted.



00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,310
My Eight Characters are unlucky.



00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,200
During my birthday banquet,



00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,970
the first Prince is observing
mourning for his mother,



00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,340
while the second Prince is grounded...



00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
You want me to release them?



00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,650
Forget them.



00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,050
Let’s enjoy ourselves.



00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,080
Immortal Tai Si is here.



00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,880
You know many novel poems.



00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,450
It's a good idea to take it as an entertainment.



00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay. Your Majesty,



00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,110
I learned a poem in mortal world recently.



00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,740
I’ll entertain



00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,400
you and everyone here.



00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,310
Please.



00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,050
Let’s enjoy it.



00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,310
Don’t you see Lord Xu’s two sons
who were born utterly remarkable?



00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,650
The duo came one after another
following an auspicious dream.



00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,170
Confucius and the Buddha
personally brought them in their arms.



00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,680
Both are from the heaven, unicorn foals.



00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,310
The elder is nine years old,
he is clever and pure.



00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,770
Autumn waters are his soul,
jade is his bones.



00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,510
The younger son is five years old,
exhibiting an imposing presence.



00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,020
The guests that fill the hall
all turn their heads.



00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,540
I know that Lord Xu has no worries at all.



00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,079
A continuous flood of accumulated virtue
produces these dukes or counts.



00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,970
When a man have sons like these two chicks,



00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,569
how could his fame and position
end up small or low?



00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,220
Wonderful.



00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,339
Your Majesty,



00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,770
when I first heard this poem in Human Realm,



00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,850
the heroic bearing of you and your sons



00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,510
occurred to me.



00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,170
This poem



00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,820
is presented to you.



00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,340
Lickspittle.



00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,250
Lower your voice.



00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,420
Only you can hear me.



00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,020
Everyone present can practice this skill.



00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,280
What if someone intercepts it halfway?



00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,140
Dan Zhu.



00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,480
What’re you two talking about?



00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,280
The game "Pass the parcel".



00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,400
Anyone want to play?



00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,820
Time flies.



00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,050
We have become old,



00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,570
and our children have grown up



00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,910
and will get married.



00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,850
It’s a good thing.



00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,680
Pitifully, Floral Immortal can’t witness it.



00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,050
She is dead, but I miss her very much.



00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,820
Your Majesty, you have deep love,
strive after virtue, practice good deeds



00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,080
and protect all living creatures.



00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,510
Your sons are noble and dignified.



00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,710
It’s really your virtue and
the blessing of the Heaven Realm.



00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,600
You’re also a lickspittle.



00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,680
I flatter His Majesty.



00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,020
Then others can’t do that.



00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,850
My sons have grown up,



00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,970
but they worry me.



00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,710
Water Immortal and Immortal Tai Si



00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,100
is blessed with thoughtful daughters.



00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,620
Kuang Lu, stand up.



00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,680
Come on. Stand up.



00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,000
Come on.



00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,000
Come on.



00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,620
Your Majesty,



00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,510
I have one daughter only.



00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,370
Kuang Lu, greet His Majesty.



00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,420
Your Majesty.



00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,620
Stand up.



00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,200
You indeed look like dew,



00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,340
clear, crystal, slim and graceful.



00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,650
Are you of the same age with Jin Mi and Sui He?



00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,370
Your Majesty,



00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,340
may I make bold to ask you for a favor?



00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,020
My daughter is too honest



00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,400
and docile.



00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,110
Your Majesty,



00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,740
please betroth



00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,080
her to a good husband.



00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,850
Unexpectedly, he would request this.



00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,820
His Majesty shows solicitude
for the weak and the old.



00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,050
Then he cottons up to
His Majesty with his daughter.



00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,880
I give in.



00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,740
The first Prince has been engaged with Jin Mi.



00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,340
It seems that



00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,850
he is eager to betroth his daughter
to the second Prince.



00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,140
It turns out that he has other purposes.



00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,170
Daddy.



00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,510
I’m not drunk.



00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,510
My father is drunk.



00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,080
Your Majesty, please forgive him
for forgetting himself in his cups.



00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,820
Taisi,



00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,170
you’re indeed drunk.



00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,280
You should turn to me for your daughter’s marriage.



00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,340
Why do you turn to His Majesty?



00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,110
You’re not responsible for
the marriages of the Heaven Realm.



00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,250
Why should we turn to you?



00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,910
Parents’ love can’t be punished.



00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,340
We drink and talk today.



00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,220
You can say everything.



00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,540
Daddy.



00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,800
Daddy, you’re drunk.



00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
I’m not.



00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,620
Their fathers have great magic power.



00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,800
They love each other dearly.



00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,710
Daddy, eat it.



00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,970
Daddy, you were the most handsome
in Huaiwu when you were young.



00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,710
You’re always the best father in this world



00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,000
in my mind.



00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,680
You have an imposing and graceful appearance.



00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,620
You’re clever and nice.



00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,650
I’m jealous of



00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,400
the lucky man



00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,800
who marries you.



00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,370
But it is a pity that compared with Xu Feng,



00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,020
you’re nothing



00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,250
but a mere mortal.



00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,420
I don't feel quite myself.



00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,570
I have to leave.



00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,770
Sui,



00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,110
why are you



00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,710
so obsessive with someone



00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,770
who doesn’t love you?



00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,000
If he really cared about you,



00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,000
he would have married you.



00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,420
I killed my father.



00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,110
I killed the only person who treated me sincerely



00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,340
and loved me the most dearly,



00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,220
but Xu Feng still doesn’t love me.



00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,370
Xu Feng,



00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,080
I hate you.



00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,280
Jin Mi,



00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,110
I hate you.



00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,570
You’re back.



00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,570
Does Moon Immortal like the green screen
with the patter of mist and clouds?



00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,740
You



00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,770
should go to visit him more frequently.



00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,680
You know?



00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,970
You can leave.



00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,000
OK.



00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,800
Auntie,



00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,250
in both the Heaven Realm and the Human Realm,



00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,710
everyone likes



00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,280
Jin Mi.



00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,940
I can’t defeat her, right?



00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,250
The second Prince will never love me, right?



00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,910
Shut up.



00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,910
You’re in low spirits.



00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,050
How can you lead the Bird Family?



00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,340
What can I do?



00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,050
Even if I die,



00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,020
the second Prince won’t care about it.



00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,820
Stand up.



00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,110
Listen carefully.



00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,770
The Bird Family is noble.



00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,800
We must be strong.



00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,620
Your sufferings



00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,850
will pay off.



00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,200
It’s not the last moment yet.



00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,050
The winner remains unknown,



00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,420
right?



00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,710
There, there.



00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,020
Don’t cry.



00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,540
I heard of your mother’s death.



00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,800
I’m overwhelmed with indignation.



00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,680
Please restrain your grief.



00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,820
I share the same enemy and hatred with Jin Mi.



00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,400
Chief Peony,



00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,340
something confuses me.



00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,170
Please enlighten me.



00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,110
Go ahead.



00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,250
Mi is different from the ordinary people in love.



00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,970
Why did you say that?



00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,970
I remember that you once said



00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,000
Jin Mi is a rarely heartless girl in this world,



00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,680
but it’s a painful topic.



00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,420
When I read in Xingjing Court,



00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,680
I accidentally found that
it might be related to Yun Elixir.



00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,420
It’s good that she lives



00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,970
a happy and carefree life,



00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,140
but according to my original intention,



00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,680
I am more willing to help her take out Yun Elixir.



00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,570
No one should deprive her of the right to love.



00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,650
If so,



00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,510
are you confident to protect Jin Mi?



00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,620
It’s predicted that Jin Mi will
have a love problem in 10,000 years.



00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,280
If the elixir is taken out, how to protect her?



00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,970
Did you tell the truth of Yun Elixir



00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,000
to Jin Mi?



00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,080
No.



00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,370
If she knows the truth,



00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,200
I don’t know what the consequences will be.



00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,050
Don’t worry.



00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,710
As I said,



00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,250
I must protect her



00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,140
anyway.



00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,850
Sorry for



00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,020
what happened that night.



00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,710
We’re accomplices.



00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,450
I am also responsible.



00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,710
You’re now my man.



00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,540
Don’t worry.



00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,020
I’ll be responsible for you.



00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,170
You look like a gangster.



00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,540
Don’t you know



00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,540
the man I loved in the previous life



00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,310
was a bandit named Crow?



00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,140
I was his wife.



00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,310
Then you’ll be Fire Immortal’s wife afterwards.



00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,000
I have told my father about it.



00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,370
What did he say?



00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,140
He didn’t say no,



00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,370
but some things worried him.



00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,540
He asked me to think over.



00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,480
I know what his worries are.



00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,280
Don’t worry.



00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,540
I’ll solve them as soon as possible.



00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,340
I made this



00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,050
for you.



00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,540
What’s it?



00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,970
You’re stupid.



00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,370
It’s Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.



00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,510
Place it in your heart



00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,220
and activate it with magic power.



00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,370
Then you can get the beautiful scenery
with spring flowers and autumn fruits.



00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,620
It’s spring in the morning and autumn in the evening.



00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,660
It can last one day.



00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,600
Do you know where the beautiful scenery comes?



00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,740
Where?



00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,740
Let me tell you secretly.



00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,000
It’s stolen from the Floral Realm.



00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,740
Chief Peony must be startled by then.



00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,340
I can’t eat it or fight with it.



00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,880
It’s useless.



00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,220
You’re right.



00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,250
Fine.



00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,050
I’ll take it back and turn it into a weapon.



00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,620
Why are there spring flowers and autumn fruits only?



00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,940
I also want



00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,250
your summer heat and winter snow.



00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,600
It’s not necessary.



00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,600
You’re Fire Immortal,



00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,420
so you have summer heat.



00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,800
And I have winter snow.



00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,540
Then there are four seasons.



00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,340
When does my stupid girl



00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,170
become so clever?



00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,850
Well,



00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,620
I’ll place it in my soul



00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,220
and protect it.



00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,340
I have...



00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,650
I have to go.



00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,380
"Xuanji Palace"



00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,000
Are you waiting for me here?



00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,250
Where are you going?



00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,880
Slow down.



00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,250
Slow down.



00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,170
Slow down.



00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,570
Well, I know.



00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,540
I’ll go in.



00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,910
Fish Fairy.



00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,880
Fish Fairy, what happened?



00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,940
When I was young,



00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,000
I always felt myself inferior



00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,880
as I had a strange shape



00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,620
and pale color in Taihu Lake.



00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,250
At that time,



00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,140
to become a cryprinus carpiod,



00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,650
I practiced without a stop



00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,710
every day.



00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,910
I didn’t know until I came here that



00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,280
I was doing something useless



00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,740
in the past



00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,170
thousands of years.



00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,250
In fact, I am not a cryprinus carpiod,



00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,710
but a white loong which wanted to become a fish.



00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,600
Recalling it now,



00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,680
I was like a frog at the bottom of a well at the time.



00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,110
Look at me.



00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,280
I used to be a plebeian fruit fairy for 4,000 years.



00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,280
Originally, I thought



00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,880
I was a fruit fairy,



00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,370
but unexpectedly,



00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,110
I’m a frost flower made from water.



00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,110
So we’re



00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,080
the same.



00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,080
In fact,



00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,450
it’s happy to be



00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,740
a frog at the bottom of a well.



00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,650
Sometimes



00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,220
the more I know,



00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,080
the more pain I suffer.



00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,370
Fish Fairy,



00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,770
are you missing your mother?



00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,250
The broad-leaved epiphyllum
blossomed the night before last,



00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,820
but you were absent.



00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,820
No one appreciated the blossom



00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,510
or smell its fragrance.



00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,650
It may be



00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,770
the saddest thing for a flower.



00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,510
You’re wrong.



00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,220
I gave it to you,



00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,020
so you’re its owner.



00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,800
Since you were here,



00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,600
it didn’t blossom in vain.



00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,140
I’m really its owner?



00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,480
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>



00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,140
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>



00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,110
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>



00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,420
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>



00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,080
<i>I hope to wash away the vanity,</i>



00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,250
<i>wipe the dust on me</i>



00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,280
<i>and get drunk with you again</i>



00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,340
<i>with a pot of clear wine.</i>



00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,219
For thousands of years,



00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,480
I just showed my real body twice,



00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,280
but you witnessed it.



00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,880
Don’t laugh at me.



00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,570
I don’t want much in this life.



00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,770
Love me a little bit more every day.



00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,310
Day after day,



00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,710
month after month



00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,370
and year after year.



00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,140
I don’t care even if you love me just a little bit.



00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,570
I hope your love lasts forever.



00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,250
Will you?



00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,570
It’s late at night.



00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,110
I have to go back.



00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,620
It really cracks.



00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,400
Mi,



00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,970
you treat Xu Feng without reservation.



00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,570
You know what,



00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,510
when I saw the dream
shown by the Beast of Dreams



00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,340
and you kissed each other,



00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,910
do you know how sad I was?



00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,820
I wish



00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,280
you didn’t know what love was,



00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,770
wouldn’t fall in love,



00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,740
couldn’t love anyone



00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,650
or be in love.



00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,620
I have nothing left.



00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,910
I only have you.



00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,910
Don’t leave me,



00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,740
okay?



00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,310
Frost Flower, why do you ignore me?



00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,940
Don’t you want to go out?



00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
Liu Ying



00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,140
Jin Mi, please do me a favor.
