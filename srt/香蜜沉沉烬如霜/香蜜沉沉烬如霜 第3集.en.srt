1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 03"

3
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,240
Such powerful water spell.

4
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,640
Who else could cast it other than
you here in the heaven?

5
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,560
Moreover, a servant saw you
around Qiwu Palace on that day.

6
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
You were supposed to guard the
Northern Heavenly Gate that night.

7
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,440
Something went wrong with
Xu Feng's nirvana.

8
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
Tell me,

9
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
is this real?

10
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,820
Father.

11
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,360
That night,

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,360
I did drop by at Qiwu Palace.

13
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,730
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,820
I know that Xu Feng is having a
hard time with his nirvana.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,040
I followed the man in black
to Qiwu Palace.

16
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,350
I wanted to protect him.

17
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,620
But...

18
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
How was it?

19
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,120
You'd seen that person?

20
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,310
Who was he?

21
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,920
Why didn't you inform us?

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,880
I fought with the man in black.

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
I could tell that he's powerful but
he wasn't interested in fighting.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,640
He ran away after a few rounds.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,360
I saw Lord Liaoyuan was
guarding Qiwu Palace,

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,720
and it was at the crucial moment
of Xu Feng's nirvana.

27
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,170
I didn't want to disturb him.

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
So I left after a few words
with Liaoyuan.

29
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,870
We never would have expected you to say this,

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,670
but your words alone,

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
are not convincing.

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,560
I know that Father and
Mother are wise,

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,480
I would never hurt Xu Feng.

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,600
I practice water spell.

35
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,810
I can never get near to
the flame of nirvana.

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,240
That's the first point.

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
Secondly,

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,260
I was injured by that person
due to carelessness.

39
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,640
Even though he used the sleet,

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,079
but he seems to be fearless to fire.

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,280
You're burnt.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,160
Why didn't you inform us
regarding your injury?

43
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,410
Black feathers doesn't necessarily
belong to crow or magpie.

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,760
They might belong to a burnt phoenix.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'd never imagined this crow
to be a magical bird.

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,640
We'll have endless supply
of elixir pills then.

47
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,460
We can't blame Liaoyuan for this.

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Nirvana of the phoenix family
has always been risky.

49
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,390
Though I've fallen into wilderness,

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,780
but I'm back unharmed with the
help of the little demon.

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,640
It's my destiny after all.

52
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,710
Your Highness, since you're back safe,

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
I'll have nothing to worry about.

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,409
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress
are worried about your safety.

55
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:35,010
They'd called in Night Immortal just now...

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,670
to punish him.

57
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,850
Run Yu?

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Take me to my father now.

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,960
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,720
Investigation wasn't done yet.

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,150
By listening to Run Yu's mere words...

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,440
The Fire Immortal has arrived!

63
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,330
Greetings to Father and Mother.

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,520
Xu! Xu!

65
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,750
Please get up. Are you hurt?

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
I was so worried.

67
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,970
I apologize for causing you to worry.

68
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,590
What'd happened?

69
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,310
Where were you all this while?

70
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,820
Father.

71
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,520
I was attacked during my nirvana...

72
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,910
by sleet weapon.

73
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,480
And I'd fallen into wilderness
for a few days.

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,960
And I wanted to find the culprit.

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,400
Therefore I've spent a few days more.

76
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
I'd never expected to
bring chaos to you.

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,950
I was being reckless.

78
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,960
Please forgive me.

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,659
Have you found the culprit?

80
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Not yet.

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
But I'm sure that it has nothing
to do with brother.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
I've found out some traces.

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,360
The truth will be unearthed soon.

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
Stand up.

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,720
Both of you...

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
do care a lot about each other.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm happy to see this.

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Good that you're back.

89
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,920
During the days when you're gone,

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,640
your mother has been
worried about you.

91
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,260
You have to comfort her.

92
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,610
Yes.

93
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,910
I know.

94
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,330
It's really a good news that
The Fire Immortal is now back.

95
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,650
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

96
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
Your Majesty.

97
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,670
Since Xu is now back safe.

98
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,660
I hope that you'll
fulfill your promise.

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Summon the six realms.

100
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,510
And decide on the titles.

101
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Father. Mother.

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,240
What is it all about?

103
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,320
Your father and I had made a vow.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
The day when you're back safe,

105
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,909
will be the day the Heaven Realm
to crown it's crown prince.

106
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,750
Now that we're under the attack of
army of Demon Realm,

107
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I think,

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,960
we'll talk about this when Xu Feng
brings victory home.

109
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,620
News!

110
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,510
Your Majesty!

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
The army of Demon Realm has
retreated from Lethe.

112
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,860
Any reason for that?

113
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,050
According to witness,

114
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,090
The Fire Immortal broke into King of
Yan City's headquarter last night,

115
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
and scared off the army.

116
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,900
Scaring the army off by
a mere appearance,

117
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
what an ability it is!

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
Your Majesty.

119
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,540
You have always been fair
with praise and punishment.

120
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,530
Fire Immortal.

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,920
What do you think?

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
I plead father and mother
to retrieve your order.

123
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,240
It's my job to lead the army and
protect my homeland.

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,360
Their retreat is just
a delaying tactic.

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,680
From what I'd observed
yesterday night,

126
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
the King of Yan City
will definitely be back.

127
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Banishing the enemy is far more
important than anything else.

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
Please excuse me.

129
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,080
I shall prepare the army for war.

130
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,190
I can only help you to get rid of
the flame poison in your body.

131
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,760
You might experience pain
for these few days.

132
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,880
Our physiques contradict each other.

133
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,370
If I forcefully heal you,

134
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,950
you'll bear worse injury.

135
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,880
Fire and water have never
gotten along.

136
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,900
Please save your magical prowess
for something else.

137
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm afraid that I can't handle more.

138
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,610
You know that fire and
water don't get along,

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,600
then why did you still
come to my rescue?

140
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,960
You'd do the same too, right?

141
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,360
Liaoyuan has just cleared the
ice poison in your body.

142
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,200
And now you're here to help me.

143
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,880
Mother will blame me if she
finds out about this.

144
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,920
This is to thank you
for saving my life.

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
Xu Feng.

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,510
Everyone suspected me.

147
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,680
Don't you have doubts?

148
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Of course I do.

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,920
You can't run away if anything
happened to me.

150
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,280
I rushed to your rescue without even
changing into my clean clothes.

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
I thank you for that.

152
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,410
You're powerful.

153
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,080
But still you're severely injured.

154
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,350
Apparently the one who wanted to
kill me must be very powerful.

155
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm afraid that I can't
handle him alone.

156
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,300
What happened that day?

157
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,260
During my nirvana that day,

158
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,230
I felt a decrease in
the fire intensity.

159
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,350
The surrounding was icy cold.

160
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
And I couldn't move.

161
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,480
I could only use my inner force to
pass through the meridians.

162
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,750
And jumped into the sea of cloud
without the enemy noticing.

163
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
As for the rest,

164
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,480
I knew nothing about it.

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,960
He is good at water spells,

166
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,760
and fearless of the flame of nirvana.

167
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
That's really weird.

168
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,680
I've told father and mother that
I will investigate this matter.

169
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,440
This is to put the enemy at ease,

170
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,080
and let you investigate
for me in secret.

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,000
And get the culprit caught
as soon as possible.

172
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,080
Don't worry.

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll dig for the truth,

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
to make up to you.

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,960
And prove my innocence.

176
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,520
But still...

177
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,960
you have to brush up
your magical prowess.

178
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,600
So that you won't cause me trouble.

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,920
Just like today.

180
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,120
You're in such a mess.

181
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,070
"Zifangyun Palace"

182
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
Your Majesty.

183
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,480
Fire Immortal doesn't suspect him. He helped with his injury,

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
and they even had tea together.

185
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,910
They don't seem to be turning their
backs on each other.

186
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,160
Stupid child.

187
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,320
He doesn’t know that he's making
friends with the wrong people.

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
If it wasn't for me who
helps him in planning,

189
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,800
he wouldn't even know if he has
handed the throne to someone else.

190
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,800
Keep an eye on Run Yu.

191
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
If anything happens,

192
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,680
come to me at once.

193
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,880
Yes.

194
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,440
So this is Heavenly Palace?

195
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,480
There's nothing special
about it after all.

196
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,320
The mist is covering the floor,

197
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,440
I can't see the path properly.

198
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,360
Why did it disappear again?

199
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
What’s happening?

200
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,720
Those flowers look
green and cheerful,

201
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,800
why do they disappear after
I touch them?

202
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,720
Am I not powerful enough?

203
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,880
That even flowers look down on me?

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,600
Stingy.

205
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm not plucking anymore.

206
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,800
Weird.

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,840
Why isn't there even a flower
in Phoenix's front yard?

208
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,200
I should have gone to other places.

209
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,680
Is this fox?

210
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
It feels soft by touch.

211
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,840
And it looks cute too.

212
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,440
I've been living for so many years,

213
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,530
finally someone harassed me.

214
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,080
I feel thankful for that.

215
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,790
Harass?

216
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
What does it mean?

217
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,360
Why do you say so?

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,160
Where do you come from, Fairchild?

219
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,800
What's your name?

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm not a Fairchild.

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,760
Just call me Jin Mi.

222
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm just...

223
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
I'm just a half-fairy.

224
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
Half-fairy?

225
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,000
Seems like I've taken a long nap.

226
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,680
There's a new ranking for fairy
in the Heaven Realm.

227
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm half way through my practice,
that makes me a half-fairy.

228
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Isn't this Xu Feng's garden?

229
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,760
So you're Xu Feng's Fairchild?

230
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm not a Fairchild of
that burnt phoenix.

231
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm his Saviour.

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,040
Saviour!

233
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
Come, little Jin Mi.
I love story time.

234
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,040
Let's go.

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,300
Who is he?

236
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,280
How can one be proficient in
both water and fire magic?

237
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,600
That phoenix was burnt and
fell into Floral Realm.

238
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
A gentleman in distress.

239
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,280
And I bumped into him.

240
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,520
Pretty Fairchild.

241
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,310
I passed him some air.

242
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
Body contact!

243
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,070
Then I waited for him
to regain consciousness.

244
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Then what? Say it!

245
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,600
I was waiting for your...

246
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,180
After he woke up,

247
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,050
he brought me to the Heaven
Realm to thank me for helping.

248
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,680
That's how a romance started.

249
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,720
It's classic.

250
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,310
I like the story very much.

251
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,200
Why doesn't he smell bad?

252
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,680
Fate loves to make fun of people.

253
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,800
Too bad you're a boy.

254
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,620
I think Xu Feng would have
fallen for you.

255
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,360
The burnt phoenix said
that I'm a girl.

256
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,440
Am I a boy or a girl?

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
Little Jin Mi.

258
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,510
Let you tell you something.

259
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,440
I was the one who started the word
"bao en" (repay one's kindness).

260
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,230
But one of the words were passed down
wrongly time after time.

261
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,110
Which is such a waste of my effort.

262
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
This is the right word.

263
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,600
Bao (hug) en (kindness).

264
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,040
One must hug to repay the kindness.

265
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,800
Since you're the first one
who'd ever harassed me,

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,840
I'll give you a red string.

267
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,200
Tie it round Xu Feng's ankle.

268
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,600
So that your romance will blossom.

269
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
Bad luck will turn into good one.

270
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,040
Moon Immortal has been generous.

271
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,180
Five, six, seven,

272
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,280
eight, nine, ten,

273
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,240
eleven, twelve...

274
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
It seems that...

275
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
Moon Immortal has endless
supply of red string.

276
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,560
If you stop giving them to the
servant fairies in my house,

277
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,920
I'll thank you for that.

278
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,400
Little kiddo is all grown up now.

279
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,360
You'll never listen to
your uncle anymore.

280
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,360
I remember the time when
you were still a little chick,

281
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,600
you love to play among the
red strings in my house.

282
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,640
But now...

283
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,160
you even sounded strange to me.

284
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,590
I feel so sad.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,080
Kiddo?

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
You're exaggerating, uncle.

287
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,550
My nephew is a good boy.

288
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,820
That's how family members
address each other.

289
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
I'd never expected...

290
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,470
that both of you are uncle and nephew.

291
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,440
Never judge an immortal by his looks.

292
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,050
Jin Mi is good.

293
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,960
Take her as your mistress.

294
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,550
Who's Jin Mi?

295
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,920
Is the "Mi" in your name Jin Mi...

296
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,470
derived from honey (mi tang)?

297
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,440
No it isn't.

298
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,480
It must be...

299
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,310
Mi from xun mi (search)?

300
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
No.

301
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,570
My Mi is from "mi shi"
(looking for food).

302
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,650
Aren't both of them the same word?

303
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,530
Great! That's great!

304
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,600
How old are you?

305
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,080
When is your birthday?

306
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Where are you from?

307
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,960
How many are there in your family?

308
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,200
It's boring here, Jin Mi.

309
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,560
Why don't you come and tour around
my house of marriage?

310
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,760
Please excuse me.

311
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,800
It's really boring here. Fine!

312
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,120
Let's go!

313
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,330
"House of Marriage"

314
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
He is handsome.

315
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,920
He is really good looking.

316
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,370
His skin is flawless.

317
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
This boy is so attractive.

318
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,680
If he lives for a few thousand
years more,

319
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,870
countless fairies will swoon over him.

320
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
If he grows on like this,

321
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,110
even the princes will be defeated.

322
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,120
- That's right.
- That's right!

323
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Xu Feng has great taste.

324
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Enough. Go.

325
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,240
- Yes.
- Quick.

326
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,440
Let's go.

327
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Little Jin Mi.

328
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,000
Why don't you stay at my
house of marriage?

329
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,480
It's more interesting
than Qiwu Palace.

330
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,240
My house is a good place
with good fairies.

331
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
What do you think?

332
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,920
My name is Liu Yan.

333
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
The eldest daughter of
the Liu in Hangzhou.

334
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm 28 years old.

335
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
I beg you, Moon Immortal,

336
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,360
to grant me a husband.

337
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
Who is as handsome as Pan An.

338
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
And may our love last forever.

339
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,790
What does it mean?

340
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,040
It's normal that you know nothing
about love since you're still young.

341
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,000
But if you were to be with
my second nephew,

342
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,200
I think you better learn
about it earlier.

343
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,200
No worries.

344
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,240
I'll slowly guide you through.

345
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,320
I'm here at the Heavenly Palace to
save my friend Rou Rou.

346
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,480
I'm looking for the Great Immortal.

347
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,840
Do you know where he is?

348
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,760
There are many Great Immortals
here at the Heaven Realm.

349
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
Who are you looking for?

350
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,560
The one who can revive
my friend Rou Rou.

351
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,440
I can see that it's still green
and crispy. It's fine.

352
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,240
My friend Rou Rou...

353
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
was a fairy that took human form.

354
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,680
But an incident that happened
900 years ago...

355
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,470
had her beaten down.

356
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,760
And she turned into this since then.

357
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,720
Do you know any Great Immortal
who can help her, Moon Immoral?

358
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,280
We are all in a cycle
of birth and death.

359
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,040
Even the Heavenly Emperor
can't take charge of it.

360
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,480
Puchi has lied to me.

361
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,280
I got it.

362
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,400
Then I shall say goodbye.

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,520
Wait up!

364
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,320
We have many powerful immortals
and resources here at Heaven Realm.

365
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,680
If you would stay and practice,

366
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,920
you can definitely help your friend.

367
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Moreover,

368
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,360
there's Supreme Clarity Heaven
above the Empyrean Heaven.

369
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,990
If you dedicate yourself to practice
the magical prowess,

370
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,440
you'll have a chance to go
to Supreme Clarity Heaven...

371
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,400
and listen to the Hunyuan Testimony
by the masters.

372
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
So Puchi wasn't lying.

373
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,360
Magical prowess?

374
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm on!

375
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
You're right! So I'll stay for a
little while longer here.

376
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,760
That's right.

377
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
If you stay with me,

378
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
then...

379
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,760
I'll have some good things for you.

380
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,880
Elixir pills?

381
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,680
Better than that.

382
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,760
"Qiwu Palace"

383
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,840
How's Jin Mi in the Palace?

384
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
Your Highness.

385
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,920
We had everything arranged
for Jin Mi as ordered.

386
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,080
But recently she's been
at Moon Immortal's place a lot.

387
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,320
Your Highness always
misses the chance...

388
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,600
to see her.

389
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
Half-fairy Jin Mi is now very popular
at the house of marriage.

390
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,880
She has many left over
red strings in hand.

391
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Many people wanted them.

392
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,070
Half-fairy.

393
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,920
Only this little demon dares to...

394
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,950
claim herself a fairy.

395
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,840
Forget about it.

396
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Leave it alone.

397
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,680
Let her be.

398
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,480
Yes.

399
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
Little Jin Mi!

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,520
You're slacking off.

401
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,920
If you didn't,

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,080
how can the Beast of Dreams
trace you by your smell?

403
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
It is a magical creature that
feeds on dreams.

404
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,360
What's this?

405
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,120
Look for yourself.

406
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,280
See?

407
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,910
How dare you deny that
you've been slacking off?

408
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
There are no flowers here at
the house of marriage.

409
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,200
What flowery dreams you have.

410
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,040
Can you do me a favour, Immortal Fox?

411
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,200
Can you please run some errand for me?

412
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Though I'm staying in the sky now,

413
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,400
but still my job is to pick flowers
and make honey.

414
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,760
The flowers here are snobbish.

415
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,920
They bully low ranked fairy like us.

416
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Whenever I touch it,
it will vanish like smoke.

417
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,360
So,

418
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,200
can you help me to pick some flowers?

419
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,920
Spring will never stay.

420
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,000
So do the flowers after they withered.

421
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,150
The reason for this is
better kept unknown.

422
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,220
It's all due to an uncommon
relationship.

423
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,960
It's all about love.

424
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,740
What's love?

425
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,680
You've never heard of it since
you're from the Floral Realm?

426
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,720
A few thousand years ago,

427
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,920
our current Heavenly Emperor had
offended the late Flora Immortal.

428
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,470
The late Floral Immortal destroyed
all flowers in Heaven Realm.

429
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,800
The Heaven Realm has been
barren since then.

430
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,100
However,

431
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,330
the Heaven Realm can't
be barren forever.

432
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,320
So Heavenly Emperor’s decided to
make flowers out of the clouds.

433
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,370
To fill the entire Heaven Realm.

434
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,560
This returned the colors
to the Heaven Realm.

435
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,320
So all the plants are fake.

436
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,680
Once you pluck it,

437
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,520
it will turn into smoke.

438
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,480
So I can't make honey anymore?

439
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,840
You stupid fellow.

440
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
Is honey that important?

441
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Didn't you get something out of it?

442
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,930
What?

443
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,150
Heavenly Emperor.

444
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,310
The Floral Immortal.

445
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,090
He is handsome.

446
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,640
While her beauty is unparalleled.

447
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Isn't that a classic love story?

448
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,280
Can love help with magical prowess?

449
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,980
If it can't and causes trouble,

450
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,320
why do we need it?

451
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,120
You! You're such a thick head.

452
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,800
This is my collection of love manual,

453
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,920
"Tianxiang Secret book".

454
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,280
Take a look.

455
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,240
It all starts from theory.

456
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,680
Hideous postures.

457
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,120
Totally uninteresting.

458
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
The...

459
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,720
love between boys and girls...

460
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,000
is the most beautiful and truthful
thing in the world.

461
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,480
Does it help with magical prowess?

462
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,810
- Of course.
- Really.

463
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,240
That's great!

464
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,760
Bring this back and have a look at it.

465
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Study it.

466
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,000
With your intelligence,

467
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,480
you'll get the idea soon.

468
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,270
They look similar to me.

469
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
It's more beautiful here
at night than in the day.

470
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,220
Why does the star fall into the lake?

471
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,230
Even the fish is forced
to leave the water.

472
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,040
The climate is bad
at the Heaven Realm.

473
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,480
It's you again!

474
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,280
Be polite, Beast of Dreams.

475
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
I apologize for that, fairy.

476
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,520
It's okay.

477
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,640
Actually this deer..

478
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,640
İs quite adorable.

479
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,920
Just that it's a little grumpy.

480
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,320
Actually I'm not a fairy after all.

481
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,720
But I'm a fairy who's
becoming an immortal.

482
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Right.

483
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,200
I saw your tail just now.

484
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,520
Your tail is majestic.

485
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,120
Mister Immortal,

486
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,040
you've taken really good
care of your deer.

487
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,380
He's fat and strong.

488
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,150
Beast of Dreams.

489
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,320
Which kitchen are you sending him to?

490
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Kitchen?

491
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,840
I mean...

492
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,800
your job has quite a good prospect.

493
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,070
I remember Sun Wukong,
the Great Sage Equaling Heaven...

494
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,640
started off as a hummer
and excelled at it.

495
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,480
He then joined the journey to the
West and had a glorious life.

496
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,520
Buddha even gave him the
title The Battling Buddha.

497
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
And Zhang Guolao of
the 8 Immortals.

498
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,640
He looked after donkeys before
becoming an immortal.

499
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,920
He led a glorious life after that too.

500
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,960
Therefore, I think...

501
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,160
your future will be bright.

502
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,840
Your words have made my day,

503
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
and I was enlightened.

504
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,560
Thank you so much.

505
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,320
You're welcome.

506
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,240
My name is Run Yu.

507
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,240
What's your name?

508
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
I'm Jin Mi.

509
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,270
Jin Mi.

510
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,240
I nearly forgot.

511
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,840
I have to deliver something
to the fairies.

512
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,760
I'm occupied, Mister Immortal.

513
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll bid you good bye.

514
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,320
Right!

515
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,480
You have this cute deer with you,

516
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
but you still look rather lonely.

517
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,080
I'll give this red string to you.

518
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
I hope you'll find that
someone to be with you.

519
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,880
Thank you Fairy Jin Mi.

520
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,680
You're welcome. I have to go.

521
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,150
Wait.

522
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,520
Fairy Jin Mi.

523
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,230
This is your hair pin.

524
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,520
Thanks. Good bye.

525
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,370
He is really good at weaving.

526
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,840
- That's right.
- He's great.

527
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,600
That's brilliant!

528
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,960
Look.

529
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,120
It's beautiful.

530
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,600
It's fragrant too.

531
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,760
- Next.
- It smells good.

532
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,160
- Make one for me.
- Me too. Me too.

533
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,880
Wait. Wait. Can I have
a word with you?

534
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,120
Wait.

535
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,870
- Don't go.
- You haven't make one for me yet.

536
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,600
It's me.

537
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,830
Who're you?

538
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm Liao Ting, assistant of
the Fire Immortal.

539
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,040
I've sent you meals and clothes.

540
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,640
- Is His Highness looking for me?
- No, no, no.

541
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880
It's me.

542
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,040
Half-fairy Jin Mi.

543
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,160
Can you make me a bouquet of flowers?

544
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,880
Congratulations for the new born baby.

545
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,520
Liao Ting is still young,
I'm not married yet.

546
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,760
What are the red eggs for then?

547
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,880
Red eggs?

548
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,520
No, no, no.

549
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,600
This is Qiwu Palace's magical bird,
Zhu Que's eggs.

550
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,280
One has to wait 800 years for an egg.

551
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,200
If you eat it, you can gain 100 years
of magical prowess out of an egg.

552
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
And 300 years worth of
magical prowess for two eggs.

553
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,600
300 years of magical prowess?

554
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,830
What did you say just now?

555
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,110
What flower do you want? I can
make you as much as you need.

556
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
- You wait for me.
- Okay.

557
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Prosperous day.

558
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,400
Good for cooking eggs.

559
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,000
The taste of Zhu Que's eggs...

560
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,390
is really incredible.

561
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,160
I like it.

562
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,200
I like it so much.

563
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,340
Help!

564
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,930
Help!

565
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,320
What's wrong, Little Jin Mi?

566
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,120
Help me.

567
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,880
- Go look for Xu Feng, quick!
- Yes.

568
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,240
Did you eat something weird?

569
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,400
I...

570
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,120
I don't know what happened.

571
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,360
It's painful.

572
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
Am I being poisoned?

573
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,480
Don't panic!

574
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
You!

575
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,760
Jin Mi!

576
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,680
- I just got somebody to get you.
- Take her away.

577
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,850
You're a bad guy!

578
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,440
Where are you taking Mi?

579
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,480
Mi!

580
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
It's daddy's fault.

581
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,480
I can't do anything seeing you
kidnapped by the thief.

582
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,760
If you carry on,

583
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,159
she'll vanish within half an hour.

584
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,880
Aren't you my nephew?

585
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,920
I didn't get to act too
much, you know?

586
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,030
What did you eat?

587
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,160
I ate two Zhu Que's eggs.

588
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,480
I didn't expect to feel hot and
painful after eating the eggs.

589
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,120
Why do I feel...

590
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,760
my magical prowess has decreased?

591
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,920
You little demon.

592
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,880
Your body is cold in nature.

593
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,590
You can only be nourished by water.

594
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
Why did you dare to eat Zhu Que's eggs?

595
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,080
Zhu Que is extremely hot in nature.

596
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,120
If it weren’t for me,

597
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,390
I'm afraid that you might already
have turned into a thread of smoke.

598
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,520
I'm a grape.

599
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,720
I grow in dirt.

600
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,040
Not in the water.

601
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,080
I thought Zhu Que was
a relative of pig.

602
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,720
Who would have related it to fire?

603
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,160
And now I've lost half of the
magical prowess I had

604
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
What shall I do?

605
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,800
Stop babbling.

606
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
You're making me dizzy.

607
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,640
Rest and recover.

608
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
You're ignorant.

609
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,640
You nearly sacrificed your life for
mere 300 years worth of powers

610
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
Stupid.

611
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,840
Look after her. Don't let her
eat anything weird.

612
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,480
Yes, Your Highness.

613
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,240
Half-fairy Jin Mi.

614
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,880
Why does His Highness
call you little demon?

615
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,530
You shut up!

616
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,200
You are to blame for all this.

617
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,840
Now that I've lost most of my prowess,

618
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,560
perhaps I need to eat something
to compensate for it.

619
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,460
Do you need any herb,
Half-Fairy Jin Mi?

620
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,080
I can look for them.

621
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,200
A demon like me...

622
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,440
loves to eat...

623
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,400
young boys and girls.

624
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,970
Of course!

625
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,940
Little fairchild like you...

626
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,280
would be my favourite.

627
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,720
Help! help!

628
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,200
Jin Mi?

629
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,880
"Qiwu Palace"

630
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,970
Who is this?

631
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,660
Yan You?

632
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,130
How are you, Your Highness?

633
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,480
You're tired of being an immortal.

634
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,590
That's why you went to the
lower realm to be a demon.

635
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,640
I've never thought that...

636
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,360
you're even tired of
being a demon now,

637
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,220
and came to Qiwu Palace
to be a thief.

638
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,640
Thief?

639
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
That's what I want.

640
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,040
I've been delving into this in the
lower realm recently.

641
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,350
I target pretty ladies.

642
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,400
But I'm tired of the beauties
of lower realm.

643
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,400
Heaven Realm is
still the best, right?

644
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,200
Changing my appetite back
to the Heaven Realm,

645
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,650
I still have Jin Mi, a pretty and
delicate grape waiting for me.

646
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,690
You know Jin Mi?

647
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,170
Of course, we've been friends
for a 1000 years.

648
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,440
We're buddies.

649
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,960
What is your relationship?

650
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,520
Why can I smell her scent on you?

651
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
That's because we love
each other dearly.

652
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,320
Quit smooth talking with me.

653
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,910
I know Jin Mi considers magical
prowess as life itself.

654
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm glad that she didn't
steal from others,

655
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,680
how can she afford to
give it to others?

656
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,480
If you won't be honest with me,

657
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
then you’ll have to forgive my rudeness.

658
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
Don't get all worked up,
Your Highness.

659
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,390
Let me explain.

660
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,690
My relationship with Jin Mi is simple.

661
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,600
We are creditor and debtor.

662
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,160
She owes me 1000 years worth
of magical prowess.

663
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,560
Therefore we've made a 100-year vow.

664
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,560
She'll pay me 100 years worth of
prowess every 100 years.

665
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,900
Therefore we're sharing
magical prowess.

666
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,030
That's why we're more
connected than others.

667
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,290
There, I've nothing to hide now.

668
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,290
I shall comfort her.

669
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,590
She's sleeping soundly.

670
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,000
She doesn't need your comfort.

671
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,120
She doesn't? Can you do that yourself?

672
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,400
Turning her into raisin with your
Nine Luminaries Fire?

673
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Rou Rou.

674
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,230
Rou Rou.

675
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,000
Don't worry, Rou Rou.

676
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,560
My magical prowess has now grown.

677
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,200
I can protect you.

678
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,910
Rou Rou.

679
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,870
Rou Rou.

680
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,530
Let go of Rou Rou!

681
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,670
Rou Rou!

682
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,040
Let go of Rou Rou!

683
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,130
Let go!

684
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,840
Rou Rou.

685
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,320
Phoenix.

686
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,320
Destroying 100 years worth of
prowess due to gluttony.

687
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,640
Only she can do that.

688
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,160
How much prowess does
she still owe you?

689
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,080
What? You are paying back
on her behalf?

690
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,160
Let me remind you about something.

691
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,640
It's easy to pay back by prowess.

692
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
Not when there's affection involved.

693
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
You are a high spirit,

694
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
I know that you don't
need these prowesses.

695
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,160
You're just taking debt as a cover,

696
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,640
to advance on Jin Mi.

697
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,960
Let me tell you something.

698
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,640
Jin Mi is now at my place.

699
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,480
She is protected by Qiwu Palace.

700
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,680
I don't care about what
you did out there.

701
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,240
But if you ever try to advance
to Qiwu Palace,

702
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,080
I shall never look on and do nothing.
