1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 61"


3
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,440
You take care of yourself.


4
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,140
Long Live my Lord!


5
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,079
Our Lord just promised to spare your life,


6
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,180
But I didn't.


7
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,820
I'll have to settle accounts


8
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,740
with you for Mu Ci.


9
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Just come and kill me.


10
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,660
I am the Princess of Heaven Realm
and the leader of Bird Family.


11
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,240
How could I bear such a disgrace?


12
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,360
Forget it.


13
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,560
She's a wreck now.


14
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,680
Being alive


15
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,640
is more painful than death.


16
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Just let her go.


17
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,760
You're right. Let her have her wish like this.


18
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,260
It's too kind for her.


19
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,420
What you must suffer should not be a little bit less.


20
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,500
Someone.


21
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
Your Highness.


22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,980
Exile her in the wilderness.


23
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,240
She shall never step out of Demon Realm.


24
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes.


25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,280
You will get retribution!


26
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,100
How beautiful the wedding dress is.


27
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm afraid if I wear it too long


28
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,180
I'll be reluctant to take it off.


29
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,620
You can't even distinguish the colors.


30
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,900
How do you know it's beautiful?


31
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,740
Even I know what color it is,


32
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,120
it doesn't belong to me.


33
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,360
Marrying me


34
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,640
makes you feel so miserable?


35
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,700
You don't even want to wear it for a little bit longer.


36
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,820
Thatâ€™s phony affection.


37
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,900
It's just a play.


38
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Why do you take it seriously?


39
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,720
What is this?


40
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,240
It's Hairy Feather.


41
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,580
Run Yu added an extra medicine, cynanchum atratum


42
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,460
in your Jiuzhuan Golden Elixir.


43
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,140
Hairy Feather can dissolve the
extreme chill of cynanchum atratum.


44
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
It can cure your countercharge.


45
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,620
Eat it.


46
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
I promise,


47
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,320
I'll not bother you any more in the future.


48
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,920
You'll never see me again.


49
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,080
I won't eat it.


50
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
It's the last one grown over
the past ten thousand years.


51
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,300
And it's the last chance to
dissolve the countercharge of the elixir.


52
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,480
It's what I owe you.


53
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,040
I beg you.


54
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,160
Do you think


55
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,740
this can offset your sins?


56
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,159
Stop.


57
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,940
Do you know how I hate you?


58
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,620
I know.


59
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm sorry.


60
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,780
But I hate myself more.


61
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,659
I've prepared for so many years


62
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,320
and stretched myself to hate you.


63
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,120
However, the two drops of blood
shed onto the heart-testing stone


64
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,360
made all of my efforts fall apart.


65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,420
I hate myself that


66
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,740
I can't forget you by now.


67
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,840
Phoenix,


68
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,600
let's not cheat ourselves anymore.


69
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,200
I know what you said


70
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,600
was to let Sui He hear deliberately.


71
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,260
You wanted to force her
to use the Pure Glazed Flame, right?


72
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,700
Tonight,


73
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,500
you should have married another man,


74
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,380
but you came here.


75
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,580
and went through the heart test with me.


76
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,120
I really don't know


77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,440
if it's not the will of the Heaven,


78
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,620
how can I explain it?


79
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,000
Phoenix,


80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,720
can we


81
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
go back to the past?


82
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,860
No, we can't.


83
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,580
We can't anymore.


84
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,660
Perhaps,


85
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,680
we can make a fresh start.


86
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
From now onwards,


87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,600
you and I should share the same mind.


88
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,880
Even when the years are chaotic,
and the waves are monstrous,


89
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,780
I'll also hold your hands tightly,


90
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,980
not leaving you till
we go to the primordial world together.


91
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
After all, I still can't


92
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,520
and don't want to let you go.


93
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
Just stay by my side


94
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
and don't lie to me again.


95
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,840
Otherwise,


96
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,420
I'll really go to the primordial world with you.


97
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,820
Father,


98
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,020
your lifetime wish


99
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,340
is to unite the six realms.


100
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,840
Otherwise, you would not have
kept Qiongqi alive, right?


101
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,820
This uncompleted work


102
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
will be accomplished by your son.


103
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,000
In the future,


104
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,020
among the six realms and four seas,


105
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm the only lord.


106
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,580
The thunder and rain


107
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,640
will go from the Gate of Heaven;


108
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,940
if the Heavenly Emperor is enraged,


109
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,660
all should die.


110
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
My Majesty, the armies are ready for battle.


111
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Your Majesty, please raise the tent
and take a mass pledge.


112
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,600
When I get the Heavenly Queen back,


113
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,780
the wedding will go on.


114
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,540
Your Majesty, please be careful.


115
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,960
How did I fall asleep?


116
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,380
I,


117
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,540
I should hurry back to see how Floral Realm is.


118
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,600
Why do you dress like this?


119
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,780
You're up.


120
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,100
News to report.


121
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,520
My Lord,


122
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,660
the Heavenly Emperor has led millions of heavenly armies


123
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,500
and deployed them along the Wangchuan River.


124
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
The King of Bian City and Princess Liu Ying
have dispatched troops to fight them.


125
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,520
My Lord, please take over the reins.


126
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,300
Got it.


127
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,020
You can leave now.


128
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,740
Yes.


129
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,300
Phoenix,


130
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,440
Run Yu,


131
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,440
I don't know...I don't know why he did this.


132
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,520
Please trust me, okay?


133
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,780
The Heavenly Emperor personally leads his soldiers


134
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,660
to save the Water Immortal held by the Demon Lord.


135
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,800
What an altisonant reason!


136
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,060
Today,


137
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,400
he tries to fight me to death.


138
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,400
I also want to see


139
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,680
how he will face me.


140
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,680
Don't go.


141
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,780
Phoenix.


142
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,560
Phoenix.


143
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,900
Halt the troops and wait.


144
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,400
When I pick up the Water Immortal,


145
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,400
you command the army to start attack.


146
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,700
Yes, your Majesty.


147
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,980
Bro just removed half of his power yesterday,


148
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,900
and their armies arrive upon the border today.


149
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,500
Did they come after knowing it?


150
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,520
Fight with full force.


151
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:19,520
Demon Lord, Demon Lord...


152
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,520
Today, I don't want to fight,


153
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,520
I only want to pick up the Water Immortal.


154
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,800
She comes to Demon Realm at her own will,


155
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,300
we regard her as a distinguished guest.


156
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,080
We have no displeasure, and we donâ€™t force her to stay.


157
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,560
Why do you gather so many forces here?


158
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,560
It will make those who don't know the truth


159
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,280
think that you're trying to pick up a fight.


160
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Mi,


161
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,520
come over here.


162
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,260
Your Majesty, I'm fine here.


163
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,640
You can rest assured.


164
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,560
Don't be impetuous!


165
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,240
I won't go back to Heavenly Realm with you.


166
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,580
Well, there is good news.


167
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,580
I think you should have also heard that.


168
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Last night,


169
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,200
I finished the wedding ceremony with the Water Immortal.


170
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,120
So now,


171
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,880
she is the queen of our Demon Realm.


172
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,060
We just get married and
stick together like glue and varnish.


173
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,460
How could she be willing to leave Demon Realm?


174
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Ridiculous!


175
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,140
I and the Water Immortal
have a marriage contract earlier.


176
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,740
People in the six realms all know it.


177
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,060
You've betrayed the Heavenly Realm
and fell into demon world.


178
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,820
How dare you hold the queen of the Heavenly Realm?


179
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,860
You really want to alienate
yourself from the world, don't you?


180
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,940
Let me advise you to turn around early,


181
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,760
and not make a fatal mistake.


182
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
I and Jin Mi see eye to eye with each other.


183
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,660
We're willing to become a couple.


184
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,480
We've gone through the wedding ceremony


185
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,180
and worshipped the heaven and earth and our parents.


186
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,860
Besides, both Demon Realm and
the Bird Family were present to witness it.


187
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,500
I don't think there's anything
inappropriate with the marriage.


188
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,860
Am I right, everyone?


189
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes, yes, yes.


190
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
Yes.


191
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,980
Do you have any good to provoke him?


192
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,900
If I don't do it first,


193
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,300
he will push us around.


194
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,320
In that case, I'm afraid there's
no such a good chance anymore.


195
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,480
The Heavenly Emperor has
sent a troop to destroy Floral Realm.


196
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,860
After all, you still don't trust me.


197
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,160
I don't trust him.


198
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,060
Bro, before our reinforcements arrive,


199
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,480
the Heavenly Emperor has controlled Floral Realm


200
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,260
and ordered to massacre Floral Realm.


201
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,900
As long Jin Mi doesn't return,


202
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,880
he'll kill a person in Floral Realm every day.


203
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
Your Majesty, why do you do this?


204
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,120
The Floral Realm has never offended you.


205
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,220
It was just a matter of expediency.


206
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,220
Thatâ€™s to persuade you to go back early.


207
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,220
If you come back to me,


208
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,420
everything would be fine.


209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,260
If I never let go of her,


210
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,020
what can you do to me?


211
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,440
If so,


212
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,700
I'll not leave any one alive today.


213
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,100
Don't do that.


214
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,720
The Heavenly Emperor is going to slaughter today,


215
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,840
and turn Floral Realm
and Wangchuan River into the Acheron.


216
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll fight to the end.


217
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,980
Go fight!


218
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,120
Fight , fight, fight...


219
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,240
Fight, fight, fight...


220
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,240
Fight, fight.


221
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
Can you stop fighting?


222
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,300
Jin Mi,


223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,420
the day will come sooner and later.


224
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,420
Protect the Water immortal.


225
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,180
Phoenix.


226
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,360
Stop fighting!


227
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,050
Over and over again,


228
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,020
you tried to kill me.


229
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,480
You've resorted to every conceivable means.


230
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,480
Me being alive


231
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,340
makes you so scared?


232
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,650
You were reborn against nature
and fell into the demon world.


233
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,710
As the Heavenly Emperor,


234
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,710
I should obey the nature and eradicate the evil.


235
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,710
It's funny.


236
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
I never give in to the destiny.


237
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Today,


238
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,820
I shall have to reverse the destiny.


239
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,060
Stop fighting!


240
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,570
Stop, stop fighting!


241
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,140
Phoenix!


242
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,020
Phoenix, are you alright?


243
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,020
Let me see.


244
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,850
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!


245
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,000
The countercharge got worse.


246
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,910
Let's call a truce, okay?


247
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,940
I beg you, Phoenix.


248
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,940
Stop fighting!


249
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,680
Stop fighting.


250
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,370
Phoenix!


251
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,450
To strive for victory, the awe-inspiring Heavenly Emperor


252
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,540
even breaks the rules and uses the forbidden technique.


253
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,540
That's ironic.


254
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,540
Being the prime demon,


255
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,540
how could you talk about fair and square with me?


256
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,200
All the land under the heaven is mine,


257
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,200
and the six realms will serve me.


258
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,970
To treat you,


259
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,910
I'll just apply your own way.


260
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,170
She is a dying person


261
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,710
There is no difference to unlock the Garan Seal for her.


262
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,340
Living a life is not a mercy,


263
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,650
living hundred times is not a mercy, either.


264
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,310
Possessing universal compassion is a real mercy.


265
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,140
In the mountain, there is a fierce tiger
that is dying due to being seriously wounded.


266
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,880
Will you save it or not?


267
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,680
If it's healed and returns to the mountain,
it will hunt the elks and eat the rabbits.


268
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,050
Though its life is saved, it hurts hundreds of other lives.


269
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,050
Being merciful in the wrong way


270
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,050
is actually pushing people into an abyss of misery.


271
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,000
A mountain tiger...


272
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,480
Yes,


273
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,480
my life


274
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,570
was saved by fighting against nature.


275
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,480
I can neither be a soldier in the battlefield,


276
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,340
nor a general racking brains in scheming.


277
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,800
But I am considered


278
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,710
to be a reason to provoke war.


279
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,710
How ridiculous!


280
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,770
Jin Mi!


281
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,910
Jin Mi.


282
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,450
Jin Mi.


283
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,740
Jin Mi.


284
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,740
Stop fighting.


285
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,620
For the sake of me,


286
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,220
it's not worth doing it.


287
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,850
The entanglement is anyhow


288
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,050
a matter among the three of us,


289
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,340
and has nothing to do with anyone else.


290
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,970
Run Yu...


291
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm sorry.


292
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Your love for me


293
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,310
won't be compensated


294
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,650
in my lifetime.


295
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,620
I hope


296
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,280
you can change back to the Fish Fairy in the past


297
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,080
and let go of old grudge.


298
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,199
Promise me.


299
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,110
Will you?


300
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,370
I promise you.


301
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,800
Phoenix.


302
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm here.


303
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,199
I want,


304
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,620
I want to hear you say,


305
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,170
I want to hear you say


306
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,020
you already forgive me.


307
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,220
I never hated you.


308
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,250
From beginning to end,


309
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,600
the one I hate is myself.


310
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,000
I hate myself.


311
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,940
I finally heard you say that.


312
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?


313
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,050
You're silly.


314
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,880
Fine, fine.


315
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,310
As a fruit,


316
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,680
I'll not argue with birds like you.


317
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,480
Phoenix, promise me.


318
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,710
Eat it


319
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,220
before the sunset of tomorrow.


320
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,220
You should stay alive.


321
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,220
Will you?


322
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,880
Phoenix,


323
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,000
I love you.


324
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,080
I really want to go back to those days.


325
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,340
At that time,


326
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,680
I didn't know what love is,


327
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,600
but I stayed by your side every day.


328
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,600
That made me so happy.


329
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
At that time,


330
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
I was your page boy,


331
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,370
and you


332
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,650
were that superior,


333
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,740
defiant and arrogant Phoenix.


334
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,740
While the Fish Fairy


335
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,940
was a gentle and kind boy.


336
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,310
And also


337
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,620
the Fox Immortal,


338
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,280
Lord Puchi


339
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,280
dad,


340
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,280
and Aunty Lin Xiu.


341
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,970
How good it was!


342
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,170
But it will never be the same again.


343
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,340
Love bears worry, and love creates fear.


344
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,110
If leaving the love, you'll have neither worry nor fear.


345
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,800
If there is love in your heart,


346
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,370
how will you be afraid of worry and fear?


347
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,220
Jin Mi.


348
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,220
In the rest of my lifetime,


349
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,420
I'll never step into Demon Realm again.


350
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,140
Here shall be the boundary.
