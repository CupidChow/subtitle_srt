00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 25"


3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,980
Invite Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family now.


4
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,420
Yes.


5
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,720
General Qin.


6
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,420
What’s wrong with His Majesty?


7
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,200
His Majesty is unwell.
Your Excellencies, please go back.


8
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,020
Minister, please wait.


9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,740
Get out of the way!


10
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,200
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.


11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Minister Fu. Duke Nanping.


12
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you have anything important to report?


13
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Your Majesty, you feel unwell, so we are so worried.


14
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,260
I have been in a cold recently.


15
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
It’s a minor illness. Don’t worry.


16
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,840
Is there any urgent report from the border?


17
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,360
All the main forces of Liangguo withdrew.


18
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,500
Your Majesty, don’t worry.


19
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,420
Minister Fu is in command to deal with
military affairs and important things,


20
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,340
so you can rest easy, Your Majesty.


21
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,620
Other officials and I will also help him sincerely.


22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
With you two,


23
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,740
I feel so contented.


24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Your Majesty, here comes Saint Girl.


25
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,360
Summon her.


26
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,200
Do you have anything else to say?


27
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,620
Your Majesty, please rest without worry.


28
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,860
-We’ll leave.
-We’ll leave.


29
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,180
Minister, please wait.


30
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,420
His Majesty is unwell by accident.


31
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,100
Why am I in command to deal with
military affairs and important things?


32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Duke, I can’t


33
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,180
stand your groundless pretence up.


34
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,880
Minister.


35
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,880
Minister, don’t embarrass me.


36
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,760
His Majesty is unwell, so it’s reasonable for you


37
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,300
to deal with state affairs on behalf of him.


38
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,460
Minister, did I misread?


39
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,520
I saw His Majesty seemed to spit blood.


40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
What do you think?


41
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,000
I also saw that.


42
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,280
In your opinion, His Majesty
suffers from some severe illness


43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,340
rather than cold.


44
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,659
I am afraid that


45
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,200
His Majesty falls ill from overwork


46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,440
and lots of hardships on earlier expedition wars.


47
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
Surely,


48
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,740
the condition also depends on
the diagnosis of Saint Girl.


49
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,220
His Majesty was in army for half a life.


50
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,400
In recent years, he has been
busy with government affairs


51
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,720
and had no time to marry consorts,
so he still has no son.


52
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,280
We keep submitting memorials,


53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
but His Majesty ignored us.


54
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,500
Once His Majesty has bad health,


55
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,660
whom will he give the throne to?


56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,540
Whom, indeed?


57
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,340
It’s a misfortune for the state and families.


58
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,120
The deceased emperor advocated imprisonment
and His Majesty’s blood relationships


59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,520
were all killed.


60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,660
Now,


61
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,160
even no one can be adopted by him.


62
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
Duke, please.


63
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,360
Minister, please.


64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,020
Take care.


65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,360
Go to arrange


66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,980
so that princess can come here
to pay respects to His Majesty


67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,000
and sound out his illness condition tomorrow.


68
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,660
Yes.


69
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,400
Today King Yi didn’t hold court due to illness.


70
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Spread this piece of news


71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,580
in secret.


72
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,820
Remember to keep it a secret from princess


73
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,440
before she comes


74
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,880
to prevent her from making a
wrong judgment due to care.


75
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
I see.


76
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,040
It’s his breath.


77
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,300
Mu Ci, I know it’s you.


78
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Why haven’t you admitted you are Mu Ci?


79
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,060
Why haven’t you meet me since you save me?


80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,740
You even took away the only gift you gave me.


81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,980
Now that you want to draw a line with me


82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,260
Well,


83
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,440
I’ll give my life right back to you now.


84
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,220
From then on,


85
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,420
we don’t owe each other.


86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
You haven’t come out.


87
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,800
Well.


88
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
I know you care about me.


89
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,140
Even if you don’t want to take off your mask,


90
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,320
I also know you are Mu Ci.


91
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
You shouldn’t have gambled


92
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,460
with your life.


93
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
If not,


94
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,100
you wouldn’t have come out to see me.


95
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,840
It shows I won.


96
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,840
Go back now.


97
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,580
Those chasing to kill you


98
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
will come again after a failure.


99
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,840
Be careful of your own safety.


100
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,680
Mu Ci.


101
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,600
Return my brass strip to me before leaving.


102
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,000
Why haven’t you admitted you are Mu Ci?


103
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,060
Do you know how much I want to see you again?


104
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,040
That Mu Ci you mentioned


105
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,000
has been gone.


106
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,660
All people think you died,


107
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,480
but I don’t think so.


108
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,220
I know you must be alive


109
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,120
and you will come back to meet me.


110
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,580
It seems that we are different


111
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,580
in the definition of being alive.


112
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,540
What actually happened back then?


113
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,900
Why did you disappear


114
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
after there was Nether Fury in Wangchuan River?


115
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,620
Mu Ci, what actually happened back then?


116
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,500
-Demon Lord.
-Demon Lord.


117
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,820
My Lord.


118
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,920
My Lord.


119
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,880
Demon Lord, Mu Ci


120
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,900
was accidentally hurt by Liu Ying 1,000 years ago.


121
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,240
King of Bian City thought he was alone and helpless,


122
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,000
so he took him back and brought him up in his mansion.


123
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,060
He has practiced magic


124
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,700
with two princes and Liu Ying since childhood,


125
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,880
showing no abnormity.


126
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,760
But Nether Fury appeared without reason today,


127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,160
which is a bad omen.


128
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,180
He could solve it easily.


129
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,700
He has black pupils.


130
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,920
Only the pure bloodline of Spirit-Vanishing Family


131
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,160
can have this abnormity after growing up.


132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
But I did


133
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
kill the whole Spirit-Vanishing Family back then.


134
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,940
Unexpectedly,


135
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,800
there is still a leftover evil of Spirit-Vanishing Family.


136
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,400
Back then, Spirit-Vanishing Family rebelled


137
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,300
to try to overthrow our Demon Realm.


138
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,720
Luckily, Your Majesty was wise and resolute,


139
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,040
so a disaster was avoided.


140
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,460
To leave no chance for their revival, we must kill him.


141
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,440
My Lord, I am not a different family.


142
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,600
Please let me out.


143
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,460
You aren’t from a different family?


144
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,440
It’s obvious to people of the whole Demon Realm that


145
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,380
you hurt Liu Ying by Wangchuan River.


146
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,880
Don’t quibble.


147
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,260
I hurt Princess Liu Ying?


148
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,520
So, how was she then?


149
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,480
My Lord,


150
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,660
we can’t take such an evil lightly.


151
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,000
We’d better seal him


152
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,540
and throw him into Yu Abyss right now.


153
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,440
I hurt Princess?


154
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
I hurt Princess?


155
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,820
I hurt Princess?


156
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,940
OK, I’ll leave it to you.


157
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,140
Remember not to make any trouble again.


158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,740
Yes.


159
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,700
You don’t need to know what happened before.


160
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Just remember there is no Mu Ci


161
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,200
in this world.


162
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,380
I know you’ve suffered a lot.


163
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,980
Mu Ci, go back to Demon Realm with me.


164
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,640
As usual, we can


165
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,100
practice martial arts and…


166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,340
Mu Ci, don’t go.


167
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,160
Don’t leave me, OK?


168
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,340
As fast as wind.


169
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,120
As slow as the slowly spreading forest.


170
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,980
Attack like fire.


171
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,560
Defend like mountain.


172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,040
Difficult to predict the movement when motionless.


173
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,280
Take action at lightening speed.


174
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,100
You’ve progressed.


175
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,860
Of course.


176
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,360
When you were out,


177
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,940
I learnt military strategies and tactics hard.


178
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I heard from Qin Tong that


179
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,670
you had taken away


180
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,860
all the “Seven Military Classics” in my study.


181
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,000
I remember you didn’t like martial arts before.


182
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,800
I couldn’t understand them when I was young,


183
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,120
but I find I am deeply attracted by them


184
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,760
after several years.


185
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,700
The art of war is like the feeling of the world,


186
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,020
so we should be clear-sighted
at the situation and popular feeling.


187
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,270
As the saying goes, there are
different situations in deployment of army


188
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,430
like the water flows without a fixed shape.


189
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,320
Those with foresights will win.


190
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,820
No wonder you always read.


191
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,140
Fortunately, you are enlightened late,


192
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,860
or you, the General Feifeng of Huaiwu


193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,980
might own my title God of War.


194
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,440
Don’t laugh at me, Cousin.


195
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,300
As a woman, I don’t dare to talk about
affairs of state defense and administration.


196
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,980
I just know little


197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
under your influence.


198
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,500
It’s a pity that I am not a man,


199
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,940
or I can serve as a pawn and pacesetter


200
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
under your command.


201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
Your Majesty, it’s time for you to take medicine.


202
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,400
Your Majesty, here are our respects.


203
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,319
Who are they?


204
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,040
Jin Mi of Saint Doctors’ Family.


205
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,760
Qiang Huo of Saint Doctors’ Family.


206
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,040
Princess, here are our respects.
May you great happiness.


207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,540
Are you the famous female doctors
of Saint Doctors’ Family?


208
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,060
Your Highness, you flatter us.


209
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,100
Our family always lives in seclusion
from the earthly world,


210
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,500
so we aren’t famous at all.


211
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,940
Because of so,


212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,840
there are many rumors about you in the human world.


213
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,520
I’ve long heard that Saint Doctors’ Family act secretly


214
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,500
and need to observe numerous rules.


215
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,640
You do impress me a lot today.


216
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
But why do you cover your faces with veils?


217
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Covering face with veil is
a century-old tradition of our family.


218
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
The female doctor of our family
begins to wear veil since childhood.


219
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,940
We also wear veils when
presenting ourselves to His Majesty.


220
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,100
I am not a king.
How about letting me look at your face?


221
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,000
It seems that I have no qualification.


222
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,160
No. No.


223
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,540
We are ugly and afraid to scare you.


224
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,280
Your saying


225
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,500
even arouses my curiosity.


226
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,220
They have strict family rules, so don’t force them.


227
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Saint Doctors’ Family is loyal to the royal family all the time.


228
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,780
Cousin, you may make a decree


229
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,980
to abolish their bad habit.


230
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,860
If all of them cover their faces with veils,


231
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,100
spies and assassins may sneak into the palace


232
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,240
to hurt you, Cousin.


233
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,420
Cousin.


234
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,220
Cousin, are you OK? Cousin.


235
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,940
Cousin.


236
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
Cousin. Cousin.


237
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
How is His Majesty?


238
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
On the way here,


239
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
I just heard His Majesty was unwell.


240
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
Seeing he brandished a sword vigorously,


241
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,780
I thought his illness was just a rumor.


242
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,740
It seems true now.


243
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,360
Your Highness,


244
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,660
His Majesty has kidney yang and blood failure,


245
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,860
so he is impotent.


246
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
He just coughs.


247
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,540
Why, why is he impotent?


248
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,560
Rome is not built in one day.


249
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
His Highness falls ill from
overwork throughout the year.


250
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,500
Now he is extremely weak.


251
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,760
Besides kidney yang and blood failure,


252
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,760
His Majesty also has five taxations
and seven damages,


253
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
so he often has prostration, coughs


254
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,620
and blood in phlegm.


255
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,980
At first glance,


256
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,880
it is due to lung meridian,


257
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,420
but virtually


258
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,140
kidney meridian.


259
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,980
Can he be curable?


260
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,440
As he is incurably ill, he approaches death.


261
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,120
But, please don’t worry, Your Highness.


262
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,860
I’ll treat His Majesty carefully.


263
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,420
Your Majesty.


264
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,440
Your Highness, Saint Girl of my family
has excellent medical skills,


265
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,620
so she’ll treat His Majesty with all her strength.


266
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,420
Depending on the situation,


267
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,560
His Majesty won’t wake up so soon.


268
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,140
Don’t be anxious here.


269
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,120
It’s not worth if you get ill due to tiredness.


270
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,660
How about going back for a rest first?


271
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,740
Once His Majesty comes round,


272
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,000
we’ll inform you at once.


273
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,240
I leave all that to you, Saint Girl.


274
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,940
Your Highness, don’t worry.


275
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,560
We’ll try our best.


276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,520
Qiang Huo, see Her Highness out.


277
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,340
Yes.


278
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,540
Your Highness, please.


279
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,500
If His Majesty gets better,


280
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,880
ensure to inform me first.


281
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,080
OK. Please don’t worry, Your Highness.


282
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,660
She loves you so deeply.


283
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,780
How is my acting skill?


284
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,980
Duke Nanping asked someone to send you a letter,


285
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,480
right?


286
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,440
How, how did Your Majesty know?


287
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,040
Now, with domestic trouble and foreign invasion,


288
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,220
Huaiwu is beset by uncertain border
and unstable court situation.


289
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,840
In the midst of war, people worry about their safety,


290
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
not to mention a good and prosperous life.


291
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,700
But being obsessed with ambition,
someone wants to kill me


292
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,600
and usurp the throne in chaos


293
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,840
for his own power and desire.


294
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,400
But it’ll take a long time


295
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,620
to eliminate the traitor.


296
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,680
Its hardships, advantages and disadvantages


297
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,080
can’t be expressed in a few words.


298
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,020
I did have some doubts about you
when you came in the beginning.


299
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,060
I was afraid you were really
on the side of Duke Nanping.


300
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,120
But you haven’t written back to Duke Nanping,


301
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,960
so I know


302
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,460
you are on my side, right?


303
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,660
Saint Doctors’ Family pledges loyalty to King Yi.


304
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,800
As Saint Girl, I don’t dare to neglect my mission.


305
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,180
Then tell Duke Nanping


306
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,720
I’ve been incurably ill and approached death.


307
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,340
Why?


308
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,120
In this case, he’ll drop his guard


309
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,060
and show his original face.


310
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,760
I can counterattack when he is off guard.


311
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,200
So I need your full cooperation.


312
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,020
As for what kind of serious illness I have,


313
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,320
you need to think about it.


314
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,500
Your acting skill has actually


315
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,640
reached a high degree of excellence.


316
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,830
I am gladly convinced,


317
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,210
admire you from the bottom of my heart


318
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
and bow to you in worship.


319
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,460
Don’t fool me.


320
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,460
We face


321
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,380
such traitor officials like Duke Nanping and Minister Fu,


322
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,760
hard-boiled and slippery persons
who have been in office for decades.


323
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,940
If they are put on the stage,


324
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,760
all of them will become famous actors.


325
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,140
We should be full of spirit and energy.


326
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,240
Yes.


327
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,060
It’s all your fault.


328
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,680
You tell them I am a patient
with deficiency of the kidney


329
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,400
and can’t have sexual intercourse.


330
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,680
How can I face them later?


331
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,180
Well, is,


332
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,980
isn't this Your Majesty’s meaning?


333
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,720
What?


334
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,460
What’s this?


335
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,800
Qiang Huo can understand
and get you medicine by prescription.


336
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,060
Powder for the Seven Emotions Medicament can fully achieve


337
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,560
Your Majesty’s desired effect.


338
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,980
But with seven emotions,


339
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,280
people have different reactions due to external stimulation


340
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,420
and express them in lines, which is natural.


341
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,560
The medicine can reverse veins


342
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,700
and forcibly take away one’s feelings,


343
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,780
so one can take it for a long time.


344
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,720
If you must take it,


345
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,760
remember not to get too happy or sad.


346
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,640
You’d better take it with Golden Chamber Pill


347
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,900
to slow medicine resistance.


348
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,000
OK, you can arrange it.


349
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,100
The crafty and suspicious Duke Nanping


350
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,900
may not believe so easily,


351
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,160
so he’ll send Sui He


352
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
to sound out my condition in two or three days.


353
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,780
You cooperate with me


354
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,740
to act before Sui He by then.


355
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,860
Your Majesty,


356
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,380
are you tired of


357
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,420
scheming against them every day?


358
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,000
I am just a doctor rather than an actress.


359
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,360
I am unmarried,


360
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,360
but now you widely spread
I can’t have sexual intercourse,


361
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,980
breaking my reputation.


362
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,880
If I am alone


363
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,440
and childless later,


364
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,940
who will accompany me?
You?


365
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,180
Your, Your, Your Majesty, calm down.


366
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,300
After taking the Seven Emotions Medicament,
you can’t become emotional or angry.


367
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,160
I heard


368
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,420
people have seven emotions and
change their emotions with the environment change.


369
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,060
If the environment changes,
people’s emotions will be stimulated and changed.


370
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,400
Now only the secret behind the veil


371
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,020
can make my emotions fluctuant


372
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,840
and make me be lost in a reverie.


373
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,240
Both Sui He


374
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,100
and I


375
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,060
are curious about your look.


376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,880
Your Majesty,


377
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,520
it’s said by Confucius:


378
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,140
“I’ve never seen anyone who
loves morality just like loving a beauty.”


379
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,720
Your Majesty, please be self-possessed.
And I look…


380
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,460
You look ugly and are disliked by all people?


381
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,160
I don’t care.


382
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,520
When we were in Luoye Mountain,


383
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,500
we stayed in the same room for over a month.


384
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,640
I know your character well.


385
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,560
I don’t see my lover,
so I am care-laden like entranced.


386
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,340
What can I do?
You’ve forgotten me.


387
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,700
I don’t dare.


388
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,420
When we stayed in the mountain,


389
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,980
you were so bold.


390
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,200
You found chances to have physical contact with me.


391
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,220
After treating me flippantly in the mountain,


392
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,880
you actually want to disown me


393
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,360
and be irresponsible for me.


394
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Do you


395
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,720
have special love


396
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,480
for mountain bandit?


397
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,300
I am terrified as I am guilty.


398
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
I, I am very guilty and deserve death.


399
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,820
Don’t always talk about death.


400
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,300
I know you cherish your life.


401
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,900
No.


402
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,440
Though I cherish my life,


403
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,760
I pledge loyalty to Your Majesty more,


404
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,940
or I don’t help Your Majesty deal with Duke Nanping


405
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,520
without consideration of life and death.


406
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,720
I never want your loyalty.


407
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,420
Well,


408
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,120
many a day will come yet.


409
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,860
One day,


410
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,320
I will make you willingly remove the veil.


411
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,880
Your Majesty,


412
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,540
with the bounden duty
as a saint girl of Saint Doctors’ Family,


413
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,340
I need to observe both
Your Majesty’s orders and my family rules


414
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,780
and don’t dare to go off the rails.


415
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,560
I have no other merits


416
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,520
except loyalty.


417
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,620
I can’t give what Your Majesty wants.


418
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,380
Though we had a good time in the mountain,


419
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,600
it isn’t the life of Your Majesty


420
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,880
and me.


421
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,620
About the time in the mountain,


422
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,040
please just take it as a dream, Your Majesty.


423
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,740
I almost couldn’t control myself.


424
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,640
As the emperor of a state, so enchanting


425
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
that I was even trapped.


426
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,360
You came up with this dumb idea.


427
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,780
What dumb book is this?


428
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
The words of sages


429
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,700
featured by ideas without evil,
such as abstemious joy and sadness.


430
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,920
Unexpectedly, Saint Girl was scared away.


431
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,700
Your Majesty, the love between
man and woman is like march to war.


432
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,780
Besides fine weather, favorable geographical
and human conditions,


433
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,220
tactics and ideas are also important.


434
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,180
When the enemy advance, we retreat
and when the enemy retreat, we chase.


435
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,700
Your Majesty loves Saint Girl


436
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,240
who is dignified and stable,


437
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,800
so the ordinary positional warfare is infeasible.


438
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,820
You should adopt the city seizure tough warfare
of strengthening the defenses and clear the fields.


439
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
You are an expert.


440
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,840
Fellow officers and I


441
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,420
think about two things all our lives,


442
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,560
namely protecting our homes and defending our state


443
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,840
and carrying on the family line.


444
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,460
Good.


445
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
Go to fetch “Wuzi” for me.


446
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,980
I want that volume with notes I made in spring.


447
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,420
“Wuzi Art of War”?


448
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,740
It was borrowed away by Princess Nanping.


449
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,320
What about “Six Secret Teachings”?


450
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,420
Your Majesty, do you forget


451
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,780
all the Seven Military Classics
were borrowed away by Princess?


452
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,570
Hasn’t she finished reading them?


453
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,570
Go to get them back from her.


454
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,020
Your Majesty, do you forget


455
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
now you are unconscious due to illness?


456
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,300
So how can you make an order?


457
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,880
Yes.


458
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,100
Get them back some other day


459
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,600
when I cure


460
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,160
my kidney.


461
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
Leave.


462
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,920
So terrible.


463
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,660
Jin Mi is double-faced


464
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,260
and Xu Feng also irritates me.


465
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,440
He actually only listened to Jin Mi verbally.


466
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,680
Well, if it goes on like this,


467
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,760
when will they be together?


468
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,460
It worries me a lot.


469
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,240
This part was over.


470
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,120
You’re to blame. It’s all your fault.


471
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,520
You banished Jin Mi


472
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,540
to the hated Saint Doctors’ Family.


473
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,740
I think


474
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,420
you just envy at


475
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,300
her youth and beauty,


476
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,260
so you don’t want her to have a happy marriage


477
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,860
and arranged her


478
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,140
a fate that is doomed to loneliness.


479
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,900
Damn fox, how can you blame me?


480
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,300
You were there back then.


481
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,540
Recall carefully.


482
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,520
Who agreed to arrange her to Saint Doctors’ Family?


483
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,980
Who disallowed Jin Mi to experience
separation of lovers in mortal world?


484
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,980
It was your dear Second Nephew.


485
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,860
No one expected he would also
jump down to mortal world with her.


486
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,940
He hurt himself


487
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,240
by his own doing.


488
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,800
He deserves it.


489
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,700
Sui He.


490
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,140
Daddy.


491
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,020
What’s wrong?


492
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,460
Who makes you cry


493
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,700
so sadly?


494
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,660
Tell me.


495
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,540
Cousin.


496
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,940
His Majesty?


497
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,160
What did His Majesty do?


498
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,280
Cousin is…


499
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,360
Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Speak slowly.


500
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,880
Today I saw Cousin


501
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,380
coughed up a handful of blood


502
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,000
and passed out.


503
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,060
Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
diagnosed His Majesty.


504
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,740
What did she say?


505
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,340
She said Cousin


506
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
was impotent with kidney deficiency
and five taxations and seven damages.


507
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
He has been incurably ill.


508
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,840
Daddy, what can I do?


509
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Find a way to save Cousin.


510
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,180
OK, don’t be afraid.
Don’t be afraid.


511
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,220
I’ll handle everything for you.


512
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,420
Fortunately, His Majesty’s father already passed away.


513
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,900
I’ll manage to cancel your engagement.


514
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,620
Daddy, what do you mean?


515
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,260
Don’t worry.


516
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,020
I won’t push you into the living hell.


517
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,840
You.


518
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,500
You.


519
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,560
You want…


520
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,000
As you see,


521
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
a wedding gown and a mourning gown.


522
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Since I was 12 years old,


523
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,300
I’ve preparing a wedding gown for myself every year.


524
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,280
Also when I was 12 years old,


525
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,580
I first saw Cousin


526
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,760
returned from battlefield with wounds


527
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,020
and knew another fate


528
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,700
was waiting for me.


529
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,220
Sui, how stupid you are!


530
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,140
Xu Feng crusaded everywhere,


531
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
so he won’t live long.


532
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,140
I know you’ve loved him passionately since childhood,


533
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,620
but we can’t


534
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,800
go against the heaven’s will.


535
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,680
As your father,


536
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,360
I won’t allow you to marry this autocrat.


537
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,020
It turns out that you think of him
in this way all the time.


538
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,340
You really disappoint me.


539
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,160
But I am afraid that I’ll also disappoint you.


540
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,400
I must marry Cousin this life.


541
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,840
Whether I live in widowhood
or can’t have any child later,


542
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,000
I won’t regret.


543
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,760
If I marry him, it’s my luck
and if not, it’s my fate.


544
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,700
Unless he dies,


545
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,740
no one


546
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,300
can separate us forcibly.


547
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,100
Qi Chong.


548
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,820
Your Highness, what can I do for you?


549
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,480
Go get Saint Girl.


550
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,760
I have something to discuss with her.


551
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,100
Yes.


552
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,140
What’s wrong with you?


553
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,340
I didn’t see you the whole afternoon.


554
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,960
Now you are back,


555
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,480
but you bend the brows.


556
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,600
Taste it now.


557
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,120
His Majesty just asked people
to send sweetmeats to us.


558
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,920
Having some sweet food,
you’ll become happy.


559
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,199
I just went to meet Duke Nanping.


560
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,100
Why did you meet him?


561
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,239
I was afraid that you would worry,


562
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,400
so I didn’t tell you.


563
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,679
But now…


564
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,320
Jin Mi, what actually happened?


565
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,820
I heard His Majesty’s illness condition


566
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,520
from my daughter.


567
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,520
You’ve done a good job.


568
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,159
My Lord, you flatter me.


569
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,980
In your opinion,


570
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,360
how long can King Yi live?


571
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,600
One year at most.


572
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,900
I haven’t told it to Her Highness,
or she may feel sad.


573
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
Leave her alone.


574
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,900
Today I meet you


575
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,520
to let you manage


576
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,120
to reduce King Yi’s longevity


577
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,320
into 10 days.


578
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,860
10 days?


579
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,920
Yes.
The plan changes.


580
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,780
I can’t wait that long.


581
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,250
It’ll be the Meeting of Commanding Officers


582
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,370
10 days later


583
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,120
when civil and military officials and
border defending generals of various places


584
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,040
will come.


585
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,720
I’ll depose Xu Feng by then.


586
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,220
You should


587
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,380
exactly make him


588
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
be killed by poison


589
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,280
on the spot that day.


590
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,060
Yes.


591
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,220
Does Duke Nanping think he is the living Hades


592
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,720
who can determine the death time of a person?


593
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,540
Lower your voice.


594
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,700
Sit down.
Lower your voice.


595
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,400
Moreover,


596
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,740
he holds the lives of more than one hundred people


597
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,900
in our family this time.


598
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,840
It’s worse than last time.


599
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,540
Now he has sent killers into the village.


600
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,500
They’ll act according to the news 10 days later.


601
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,240
We can’t let Auntie die.


602
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,300
I know.


603
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,420
But if King Yi dies,


604
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,280
more people will suffer.


605
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,460
Why?


606
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,980
Now there is a state of chaos.


607
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,720
People are destitute.


608
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,720
But as for the places under the rule of King Yi,


609
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,300
wars are pacified and people live and work in peace.


610
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,800
If he dies,


611
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,040
who can save the living in water and fire?


612
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,340
I believe him.


613
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,900
If he can calm down the country,


614
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
he’ll create a peaceful, tranquil and prosperous age


615
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,000
without war and famine.


616
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,940
It sounds reasonable.


617
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,320
It’s too nerve-racking.


618
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,760
We can’t await our doom


619
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,160
in this way at all.


620
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,420
How about seeking advice from Auntie?


621
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,720
I also think so.


622
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,200
This is a matter of great importance.


623
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,060
We need to discuss with our auntie carefully.
