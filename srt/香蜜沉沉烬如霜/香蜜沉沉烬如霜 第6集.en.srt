1
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,180
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,700
"Episode 6"

3
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,960
Uncle,

4
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,530
report to father right away.

5
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,180
Qiong Qi is wrecking
the Southern Heavenly Gates.

6
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,090
Request for immediate assistance.

7
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,160
Little one, are you all right?

8
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,300
- Let me have a look.
- I'm fine.

9
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,020
Fish Fairy,
you must be careful.

10
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,090
Don't you worry.

11
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,170
Take care of Jin Mi.

12
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
Phoenix!

13
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Watch out!

14
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
Quick, get up.

15
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
Qiong Qi is deadly.
Don't go after him.

16
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
Are you two all right?
Are you hurt?

17
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
I've failed you, father.

18
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,770
I couldn't detain the beast.

19
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,940
I allowed Qiong Qi to destroy
the Southern Heavenly Gates.

20
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,260
I deserve to be punished, father.

21
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,800
You're being too harsh on yourself.

22
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,320
He is an ancient beast.

23
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,610
Ferocious by nature.

24
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,440
You, alone, are no match for him.

25
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,950
Follow me back...

26
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,250
to the Empyrean Cloud Palace now.

27
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,670
We need to figure out
a counter-measure,

28
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,870
- before he comes back stronger.
- Little one,

29
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
are you all right?

30
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,840
Yes.

31
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,480
It's said that
nine hundred years ago, Qiong Qi...

32
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,340
had caused havoc in the six realms.

33
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,240
He didn't just cause chaos
in the Demon Realm,

34
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
he even caused disturbance
in Floral Realm.

35
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
The Heaven Realm sent out...

36
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
masses of powerful Supreme Immortals,

37
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
it took a long time to
finally take him down.

38
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,960
Then, even...

39
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
Xuan Ling Lord Doumu
came forth to cast a seal.

40
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
It befogs me...

41
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,840
why Qiong Qi would appear again.

42
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,600
Qiong Qi's reappearance
is indeed precarious.

43
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,730
In my humble opinion,

44
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,890
it is now a critical time.

45
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,400
He must be quickly detained,

46
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,860
and be sealed once more.

47
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,400
If left unhandled,
he will cause danger to six realms.

48
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,200
There'll then be endless consequences.

49
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
Dear lord, I could not agree more.

50
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
In my humble opinion,

51
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,950
in the battles between
heaven and demon...

52
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,170
though the Demon and Heaven Realm
have called for truce,

53
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,820
feelings of unease
still lurk within them.

54
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,710
Waiting to be unleashed.

55
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,350
King of Yancheng may have withdrawn
at Wangchuan River.

56
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,080
That was but a feigned retreat.

57
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
Now that Qiong Qi has reappeared,

58
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
I believe, Demon Realm is
definitely involved in it.

59
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,380
I humbly ask,

60
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,210
to enter the Demon Realm
to capture Qiong Qi.

61
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,870
At the same time,
investigate the Demon Realm.

62
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,480
The Fire Immortal is right,

63
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,790
to undo the spell,
we need to find the spell caster.

64
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
This catastrophe sprouted
from the Demon Realm.

65
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,910
Please father, make a decision
as soon as you can.

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
The peace among the
six realms lasting until today,

67
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,760
had not been easy to maintain.

68
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
We must not allow the
Demon Realm to evoke,

69
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
overturning the peace.

70
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,460
- Orders for the Fire Immortal, Xu Feng.
- Yes, father!

71
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,000
Take this, Red Clouds Sword.

72
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,000
Protect Heaven and
intercept Demon Realm.

73
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,130
Take down all devils and demons.

74
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,159
Capture Qiong Qi.

75
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,480
Uncover the truth behind
Qiong Qi's return.

76
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I oblige.

77
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
It's already so late.

78
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,990
Why isn't Phoenix back yet?

79
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
I wonder if he is badly hurt...

80
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
by Qiong Qi.

81
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,080
Veggie!

82
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,750
My poor Veggie!

83
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,320
How you've suffered.

84
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,280
Just 2 days,

85
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
and you've been cooked into a dish.

86
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
These soulless short-lived
Heaven Immortals!

87
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
What a sin!

88
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
This Veggie...

89
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,560
who are you talking about?

90
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,820
Have you forgotten?

91
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,800
The field by the Water Mirror,

92
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,910
the lover of the chives sister,

93
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
little Chinese flowering cabbage.

94
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,280
When you were young,
he used to praise you for your wits.

95
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,370
Have you forgotten?

96
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,120
Well, at a glance,
it does look a little familiar.

97
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,040
But how could you tell?

98
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,440
Of course I could.

99
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,930
It's Veggie!

100
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,730
Veggie has always had green leaves.

101
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,940
White stalks.

102
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,430
Rounded head.

103
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
Tender in texture.

104
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,390
Of course it's him.

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,600
Don't all Chinese flowering cabbages
look like that?

106
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,410
Your Highness,

107
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,230
Your Highness,

108
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,830
I heard you had a vicious battle at
Southern Heavenly Gates with Qiong Qi.

109
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,830
Were you hurt?

110
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,130
It was nothing major.

111
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,360
Go on down.

112
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Yes.

113
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,520
- Stop crying.
- Hello, Uncle.

114
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,010
Xu Feng.

115
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
This is...

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,040
A rotten tree cannot bear good fruit.

117
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,340
None of you Heaven-kind
have a kind soul.

118
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
Like father, like mother,

119
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,760
like son.

120
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,590
Xu Feng,

121
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,900
do you still remember...

122
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,390
when you secretly
set free the Jade Rabbit,

123
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,560
there was a Carrot Fairy...

124
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,750
that was thrust around through
the Heavenly Palace?

125
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,760
Well, he's the one.

126
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,520
I was young and oblivious.

127
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,640
For the wrong that I've done unto you,

128
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,520
I hereby apologize.

129
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
But,

130
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,620
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress
are rulers of the six realms...

131
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,380
They are not someone who can be
criticized by a petty fairy like you.

132
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,040
Mr. Hu.

133
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,160
Let's all get along peacefully.
Speak nicely.

134
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,220
Your dishes here are
the least bit tasty.

135
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,440
Little one,

136
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,810
follow me back to the Water Mirror.

137
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,740
And debrief to the fellow Floral Fairies.

138
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,910
I recently heard that
the Floral Realm...

139
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,310
had a fall out with the bird tribe...

140
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
for a mere fairy.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
Is this uproar...

142
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
due to Jin Mi?

143
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,800
So what if is?

144
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,430
What if it's not?

145
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,310
The Floral and Heaven Realm...

146
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,630
haven't communicated
for thousands of years.

147
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,760
Yet today, the Floral Fairies have to
attend to this personally...

148
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,510
for just a fairy.

149
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,230
Seems like there'll be lots
to weather in the coming days.

150
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
The Floral Realm
is none of your business.

151
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you going back for this?

152
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
Very well.

153
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
Qiong Qi is causing havoc.

154
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,540
Father has sent me to
patrol the Demon Realm.

155
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
I'll leave tomorrow.

156
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,260
I'll be gone for a good few years.

157
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,670
If you stayed in Heaven,
with no one to train you.

158
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,920
It'd be a waste of time anyway.
Better yet to go back.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,240
Phoenix, you fool!

160
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,140
How can you let Jin Mi go?

161
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,000
That's great!

162
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
Now that we've bid farewell.

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,240
Let's go then.

164
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,350
Wait a minute.

165
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,130
Now... now's not the time to leave yet.

166
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,360
Why... why's that?

167
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,810
I've not done packing my bags.

168
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Jin Mi, how are you more
clutter-brained than me?

169
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
You're no ordinary human.

170
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,400
What bags do you need?

171
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
Whatever pretty clothes you desire,

172
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,640
you need only snap your fingers,

173
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,000
and you have everything you need.

174
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,280
I... I...
It's not clothes that I want.

175
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,800
It's... it's books that
I want to take along.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Books?

177
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,080
Yes, yes.

178
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,690
Since... since I came here,

179
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,880
I've been studying this
mental cultivation.

180
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,830
There's a few chapters of scripture...

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
that I've not understood.

182
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,440
So I'd like to take them back,

183
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,750
so that I can ask Chief Peony,
isn't that good?

184
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,350
Your Highness,
Can I...

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
Can I take a few books
from your study?

186
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,830
I am truly glad,

187
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,440
that you have a
curious heart to learn.

188
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,760
The books in the study
are yours to take.

189
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

190
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,200
That's more like it.

191
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,280
You've finally matured.

192
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,050
Little one,
besides just playing a fool,

193
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,600
you now yearn self-improvement.

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,480
Very well. We shall
leave tomorrow then.

195
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,840
We shall leave tomorrow.

196
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,170
All right.

197
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,350
- We'll leave tomorrow.
- Take more books.

198
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,160
Take more books.
Don't worry about the weight.

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,440
- If it's heavy, I'll help you.
- All right, all right.

200
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,920
Wait a while.

201
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,910
That should do it.

202
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,640
You've finally learn
not to feed me scalding water.

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,960
Qiong Qi was so scary today,

204
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
thanks for saving me.

205
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,360
Thank goodness, you are grateful.

206
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,120
I very much appreciate being alive.

207
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,390
So I must give thanks,

208
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
for being my saviour.

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,240
I wonder how she plans to thank me.

210
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,120
How are you going to thank me?

211
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Didn't I just thank you?

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,110
Forget it.

213
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,960
It's like I'm serenading a cow.

214
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,530
We were doing fine,

215
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,240
yet he suddenly gets mad at me?

216
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,760
What ridiculous mood swings.

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,080
Rest assured,

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,760
I will definitely defeat Qiong Qi...

219
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,040
and avenge you.

220
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
If you really do defeat him,

221
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,880
even if you
make me gardener then,

222
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,160
I'd be more than willing.

223
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,240
I'd even plant
a whole garden with Phoenix Flower.

224
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,850
What's the matter?

225
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,870
Are you all right?

226
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,080
Help me up over there.

227
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,530
Yes, of course.

228
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,980
Slowly.

229
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,050
Phoenix.

230
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,900
Are you okay?

231
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,390
I'm fine.

232
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,620
I'll be okay, with just a
change of luck after 12 days.

233
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
- Phoenix.
- No big deal.

234
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,750
What's with that face?

235
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,010
Your brows and eyes
are all scrunched up.

236
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,840
I was just thinking,

237
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,120
you're not using your powers
to stay strong, right?

238
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,520
Why would I stay strong for?

239
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
Then, get up and walk 2 rounds for me.

240
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm up.

241
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Not enough.

242
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,600
This can't determine
if you're really okay.

243
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,040
I must see for myself.

244
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,950
What are you doing?

245
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,840
I want to see
if your back is recovered.

246
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,400
How would I know if I don't check?

247
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,220
- Let go.
- No.

248
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,400
Let me see.

249
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,550
Qiong Qi is so strong.
No way you'd recover so easily.

250
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,350
If I don't see it myself,
I won't believe it.

251
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,290
If I say I'm fine, I'm fine.
Tugging and pulling, what a mess.

252
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,400
Let me see.
I'll stop once I see.

253
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Let me see.

254
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,480
Even immortals have scars too.

255
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,100
Why do you have so many?

256
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,360
What happened here?

257
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,240
They were from former battles.

258
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,890
How long do you plan to keep looking?

259
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,980
Fine, fine.

260
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,800
Do you all wild fairies...

261
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,400
know no bounds between men and women?

262
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,160
And always tug at people's clothes?

263
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,670
It's fine that it's me.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,400
But you can never
tug on other people's clothes.

265
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,000
Understood?

266
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,050
Understood.

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
You're amazing.

268
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,480
You can recover from
all injuries by Qiong Qi's.

269
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
But why do you have
so many scars?

270
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,040
Wars wait for no men.

271
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,550
When have I the time to heal?

272
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,830
So as time passes,

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,240
scars naturally stay.

274
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,800
But they are just external injuries.

275
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,120
It's nothing.

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,560
Don't you feel pain?

277
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,080
They've long recovered.

278
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,520
I guess being Supreme Immortal
is not easy too.

279
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,040
Obviously.

280
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,480
The Way of Heaven...

281
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,290
is paved with endless pain
but sparse healing.

282
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,480
Do everything...

283
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,880
in adequacy.

284
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
The higher the magical prowess,
the stronger one becomes.

285
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,720
The more responsibility and
bigger the mission one bears.

286
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,480
The more there are that...

287
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
one needs to protect.

288
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,320
I heard Chief Peony mention once,

289
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,590
in the Floral Realm,

290
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
if Ganoderma essence is applied,

291
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,520
those badly injured can heal,

292
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,120
normal people can get stronger...

293
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,080
from ingesting it.

294
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Seeing that Your Highness
has saved my life,

295
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,200
I'll give you one.

296
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,640
Ganoderma essence is rare
and sacred in the Floral Realm.

297
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,880
You need not bother
Chief Peony for my sake.

298
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,440
Mr. Hu said before,

299
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,320
people who look good,

300
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,640
spend all their effort in
caring for their face.

301
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,920
Therefore, their brains
are usually empty.

302
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,760
You, are the perfect example.

303
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,400
You're the one who kidnapped me here.

304
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
Why would Chief Peony save you?

305
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,440
If that's the case,

306
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
how would you give it to me?

307
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,580
It's just some grass.

308
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,560
I'll just cast it out for you.

309
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,750
You, cast it out?

310
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,000
Don't look down on me.

311
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,840
That's actually really easy.

312
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,640
You better think about
how you should thank me,

313
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,800
after I cast it out.

314
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,600
All right,

315
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,930
I'll be waiting then.

316
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,240
Just you wait.

317
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,120
Wait and see.

318
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
If you can plant the Ganoderma,

319
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,950
I'll give you 200 years worth
of magical prowess.

320
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,360
What say you?

321
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,900
I know you're just teasing me.

322
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
But us fruit planters,

323
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,720
do not share the same thoughts
with the birds.

324
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,360
Three hundred years.

325
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
All right, 300 years then.

326
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,620
I... I...

327
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I... I've planted it!

328
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,280
I've grown the Ganoderma!

329
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,440
Look!

330
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,470
Three hundred years
of magical prowess.

331
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,760
Losers pay the rake!

332
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,170
What are you?

333
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,040
What's wrong?

334
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,160
Ganoderma essence is a
sacred to the Floral Realm.

335
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,700
How can a nobody like you
grow something like that?

336
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,750
Let me ask you,

337
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,870
how are you related
to the late Floral Immortal?

338
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,920
The late Floral Immortal had
great magical prowess.

339
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,440
High above all immortals.

340
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,440
If only I could be related to that.

341
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm not joking around, who are you?

342
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,140
I'm just a grape,
what's wrong with you?

343
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,270
Have you changed your mind
about the magical prowess?

344
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,640
You can just say so.

345
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,140
Why are you being like this?

346
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,080
Fox fairy, why are you here?

347
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,440
As the wind breezes by,

348
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,160
separating Heaven and Earth
to a million miles.

349
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,910
So, what?

350
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,680
Moon Immortal was right,

351
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,440
to hold down a man,
is to first hold his kiss.

352
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,960
But why do I feel weird?

353
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
The rest is still usable.

354
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
Keep it.

355
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,600
Don't waste my Ganoderma!

356
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,600
Never to meet again in all eternity,

357
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,120
despite how frantic the world becomes.

358
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,400
In a love letter, I found the place
where we meet in every life.

359
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,960
There I'll wait for us to
watch the setting sun.

360
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,560
In a love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

361
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,400
There I'll sing in the moonlight.

362
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,520
In a love letter, I found the place
where I make a wish in every life.

363
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,040
There I'll plant a red lotus to fill
the memories with its lovely scent.

364
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,040
In a love letter, I found a place...

365
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,130
Rou Rou.

366
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,140
Phoenix got hurt because
he tried to save me.

367
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,030
Yet,

368
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
this cunning bird...

369
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
said he's fully recovered.

370
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
Who knows if he's really recovered?

371
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,240
He even sacrificed his life for me.

372
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,920
If I left just like that,

373
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,640
it'd be too unfair...

374
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,240
right?

375
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,800
Even if not for him,

376
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,390
but for you,

377
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,320
I too, must go to Demon Realm
to find Qiong Qi.

378
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,880
To avenge you!

379
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,880
In a love letter, I found the place
where we meet in every life.

380
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,990
There I'll wait for us to
watch the setting sun.

381
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,940
In a love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

382
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,680
There I'll sing in the moonlight.

383
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,640
In a love letter, I found the place
where I make a wish in every life.

384
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,420
There I'll plant a red lotus to fill
the memories with its lovely scent.

385
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,240
In a love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

386
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,920
Congratulations, Your Highness.

387
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,640
What of?

388
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,720
I heard that Your Highness
caused great pain...

389
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,140
to Qiong Qi with your powers.

390
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,190
The Heavenly Emperor personally gifted
the Red Clouds Sword...

391
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,050
which can kill immortals and
subdue demons.

392
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,680
That sword is Heaven Realm's
greatest treasure.

393
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,040
The Heavenly Emperor's action
of doing so speaks volumes.

394
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,780
Your aunt is too, greatly thrilled.

395
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,790
Therefore, I have come forth
especially to congratulate you.

396
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,080
It was only a duty,
there's nothing to be congratulated.

397
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,720
What is it that brings you here
so early in the day?

398
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,720
Your Highness,
you are journeying far.

399
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,320
I came to send you off.

400
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
Also, I heard some rumours yesterday.

401
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,360
Saying that, Jin Mi is the person
Chief Peony is after.

402
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,630
Is this true?

403
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,960
You sure are well-informed.

404
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,640
Seems like Qiwu Palace
should do an in-house clean up.

405
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,290
No wonder I couldn't
find a single soul...

406
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,320
as I searched the entire bird tribe.

407
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,640
Jin Mi is really headstrong.

408
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,040
Just by her alone,

409
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,010
she caused so much trouble
to the bird tribe.

410
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,400
You can't blame Jin Mi,

411
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,420
it was I who took her here
to Heaven Realm.

412
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,860
I'll apologize to Chief Peony.

413
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,650
To clear up the misunderstanding.

414
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,870
Surely.

415
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,180
So long as the Floral Realm and
the bird tribe are on good terms,

416
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,490
I'll have a peace of mind.

417
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,400
Just that, I used to think
I knew Jin Mi.

418
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,240
Yet she even hid her identity from me.

419
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,760
I'm just so disappointed.

420
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,270
You've always been benevolent.

421
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,160
Don't compare yourself to Jin Mi,
that clutter-brain.

422
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,050
Phoenix has great powers.

423
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,070
Hopefully he doesn't figure it out.

424
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,790
Ouch.

425
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,840
Your Highness,

426
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,320
this shirt has got some dirt on it.

427
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,600
Your Highness,

428
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,590
it might be because
this scroll is aged.

429
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,580
It's not properly dusted,
thus dusting the shirt.

430
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,630
Your Highness, shall I get a
change of clothes for you?

431
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,560
Your Highness,
how about this purple one?

432
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,200
It's a little too bright.

433
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,120
Then, Your Highness,
what about the black one?

434
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,430
That's too gloomy.

435
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,580
No worries.

436
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,240
A little dust is fine.

437
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,790
I'll just wear this.

438
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,800
That's right.

439
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,390
Ouch!

440
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,860
It hurts!

441
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,280
"Bank of Wangchuan River"

442
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,680
Young man, are you looking for a ride?

443
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,920
Exactly.

444
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,350
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

445
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,470
Please.

446
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,680
Please stand firm, young man.

447
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,400
The fairy in the sleeve pocket too,
hold on tight.

448
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,080
I'm going to take off.

449
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Fairy in sleeve pocket, hold on tight.

450
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,840
That...

451
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
I don't know how but I slept
in the wrong place, last night.

452
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,320
How unfortunate.
How unfortunate indeed.

453
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,470
This is Wangchuan River.

454
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,280
If you don't wish to be the food of
the souls in the river, sit still.

455
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Where's your grape vines?

456
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,970
I worried that wearing it
would wound your pride,

457
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,020
so I kept it.

458
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,700
Why would my pride be wounded?

459
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,670
Obviously because I worry,
I'd snatch away...

460
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,730
your reputation as the most
handsome man in the six realms.

461
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,480
My whole 10,000 years of watching...

462
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,040
River of Unmindfulness,
this is my second time...

463
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,080
seeing such a stunning lady.

464
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,230
Isn't your business
doing too bad then.

465
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,060
Only 2 ladies in 10,000 years.

466
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,330
I still remember,
about 10,000 years ago...

467
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,910
there once was a lady...

468
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,500
who came to me for
a handful of water from this river.

469
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,110
That lady had the skin of a goddess.

470
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,490
She walked like she was
on a field of flowers.

471
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,040
Her feature's stunning.

472
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,720
But she looked miserable.

473
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Unlike this lady here,
who's bright and naive.

474
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,490
Sounds like an interesting story.

475
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,850
I'll tell this to the Moon Immortal
when I get back.

476
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,470
He'd definitely be delighted.

477
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,710
Then what happened?
What happened next?

478
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,230
Then from the shore,
came a man with brocade clothing.

479
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,220
Hurriedly he spilled the water
from the hands of the lady.

480
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,100
After a struggle between the two.

481
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,660
The girl leaped up,
seeming to dive into the river.

482
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
Then the man panicked.

483
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,640
As if he'd gone mad,
and tried to pull her back.

484
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,710
In the end,
the 2 of them disappeared...

485
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,240
and was nowhere to be seen.

486
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
River of Unmindfulness.

487
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,780
Looking back, it's all
become a distant memory.

488
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,200
So it's a story with a bad ending.

489
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,920
Stand firm.

490
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,660
Told you to be careful.

491
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,880
You clumsy mess.

492
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,840
What a moody birdy.

493
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,730
Don't leave me here alone.

494
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,800
I'll be scared all alone here.

495
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,970
You're a elfin.

496
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,590
What could possibly scare you?

497
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,120
Oh yeah.

498
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,390
You've got a point.

499
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,850
What? I'm no elfin.

500
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,370
I'm a fairy.

501
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,600
From today on,

502
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,320
you will be my personal maid
in the Demon Realm.

503
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,520
Assist me closely.

504
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,960
And I'll make sure you don't get
captured by demons. How's that?

505
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,360
All right.

506
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,390
Why did you make
my hair into 2 pigtails?

507
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,100
This is so old-fashioned!

508
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,540
Why did you make
my hair into 2 pigtails?

509
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
I hate pigtails.

510
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,560
I think it looks great.

511
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,120
Two pigtails don't look good at all!

512
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,080
I think it looks great.

513
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,840
Mr. Demon,
come buy this tail.

514
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,990
I have only the freshest.

515
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,400
Once you put it on,
I assure you will be in disguise.

516
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,160
How real!

517
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,680
It's still warm.

518
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,120
Do you have bunny ears?

519
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,560
I do, I do, I do!

520
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,520
Wow, really?

521
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
Now I can go back and
give Mr. Hu a scare.

522
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,850
Do I look cute?
Cute, aren't I?

523
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,160
You have such great taste.

524
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
This rabbit ears are made
according to...

525
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,560
- the Jade Rabbit of Guanghan Palace.
- Really?

526
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,160
Don't get tricked.

527
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
All right!

528
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Ms. Demon,

529
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,380
you have not given me
any magical prowess.

530
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
What magical prowess?

531
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll pay on behalf of her.

532
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,250
Fish Fairy?

533
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,200
Fairy Jin Mi.

534
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,350
- Why are you here?
- You seem well.

535
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,410
- Thanks Fish Fairy.
- Cute, right? You like it?

536
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,840
This.

537
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,700
It's my maid who is buying,

538
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,190
of course I should be paying.

539
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,320
How could I trouble
The Night Immortal.

540
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,200
It's no trouble between brothers.

541
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,230
Brothers?

542
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,790
You are brothers?

543
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,680
The Heaven Realm is truly weird.

544
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,830
First there was the Fox uncle.

545
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,160
Now there's a handsome fish brother.

546
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,020
Everyone is connected in this world.

547
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,280
Looks like you know each other.

548
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,230
That day, Fish Fairy was
feeding the deer in Heaven,

549
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
and I ran into him.

550
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,860
Fish?

551
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,750
The Night Immortal,

552
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,590
when did you decide to
forgo being a dragon,

553
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,050
but become a fish instead?

554
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,330
The Night Immortal?

555
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,780
I heard that a while back...

556
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,880
The Fire Immortal became a crow
back in the Floral Realm.

557
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,600
Me becoming a fish
is nothing compared to that.

558
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
You.

559
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,620
You're the Night Dragon, the Night Immortal?

560
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,239
I guess having a tail with scales,
doesn't mean you're a fish.

561
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,340
You could be
a low-profile dragon too.

562
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,570
It never occurred to me,
that Jin Mi, you...

563
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,280
are the Fire Immortal's maidservant.

564
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,100
How very interesting.

565
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,210
What brings the Night Immortal
to the Demon Realm?

566
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,409
You coming here personally
to capture Qiong Qi...

567
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,670
has made me worry.

568
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,110
So I came to lend a helping hand.

569
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,870
Qiong Qi is truly ferocious.

570
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,290
I may not be able to protect you.

571
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,520
Rest assured.

572
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,960
I won't drag you down.

573
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,600
- Let's go then.
- Let's.

574
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,400
What a big room!

575
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,010
Where... where should I sleep?

576
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,300
You're my personal maid.

577
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,030
Of course you have to serve me.

578
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
That doesn't seem very good.

579
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm not used to sharing a bed.

580
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,360
This is a suite.

581
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,920
Of course you'll have your own bed.

582
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,790
Tonight, I'll be discussing the
battle plan with his highness.

583
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,110
You go prepare some
fine wine and food...

584
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,480
and send it to my room.

585
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,360
He knows just how to make me busy.

586
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,160
Why are you here in Demon Realm too?

587
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,160
Mr. Hu...

588
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,120
The past year...

589
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,000
has been a great memory.

590
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,920
Immortal,
you have a letter.

591
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Immortal.

592
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,160
This was written by Jin Mi to you.

593
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,700
Jin Mi?

594
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,440
Little one!

595
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,520
Little deer,

596
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
morning.

597
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,120
Here.

598
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,970
Have a bit of grass.

599
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,170
This grass
is hard to find in this Demon Realm.

600
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,910
Don't just feed on dreams,

601
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
have some greens too.

602
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,360
Then, you'll be healthier.

603
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,480
Have some grass.
Grass.

604
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,320
Come on, come get it.

605
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,000
Here you go.

606
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,290
Jin Mi, don't force it.

607
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,970
Fish Fairy.

608
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,060
Jin Mi, you may not know...

609
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,180
but the Beast of Dreams
only feeds on dreams.

610
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
So, it can't eat grass.

611
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,550
Let it out at night,

612
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,930
and it'll go hunting for dreams.

613
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,990
Then it'll eat.

614
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
Only eats dreams?

615
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,100
I wonder if the dreams taste any good.

616
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,180
Is it sweet? Salty?

617
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,520
This Little one,

618
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,840
hit a jackpot and had...

619
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,200
pretty girls in his dreams.

620
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,450
But this dream...

621
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,330
why did it change at the end?

622
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,600
There are 2 types of dreams.

623
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,160
One is a blue dream from memory.

624
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,900
The other is a yellow dream of desire.

625
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,940
When people dream
of the things that had once happened,

626
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,600
then, the dream beads
will glow with a blue light.

627
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,410
Which is the blue coloured
dream of memory.

628
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,600
If it's a dream that has
never really happened,

629
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,870
but just imagination.

630
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,720
Then the dream bead
will let out a yellow glow.

631
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,630
Which is the yellow coloured
dream of desire.

632
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,510
People often dream
of reality at the very beginning...

633
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,890
of their dream.

634
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,270
But then...

635
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,020
it gradually fills with...

636
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,400
all sorts of imagination.

637
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,720
This dream will change from
a blue dream of memory...

638
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,720
to a yellow dream of desire.

639
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,660
It sounds super complex.

640
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
To put it simply,

641
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,350
can I say, that a
yellow dream is fake...

642
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,720
and a blue dream is real?

643
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,040
If it's both blue and yellow,

644
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,490
then it's half fake and half real.

645
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,910
That's right.

646
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,360
Jin Mi, you are correct.

647
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,880
Oh yes, breakfast is served.

648
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,990
Let's go eat.

649
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,760
Don't worry about me, you go ahead.
I'll be there in a bit.

650
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,730
All right, I'll be going first.

651
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,560
Little Beast of Dreams.

652
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,640
The dream you just spit out
was really meaningful.

653
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,890
Give me another, won't you?

654
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,000
Isn't that Phoenix?

655
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,760
This must be the erotic dream that...

656
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
Moon Immortal mentioned.

657
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,990
Fancy that!,

658
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,620
The rascal, Phoenix.

659
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,600
He always looks so serious.

660
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,800
Yet he has such erotic dream.

661
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,240
This girl...

662
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,240
Why does she look exactly like me?

663
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Tell me,

664
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,640
who's that woman
hugging the Fire Immortal?

665
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,970
Isn't this woman
the Demon Realm general?

666
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,670
I have no idea too.

667
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,970
I was just looking too.

668
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,320
With that whip of yours,

669
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,920
I couldn't see anything.

670
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,360
And who are you?

671
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,120
How dare you spy on the dreams
of the Supreme Immortal?

672
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,290
Me?

673
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,000
I am his highness
The Fire Immortal's maidservant.

674
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,740
The Fire Immortal,
where is he?

675
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,470
Come, come, I'll tell you.

676
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,650
He's eating right now.

677
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,850
Just go straight, turn left,
left and left again.

678
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,050
When you get there,
turn right and you'll see him.

679
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,230
Go on!

680
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,590
I got to find a good spot
to watch it unfold.

681
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,110
The food in Heaven Realm are bland,

682
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
After a long time, it feels dull.

683
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,920
Eating spicy and sweet food
once in a while...

684
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,220
is quite a pleasure.

685
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,040
Coming out from the Second Prince
who eats only fruits of bamboo,

686
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
only drinks from the purest spring,

687
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
that's rather interesting.

688
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,250
Cheers,

689
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,880
Fairy Jin Mi.

690
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,580
No one came to see you yet?
