
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 22"



00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,040
It was probably Duke Nanping



00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,579
who poisoned my food



00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,579
and colluded with Liangguo people
in ambushing me before.



00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,790
How ambitious he is!



00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,920
I must get back to get rid of him soon.



00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Why does my heart beat so fast



00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,780
and feel so sore?



00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,120
I’ve never felt like this before.



00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,360
It was urgent, so I offended you.



00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,320
Since we were separated by the veil,
you didn’t offend me.



00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,920
Never mind.



00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,800
" Dongting Lake"



00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
My Lord. My Lord.



00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,120
Yong, Lian, how’ve you been?



00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,800
My Lord, please behave yourself.



00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
Master has been waiting for you for a long time.



00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,660
You’re so boring and monotonous.



00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,560
"Yunmeng Lake "



00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,180
Master, how have you been doing recently?



00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,040
You haven’t been back since Rat Fairy died.



00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,740
If I didn’t summon you today,



00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,500
you would never



00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,020
step in Yunmeng Lake again, right?



00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,260
I don’t dare.



00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,020
You don’t dare?



00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
Maybe you don’t dare,



00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,660
but you have such an idea.



00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,660
My sincerity to you is visible.



00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,040
I know the death of Rat Fairy
was a heavy blow to you,



00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,860
but since he was dead,



00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,400
it’s useless to dwell on the past.



00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,580
You should look ahead



00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
and let it go.



00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,580
What’s your order, Master?



00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,220
Get up.



00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,680
I got the message that



00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,360
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow appeared again.



00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,180
Go to snatch it



00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,860
and kill Xu Feng for me.



00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,190
Oh, my Gosh!



00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,640
My adopted mother always does whatever she likes.



00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,740
It sounds like Spirit-Vanishing Arrow



00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,960
is just a knife in her kitchen



00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,860
and Xu Feng is a chick raised by her.



00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,680
Mom, I’m afraid I can’t do it.



00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,760
Rat Fairy and I got help from outside or in last time,



00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,180
but we still failed to kill Xu Feng



00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
and Rat Fairy even died because of this.



00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,620
I really don’t have confidence



00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
that I can get rid of Xu Feng alone.



00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,700
He’s a mortal now



00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,280
and even weaker than he was during nirvana.



00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,260
Since the great cause is unachieved,



00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,010
someone must die for it.



00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,340
How can you give it up just for his death?



00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,980
Did you just regard Rat Fairy



00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,920
as a pawn?



00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,140
I know you don’t agree with my behavior,



00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,000
but we have no way to back down.



00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,740
Rat Fairy was loyal to me



00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,960
and masterminded with painstaking effort
in Heaven Realm for so many years



00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,520
so as to collect a lot of precious information for us.



00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,300
If we give up halfway,



00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,140
we’ll fail him.



00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,580
Before Rat Fairy died for justice,



00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,580
he repeatedly asked me to tell you



00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,500
haste makes waste.



00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,760
Water Immortal saved you



00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,720
from Heavenly Empress despite everything



00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,360
and offered you this place to live.



00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,840
You just mentioned that



00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,700
it is useless to



00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,400
dwell on the past.



00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,740
Why do you



00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,120
get yourself into endless hatred



00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,120
and implicate more innocent people?



00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,120
Cut it out.



00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Stop telling me



00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,740
an eye for an eye



00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,180
will only make the whole world blind.



00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,110
In such a big world,



00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,030
I may still exist, but I have ceased to live,



00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,440
and have nowhere to make my home.



00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Have you ever tried to



00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,360
live on the charity and compassion of others?



00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
You saved me,



00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,500
so I’ll die for you without any hesitation.



00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,500
After Rat Fairy died,



00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
I’ll still pledge allegiance to you.



00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,700
If I die,



00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,520
I wonder who will pledge allegiance to you.



00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,780
Yan You, I can only depend on you.



00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,440
You must take care of yourself
when dealing with Xu Feng.



00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,620
I can’t afford to lose you.



00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,600
Li.



00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,160
Mom.



00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,860
Mom.



00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,800
I have seen you.
Come out.



00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
Little boy, what species are you?



00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,800
I’m a carp elf.



00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
I don’t believe you.



00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
She won’t adopt a real carp.



00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,160
White loach, who are you?



00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
I’m another Li.



00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,040
But we are the same and both of us are false.



00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,660
Little loach, are you happy here?



00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,000
I have plenty to eat and drink



00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,320
and nice new clothes to wear here.



00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,940
Surely I’m happy.



00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,940
But I prefer rolling in the mud puddle.



00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,380
I can’t let her go on anymore.



00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,860
I promise to send you back to the mud puddle.



00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,390
Where is he?



00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,100
I can’t find him anywhere.



00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Was he captured by King of Gu City?



00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,640
It’s forbidden to get in and out of
the sleeping chamber of His Majesty.



00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,020
Even if Princess Sui He



00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,080
wants to borrow something,



00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,340
you must report it to me first. Got it?



00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,780
Yes.



00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,640
I didn’t expect that you are
not only good at martial arts



00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
but also good at cooking.



00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,260
Great.



00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,220
Medical fees.



00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,980
Claw me and I’ll claw thee.



00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,620
You saved me, but I was
unable to repay your kindness,



00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,940
so I cooked a simple meal
to express my gratitude to you.



00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,120
Here. I don’t need it.



00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Although you’re my patient,



00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,140
I’ve regarded you as my friend.



00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,580
I grew up in Saint Doctors' Family
and seclude myself from the world.



00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,960
I’m really glad to meet you.



00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,200
If you heal me,



00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,400
I’ll achieve one of your dreams someday.



00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,940
How can a bandit achieve my dream?



00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,020
Thank you,



00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,020
but you may not achieve my dream.



00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,300
If you have a dream,



00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,060
maybe I can help you achieve it.



00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,540
That’s a deal.



00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,340
You don’t stand on ceremony at all.



00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,020
You get a promise from me then.



00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
However, I’m sure



00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,760
we’ll never see each other again in the future.



00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,940
You bandits lead a bloody life.



00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,460
Although I don’t have to fight,



00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,340
I’m on tenterhooks every day.



00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,040
In fact, we have the same destination.



00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,220
I’m just taking one day at a time.



00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,400
Although I have learned medicine for 15 years



00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
and been proficient in medical science and pharmacology,



00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,200
you’re actually my first patient.



00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,080
Isn’t that funny?



00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,580
As Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family,



00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,580
the meaning of my life



00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,500
is to prepare Elixir of Life for King Yi.



00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,500
If I fail,



00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,040
when King Yi.



00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,160
passes away,



00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,560
it’s also time for me to die.



00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,560
When King Yi is alive,



00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,860
I have to decoct herbal medicine for him



00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,860
and when he dies,



00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,420
I’ll be buried with his coffin



00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,360
in the imperial mausoleum as a burial object



00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,000
to expiate his sins with my holy and pure soul.



00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,940
But I heard that King Yi



00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
fights battles everywhere
and has killed many people.



00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,160
I guess he may die young as well.



00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,860
So I can’t live for long.



00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,620
Here.



00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,120
Crow, I substitute wine with tea
and propose a toast to you.



00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,180
Thank you



00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,660
for letting me know



00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,720
the meaning of being alive



00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,440
in my humble and insignificant life for the first time.



00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,540
Although I don’t know
whether you can be cured or not,



00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,640
you let me know



00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,580
how wonderful it is to help someone



00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,980
when I’m still alive.



00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,320
I have a poor memory.



00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,980
I have forgotten that you can’t hear me.



00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Anyway, Crow,



00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,720
thank you.



00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,920
What kind of person are you?



00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,860
Jin Mi.



00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,240
I’m afraid that Duke Nanping has plotted for long.



00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,240
If I return to Palace of King Yi now,
I may be in danger.



00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,800
It’s better to go to Beiyuan Mountain Villa first.



00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,020
It is the place where my trusted troops are stationed,



00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,510
so it is the safest.



00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,020
I can have a further plan after reaching there.



00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,000
Crow.



00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,300
Crow.



00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Crow.



00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,980
Crow.



00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,340
How come



00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
he vanished like the night drew?



00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,980
Dear Madam, I’ve been sick
for more than one month



00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,760
and thanks to your careful attention,



00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,250
I was cured yesterday.



00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,670
Something happened in my family,



00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,400
so I have to leave without saying goodbye.
Please forgive me.



00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,800
We met by chance,
but anyway we have different paths.



00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
I never make a promise easily,



00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
but since I do,
I’ll keep it by any means.



00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,720
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye.



00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,140
You left the same night as soon as you were cured.



00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,580
You didn’t even have time to say goodbye to me



00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,260
in person?



00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,540
I won’t charge you for medical fees.



00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,580
Peony.



00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,280
Peony?



00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,460
Peony.



00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,020
I’ve planted some carrots.



00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,440
Would you like some?



00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,800
Mr. Hu,



00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
what’s wrong with you today?



00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,600
Do you think



00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,280
you live too long



00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,980
and want to die?



00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,840
Peony, you do lack a sense of romance.



00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,760
It’s romantic to die for a beauty.



00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,620
Moon Immortal really wants to be fertilizer.



00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,260
Someone,



00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,940
put him in the rabbit house.



00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,660
Yes.



00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,320
No.



00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,120
No. No.



00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,100
You…



00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,220
I won’t go in.
I won’t go in.



00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,320
Let me out.
Let me out.



00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,460
Help!



00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,680
Chief Peony, I was wrong.



00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,240
Let me out.



00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
Let me out.



00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,280
Chief Peony, I was wrong.



00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,080
Let me out.
Let me out.



00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,020
Let me out.
Let me out.



00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,960
Hong Hong.



00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Don’t cry.



00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,920
It was all your fault.



00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
Old fox,



00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,080
why don’t you make fun of



00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
those fair children in the heaven



00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,060
but play tricks on me



00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,720
in Floral Realm?



00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,920
Jin Mi and Xu Feng both are absent,



00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,460
so I’m really bored.



00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,700
You’re bored, so you played tricks on me?



00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,320
How dare you offend Chief Peony? Chief…



00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,000
Chief…



00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,160
How dare you make fun of Chief Peony?



00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,320
You’re so bold. You…



00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,960
There is only one man



00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,840
in Floral Realm.



00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,160
I could only tie the red rope to you.



00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,960
Did you just see



00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,620
how furious those rabbits were?



00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,460
They came at me.



00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,160
You know,



00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,840
a rabbit almost peeled me.



00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,340
Please let me pass.



00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,060
A rabbit almost peeled me



00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,940
just now.



00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
Fortunately, I have a weapon with me.



00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
Mr. Hu, you don’t dare to provoke Chief Peony.



00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,860
How about…



00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,580
Lian Qiao?



00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,420
Are, are you kidding me?



00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,840
I’m a great-great-great-great-grandfather



00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,200
of the great-great-great-great-grandfather of Lian Qiao.



00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,480
No way.



00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,300
Stop kidding.



00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,140
A usually love story



00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,860
must be usual



00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,240
or it won’t be impressive.



00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,920
Am I right?



00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,860
You have become dull



00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,500
because of playing matchmaker all the time.



00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,180
I’m leaving.



00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,400
Jin Mi, Xu Feng,



00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
when do you go back after experiencing hardships?



00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,180
I’m so bored.



00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Sister, are you worried about Jin Mi?



00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,920
I wonder how she is going in the mortal world.



00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,080
Now she has become



00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
a weak mortal.



00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
Don’t worry.



00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,160
If she really has an accident



00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,500
in the mortal world,



00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,660
she can finish experiencing hardships



00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,100
and return soon then.



00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,180
What happens in the mortal world is not terrible,



00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,080
as it can cultivate her.



00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,440
I’m afraid that it isn’t mortals who want to harm her.



00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,900
Jin Mi has no enemy



00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
except Heavenly Empress.



00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,820
Heavenly Emperor specially issued a decree



00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,100
ordering all immortals not to intervene
in Jin Mi’s experiencing hardships.



00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,780
This is issued for Heavenly Empress, right?



00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,540
Yes. Take it easy, Sister.



00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,400
Moreover, Night Immortal



00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,780
keeps an eye on Jin Mi every day,



00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
so I think



00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,660
Jin Mi will return safely



00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,660
very soon.



00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,820
She is always a child in my mind.



00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,720
I was afraid that she might hurt herself,



00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,240
so I didn’t dare to let go of her in the past.



00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,720
It’s time to let go of her



00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,380
and allow her to experience something outside.



00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,940
Catch me.



00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,800
Go and catch me.



00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,440
It’s a serious fault for taking away the Millennial Ginseng.



00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,380
I don’t know how they will punish me.



00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,740
Anyway I’m tough. I’ll play it by ear.



00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,140
Auntie. Qiang Huo.



00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,240
You’re back.



00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,940
Jin…



00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,280
Saint Girl, have you had your dinner?



00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,740
Are there any leftovers?



00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,080
Let me cook a bowl of egg noodles for you.



00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,860
Take it easy.



00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,520
You’re always reckless.



00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,320
Did she forget?



00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,080
Well, give it to me.



00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,960
Thank you, Auntie.



00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,600
You have been to Luoye Mountain
for more than one month.



00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,460
What did you get?



00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,320
I gained a lot.



00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,500
I will sort it out in a few days



00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,500
and lecture other girls about it.



00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,600
How was everything going



00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
in this month when l left?



00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,160
Everything was good.



00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,520
I feel relieved then.



00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,700
Jin Mi, I didn’t tell them.



00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,480
I don’t know



00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,160
how the elders would punish you



00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
if I told them.



00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,160
I thought it over later.



00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
What you said did make sense.



00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,640
Anyway King Yi can’t live forever.



00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,980
It’s better to give it to other people who need it.



00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I chose you other than ginseng for sure.



00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,500
How nice you are, Qiang Huo. I know



00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,500
you’re my best friend.



00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,340
But you were so bold.



00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,240
Don’t ever do it again.



00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,660
I won’t.



00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,320
Anyway



00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,940
I don’t have any Millennial Ginseng to steal anymore.



00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,500
By the way,



00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,500
was the person you treated with the Millennial Ginseng



00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,700
cured?



00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,480
Yes.



00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,800
But I met



00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,800
a rare disease



00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,800
when treating my first patient.



00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,160
It’s said in the book that
the patient can be cured in three days,



00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,680
but it took me one whole month.



00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,920
My biggest impression this time is that



00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,220
we can’t believe everything in the book.



00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,880
Experience is the best teacher.



00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,100
Let’s go.



00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,080
A country cannot exist without a king.



00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,240
Xu Feng is missing and may be dead.



00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,240
We should hold a funeral at once.



00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,820
Now Huaiwu is beset by enemies from within and without.



00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,720
I have no choice.



00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,880
Cousin must be alive.



00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
I will look for him in Luoye Mountain with my men.



00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,820
There are plenty more fish in the sea.



00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,160
As my daughter,



00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,320
you can certainly find a good husband.



00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
Why are you so obsessive



00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,560
about Xu Feng?



00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,260
Daddy, you should understand my only dream



00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,600
is to get married with him in my life.



00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,500
Even death can’t part me from him.



00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I don't believe heaven is so cruel



00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,360
to perish my only dream.



00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,780
I must find Cousin.



00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,260
You can’t hold a funeral now.



00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,780
You…



00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,260
Your Highness.



00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,720
Your Highness.
Your Highness.



00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,220
What’s the hurry?



00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,540
Your Highness,



00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,540
King Yi returned safely.



00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,300
What?



00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,580
King Yi did return safely?



00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,340
Yes.



00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,260
Where is he now?



00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,740
He should have been back to his mansion now.



00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
Who is that?



00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,520
Why don’t you show up but hide covertly?



00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,000
Show up.



00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,280
Just stay away from her.



00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,640
Hey, I advise you to mind your own business.



00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,900
Get rid of him first.



00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,240
Watch out.



00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Are you all right?



00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,280
"Beiyuan Villa"
Your Highness, His Majesty is having a rest.



00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,800
Let me get in to see him.



00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,980
His Majesty said



00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,620
no one is allowed to disturb him without his permission.



00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,920
How dare you stop me?



00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,700
Military orders cannot be disobeyed.



00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,960
Please forgive me, Your Highness.



00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,480
I won’t leave without seeing him today.



00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
Qin Tong.



00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
Yes.



00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,160
Go to handle her.



00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,360
Yes.



00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,360
Get out of my way.



00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,680
Your Highness, can I have a moment with you?



00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,620
You’re so reliable.



00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,820
I’m flattered.



00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,580
How did you send her away?



00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,580
Although His Majesty is safe and sound,



00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,260
but he is exhausted and weak and needs some rest



00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,520
after a long and tiring journey.



00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,100
You shouldn’t bother him now.



00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,220
Please come here tomorrow



00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,720
and His Majesty will meet you for sure.



00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,700
How could you make a decision for me?



00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,500
I was wrong.



00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,100
The message of my hunting



00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,380
must have been divulged to Liangguo.



00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,560
You doubt there is a mole in the palace?



00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,080
Fine.



00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,980
Since I need some rest today,



00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,820
I won’t think about it.



00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,120
Let’s discuss it tomorrow.



00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
You can leave.



00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,340
Yes.



00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,960
Most of the wound has been recovered.



00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,840
The poison must have worked.



00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,720
Your Majesty, it’s not a trivial matter



00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,200
if someone really divulged
the message of your hunting



00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,540
to Liangguo.



00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,380
Please allow me to investigate it.



00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,440
I’ll find the mole as soon as possible.



00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,620
Thank you, Duke Nanping.



00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,680
Yes.



00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,960
Your Majesty, it seems that you’re still weak?



00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,040
The medical skill of the
imperial doctor isn’t good enough.



00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,960
How about summoning Saint Girl
of Saint Doctors’ Family here



00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,720
to examine you?



00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,220
Saint Girl?



00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
Jin Mi?



00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,420
She must not be involved.



00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,280
I feel much better.



00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
You don’t have to go through all this trouble.



00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,060
Your Majesty, you’re the foundation of Huaiwu.



00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,060
You can never take it lightly.



00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,060
Moreover, the mission of Saint Doctors’ Family



00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,680
is to make sure the good health of you.



00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,920
It’s proper



00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,400
to summon Saint Girl here now.



00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,280
Your Majesty, I think what
Duke Nanping said makes sense.



00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,500
I hope



00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,240
Your Majesty can summon
the Saint Girl here as soon as possible



00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,280
to nurse your health.



00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,760
I also agree.



00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,360
Duke Nanping acts quickly.



00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,720
He asked me for the imperial edict



00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
and sent for Saint Girl



00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,480
shortly after he advised to summon her.



00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,580
Qin Tong, pick several of your trusted subordinates



00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,580
to follow the men of Duke Nanping



00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,260
and make sure the safety of Saint Girl.



00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,260
I’ll protect Saint Girl?



00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,100
I won’t feel relieved if you don’t go there in person.



00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,820
I’m worried that



00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,660
someone really wants to kill you.



00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,060
Don’t worry.
I have a plan.



00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,220
I’ll get prepared now.



00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,860
Cousin, are you getting better?



00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,120
Much better.



00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,440
Yesterday I heard from Qin Tong that



00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,860
you were still weak,



00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,320
so I asked the senior pharmacist
in my mansion for advice



00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,660
and chose the best materials



00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,240
to stew a cup of decoction in person.



00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
It can alleviate your weakness and tiredness



00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Thank you.



00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,100
You know,



00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,500
I worried much about you recently.



00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,500
Leave the decoction.



00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,980
I’m tired after discussing
official business in the court today.



00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,020
I’m going to take a rest.



00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,860
Someone, keep the decoction.



00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,680
But…



00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,680
When will you look back at



00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,140
my love for you?



00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,820
Taste some grapes for me.



00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,140
It looks sweet.



00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,580
So sour.



00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,340
Liar.
You such a liar.



00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,860
"Saint Girl Hall"
Hurry up.



00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,360
"Saint Girl Hall"
What’s going on?



00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,140
"Saint Girl Hall"
Look. Have a look. What’s going on?



00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,620
"Saint Girl Hall"
What happened?



00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,580
I don’t know.



00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,880
What happened?



00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,720
It isn’t the day to hold a memorial ceremony today.



00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,140
Auntie looks serious.



00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,220
I said nothing.



00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,340
Did Auntie know



00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,020
we flew a kite secretly yesterday?



00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,620
I don’t know either.



00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,360
Saint Girl, do you why we come to Saint Girl Hall?



00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,140
I’m stupid. Please instruct me, Auntie.



00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,820
Tell me where the ginseng is.



00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,040
How come the ginseng is gone?



00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,780
If people from the capital didn’t ask me about it,



00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,440
the elders and I



00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,320
wouldn’t check the pharmacy



00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,360
and we wouldn’t find



00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,280
the ginseng is gone.



00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,260
The ginseng is kept by you.



00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,500
How come it’s gone?



00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,080
Well, er.



00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,260
Oh, no.



00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,180
I didn’t expect that I was caught so soon.



00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,020
Saint Girl, where is the ginseng?



00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,080
Auntie, Longevity Qiankun Elixir is prepared.



00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
What?



00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
But,



00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,560
but I took it.



00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,920
I was afraid that any mistake was made,



00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,980
so I took it for King Yi



00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
to have a test.



00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,240
How, how could you



00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,700
take such an important thing?



00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,320
Auntie, I took the liberty to take it



00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
without discussing with you and the elders



00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,120
in advance. Please punish me.



00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,400
Didn’t you know the ginseng
can’t be found within 1,000 years?



00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,360
Since you weren’t totally sure,



00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,940
how could you add the guiding drug easily?



00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,820
Auntie, I was not very well the day before yesterday



00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,820
and arbitrarily took away the medicine of Saint Girl.



00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,060
I thought it was common medicine



00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,060
and didn’t expect it is Longevity Qiankun Elixir.



00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,160
You…



00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,000
No, Auntie.



00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,000
It has nothing to do with Qiang Huo.



00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,360
She wanted to bear the blame for me.



00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,100
It was done by me alone.



00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,820
I’m willing to take the consequences.



00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,840
No. It’s my fault.



00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,380
No, Auntie.



00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,960
It’s my fault. It’s my fault. It isn’t Qiang Huo’s fault.



00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,940
You don’t have to protect me.



00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,920
Auntie, it’s my fault.



00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,200
Saint Girl. Auntie.



00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,220
King Yi issued an imperial edict summoning Saint Girl.
