1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 29"

3
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,120
It seems that it is providence.

4
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
What providence?

5
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Nothing. Nothing.

6
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

7
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,040
Nothing.

8
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,320
Why haven't returned to Heaven Realm yet?

9
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,400
With your brilliant scheme,

10
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,280
I had so much fun.

11
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
I can’t help but want to talk to you.

12
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,040
How did you come up with such a brilliant scheme?

13
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Experience is the best teacher.

14
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,030
Although

15
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,160
I have made matches for others for many years,

16
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,200
what I know about love

17
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
is purely theoretical.

18
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
And I have few chances to dig into it.

19
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
I really feel ashamed.

20
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,079
As for this aspect, it seems

21
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,960
I have to pick your brains.

22
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
No problem. No problem.

23
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,960
I have heard that
the osmanthus wine of a wine shop

24
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
is very tasty, which is very famous.

25
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,600
We may as well chat while drinking the wine.

26
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,079
Okay.

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,640
I think we are very congenial.

28
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,079
Let’s have a good chat tonight.

29
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
But

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,960
let me take a look at Xu Feng first.

31
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,880
He, he is busy with public affairs.

32
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,800
There’s nothing interesting about him.

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Besides, he is now a human being.

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
You can't talk to him.

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,520
It’s better to drink wine with me.

36
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,800
In the Human Realm,

37
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,120
night hours in spring are extremely precious.

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,360
No. No. No.

39
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,520
You are wrong, Yan You.

40
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,200
For human beings, the saying that
night hours in spring are extremely precious

41
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,080
is related to the spiritual practice.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,040
It’s not appropriate

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,160
to use this saying to describe us.

44
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
As for us, we should say

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,600
beautiful night hours.

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
Beautiful night hours.

48
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,680
Let’s go.

49
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,640
"Yunmeng Lake"

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,200
Young Lord.

51
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,680
You are getting more and more skilled.

52
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,400
You are still so boring.

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,650
You are so disobedient.

54
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,020
So disobedient.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,960
So disobedient.

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,000
You

57
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,560
You

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,200
So disobedient.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
So disobedient.

60
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,159
Why?

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Why?

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,040
You are so disobedient.

63
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,480
-So disobedient.
-Master, what are you doing?

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,920
Stand up.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,640
Li is still young. Keep cool.

66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
Do you think that I don't love him?

67
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
I provide him with
delicious food and decent clothes,

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,280
making him be a decent carp.

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,320
He just doesn’t want to.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,130
Instead, he wants to play in the mire.

71
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,130
Why?

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,630
Why? Why?

73
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,050
Why? Why?

74
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,300
Why?

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Why?

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,360
Go.

77
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,880
Li. Li.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,000
Li.

79
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
Promise me

80
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
you won’t play in the mire again.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Okay?

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Don’t fool me.

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,240
If you fool me, I will punish you severely.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,640
Got it?

85
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,410
Got it?

86
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,450
Got it?

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,160
Master,

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
let Li leave now.

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,440
I have something to report.

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,120
Okay?

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,000
Go.

92
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,960
On that day, you promised me

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
that you would take back
the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

94
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,640
Have you got it?

95
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
I’m incompetent.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
I couldn’t take back the
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
What did you promise me that day?

98
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,320
You said that you would
take back the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Why did you fool me?

100
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,600
You know that I hate being fooled by others.

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,880
I don’t dare to fool you, Master.

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,960
Maybe it’s providence.

103
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,080
Master, Xu Feng is completely innocent.

104
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
Innocent?

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Innocent?

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,280
He has a mother like that.

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
So he must pay for it.

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,320
I want his mother to feel the same pain

109
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,360
of losing a son.

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,720
Now that you don’t want to kill him,

111
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,440
I will do it by myself.

112
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,120
Tell me.

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
Where is the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,000
I’m going to take back the arrow

115
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,640
and kill Xu Feng with it.

116
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
Foster mother is going to be insane.

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,080
Tell me.

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,960
Where is the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

119
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,640
I know I was wrong.

120
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,200
I’m going to take it back now.

121
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,760
Will you really kill Xu Feng for me?

122
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,520
Stand up.

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Stand up.

124
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,800
I’ll believe you one more time.

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,159
If you let me down again,

126
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,159
I will punish you severely.

127
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
Remember.

128
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,720
You are a red carp from now on.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
You are no longer a little green snake.

130
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Got it, Li?

131
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
Call me mom.

132
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,040
Mom.

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Good boy.

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,040
You are a good boy, Li.

135
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,120
I will not let you suffer from injustice.

136
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,280
Okay?

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,240
Okay.

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
Good boy.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
You are a good boy, Li.

140
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,320
I got it.

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,640
Li.

142
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,720
That’s my boy.

143
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,000
I shouldn’t let her keep insane like this.

144
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,770
Duke Nanping Palace

145
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

146
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,160
The princess

147
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,600
hasn’t eaten anything yet?

148
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,480
Not yet.

149
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,280
You may go.

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,280
Yes, my Lord.

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
My dear.

152
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,280
You should eat something.

153
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,760
Seeing you act like this, I really feel distressed.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,760
Don’t worry.

155
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
I have listed that Puchi as wanted

156
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,440
in the whole city.

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,080
Tell me.

158
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,280
Do you want me to
have his body cut off piece by piece

159
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,880
or make him torn into pieces by horses？

160
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,280
You can't catch him.

161
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,640
You are complaining about my ineffectiveness.

162
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,600
I didn’t expect that

163
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,840
This Puchi is so cunning and shameless.

164
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,560
Maybe King Yi bought him off

165
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
and let him make such a drama.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
This matter has nothing to do with Xu Feng.

167
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
OK. OK. He is innocent.

168
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,600
Innocent.

169
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
These human beings are so foolish.

170
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Dear,

171
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
what on earth can I do

172
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
to make you happy?

173
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,560
At present, I can only rely on him
in the Human Realm.

174
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,760
Dad,

175
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,000
you must know what I want.

176
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
I know.

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,880
But I’m confused.

178
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,840
Why did you go with that Puchi and ask

179
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,280
King Yi to offer you two a marriage permission.

180
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,360
Now King Yi has decreed
the cancellation of your engagement.

181
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
This matter is completely settled.

182
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,880
What can I do?

183
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,720
I,

184
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,120
I’ll find a solution.

185
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,200
I’ll find a solution. OK?

186
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,600
Eat something first, OK?

187
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,880
Be good.

188
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
Have a seat.

189
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
Come and

190
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,320
bring the meal for the princess.

191
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,320
I won’t allow Sui He
to keep obsessed with King Yi like this.

192
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,040
Qi Chong,

193
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
send this letter to Liangguo.

194
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,160
The sooner the better.

195
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,440
Yes, my Lord.

196
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,720
You are not kind to me.
So don't blame me for being unjust.

197
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,640
You hurt Sui He’s feeling so much.

198
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,920
How I can spare you?

199
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
This time, Liangguo is going to send out troops.

200
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
When you go to fight in battle in person,

201
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,200
you’ll be dead.

202
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Your Majesty.

203
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,080
The Saint Girl is taking a nap.

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,080
She has been very tired in these days.

205
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
You may go back, Your Majesty.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Your Highness.

207
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
Xu Feng

208
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,640
made these phoenix lamps for Jin Mi.

209
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,600
I have something to ask you.

210
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
What a coincident!

211
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,680
I was going to look for you.

212
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,080
We can meet each other here now.

213
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,360
It seems that we are thinking about the same thing.

214
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,200
Tell me.

215
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,840
Why did you try to get Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

216
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,960
In addition,

217
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Rat Fairy has admitted

218
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,640
that it’s him who used
Magic Fireball to attack Xu Feng that day

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
and denied that you were his fellow.

220
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,760
But I guess

221
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
he was just providing cover for you. Right?

222
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,960
What’s your intention?

223
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,360
Your Highness,

224
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,480
could you please ask these questions one by one?

225
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,240
I’m overwhelmed by so many questions.

226
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,840
If you want to know all the answers,

227
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
then please go with me.

228
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
What? Are you afraid that I’ll fool you?

229
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
Since you can relate Magic Fireballs to me,

230
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
you should know that I won’t hurt you.

231
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,000
The answers you want

232
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,120
are under the Dongting Lake.

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,720
Don't you remember this place?

234
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
Should I remember it?

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,880
Don't you think this place is very familiar?

236
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,200
I do feel it’s familiar.

237
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,560
But,

238
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,000
but I’m feared

239
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
It seems that

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you still haven't be ready to uncover the mystery.

241
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Why

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
am I so flustered when approaching this place .

243
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,800
It’s OK.

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,560
If you don't want to go down there,
I won't force you.

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
However, although there is
no need to hurry at this moment.

246
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
it is not appropriate to put it off anymore.

247
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,040
If you are ready,

248
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,480
we will enter the bottom of the lake.

249
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,400
All the answers will be naturally revealed.

250
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,720
What did I do wrong?

251
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,960
Your Majesty, did you spoil the plan
and say something wrong a few days ago

252
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,720
when you drank wine to boost your courage

253
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
to express your affection?

254
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,800
Tell me.

255
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,200
If your wife is not happy,

256
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
what will you do to cheer her up?

257
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,000
Then I’ll decide how much unhappy she is first.

258
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,480
If she’s just a little unhappy,

259
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
then I’ll buy some
fresh stuff for her to make her happy.

260
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,160
If she’s very unhappy...

261
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,560
What will you do?

262
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,520
Then I’ll buy some stuff that are more expensive.

263
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,720
Do you think the Saint Girl is an ordinary girl?

264
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,680
No, I don’t dare to think so.

265
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,480
You may go.

266
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,320
I’m leaving now.

267
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Wait a minute.

268
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,280
Find me

269
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,560
the stuff that are both fresh and expensive.

270
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,080
Now that you still have feeling for me,

272
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,320
why are being so cruel ?

273
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,200
Liu Ying, we are on different tracks.

274
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,000
You’ll be better off without me.

275
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,640
You said you engraved this with my name.

276
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,000
You said you would never forget our past.

277
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Liar!

278
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,000
Your Highness.

279
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,040
You are back.

280
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,280
Kuang Lu,

281
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,720
do you remember the things
that happened in your childhood?

282
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,360
Of course.

283
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,040
What about things that made you sad?

284
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,400
There was nothing that made me sad.

285
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
Even if I felt sad at that time,

286
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,240
now I think

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,720
it’s actually not a big deal.

288
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,400
For fairies and immortals,

289
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,320
the most important thing is freedom and happiness.

290
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,440
You should think more
about things that make you happy.

291
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,560
If I can really be like you,

292
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,200
it will be a good thing.

293
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Your Highness.

294
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,920
Do you recall something that makes you sad?

295
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,960
Everyone has his or her troubles.

296
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,960
Time is like the prayer beads
that are made from troubles.

297
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,320
Optimistic people

298
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,880
count the beads with smile.

299
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,400
Although we may meet some setbacks,

300
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
we should confront them calmly.

301
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,400
Only in this way can we welcome the bright future.

302
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Kuang Lu,

303
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
can you

304
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,200
go with me to the Dongting Lake?

305
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Dongting Lake?

306
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,800
Your Highness. Wherever you go,

307
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,920
I’ll be with you.

308
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,080
What a beautiful place!

309
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,400
Why did you think of coming here, Your Highness?

310
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,560
In this place,

311
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,880
there may be the past that I wanna face.

312
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,320
You are not a red carp.

313
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,600
You are not qualified to play with us.

314
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,320
Go. Go. Go.

315
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
A monster with horns on head.

316
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,920
Go.

317
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Go.

318
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,960
Leave Lize Pond right now.

319
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,760
Your Highness.

320
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,880
Your Highness.

321
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,040
Did you recall something?

322
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,360
You seems to be very familiar with Dongting Lake.

323
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,560
Let's go.

324
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,440
No, please.

325
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,680
Mom, please.

326
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,600
No, please.

327
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,200
Li.

328
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,360
No. No. Li.

329
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,960
Cut the horns,

330
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,840
and you will be just like them.

331
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,040
Mom, please.

332
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
No. No.

333
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,440
Mom.

334
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,880
Mom.

335
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Mom, please.

336
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,240
No.

337
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,080
Your Highness.

338
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,280
Are you okay?

339
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,440
Be good.

340
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,200
Mom, please don’t...

341
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,320
Are you okay?

342
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,160
I’m OK.

343
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,320
"Yunmeng Pond"

344
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,350
Yunmeng Pond.

345
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,120
This name is quite nice.

346
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,650
"Lize Pond"

347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,190
Li.

348
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,820
Li.

349
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,040
Go play with your friends.

350
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,720
Tell them

351
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,600
that you are a red carp.

352
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
You are not a little loong.

353
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:30,960
Go.

354
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,080
Go.

355
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,920
Your Highness.

356
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Your Highness.

357
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,560
What happened?

358
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,160
Yunmeng Pond

359
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
Is it not Lize Pond?

360
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,960
Your Highness.

361
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,440
You are here finally.

362
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,000
Please.

363
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,280
Master, Night Immortal wants to meet you.

364
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,640
Lord Dongting.

365
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,560
Please accept my courtesy.

366
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,320
Why do you give me such a big courtesy,
Mister Immortal?

367
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,160
I can’t afford it.

368
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,200
I just do what I should do.
You deserve it, Miss Immortal.

369
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
I have some confusions.

370
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,320
I’m here to ask for your enlightenment.

371
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,320
I have stayed here for long time,

372
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
isolated from the outside world.

373
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,360
I’m afraid I can’t help you.

374
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,480
Recently, I got a piece of painting.

375
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
I heard that Lord Dongting is well-informed.

376
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,080
So I’m here to appreciate it with you.

377
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,440
Mom.

378
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,160
Could you please leave me and Lord Dongting alone?

379
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,200
I know little about paintings.

380
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

381
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,560
It’s OK.

382
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,440
Then let me interpret this painting for you.

383
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,640
In this painting, the string of Magic Fireballs
on the woman's wrist

384
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,400
is a very precious treasure in the Heavenly Realm.

385
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,240
There are only two strings of them in the world.

386
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,440
Another string

387
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,280
was given by Heavenly Emperor
to the Heavenly Empress as a gift on their wedding day.

388
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,760
So the relationship between
the woman in the painting and the Heavenly Emperor

389
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,800
must be very close.

390
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,720
Suddenly a beauty derived from
a red shark bead appears with the sound "susu";

391
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,760
I will never ever let her leave.

392
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,520
This poem conveys the pledge of one's eteranl love,

393
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,360
which is full of affection.

394
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,320
The two words at the end of the two lines
can be combined to the name Su Li.

395
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,840
The signature seal belongs to Lord Beichen,

396
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,600
which is the nickname of the Heavenly Emperor
that he called himself when he was young.

397
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,160
He only called himself this name
in front of the ones who are very close to him.

398
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,240
Few people know this name.

399
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,160
For whom would Heavenly Emperor draw the portrait?

400
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,240
For whom would he write a poem

401
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,040
to express his affection with his nickname signature?

402
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,920
What’s more,

403
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,200
when Rat Fairy was in trial

404
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,680
and he repeatedly mentioned the name of Su Li,

405
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,160
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress looked very queer.

406
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
Heavenly Empress is a jealous woman.

407
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,880
The relationship between
Fairy Su Li and the Heavenly Emperor

408
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,120
is very evident.

409
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,960
I have studied hard at the Xingjing Court since my childhood.

410
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,520
I can remember all the anecdotes of the people
in the six realms that are mentioned in the books.

411
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,960
Only the name Su Li seems familiar

412
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,120
but leaves no impression on me.

413
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,320
It’s just like my childhood memories,

414
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
which vanished completely.

415
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,040
It seems that

416
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Fairy Su Li

417
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
is an old acquaintance

418
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,520
who was very important to me in my childhood.

419
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,800
Someone deliberately erased my childhood memories.

420
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,560
I forget all those things,

421
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,120
including this person

422
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,520
and this name.

423
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,000
Mister Immortal, your ability to think much

424
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
and to imagine

425
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,320
is so amazing.

426
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
Am I really thinking too much?

427
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,000
Heavenly Emperor is from Loong Family,
and he practices fire-related magics.

428
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,960
I’m from Loong Family, too.

429
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,080
But I practice water-related magics.

430
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,520
So it can be inferred that

431
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,120
my biological mother must come from Water Family.

432
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,480
Fairy Su Li in this painting

433
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,120
is treading on the wave and catching fish.

434
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,840
So she’s very likely to be a member of Water Family.

435
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,080
And the shark beads mentioned in the poem

436
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,440
are derived from the tears of mermaids.

437
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,040
Coincidentally,

438
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,480
I also have a string of shark beads.

439
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,760
It has been with me since my childhood.

440
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,360
I have always kept it with me.

441
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,600
Su Li has been dead.

442
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
Why do you

443
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,480
keep talking about a dead person?

444
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,600
That day, Rat Fairy chose to die.

445
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
Seemingly he had planned to

446
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
take revenge for the dead Fairy Su Li.

447
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,240
And he did drive a wedge
between Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress

448
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,320
and cause destruction to Bird Family.

449
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,800
But as far as I’m concerned,

450
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,080
this scheme was short of orderliness and foresight.

451
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,000
which couldn’t destroy Bird Family radically.

452
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,200
It’s more like an act of escaping running into danger

453
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,480
at the expense of Rat Fairy’s life.

454
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,280
In the final analysis,

455
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,280
the only reasonable explanation is that

456
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,840
Su Li is not dead.

457
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,680
She’s alive.

458
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
And she is the person behind the scenes,

459
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,280
saving power secretly

460
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
and scheming

461
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,080
against Heavenly Realm again and again.

462
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,440
My son has finally grown up.

463
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,440
I have always heard that
Night Immortal is extremely smart.

464
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,360
Now I know that you are really very smart.

465
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,680
With only a piece of painting,

466
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
you can make a careful investigation

467
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,000
and make so many inferences.

468
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
So

469
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,440
is what I said true or not?

470
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,000
Inferences are just inferences.

471
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,920
You are a prince.

472
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,560
Your parents,
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress...

473
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,000
Heavenly Empress is not my biological mother.

474
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,880
Just because I am
the eldest son of Heavenly Emperor

475
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,960
she does everything possible to

476
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,640
take complete control over me.

477
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,760
During the thousands of years,

478
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,280
I have always

479
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,040
missed my biological mother.

480
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,320
You may go, Mister Immortal.

481
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,080
Your mother has died

482
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,240
in the fire that happened in Lize Pond that year.

483
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
I thought

484
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
my mother did love me.

485
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
She had to give me up

486
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,920
under the unfavorable situation.

487
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,160
I know who the person in the painting is

488
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,520
and the meaning conveyed by the poems.

489
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,880
But I didn’t expect that

490
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,560
my biological mother, who I miss everyday

491
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
would keep a distance from me,

492
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,560
seeing me as a stranger.

493
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,720
Is it because I’m too self-sentimental

494
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
or you are too heartless?

495
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,000
How is it possible that I don’t love you?

496
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,080
But I have walked on a road with no way back.

497
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,800
There is no end to troubles.

498
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,880
Why are you so obsessed with this matter?

499
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,800
Now you have another child
to accompany you and make you happy.

500
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
I don’t want to badger you.

501
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,040
I just want to ask you a question.

502
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,160
If I am really a shame for you,

503
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,560
why did you insist on giving birth to me?

504
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,360
If you and father were in love with each other,

505
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,880
why did you torture me

506
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,560
and abandon me?

507
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,040
This scar is caused by your Magic Fireball.

508
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,720
This is the scar left

509
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,320
after you cut my scales.

510
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,800
Scales have grown on other parts of my skin.

511
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
Only this forbidden lamella

512
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,240
has become my lifelong wound

513
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,600
and pain.

514
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,240
Everyone knows

515
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,200
the forbidden lamella of a loong is untouchable.

516
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,920
I really can't imagine

517
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,800
what kind of hatred

518
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,400
would make you do this to me, your child.

519
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,640
Stop.

520
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Stop, please.

521
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,960
Go away.

522
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,680
Go away.

523
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,880
Go away.

524
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,440
The one who gave birth to me,

525
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,639
destroyed me

526
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
and abandoned me

527
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,800
is my mother.

528
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,880
I get hurt both physically and mentally.

529
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,159
I’m scarred.

530
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,600
It’s because of you.

531
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,480
Today, I worship you one more time

532
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,960
to repay you for giving birth to me.

533
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I am not your mother.

534
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,719
You are not my son.

535
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
I am not your mother.

536
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,280
Go away.

537
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,080
Go away.

538
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,600
Li.

539
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,840
Li.

540
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,640
Li.

541
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,280
Li.

542
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,120
Li.

543
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,400
Li.

544
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,400
Li.

545
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,240
Li.

546
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,560
"Beiyuan Villa"

547
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,280
Your Majesty, don’t you like these?

548
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,360
You don’t like these, either.
