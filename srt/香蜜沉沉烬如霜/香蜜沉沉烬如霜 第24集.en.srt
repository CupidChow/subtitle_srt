"Episode 24"

3
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,780
Who are you?

4
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,340
Why did you use your power to save me?

5
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Stop!

6
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,700
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow!

7
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,620
Mu Ci.

8
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,000
Your Highness, you got the wrong person.

9
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,360
Can you show me your face then?

10
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:41,360
We are just strangers, we don't have to meet.

11
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,540
Well, why are you carrying
the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

12
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,500
And why do you sneak into the Beiyuan Villa?

13
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,180
Your target is Xu Feng, isn't it?

14
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,480
Do you know the consequences
of perishing his primordial spirit?

15
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,020
Mu Ci, I know it's you.

16
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,900
You just made the same moves as before.

17
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,400
Your Highness, you should just take care of yourself.

18
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,740
Mu Ciâ€¦

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Mu Ci, please show up.

20
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,160
Mu Ci, please show up.

21
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,460
Come out and see me.

22
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,760
Why do you pretend not to know me?

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,640
How could it be?
How?

24
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,440
You gave my memory back to me!

25
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,140
Mu Ci.

26
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,080
Give it back to me!

27
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,560
Why did you ask me to come here?

28
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,840
You sent me a gift that I liked so much.

29
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,660
I should certainly return a gift.

30
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,300
Look!

31
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,600
A heart!

32
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,800
Now I give my heart to you,

33
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,640
you should keep it well.

34
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,380
Sure.

35
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
I promise you.

36
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll wear it where it's closest to my heart

37
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,920
until the last moment of my life, okay?

38
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,800
Sorry!

39
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,780
I broke my promise.

40
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,040
"Beiyuan Villa"

41
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,660
My Majesty, what is your discomfort today?

42
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,680
I feel dyspnea and shortness of breath.

43
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
His pulse shows that

44
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,380
he has smooth breaths.

45
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,320
What's there to diagnose?

46
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
If Your Majesty feels dyspnea
and shortness of breath,

47
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,620
I'll go prepare a piece of tonic medicine

48
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,640
to replenish your heart and lungs.

49
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm sure

50
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,780
you can breathe smoothly after taking it.

51
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,800
Apart from the feeling of dyspnea
and shortness of breath,

52
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,900
I also have a splitting headache today.

53
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,560
Why do you trouble me again?

54
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,280
There's no problem with the pulse.

55
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,900
What's there to diagnose?

56
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,300
Your Majesty has been worrying
too much over the state affairs for days.

57
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,760
So I'll prepare a tranquilizer.

58
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm sure it'll relieve your headache.

59
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,120
Apart from the feeling of dyspnea
and shortness of breath,

60
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,260
and a splitting headache,
I also have bad appetites

61
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,040
and lost sleep.

62
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,620
Why do you give me a tough task every day?

63
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,060
The pulse is quite good.

64
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,500
What's there to diagnose?

65
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Your Majesty, when did these symptoms started?

66
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,220
And how long have they lasted?

67
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,520
It's always like this when you're gone,

68
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,320
and seeing you will ease it a little bit.

69
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,740
I heard the Saint Doctors' Family
has the medical skill

70
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
that is second to none.

71
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,600
As the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family,

72
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,760
you've already come here for a couple of days.

73
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,140
But you haven't yet diagnosed what disease I have,

74
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,200
and just fool me with some useless medicine.

75
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,140
Don't you feel ashamed?

76
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,420
Please forgive me for my disability.

77
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,700
Your Majesty, please give me some more time.

78
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,720
I will surely cure your illness.

79
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,919
Couldn't King Yi have got lovesick?

80
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,080
How could it be?

81
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,500
King Yi has never seen

82
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,620
my face!

83
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,380
If he's got lovesick, he loves someone else.

84
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,380
That's right.

85
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,340
Guess what,

86
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,380
could it be that His Majesty has got sick

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,500
because of missing somebody?

88
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,940
As I said, you didn't get
the essence when learning.

89
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,100
Well, tell me

90
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,840
which medical book has mentioned lovesick?

91
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,060
Go, go, go, and get me the book.

92
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,480
If we fail to cure His Majesty,

93
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,960
we both have to be implicated.

94
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,400
I see.

95
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,180
Go quickly!

96
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,060
Lovesick?

97
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,020
"Beiyuan Villa"

98
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,660
I heard that these days

99
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,460
His Majesty always called in

100
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,760
that Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family.

101
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,200
And she stayed in there for quite a while.

102
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,120
In the past, if Princess Sui He came,

103
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,480
His Majesty used to send her
away with just a few words.

104
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Looks like His Majesty treats
the Saint Girl quite differently.

105
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,320
That's it.

106
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,660
His Majesty has a heart for the Saint Girl.

107
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,880
You see, the tributary fresh fruits

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,460
were recently sent to the Saint Girl every day.

109
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,460
Could it be that His Majesty loves the Saint Girl?

110
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,780
It's the Beiyuan Villa here.

111
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,540
There are some words we can't speak.

112
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,260
Let's go.

113
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,760
Saint Girl,

114
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,140
this is from Duke Nanping.

115
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,600
He hopes Saint Girl

116
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,260
can answer the questions well.

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,320
At this time after five days,

118
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,160
I'll come and pick up the letter of reply.

119
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,180
What are you thinking of?

120
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,620
It's you, Qiang Huo!

121
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,760
I wasn't thinking of anything?

122
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,300
Jin Mi, according to your observation,

123
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,140
is the life of His Majesty in danger?

124
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,800
If so,

125
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,880
why don't we go back early?

126
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,140
Although the life of His Majesty isn't in danger,

127
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,940
he does have different physical discomforts.

128
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,380
Now that we're here,

129
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,040
how can we return without curing him?

130
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,800
If we fail to diagnose his symptoms,

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,880
we'll disgrace our Saint Doctors' Family, aren't we?

132
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,480
Besides,

133
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
if he doesn't get well,

134
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm going to be buried with him sooner or later.

135
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,320
Am I right?

136
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
You mean cousin often calls in
the Saint Girl to his bedroom.

137
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,200
and she stayed there for quite a while.

138
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,920
All the people in the mansion said that

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,140
His Majesty cares a lot for the Saint Girl.

140
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,140
and treats her differently.

141
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,920
Cousin has a physical malaise these days

142
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,680
and the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family

143
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,000
has the top-notch medical skill,

144
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,240
there's no harm for her to stay long there

145
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,180
as she is devoted to cure him.

146
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,340
Don't guess blindly like others.

147
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,340
Yes.

148
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,080
Well, do you know the name of the Saint Girl?

149
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,680
She's called Jin Mi.

150
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,680
Jin Mi.

151
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,680
As I see, Your Majesty has
a good appetite these two days.

152
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,620
That's true.

153
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,660
But I don't let Jin...

154
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,980
don't let the Saint Girl know it.

155
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,360
Otherwise our efforts will be in vain.

156
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,720
Speaking of the Saint Girl,

157
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,020
she didn't have a bite of the food

158
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,800
we sent there these two days.

159
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
Were the dishes not delicious?

160
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,980
According to the maid, the Saint Girl is sick.

161
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,020
So the summon of Your Majesty today...

162
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm afraid she can't make it.

163
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

164
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
The wind was so strong that day,

165
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,940
I told you not to sit in the yard that long.

166
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,200
but you didn't listen to me, did you?

167
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,560
Come on, take the medicine and you'll get better.

168
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,420
My respects...

169
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,300
How did you get sick?

170
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,760
Your Majesty, the Saint Girl
is just infected with the wind chill.

171
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,680
She will be fine after taking
the medicine and rest for two days.

172
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,480
There'll be no big deal.

173
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,700
It's been two days.

174
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,980
Why haven't she got well?

175
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,140
You're also from Saint Doctors' Family, aren't you?

176
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,520
Why can't you cure a minor illness like this?

177
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,660
Why does His Majesty get so angry?

178
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,140
Is he angry for I can't go see him?

179
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,040
But his energy is

180
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,260
really great today.

181
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,660
Take your leave.

182
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes.

183
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,900
Your Majesty, my...my...

184
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,240
There's no need.

185
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,420
I allow you not to greet me from now on.

186
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,380
So handsome and so gentle!

187
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,020
The future queen has a great blessing.

188
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,220
I can do it myself.

189
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,040
My grapes

190
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,620
are all sweet.

191
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,960
Xu Feng, I have given way to you since childhood.

192
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,660
But for Jin Mi,

193
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,280
I won't give in.

194
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,020
Jin Mi...

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,660
I don't know what background the Saint Girl has.

196
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,120
Who are you?

197
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,920
My respects, Princess Sui He.

198
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,600
Princess

199
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,600
Heavenly Empress asked me

200
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,580
to unseal the immortal memories of your Highness.

201
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,720
What immortal memories?

202
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,240
What the hell are you talking about?

203
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,380
Sorry to offense.

204
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,960
You...

205
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,300
Don't come over here. Don't come over.

206
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,480
Do you know who my cousin is?

207
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,280
How dare you! I'll kill you.

208
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
This is supposed to be the Spirit-Vanishing
Arrow my foster mother mentioned.

209
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,860
Who the hell is he?

210
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,320
He's so hard to deal with.

211
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:27,330
"Beiyuan Villa"

212
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,240
Qiang Huo, why do you get up so early?

213
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,080
Your Majesty!

214
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,700
Has your wind cold healed?

215
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,960
I am still waiting for

216
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,920
your diagnosis and treatment.

217
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,440
I have recovered.

218
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,560
Sorry to let you worry.

219
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,760
Your Majesty, do you still have the
feeling of dyspnea and shortness of breath,

220
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,100
splitting headache or other discomforts these days?

221
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,140
Why don't you make another diagnosis on me?

222
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,980
Smile so warm like the spring breeze.

223
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,160
He should be in a good mood today.

224
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,180
Yesterday, he came here with
jubilant strides and rosy complexion.

225
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,500
And now his breath is even and his face radiant.

226
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,940
It's completely unlike what he said.

227
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,240
He is not that weak.

228
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,800
Please forgive me for my disability.

229
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,000
The pulse of Your Majesty is strong and steady.

230
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,940
I said earlier that I felt dyspnea and
shortness of breath, splitting headache,

231
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,660
bad appetites and sleep.

232
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,800
Although it is a little bit exaggerated,

233
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,540
these symptoms

234
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,220
were truly what I felt.

235
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,320
As the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family,

236
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,280
you don't know what the symptoms are.

237
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,560
Your Majesty, I...

238
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,890
You're not experienced.

239
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,310
I can't blame it on you.

240
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,060
My disease shouldnâ€™t have been recorded

241
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,100
in the ordinary medical books.

242
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,620
Your Majesty, as far as I know,

243
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,280
your pulse

244
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,480
indicates

245
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,200
the sick of love?

246
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
You... you already figured it out?

247
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,660
Yes.

248
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,040
It seems

249
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,960
that girl is the right medicine of Your Majesty.

250
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,060
Let me ask you,

251
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,060
You want me to be sick

252
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,300
or healthy?

253
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,320
What do you mean by that, Your Majesty?

254
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,820
I certainly hope Your Majesty is healthy

255
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,120
and enjoys longevity.

256
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,920
Come on, here comes the freshly ground sesame paste.

257
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,760
So sweet-smelling...

258
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,340
I didn't know Your Majesty is here.

259
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,180
Please forgive my rudeness.

260
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,440
Qiang Huo?

261
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,780
Why is it so familiar to me?

262
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,060
So I suggest

263
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,000
Your Majesty can try a herb, Qiang Huo.

264
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,940
Qiang Huo?

265
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,120
Exactly.

266
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,000
Apart from dispelling coldness,
eliminating wind and cold,

267
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,700
this medicine can also cure Yang...

268
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,940
this medicine can also cure your

269
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,820
kidney deficiency.

270
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,640
Well, the Lantern Festival is coming in a few days,

271
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,300
I'd like to ask you what kind of lantern you like.

272
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
The phoenix lantern.

273
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,880
Mu Ci.

274
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,720
Mu Ci.

275
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,900
What's wrong?

276
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,040
What's wrong?

277
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,900
What's going on?

278
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,080
What's going on?

279
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,080
Your Highness!

280
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,360
Jump over here.

281
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,260
Damn, this is the Nether Fury.

282
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,420
Your Highness!

283
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,240
Mu Ci.

284
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,920
Mu Ci.

285
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,050
Wangchuan River gathers
grievances and resentments,

286
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,760
even the immortals and demons fear it.

287
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,980
Your Highness, you go first!

288
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,340
Mu Ci, don't force yourself to confront it.

289
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,800
You'll receive a countercharge.

290
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,580
Mu Ci.

291
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,140
Mu Ci.

292
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,760
Mu Ci.

293
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,540
Your Highness, go quickly!

294
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,380
Mu Ci.

295
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,640
Mu Ci.

296
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,640
What the hell happened back then?

297
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,200
Why don't you want to recognize me?

298
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,160
Since we came here,

299
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,220
you've been gloomy with worry and sadness.

300
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,160
What happened?

301
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,940
Nothing.

302
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,640
Perhaps, it's because I'm a bit acclimatized.

303
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,240
I see that His Majesty is energetic,

304
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,640
he doesn't look like a sick person.

305
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,500
Why don't we go back to Saint Doctors' Family?

306
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,900
The mission of our Saint Doctors' Family

307
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
is to ensure the health of His Majesty.

308
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,160
Now His Majesty himself has not said heâ€™s recovered.

309
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,680
How can we leave without permission?

310
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,380
You can't, or you don't want to?

311
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,880
I'm the Saint Girl, and I'll undertake it.

312
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,860
Saint Girl...

313
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,600
I hope you can remember that.

314
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,340
What's wrong with you today?

315
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm fine.

316
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,620
What am I going to do?

317
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,860
Crow, Duke Nanping...

318
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,140
Who should I choose?

319
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,380
Have you heard anything from the Saint Girl?

320
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,200
My lord, there's no news.

321
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,440
Looks like she didn't know what I am capable of.

322
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,160
It's time to exert some pressure on her.

323
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
"Beiyuan Villa"

324
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
Who are you?

325
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,220
Are you all right?
Did you get hurt?

326
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,380
I'm fine.

327
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,840
Thank you, Immortal Run Yu.

328
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,440
That was close.

329
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,540
If it weren't for your show-up,

330
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,700
my little life was just over there.

331
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,200
Have you offended anybody?

332
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,580
I've been in contact with very few people

333
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
as I grew up,

334
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,220
let alone offend someone.

335
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,040
Would it be Duke Nanping?

336
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,140
But he just sent a letter hours ago,

337
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
and wanna kill me so soon.

338
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,240
It's irrational.

339
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,560
That arrow was weird.

340
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,100
It's absolutely not a weapon a mortal should have.

341
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,460
It seems...

342
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,280
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

343
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,140
What a nice piece of fish scale!

344
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,000
It's a piece of dragon scale.

345
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,800
Dragon scale?

346
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,540
It's for you.
If you want to see me,

347
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,700
just say the dragon-summon spell.

348
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,680
Dragon-summon spell?

349
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,720
Thank you, Immortal Run Yu.

350
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,320
So fragrant.

351
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,560
It smells a bit like ambergris.

352
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,600
But better than that.

353
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,900
It's cool and sweet,

354
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,360
exactly like your body scent.

355
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,100
I wonder if I could use it as a guiding drug.

356
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,520
It's the only piece.

357
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
It's a pity if it's used as medicine.

358
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm kidding.

359
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,120
You give me such a precious thing,

360
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,500
I'll sure keep it good and keep it safe.

361
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,180
There was once a fairy

362
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,560
who promised to appreciate the epiphyllum with me.

363
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,860
But then for a variety of reasons,

364
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,100
she failed to make it.

365
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,920
Ten days later, the flower will bloom again.

366
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,260
I wonder if I could invite you

367
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,880
to appreciate it with me.

368
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,300
You saved my life, gave me the dragon scale,

369
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,920
and invited me to appreciate the flower.

370
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,940
That's very kind of you, Immortal Run Yu.

371
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,360
But this makes me embarrassed.

372
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,640
If you are happy to take it,

373
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,880
I will be contented.

374
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,200
You are neither relative nor friend to me,

375
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,380
how can I have the cheek to receive it?

376
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,920
Though I have no valuables,

377
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,600
if you have any wishes,

378
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,300
just tell me and I'm sure
I'll do whatever I can to make it.

379
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,400
Well...

380
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,880
can you make wine?

381
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,540
Make...make wine?

382
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,520
I have a friend who always says

383
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,640
"Appreciate the flowers and drink the wine;

384
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,420
Itâ€™s so pleasant that you'll be reluctant to return home."

385
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,780
Fine, fine. Iâ€™m on that.

386
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,320
Looks like your old friend

387
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,580
is pretty interesting.

388
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,630
Tonight the sky has lost its brilliance

389
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,760
since your Highness failed to
arrange the stars in the sky.

390
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,220
It's so boring.

391
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,640
Your Highness.

392
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,880
Please take a seat.

393
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,820
In the huge Heaven Realm, the only one who knows

394
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,560
I am absent would be you.

395
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,300
You descend to the mortal world in the deep night,

396
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,139
I'm afraid it's not just about for Zen meditation.

397
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,000
Itâ€™s not that simple, isnâ€™t it?

398
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,080
I dare not say an insinuating word
before your Highness.

399
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,719
This time, Fairy Jin Mi experiences
her inexorable doom.

400
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,940
His Majesty ordered that no fairies and immortals

401
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,540
shall intervene.

402
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,020
Your Highness, you went a little over this time.

403
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,739
My father sent you to take care of Jin Mi,

404
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,960
but just now Jin Mi was close to lose her life.

405
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,460
I think you must have also seen
through the mortal world-viewing mirror

406
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,000
that the murderer was not a mortal.

407
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,900
I wonder how can you

408
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,920
afford to bear the delinquency of lack of care.

409
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,000
Essentially,

410
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,040
how dare I violate the order of my father!

411
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,440
You also have your difficulty,

412
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,200
I don't want to delve into it.

413
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,020
Just the tree desires stillness
but the wind will not cease.

414
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,020
I wanted to make concessions to avoid trouble,

415
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,120
but some people are just trying to be malicious.

416
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,760
Ultimately,

417
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,540
Jin Mi is my fiancÃ©e.

418
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,240
If something happens to her,

419
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,560
then even my word does not carry much weight,

420
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,560
I will never sit idly by.

421
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,180
Even it stirs up trouble in
the Empyrean Cloud Palace,

422
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,440
I won't fear at all.

423
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,620
Your Highness, you take it too seriously.

424
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,120
No one dares to harm the
heavenly consort of your Highness.

425
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,270
What's more, it is Heavenly Emperor's order,

426
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,560
I'll surely do with all my heart.

427
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,040
Well, that's the best way to say it.

428
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
And my final reminder,

429
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,840
Jin Mi is not only my fiancÃ©e,

430
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,860
she is also the daughter of the
former Floral Immortal and the Water Immortal.

431
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,700
Even His Majesty regards her with special concern.

432
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,740
Straightly speaking, the experience of inexorable doom

433
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,380
is only to

434
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,260
make an exception to
grant Jin Mi the Floral Immortal.

435
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,320
Just the motions to go through.

436
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,620
In case anything happens to the next Floral Immortal,

437
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,080
His Majesty will be sure to strictly investigate it.

438
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Who do you think

439
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,500
will be the scapegoat?

440
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,740
By that time,

441
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,460
who will stand out

442
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,200
and keep you safe.

443
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,700
You're wise.

444
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,140
You should have the right answer

445
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,680
for which eye to open and which to close.

446
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,500
It's so late, you can leave now.

447
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,700
"Palace of Duke Nanping"
It's not far from the front.

448
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,860
Father,

449
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,980
Our respects, your Highness.

450
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,600
Sui, you're here.

451
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,660
Good.

452
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,820
You can leave now.

453
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,420
Yes.

454
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,360
Father.

455
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,180
Your father and Minister Fu,

456
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,660
which is more magnanimous?

457
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,720
Naturally, my father is.

458
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,420
How can Minister Fu compare with my father?

459
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,380
How about His Majesty?

460
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,200
My fatherâ€™s absolutely perfect when he was young.

461
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,480
My cousin was not born yet.

462
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,300
In my heart,

463
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,880
my father is always the best father in the world,

464
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,540
with imposing appearance and graceful bearing.

465
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,000
What a sweet heart you are!

466
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,660
You're so smart.

467
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,360
I don't know which guy will be so much blessed

468
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,340
to marry you in the future.

469
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,740
I'm afraid I'll envy him to death.

470
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,460
Father, you said that again.

471
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,120
In the big Huaiwu,

472
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,100
the one who will make me willing to cook for him

473
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
will be nobody else.

474
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,020
Father, are you going to envy my cousin?

475
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,760
You're talking about your cousin all the time.

476
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,560
Girls truly have outward hearts.

477
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,520
My daughter,

478
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,600
I raised you for His Majesty.

479
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,820
What are you talking about, father?

480
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,560
Isn't it okay if I don't get marry?

481
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,400
Marquis.

482
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,120
This is the golden snow bird's nest
that her Highness cooked for you.

483
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,460
Since father thought I have an outward heart,

484
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,300
then father would better not
eat the golden snow bird's nest

485
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,440
I cooked for you specially.

486
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,860
No one is allowed to rob what my daughter gives me.

487
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,320
Just take your time.

488
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,920
You forgot the way of keeping good health again.

489
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,720
How does it taste?

490
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,040
Great!

491
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,100
It's carefully prepared by my beloved daughter,
how could it be not good?

492
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,980
The best taste in the world is nothing more than this.

493
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,520
It was decided yesterday that we would
discuss the affairs from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. today.

494
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,680
But it's noon now.
His Majesty is always punctual.

495
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,880
Is it possible that

496
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,960
the rumor is true that

497
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,080
His Majesty has got some unmentionable disease.

498
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,880
That's groundless statement.

499
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,140
You donâ€™t need to worry.

500
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,040
Lord, when hunting in Luoye Mountain,

501
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,320
did anything happen to His Majesty?

502
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,960
I heard there was a Liangguo troop in ambush...

503
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,440
Minister Fu, you and me are servants to His Majesty.

504
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,000
We shall only exert all our strengths
and be loyal to His Majesty.

505
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,270
It could be a mess outside the court
and among the lower officials

506
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,400
that doesn't matter.

507
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,960
However, we can't mess up.

508
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,480
Send the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family quickly!

509
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:08,840
Yes.

510
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,880
General Qin

511
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,860
what's wrong with His Majesty?

512
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,420
His Majesty doesn't feel well, please go back.

513
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,360
Minister, please wait.

514
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,140
Get out of the way!

515
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,600
-Your Majesty
-Your Majesty
