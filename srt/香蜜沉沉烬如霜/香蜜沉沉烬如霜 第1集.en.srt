1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 01"

3
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
My order

4
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,370
From today

5
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,060
Nobody is allowed to tell about me giving birth to my baby.

6
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,480
Anyone who talks about this will die

7
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,730
his soul will be destroyed

8
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,590
Yes, My Lord.

9
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,980
As you wish, my Lord.

10
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,480
We will destroy our own soul if we break our word

11
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,560
Please let her take this pill.

12
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,220
It's Yun Elixir.

13
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,480
Anyone who takes this will not fall in love and get hurt

14
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,980
My Lord.

15
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,570
A relationship can make people suffer and lose freedom.

16
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,980
Without falling in love, one can be strong and be at peace.

17
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,120
This is the best gift I can give her.

18
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,560
My baby girl should not be like me

19
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,260
suffering from deep love and regrets.

20
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,370
The excellent Water Immortal, Luo Lin,

21
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,520
and the virtuous Wind Immortal, Lin Xiu,

22
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
you are a good match

23
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,180
I'm afraid that within the universe, it is no longer possible to find such a happy marriage.

24
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,990
Drink this cup of wine

25
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,040
I wish you a lifetime of love and happiness.

26
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,980
Hope you can work together

27
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,780
to help the Emperor from now

28
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,500
If you later give birth to a baby boy

29
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,120
I would like my first son to be brothers with him.

30
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,270
If you later give birth to a baby girl,

31
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,100
I would like my first son to be betrothed to her.

32
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,580
I hope our friendship will be passed down to the next generations,

33
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,410
what a great thing!

34
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,650
What do you think of my suggestion?

35
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,140
That is definitely great.

36
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Zi Fen,

37
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,260
The Emperor's order is irreversible.

38
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
I have no choice

39
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,580
But what about us?

40
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,730
But my heart is only for you

41
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,180
Nothing can change my love for you

42
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,460
I just hope you can find eternal peace in floral blossom

43
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,060
Have a peaceful life like water and the clouds

44
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
I want to name her Jin Mi

45
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,640
Yes, my lord.

46
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,210
Congratulations for the birth of our young goddess Jin Mi

47
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
No more congratulations

48
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,010
After I pass away

49
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,470
I don't want Jin Mi to be the Flower Deity like me.

50
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,540
I want her to live a simple life

51
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,840
Your highness, please reconsider.

52
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,360
How can the Floral Realm have no Goddess

53
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
I've decided.

54
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,670
After I die,

55
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,450
You all take your place

56
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
to be in charge of the Flower Palace.

57
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Follow the order of the four seasons

58
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
take your responsibilities

59
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,150
Your highness, we will follow your order.

60
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,940
I foresee that

61
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,400
my baby girl will have a tragedy

62
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,260
within the following 10000 years.

63
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,900
Even though she has taken the pill, I am still worried.

64
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,570
My order,

65
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,900
From today forth, Jin Mi is forbidden to go out of the Flower Palace.

66
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,030
For ten thousand years,

67
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,000
She is forbidden to leave.

68
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Yes, My Lord

69
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,260
My Lord

70
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,020
My Lord

71
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,500
On summer solstice of  the celestial year of 208613,

72
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,020
The Floral Immortal Zi Fen passed away

73
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
All the flowers perished

74
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Hearing this bad news

75
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,760
The Emperor mourned for 7 days

76
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,470
All the beings in the floral realm cried for her

77
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,480
Flowers of the whole world shared in this sorrow

78
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
and withered

79
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,250
for the following ten years

80
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,620
There were no more flowers blossom in the world

81
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,420
The colors between the heaven and earth were lost

82
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,520
until after the end of the mourning period of ten years

83
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,300
flowers start to blossom again

84
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,980
The beginning of the world was Tao

85
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,659
Tao gives birth to Yin and Yang, separates the clear and turbid

86
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,200
This creates two realms of the Celestial and the Devil

87
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
Ying and Yang interact and fuse

88
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Then there were the sun, the moon, the stars

89
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,180
and all the creatures in the world

90
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,460
and also the good and the evil

91
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,940
After that, all the creatures cultivate themselves

92
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,020
And become gods, fairies, monsters, demons

93
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,340
and humans of flesh and blood

94
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,900
The Floral Realm once belonged to the Heaven Realm

95
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,500
four thousand years ago, the Floral Immortal passed away with regrets

96
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,880
the floral fairies left the Heaven Realm

97
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,200
and established their own realms

98
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,600
becoming the new sixth realm

99
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,600
That's all for the biography of Floral Immortal

100
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,220
Any questions?

101
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,020
Mr. Hu!

102
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,260
Lian Qiao!

103
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Everyone's talking about the six realms

104
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,100
The general history of sixth realm

105
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,280
The complete collection of six realm

106
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,380
The Romance of six realm

107
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,220
However, those books only talk about four realms

108
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,900
Floral, Celestial, Human and Devil

109
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
What are the other two realms?

110
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,560
yes, yes, what are they?

111
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,080
emmmm

112
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,220
The Tao is so difficult to explain

113
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,140
This is something I cannot divulge

114
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,000
why not? what does it mean?

115
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,580
Look, Jin Mi

116
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,860
Wake up!

117
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,880
Little One!

118
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,020
What happened? Dinner time?

119
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,420
Look at you!

120
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,780
You spend your day just eating and sleeping.

121
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,420
Tell me, can you do anything else?

122
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,540
Don’t worry.

123
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Today is neither first nor fifteenth of month,

124
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
so Chief Peony won’t come.

125
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,500
Jin Mi

126
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,220
did you forget what today is?

127
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,340
Jin Mi! Jin Mi!

128
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,660
Chief Peony

129
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,660
Chief Peony

130
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,060
You  haven’t made any attempt to work hard

131
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Chief Peony.

132
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,220
do you mix up the date?

133
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,980
Today is neither first nor fifteenth of month!

134
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,000
Spot check.

135
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,200
Chief Peony.

136
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,420
This is all you have learned in four thousand years?

137
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,580
Your spiritual power is weak and your fairy skill is poor,

138
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,100
and you cannot even complete a medium spell.

139
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,200
Your comprehensive skill is not worse than others

140
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,940
and you are even smart

141
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,640
In the past years, where have you put your mind?

142
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,640
It is quite dangerous outside the Water Mirror

143
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,340
you can only increase your spiritual power to protect yourself

144
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,800
If you want to leave the Water Mirror, stop being lazy

145
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,720
Work hard and practice more.

146
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,120
Yes, I know. I will follow your guidance.

147
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,740
Have you not remembered what day is today?

148
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,800
Today?

149
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,630
Today is not the first or the fifteenth.

150
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,970
Hu?

151
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,770
Carrot?

152
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,580
Radish?

153
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,420
Lian Qiao, do you want to be punished as well?

154
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,600
Drink turnip soup?

155
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,910
I remembered! Frost’s Descent.

156
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,170
We drink Turnip and Spare Ribs Soup in Frost’s Descent.

157
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,090
So today

158
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,740
so today is the anniversary of past Floral Immortal’s death.

159
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,730
After today’s worship ceremony

160
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,270
you are punished to guard the Floral Immortal’s Mausoleum.

161
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,280
Chief Peony.

162
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,340
I am freaked out! Finally left.

163
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,100
According to laws,

164
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,420
my son Xu Feng must refine for forty-nine days to achieve rebirth.

165
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,610
Tonight is the last night.

166
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,780
Lord Liaoyuan, please help him to reborn in Nirvana.

167
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,020
You must protect Qiwu Palace well tonight

168
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,940
and no one should enter it without permission

169
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,000
Remember

170
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
no one

171
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,900
As you wish, your Majesty

172
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:34,180
I seem to remember that Chief Peony was furious about something,

173
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,440
Today is the anniversary of past Floral Immortal’s death.

174
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,250
The Flower Realm opens the Water Mirror every hundred years

175
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,970
to let the low-level floral elves and fairies like us to worship

176
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,360
Maybe Chief Peony misses the past Goddess, so she was not happy.

177
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,220
The day before yesterday, I proposed a report to Chief Peony,

178
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,700
telling her that

179
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,760
I want to leave the Water Mirror.

180
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,860
No wonder she tested your spiritual power.

181
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,800
Little One, are you crazy?

182
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,110
It is very dangerous outside, very dangerous!

183
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,900
Fruit fairies and elves are quite rare

184
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,220
and we may be eaten when we go out

185
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,240
But how good it is to be under the protection of this Realm!

186
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,600
We can devote ourselves to cultivation.

187
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,440
I just want to go out and have a look.

188
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,500
Look at the Human, Celestial, Devil Realms

189
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,700
written in the book

190
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,560
I just want to take a look and see what places look like.

191
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
We are in Floral Realm, but we are kept in this water mirror.

192
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,400
We don’t even know what the Floral Realm looks like.

193
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,960
I don’t understand.

194
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,380
Why the past Floral Immortal made this water mirror

195
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,510
restraining us in a fake water drop.

196
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,640
If I stay here anymore, I will become a raisin.

197
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
shhhh

198
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Lower your voice.

199
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,260
If Chief Peony hears your words, you will be punished again.

200
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,800
Let me tell you. It’s not fun outside.

201
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,240
It’s dangerous.

202
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,420
Did you forget the anniversary of past Floral Immortal’s death 900 years ago?

203
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,420
What a disaster you made when you escaped!

204
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,240
The Water Mirror is open! Really! Come on, let’s go and see.

205
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,320
Jin Mi, it’s about time.

206
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,920
Let’s go and worship the past Floral Immortal.

207
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,880
Jin Mi, come to the front?

208
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,590
What did you do?

209
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,619
Kneel down.

210
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,900
Me?

211
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,339
She is still an elf.

212
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,000
I’m afraid it is against the disciplines.

213
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,839
Keep things simple and follow your heart.

214
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,980
Past Floral Immortal cared all beings in Floral Realm, and there is nothing against the disciplines.

215
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Keep silence.

216
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Kneel.

217
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,370
Respect.

218
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,750
We miss you who left us,

219
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,100
and picked flowers for you.

220
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,460
No one can live forever,

221
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,900
but our memory of you last forever.

222
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,260
Chief Peony

223
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,960
Chief Begonia

224
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,550
and all beings in Floral Reals gather here

225
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,660
to show our sincere respect to Past Floral Immortal.

226
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,960
Worship.

227
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,480
Flower rain. Look, it rains flowers.

228
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,860
It’s raining flowers.

229
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,820
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful.

230
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,020
Jin Mi, come here.

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,360
With the protection of the Yun Elixir,

232
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
you will be safe.

233
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,760
Tonight is the last period of the Phoenix Nirvana.

234
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,000
At the midnight

235
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,300
the spiritual power of God of the Fire is the weakest.

236
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,040
You can act according to circumstances.

237
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm aware

238
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
My Lord

239
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,930
if there is no perfect plan,

240
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,440
we must not act rashly!

241
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,700
Phoenix Nirvana takes place once in five hundred years.

242
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,590
I have been waiting too long.

243
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,520
I will send others for this matter, you don’t have to worry about.

244
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,340
See the fairy in Floral Reals as soon as possible.

245
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,010
Yes, my Lord.

246
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,320
Lian Qiao, are you OK?

247
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,080
I’m all right.

248
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,050
Just go. You don’t have to accompany me.

249
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,920
I am OK to kneel here alone. It doesn’t matter.

250
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,880
No

251
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,980
good friends come through thick and thin together.

252
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,190
You are in a worse condition than me. Chief Peony gave you an Immobilizing spell

253
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,460
It may be solved after sunset

254
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,860
Then your body will be numb

255
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,350
My mother is calling me, I have to go.

256
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,900
Mo-

257
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
-ther?

258
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Move!

259
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,280
Grape, grape

260
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,160
you can’t even break the Immobilizing spell

261
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,620
What can you do?

262
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
No it can't be like this

263
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Mountain

264
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,140
down,

265
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,120
Waves up!

266
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,680
Oh, come on, am I really a useless elf?

267
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,770
Lord Puchi.

268
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,980
Yan You.

269
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,440
Lord Puchi.

270
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,260
Yan You.

271
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,800
You still can’t remember it for nine hundred years?

272
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,920
Yan You is not good name at all.

273
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,260
Do you know why?

274
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,040
Why?

275
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,360
There is a slug in the Flower Realm called “Yan You”

276
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,620
It looks very cumbersome.

277
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,300
Lord Puchi sounds better

278
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,180
It shows your characteristics

279
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,900
And also, very cute, isn’t it?

280
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,040
Lord Puchi. I don’t like this name.

281
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,960
But you have been called me that for nine hundred years, and I starting to get used to it.

282
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,470
You are just a little monster in the pond

283
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,650
why you need such big opening every time?

284
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,960
It’s only an eye candy and a waste of power.

285
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,800
This is the spiritual power I saved for a hundred years.

286
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,840
take it to nourish yourself.

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,260
Want to be a heroine?

288
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,800
Give the spiritual power you saved to me?

289
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,740
Who is the poor girl that even cannot break the Immobilizing spell?

290
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,950
Poor girl. Take it back.

291
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,440
Are you looking down on me?

292
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,480
OK, you win.

293
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
That’s right.

294
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,560
Here you are.

295
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,390
I also brought you a gift.

296
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,610
What gift? Something to eat?

297
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
Guess.

298
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,860
I’m hungry.

299
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,900
If you bring me meat,

300
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,160
it would be the best.

301
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,960
Clever, half correct.

302
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,980
This is Rou Rou.

303
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,260
Time really flies.

304
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,840
These years, you have given me the spiritual power of your hard work

305
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,880
to repay the help of that day.

306
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
In fact,

307
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,260
I really don’t need your spiritual power.

308
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,060
Your chatting with me makes me very happy.

309
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,940
Actually,

310
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,840
I repay you with spiritual power

311
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,640
not all because of you

312
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,680
If I had not taken her out of the Water Mirror,

313
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,940
we would have not met Qiong Qi

314
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,800
If we had not met Qiong Qi...

315
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,340
So what I want to do now

316
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,480
is atonement.

317
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,360
I know that you can’t let her go

318
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,740
so I want you to know

319
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,140
Your best friend is accompanying you in another way.

320
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,100
Lord Puchi,

321
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
will she change back to the Rou Rou

322
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,100
who can talk and sing, run and jump?

323
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,360
Well...

324
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,920
this is not impossible

325
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,400
Just find the Great Immortal.

326
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,520
The Great Immortal?

327
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,660
Then if I go to the Heaven Realm, can I find the Great Immortal?

328
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,120
Elves have no right to meet.

329
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,500
Unless you cultivate to become a fairy.

330
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,780
I cannot even get out of this small water mirror.

331
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,260
Everything has cause and effect.

332
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,920
Don’t live in the memory.

333
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,300
It’s time to let it go.

334
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,280
Practice hard.

335
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,560
And one day,

336
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,020
Succulent Fairy will wake up

337
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
and change back to Rou Rou in your memory.

338
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,420
Today is Frost’s Descent,

339
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,400
make a Fire Tiger.

340
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,440
Night Immortal.

341
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Night Immortal.

342
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,600
Lord Liaoyuan.

343
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,760
Why is your Grace here so late at night?

344
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,980
Just now, I saw a man in black break into the Northern Heavenly Gate

345
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,060
and came here.

346
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,820
Have you noticed a man in black?

347
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,280
No.

348
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,680
Have you seen a man in black?

349
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,940
No.

350
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,590
Now it is the critical moment of Xu Feng’s rebirth in Nirvana.

351
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,530
I am afraid that the man in black wants to hurt Xu Feng.

352
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,280
Lord Liaoyuan, please come with me to catch him together.

353
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,520
Empress published an order that Qiwu Palace should be closed tonight.

354
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,170
I beg for your forgiveness, my Grace.

355
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,480
Ok. I fought with the black man.

356
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,070
This person has a strong spiritual power.

357
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,540
Hope you can take more precautions.

358
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,410
Night Immortal and his Highness are like brothers.

359
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,700
I am deeply moved by your friendship. I will keep an eye on the Palace.

360
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,680
Then I will leave.

361
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,700
Meteor!

362
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,520
Humans say if you make a wish when meteor across the sky, your dream will come true.

363
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,410
But there is a Realm protection, will the effect be greatly discounted?

364
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,260
It doesn’t matter. Let me try first.

365
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
I want to meet the Great Immortal.

366
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,300
What is this?

367
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,060
A burning smell.

368
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
So stinky.

369
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,050
Seems to be a bird

370
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,930
First baked,

371
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
then frozen,

372
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,140
frozen when cooked

373
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,660
what is this method of cooking?

374
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,140
This is a bird?

375
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,600
I see a bird.

376
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,110
Yes, a bird.

377
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,130
Its flowers and leaves are hard.

378
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,190
These are its feathers.

379
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,320
It is a bit stinky.

380
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,180
Crow, it is a crow.

381
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
Crow?

382
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,380
how do you know?

383
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,400
I read Hu’s “The Six-Realms Species Encyclopedia”.

384
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,380
Crows grow like this.

385
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,380
It must be a crow.

386
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,660
But why it doesn’t move?

387
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,220
Is it dead?

388
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,020
Don’t panic.

389
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,160
No, it is not dead yet. It still has breath.

390
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,710
Then we save it, and we raise it.

391
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,490
There is a saying in Human Realm

392
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,020
Buddha said be merciful

393
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,180
How can we just watch it dying without doing anything?

394
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Let’s save it!

395
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,880
Can this really save it?

396
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,810
Don’t worry.

397
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,660
We grew in this way when we were young, didn’t we?

398
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,290
Water it,

399
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,630
and let it enjoy sunshine. It will be fine.

400
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,570
Little crow, take care of yourself.

401
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,520
We will come to see you later.

402
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,620
To water you again.

403
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,830
Let’s go.

404
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,480
OK

405
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,040
Your Majesty, his Highness disappeared in the process of rebirth.

406
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,540
What happened!

407
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,780
Make it clear, Liaoyuan.

408
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,000
I produced fire for forty-nine days to help his Highness to rebirth in Nirvana.

409
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,120
Today is the forty-ninth day.

410
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,420
Unexpectedly, as the fire was extinguished,

411
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
his Highness suddenly disappeared.

412
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,280
How could this happen?

413
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,260
According to your opinion,

414
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,560
what variables were there during Xu Feng’s refinement?

415
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,060
There is another event to be reported.

416
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,120
Say it!

417
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,040
Little crow, little crow

418
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,390
little crow.

419
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,160
You are so special.

420
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,680
Our Realm protection is inseparable,

421
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,140
how did you come in?

422
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,580
No response?

423
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,520
Ok, okay, I never serve it for anyone.

424
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,190
This is the honey that I made

425
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,980
with more than 100 kinds of flowers,

426
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,980
and it has been sealed for five hundred years.

427
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,440
I will give you a try first to see if it works.

428
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,960
Good, it works.

429
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,920
Why, why are you dead again?

430
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,390
Oh my god,

431
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,850
Lian Qiao must be disappointed.

432
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,940
However, if you can break through this protection,

433
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,179
you are certainly not a simple crow.

434
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,679
Are you a crow fairy?

435
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,190
If that’s the case, it’s too wasteful to bury you as flower fertilizer.

436
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,730
You even ate my precious honey.

437
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,239
How about

438
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,239
How about, how about I cook you?

439
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,100
This is it

440
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,680
Little crow

441
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,070
little... Little crow?

442
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,550
Little crow

443
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,470
Little crow...

444
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,940
how do you get so big?

445
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,160
How should I place you in the pot if you are so big?

446
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,400
Then how can I cook you?

447
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,210
However, I have heard that fairies have inner Dan,

448
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,640
which condenses all their power.

449
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,330
If I find yours and eat it,

450
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,220
it might be equivalent to eating your whole body?

451
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,720
Grape,

452
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,140
you are so intelligent.

453
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,680
It's strange...Why it has a tumor here?

454
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,420
I know it.

455
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,010
it might be his Internal Dan.

456
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,460
must be able to help me with my spiritual power

457
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Who are you?

458
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,010
Hi, you woke up!

459
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,720
What kind of little evil spirit are you?

460
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm not an evil spirit

461
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,080
I said...I'm not an evil spirit

462
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,440
Though I'm just a little fruit elf

463
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,060
a fruit elf still need to cultivate and practice hard

464
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,080
I'm not an evil spirit

465
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,820
Now that you woke up

466
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,450
just call me "my savior"

467
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,520
We do good without leaving our name

468
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,400
It is our good tradition in the Water Mirror

469
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,450
My savior?

470
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,900
Were you trying to save me,

471
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,740
with a knife?

472
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,900
Yes... I was...

473
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,500
I was...

474
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,650
You fell into my garden and was badly injured

475
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,720
I saved you from good will

476
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,740
To save you

477
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,660
I fed you the precious honey

478
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,640
so that you can wake up

479
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,660
well

480
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,020
Your clothes are quite dirty and ragged

481
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,080
I was trying to change you some new clothes

482
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,560
Then I saw

483
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,260
you have illness near your belly

484
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,700
Though I appreciate that you are broken in body but firm in spirit

485
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,080
you are still different from the average person

486
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,700
Now that I saved you, I'll finish my job

487
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,250
Lie down and I'll remove the ill part

488
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,370
lie down...what are you doing...

489
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,920
you are a female. Do you know the differences between male and female?

490
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,320
What differences...

491
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,660
How can you ignore the basic morals?

492
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,820
I've only heard about the differences between flowers, birds and animals

493
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,770
Never heard of differences between male and female

494
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,770
you...

495
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,640
I consider that you're still young

496
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,720
and were raised in this uncivilized place

497
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,380
I won't blame you...

498
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,040
We elves making fruits of course don't care about what birds think of us

499
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,970
a low level elf...

500
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,940
how could she have the magical hair clasp?

501
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,000
where did she get it?

502
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,330
well...

503
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,960
Well... since we've now known each other

504
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,430
We are friends now

505
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,200
take a good rest

506
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,330
I'll bring you something to eat

507
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,960
good night

508
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,860
friend, lunch time

509
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,200
hurry

510
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,190
sit

511
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,400
Eat those yourself

512
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,360
why

513
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,820
Don't you crows like worms

514
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,620
little elf...Who told you I'm a crow?

515
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,020
you are not?

516
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,240
Then you are a magpie?

517
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
wow

518
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,500
Is there any fountain water here?

519
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,580
please follow me

520
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
The water's OK

521
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,970
not bad

522
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,480
friend, friend

523
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,700
I didn't know you were so good at fairy skills

524
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,850
though I know the skills of changing shapes

525
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,650
never learned how to do the magic of bring a real thing from nothing

526
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,620
Neither can Mr. Hu. But Chief Peony can

527
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,290
friend, to achieve such skill

528
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,300
How many years does it take?
