1
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,850
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,900
"Episode 14"


3
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
You must have mistaken.


4
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,480
How would that be?


5
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,800
Well...


6
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,920
since Jin Mi is no longer in danger,


7
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,000
I shall not disturb you all any longer.


8
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll visit again another time.


9
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,560
Everyone has done something
right and wrong,


10
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
all the immortals have
their own stories.


11
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,520
Right now there are no outsiders,


12
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
you all have no need to
conceal it from me.


13
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,320
I know that you all have
sworn an oath to Zi Fen.


14
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,640
I won't make things
difficult for you all.


15
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,640
Just now I've just
checked Jin Mi's spirit,


16
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
even if you all want to hide it
from me, you won't be able to.


17
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,079
I'm only going to ask you one thing.


18
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
Is Jin Mi born during the frost fall?


19
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
It's true.


20
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Mi...


21
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,360
These 4000 years,


22
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,520
I have never done anything
a father should.


23
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,240
Zi Fen has passed away,


24
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,720
I am ashamed to see her.


25
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,720
Mi...


26
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,600
Mi...


27
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,520
Let father help you up.


28
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,800
Here...


29
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
This...


30
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
Father?


31
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,360
Immortal,


32
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
you have mistaken.


33
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
Is my fault that I didn't
look after you well.


34
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,880
If you are not willing to
recognise me as your father,


35
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
I will not be angry at you.


36
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,680
No...


37
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,240
It's not like that.


38
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
It's not that I don't want to
recognise you,


39
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,880
it's that you have mistaken
me as someone else.


40
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm just a normal grape fairy,


41
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
raised by nature.


42
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,000
Even if I want to scam or pretend,


43
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,440
I wouldn't dare to
do it to you, right?


44
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,200
Silly girl,


45
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,880
how can you be a grape fairy?


46
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,400
Just now I've checked your spirit,


47
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,480
you are indeed the child
of Zi Fen and I.


48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,560
Zi... Zi Fen?


49
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Which? Which Zi Fen?


50
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,400
In all six realms,


51
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,480
who dares to have the same name
as late Floral immortal?


52
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
The late Floral immortal?


53
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm the child of
late Floral immortal?


54
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,280
Oh my!


55
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,080
I cannot simply dream.


56
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
State of illusion,


57
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,760
I've pretended to be the late
Floral immortal's descendant,


58
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,040
scammed the Heavenly Emperor
for 5000 years prowess,


59
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
indeed now I'm facing
retribution from it.


60
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,080
Late Floral immortal,


61
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,520
please forgive me.


62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,720
Quickly wake up.


63
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,160
One, two, three...


64
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm... I'm not dreaming?


65
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
Is... Is this real?


66
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,880
I...


67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,880
I've been a grape fairy for
the past 4000 years.


68
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
Right now, am I...


69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,640
a drop of water or a flower?


70
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,800
You spirit must have been sealed off
by Zi Fen using the Garan Seal.


71
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,280
Therefore your true form
is not this entity.


72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
Also because of this, training your
prowess was an obstacle.


73
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,560
Your body also looks a bit younger.


74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,880
I'll bring you to my Master,


75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Xuan Ling Lord Doumu,


76
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
to seek for the counter spell,


77
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
then you'll be able to
get back your true form.


78
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,120
Chief Peony,


79
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,720
is that true?


80
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
Late Floral Immortal
concealed the truth...


81
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,720
to protect you.


82
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Since you've exposed your true
form in the Heaven Realm,


83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,080
it can no longer be concealed.


84
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,600
It's good that Water Immortal is
protecting troublemaker like you.


85
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,160
Are fathers so easy
to be found nowadays?


86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Yesterday I had one,


87
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,400
today I have another one.


88
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,840
But since Chief Peony has
already confirmed it,


89
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
it must be true.


90
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,400
I didn't think that I would have
a father and mother.


91
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,840
Fa... Father.


92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,560
Are you really my father?


93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,720
Let me bring you home.


94
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,600
I will never leave you
behind anymore,


95
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
causing you to be so lonely.


96
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,400
Okay...


97
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,080
It's okay.


98
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,440
But you all told me that I'm the
late Floral immortal's child...


99
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,720
but the late Floral immortal
passed away for 4000 years ago.


100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
I've never even seen her once...


101
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
or to know what she looks like.


102
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
Although you mother is
not around anymore...


103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
but you still have father.


104
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,360
As long as I'm here,


105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
I will accompany you forever.


106
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
By the way.


107
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,080
Mi.


108
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Right now your body is filled with
yang energy that's burning furiously.


109
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
Where did you get it?


110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,520
To solve it, we must find
the one that casts it.


111
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,800
In this current state of urgency,


112
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
we have to find that person...


113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,640
to retrieve the prowess
that's working against you.


114
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,080
I... I didn't ask for it.


115
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
He gave it to me.


116
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,520
He gave it to me,
do I really need to give it back?


117
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,039
In this situation, why are you still
thinking about the prowess?


118
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,720
If you don't give back,
you'll die from vomiting blood.


119
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,440
No. Last night, Heavenly
Emperor brought my spirit...


120
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,520
to the state of illusion.


121
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,320
He gave me 5000 years of prowess,
it has nothing to do with me.


122
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,920
Heavenly Emperor?


123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
What did he say to you?


124
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,960
He said...


125
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,920
He...


126
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
He is also my father.


127
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,120
What a joke.


128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
Indeed the biggest joke in the world.


129
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,120
This shameless person,


130
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
how can he be the master
of the Heaven Realm?


131
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,440
If it wasn't for Heavenly Emperor,


132
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,240
the late Floral Immortal's soul wouldn't be
destroyed and wouldn't die in hatred.


133
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,840
Calling him the murderer of Jin Mi's
mother will not be too far off.


134
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
Father?
What a joke!


135
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,800
How could he?


136
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,080
Begonia!


137
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
What did you just say?


138
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,680
What was the cause of
Zi Fen's passing?


139
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,640
It's been 4,000 years,


140
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,840
how long will you hide it from me?


141
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,240
How did late Floral Immortal pass away?


142
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,000
Speaking about that,


143
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,520
you were also part of the cause.


144
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,800
Today, even if I have to go against
the oath I swore to the late Floral Immortal,


145
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,600
and destroy my own spirit,


146
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,560
I'll have to tell the truth.


147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
All the men in the world are
fickle when it comes to love.


148
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,440
Right now Jin Mi has grown up...


149
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
everyone claims to be her father.


150
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,600
Where were you then?


151
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,720
Do you know that the
late Floral Immortal used...


152
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,280
all her prowess to protect this child?


153
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Four thousand years ago,


154
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
Jin Mi came into the world crying,


155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
when late Floral Immortal closed her eyes...


156
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,120
it was the same night when
Water Immortal had his wedding.


157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
You are all happy and well-contented,


158
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,360
don't even have the time to
watch the peach blossoms.


159
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Why would you even think of
people from the past?


160
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Enough, Begonia!


161
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,320
Jin Mi is still inside.


162
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,440
If Jin Mi hears all these,


163
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,920
we all have to share the blame...


164
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,560
and drag Jin Mi into the affair
of the past generation.


165
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
What for?


166
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
That means that...


167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,640
Zi Fen died in the frost fall
of the year 28612...


168
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,680
and not Summer Solstice
in year 28613?


169
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,400
Floral Realm has hidden the news about
Zi Fen's death for almost a year?


170
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,760
- Why?
- That year...


171
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
Begonia!


172
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,080
Are you not going
to even listen to me?


173
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,160
All the chiefs have already sworn
an oath to the late Floral Immortal,


174
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,280
please don't force
us to tell you anymore.


175
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
Chiefs, today Little One
has found her father.


176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
Please don't make her upset anymore.


177
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,400
Why don't you all go
inside to accompany her?


178
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
If you would like to talk
about the old days,


179
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,880
why don't you talk to me?


180
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,040
Mr. Hu,


181
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,760
you are considered someone
who was close to Zi Fen.


182
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,120
You must know what had happened
back then.


183
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Since the late Floral Immortal had always
wanted to keep this secret,


184
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm afraid she intended
not let you worry about it.


185
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,040
However, since you are not willing
to become a confused fool,


186
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,760
then why not become a sad but
understanding person?


187
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
Back then when Heavenly Emperor
was still the second prince,


188
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,680
he planned every move carefully...


189
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,720
to win over the late Floral Immortal's heart,


190
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,880
I am sure you are
more aware of it than I do.


191
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
In order to rise to the throne
as Heavenly Emperor,


192
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,680
he formed an alliance
with the bird tribe...


193
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
and married the princess of
bird tribe, Tu Yao...


194
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,160
and betrayed the late Floral Immortal.


195
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,400
When the late Floral Immortal knew about it,
she was desperate and heartbroken.


196
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,320
Luckily,


197
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,960
luckily your kindness...


198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,200
to the late Floral Immortal was
the same every day.


199
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,600
Her love for you had grown
stronger in time.


200
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,120
This was supposed to stop her
before it was too late.


201
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,040
Who knew?


202
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,240
The Heavenly Emperor acted the same
even after he was crowned.


203
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,120
He continued to harass
the late Floral Immortal...


204
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,560
but the late Floral Immortal refused to yield.


205
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,640
That made the Heavenly Emperor
even more frustrated and...


206
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,560
he forcibly defiled the late Floral Immortal.


207
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,040
He used force on Zi Fen!


208
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
But the late Floral Immortal
didn't know that...


209
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,960
she was already pregnant with Jin Mi.


210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
In anger,


211
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,880
she went to the
River of Unmindfulness.


212
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,440
Lady.


213
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,080
You already made your choice
between power and me.


214
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,480
We have taken different paths,


215
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,480
but you've shamed me
and made me betray Luo Lin.


216
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
Only by jumping into the
River of Unmindfulness...


217
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,080
could wash off the shame
and heartbreak.


218
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,080
The late Floral Immortal wanted to drink
from River of Unmindfulness...


219
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,840
to forget her sorrow
but Heavenly Emperor stopped her.


220
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,400
She then jumped into the river
to destroy her own spirit...


221
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,960
but the Heavenly Emperor
cast a spell to stop her.


222
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,560
I am the Heavenly Emperor.


223
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
The entire of Heaven Realm is mine.


224
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
I won't allow you to die...


225
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,360
and I won't allow you to forget me.


226
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,840
Let me go!


227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
Let me go!


228
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,320
Let me go!


229
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,680
The Heavenly Emperor imprisoned the
late Floral Immortal inside Qi Wu Palace.


230
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,720
Brother!


231
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,760
Brother!


232
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,600
Brother!


233
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
To get the late Floral Immortal
to give up on you,


234
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,920
the Heavenly Emperor plotted to get
you and Wind Immortal to marry,


235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,080
he even purposely let the
late Floral Immortal hear about it.


236
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,400
The Water Immortal and Wind Immortal
have arrived.


237
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,280
His Majesty,
why did you summon Lin Xi and I?


238
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,640
Brother.


239
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,880
My heart belongs to someone else,


240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,960
even if I'm not the one she wants...


241
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,119
I've already decided that I won't
marry anyone else except for her.


242
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Forming a marriage
between Lin Xiu and you...


243
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,680
is not an idea of just my own.


244
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,680
Due to the unrest in the six realms,


245
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,319
a marriage between you two...


246
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,520
would boost up the morale of
the soldiers in the Heaven Realm.


247
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,960
Luo Lin,
are you going to defy my order?


248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,119
Thank you your Majesty
for your kindness.


249
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,120
I wish that Princess Tu Yao and you
would be happy together forever...


250
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,800
but to go against my heart,


251
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,560
even if you have to take away my
immortality and make me human,


252
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
I will not obey your order.


253
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,320
Your Majesty, please calm down.


254
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
Luo Lin, Zi Fen and I had been...


255
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,160
cultivating in the same
school for thousands of years.


256
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,320
We are as close as siblings.


257
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,280
I cannot just take away
their loved ones.


258
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,800
Tu Yao was already married to
the Heavenly Emperor as she wished,


259
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,960
what else was she not satisfied with?


260
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,360
Due to the situation then,
the Heavenly Emperor...


261
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,680
has no choice but to
make Tu Yao his wife.


262
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,040
But in his heart, he has always
missed the late Floral Immortal.


263
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,480
He even wanted to make the
late Floral Immortal his concubine.


264
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,670
"Linyuan Terrace"
Tu Yao found out about it...


265
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,700
and how could she not hate him?


266
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,120
- Chief!
- Chief!


267
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,480
- Chief!
- Chief!


268
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
- Chief!
- Chief!


269
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,960
Why are you hurt so badly?


270
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,720
- Chief!
- Chief!


271
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,360
After I've rejected the
marriage proposal,


272
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,080
I went to the Floral Realm
to visit Zi Fen...


273
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,840
but she told me...


274
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,520
she has never loved me.


275
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,320
From the very beginning till the end,
I only love the Heavenly Emperor.


276
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,480
Why don't you just go and
marry Lin Xiu?


277
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,600
The spirit and internal organs of late
chief were already severely burnt.


278
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
She knew she couldn't live any longer.


279
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,880
That's why she had been cold to you,


280
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,780
in hopes that you would be
able to let her go easily.


281
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,980
She didn't want you...


282
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,520
to cause a scene for something
that can never be undone.


283
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
She hoped that the Wind Immortal
and you could be a loving...


284
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,200
and contented couple.


285
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,040
I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with Zi Fen...


286
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,400
but this world is unpredictable.


287
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Without Zi Fen,


288
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,920
how can I be contented?


289
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,720
Jin Mi lost her mother
when she was so young,


290
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,520
she was lonely and helpless,


291
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,600
how can I forgive myself?


292
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
I must kill that poisonous
woman with my own hands.


293
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,240
Even if my spirit will be perished,


294
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,320
I'll have to avenge Zi Fen!


295
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,680
The deceased is already gone.


296
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,880
The late Floral Immortal's spirit
has been destroyed,


297
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,760
even if you have finally avenged her,


298
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,000
she will not be resurrected.


299
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
Also, the late Floral Immortal's
last wish...


300
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,360
was for the Floral Realm
to be peaceful...


301
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,520
and stop seeking revenge
on each other.


302
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,800
The late Floral Immortal was worried that the
little grape would be like her,


303
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,120
develop infatuation
and die in grief.


304
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,880
That's why she ordered all the chiefs
to strictly protect this secret.


305
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,480
Even made Grape to dress up
like a man when she's out...


306
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,280
and trap her in the Water Mirror
for 10,000 years,


307
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,320
even asked me to
watch over her closely.


308
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,080
I thought that the little one...


309
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,120
would be happy and carefree
for the rest of her life.


310
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Who would have thought that...


311
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,440
fate messes with people?


312
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,840
Jin Mi,


313
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,880
it's you after all.


314
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,520
There's a limit to taking revenge,


315
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,200
how could you use Jin Mi...


316
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
and put the young chief
of Floral Realm in danger.


317
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,080
Do you know that...


318
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,840
the Heavenly Empress almost
killed her that day?


319
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,920
Hurting her is the Heavenly
Empress's doing,


320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,320
not what I wish for.


321
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,080
I will no longer help you.


322
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,400
Chief Magnolia , do you really want to
break the agreement?


323
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,400
You broke faith first.


324
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,600
I've already told you...


325
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
there's a limit to taking revenge,


326
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
it must not involve the
people from Floral Realm.


327
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,840
Since we have already
decided to take revenge,


328
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
of course there will be risk.


329
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,960
If you dare to cause anymore
harm to Jin Mi,


330
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
I will not forgive you.


331
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Chief Peony has always
been just and stern,


332
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,960
if she finds out that
we formed an alliance,


333
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
what would be your consequences?


334
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
No matter what,


335
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,080
we are on the same boat right now.


336
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,640
Since we've started it,


337
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,760
how can we stop now?


338
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,240
Take care of yourself.


339
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,290
"Xuanji Palace"


340
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,520
Your Highness, how's Jin Mi?


341
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,600
Luckily, Water Immortal
was there to help.


342
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,480
Jin Mi is fine now.


343
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
Jin Mi is actually Water
Immortal's daughter.


344
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
According to the arrangement
made 4000 years ago,


345
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
she is my fiancÃ©e.


346
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,880
Isn't she...


347
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,240
the child of Heavenly Emperor?


348
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,000
The magical prowess that father passed
to her goes against her own prowess.


349
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,040
Water Immortal has already
personally checked it.


350
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
He confirms that Jin Mi
is his own child.


351
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,360
Soon...


352
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
he'll announce it publicly.


353
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,440
Your Highness,
I can see that you're very happy.


354
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
I've never been this happy...


355
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
but I've also never
been this nervous.


356
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,080
I overheard the conversation between
Water Immortal and Chief Peony...


357
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,200
about the relationship between father
and late Floral immortal, Zi Fen.


358
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,520
The Water Immortal hates
father and mother.


359
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm afraid that he might not
approve this marriage.


360
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,320
Even if there was
any misunderstanding,


361
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,640
the engagement was made long time ago.


362
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,160
Promise made by the Immortals
must be obeyed,


363
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
no one can break it, isn't?


364
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,200
But I know that...


365
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Xu Feng likes Jin Mi too.


366
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,040
He might be able to fool others...


367
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,200
but I won't be fooled by him.


368
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,880
I can't bare to hurt him.


369
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,160
Then can you bare giving her up?


370
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
When Lord Fire Immortal was young,


371
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,840
he had so much love from
Heavenly Emperor and Empress.


372
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,320
He is also the firstborn.


373
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,840
He already has too much.


374
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,560
Unlike you,


375
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,640
you're always alone,


376
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,200
beast of dream and the night
are you only companion.


377
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,560
You never fight for anything.


378
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,120
If...


379
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,560
If you give your wife away, that's...


380
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,440
This one time...


381
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,640
Xu Feng,


382
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,560
I'll wrong you just this one time.


383
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,440
I'll repay you for hundred
and thousand times in the future.


384
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,160
Would you still blame me?


385
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,360
Chief Peony,


386
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,160
while we're here today,


387
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
tell me the honest truth.


388
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,240
Jin Mi,
is she or is she not my child?


389
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
In the spirit of the
departed late Floral Immortal,


390
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,040
no matter how many
times you asked.


391
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,080
I will only have one answer.


392
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,000
Jin Mi is not your descendant.


393
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,760
Don't try to hide it from me.


394
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,960
Zi Fen...


395
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,480
passed away after giving birth on
summer solstice in the year 28613.


396
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,400
Based on the time calculation,


397
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,560
no doubt that Jin Mi is
my own flesh and bone.


398
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,160
Your Majesty, you've mistaken.


399
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,160
Jin Mi was not born on
the summer solstice...


400
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,160
but was on the frost fall
a year before that.


401
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,480
I understand that..


402
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,040
I've wronged Zi Fen...


403
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,240
and caused her to die in hatred.


404
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,200
I also know that...


405
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,320
you all feel injustice for her.


406
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,640
But these past thousand years,


407
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,800
I've tried every chance given
to make up for the regret.


408
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,880
I'm sure that you all
would not want Jin Mi...


409
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
to become an orphan.


410
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,360
Has Your Majesty forgotten
how and why did late Floral Immortal died?


411
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,720
Only a few days ago,


412
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,320
Heavenly Empress came
to the Floral Realm...


413
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,160
ruined the tomb of late Floral Immortal...


414
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,960
and almost killed Jin Mi,


415
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,080
Your Majesty should know
about it, right?


416
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,360
Your Majesty, for the sake of
the relationship that you had,


417
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,880
then please don't endanger
late Floral Immortal's only child.


418
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,680
Regarding the Heavenly Empress,


419
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,520
please be at ease.


420
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
I will talk to her,


421
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,400
make her and everyone else in
the Heaven Realm to accept Jin Mi.


422
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,880
It is just Jin Mi.


423
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,280
Who dares to trouble the
Heavenly Emperor for it?


424
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,720
When the King and Queen are fighting,
Heaven Realm becomes unrest,


425
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,600
Jin Mi will not be able to
bare the blame for it.


426
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,040
In the Heaven Realm,
mistakes can be made easily.


427
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,560
Even the late Floral Immortal, which is also a
Supreme Immortal was plotted against,


428
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,000
let alone a weak child.


429
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,760
Jin Mi has a place in the
Floral Realm,


430
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,640
it will be enough.


431
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,120
Please Heavenly Emperor,
give her a way out.


432
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,240
Fine.


433
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,000
This needs further consideration.


434
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,160
But you should know,


435
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,560
although time has passed...


436
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,920
I've not changed my mind.


437
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,960
One day, I'll have to
recognise Jin Mi as my own.


438
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,200
I want to proudly get her
back to the Heaven Realm.


439
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,000
It'll be considered as
giving Zi Fen some justice.


440
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,640
In that case,


441
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,320
I'll patiently wait for it.


442
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,560
Former Floral immortal,


443
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,160
I'm here to visit you.


444
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,280
Can I call you mother now?


445
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Mother,


446
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,960
I've recognised father,


447
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,480
which is the Water Immortal.


448
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,280
He told me that you loved
having these flower biscuits.


449
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,400
What a coincidence, fresh flower
biscuit is my favourite as well.


450
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,840
I've brought some for you.


451
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,160
They don't look good...


452
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
but I made them by myself,
they are quite good.


453
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,920
Please don't mind it.


454
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,680
Frankly speaking,


455
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,880
these past 4000 years,
I've been thinking...


456
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,960
how would you and I reunite?


457
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
But I've never thought that...


458
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,720
we would reunite this way.


459
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,200
I even thought that,


460
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
after meeting you,


461
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll have many heart-to-heart
talks with you.


462
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,080
But I've never thought that,


463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,160
I've already spoken enough with you.


464
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,320
You are really a surprising mother.


465
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,320
I've always been jealous of Lian Qiao.


466
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,360
Because every time during meal time,


467
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
her mother...


468
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,120
would ask the butterflies to ask her
come home to have her meal.


469
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,080
I was thinking,


470
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,520
how nice would it be
if I have a mother.


471
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,560
My mother would ask me
to have my meal.


472
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,400
But now that I've know that
I have a mother,


473
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,880
I'm even more jealous of her.


474
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,480
How in the world is there
a mother like you?


475
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,200
You didn't care about me
after giving birth to me.


476
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,560
Even trapped me in the
Water Mirror for 4000 years.


477
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Even asked Chief Peony to lie to me,


478
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,080
said that I'm an orphan grape.


479
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,440
You even hid my true form,
caused my prowess to be so low.


480
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,320
What did father and
I ever do to you?


481
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,800
In the love letter, I found the place
where we meet in every life.


482
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,840
There I'll wait for us to
watch the setting sun.


483
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,880
In the love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.


484
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,200
There I'll sing in the moonlight.


485
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,440
It's fine...


486
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
although you didn't treat me well...


487
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,000
at least you have brought me
to this world.


488
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,840
Okay, I'll have to go now.


489
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,250
I'll be fine with father.


490
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,040
When I have the time,
I'll come visit you again.


491
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm leaving now.


492
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,360
Water Immortal.


493
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,080
Now that Jin Mi has gone
to pay her respect to Zi Fen,


494
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll like to ask you about something.


495
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,560
Water Immortal, you are too serious.


496
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,000
I'll tell you whatever I know.


497
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,800
When I was checking on
Jin Mi's true form,


498
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,360
I found that besides the
Garan Seal in her body,


499
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,400
there's also another restriction.


500
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,880
I've asked Mr. Hu...


501
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,480
but he wouldn't tell me
no matter what.


502
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
Do you know anything about it?


503
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,760
That restriction was planted
by the late Floral Immortal.


504
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,800
She has predicted that Jin Mi
will face a trial in 10,000 years.


505
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,160
It's for Jin Mi to block
out that trial.


506
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,320
Regarding the details,


507
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,360
we are not sure of it.


508
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,120
Is that right?


509
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,680
However, please be at ease.


510
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,560
The late Floral Immortal planted
this restriction...


511
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,639
out of a parent's love.


512
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,199
It does nothing bad to Jin Mi,


513
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,600
please be at ease with it.


514
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,760
Since it's Zi Fen's idea,


515
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
I'll let it go.


516
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,960
Sister Zhang,
the Water Immortal is Jin Mi's father.


517
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,280
Why can't we tell him the
truth about the Yun Elixir?


518
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,760
Water Immortal has always
been kind and soft-hearted,


519
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,840
adapts to nature.


520
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,320
Based on his temperament,


521
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,400
if he knows that the Yun Elixir...


522
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,400
is used to suppress
Jin Mi's true nature,


523
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,600
most likely he will remove it.


524
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,640
In case late Floral Immortal's prediction
has come true,


525
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,880
Jin Mi will face a 10,000 year
love trial.


526
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,560
How do we explain ourselves
to the late Floral Immortal then?


527
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,680
Next time, at the Highest Palace,


528
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,920
you can't just speak as you like.


529
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,360
Please be at ease, father.


530
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,960
I'll just sit here quietly
and listen to you all speak.


531
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,080
I will not speak as I want...


532
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,000
and will definitely not
speak to Heavenly Empress.


533
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,320
She won't have any excuse
to go against me then.


534
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,920
If she tries to trouble you,
you don't have to be afraid of her.


535
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,720
Water Immortal! Water Immortal!


536
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:33,760
Rat Immortal.
Water Immortal! Water Immortal!


537
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,400
Rat Immortal.


538
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,200
Where are you going, Water Immortal?


539
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,600
I'm bringing my daughter to
the Empyrean Cloud Palace.


540
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,440
This is my daughter, Jin Mi.


541
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,120
Mi, greet the Rat Immortal.


542
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,920
Greetings, Immortal.


543
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,240
You look like you are in a rush,
are you going to Mortal Realm now?


544
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,000
I was about to go look for you.


545
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,760
What's the matter?
Why are you looking for me?


546
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,760
- Fairy Jin Mi.
- Fish Fairy.


547
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,600
- What a coincidence.
- Are you going to patrol the night?


548
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,640
I am not in the rush for it
as it's still early.


549
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,300
Oh right,
you just went back to the Floral Realm.


550
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,900
Did the chiefs punish you?


551
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,880
That's good.


552
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,000
You must be really careful
coming to the Heaven Realm.


553
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,240
The Heavenly Empress is still angry,


554
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,160
I'm worried that it'll be
a disadvantage for you.


555
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Why don't you let me accompany you,


556
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,640
so that you'll be looked after?


557
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,960
You don't have to worry about me.


558
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,440
You must not let me hold up
on your duty time.


559
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,400
By spending time speaking to me,


560
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm guessing I've already hold up
your time to form the night.
By spending time speaking to me,


561
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,520
I'm guessing I've already hold up
your time to form the night.


562
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,960
No, you don't.


563
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,360
Courtesy to your kind words last time,


564
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
saying that you liked me,


565
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
I've been grateful for it,
from the bottom of my heart.


566
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,240
It's my pleasure
to be able to serve you,


567
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,760
just that I have an
engagement since young,


568
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,520
I'm worried that I'll have to
let you down on your kindness.


569
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,080
What's the big deal?
We are friends.


570
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,760
Fish Fairy,
even if you have an engagement,


571
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,360
I would still like you.


572
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,400
I like you too.


573
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,640
Greetings, Immortal.


574
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,720
I was careless and did not
notice your presence,


575
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,360
please forgive me.
