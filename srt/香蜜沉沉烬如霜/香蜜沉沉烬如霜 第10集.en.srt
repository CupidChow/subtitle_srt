1
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,800
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,560
"Episode 10"

3
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,980
The saying goes, parents know
their children best.

4
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,060
But my son is not on the same boat with me.

5
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,520
I don't know what for
I'm doing all these.

6
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,440
His Highness will understand...
your thoughts one day.

7
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,060
But now

8
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,960
the people around him are all sceptical

9
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,120
The Princess of Bian City, Liu Ying
has only met with His Highness for a few days.

10
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,170
Yet she's already calling
him Brother Feng.

11
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,000
She doesn't care if he will

12
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,790
be criticised by
others in Heaven Realm.

13
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,960
It's just a demon's trick.
Don't mind that.

14
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,640
What's your opinion on
Xu Feng getting injured...

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,020
in Demon Realm?

16
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,140
I think something is fishy.

17
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,340
With the prince's cultivation,

18
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,520
he won't be injured so easily.

19
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,190
I believe Liu Ying is
not someone ordinary.

20
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,320
She wouldn't let someone from Heaven
Realm who provides help to get hurt.

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,450
In my opinion,

22
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,640
there's another story behind this.

23
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,560
Go check it out at Demon Realm.

24
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,079
Watch out for Qiong Qi
and the 3 Demon Kings.

25
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,510
See if Run Yu is colluding
with them secretly.

26
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,960
And report it to me.

27
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,700
Yes, aunt.

28
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,100
Princess, I've brought him here.

29
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,770
Greetings, Princess Sui He.

30
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,110
So you're the soldier that...

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,180
came late for conscription
and was taken by Xuanji Palace?

32
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,100
Yes, I am.
Is there anything you need me for?

33
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,850
Well, is Night Immortal
treating you right?

34
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,590
Yes.

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
How?

36
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,840
He only appears at night and
always keeps to himself.

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,570
Although I seldom see him,

38
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,140
he's quite good to fairies like us.

39
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,160
He always greets us.

40
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
Is this even good treatment?

41
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,520
Do you want to work for Fire Immortal?

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,900
Help me with this,

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,440
and I'll get you there.

44
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,769
Choose anywhere you like
at Divine Army Mansion.

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,120
As for your position,

46
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,260
as long as it's not a
high-ranking position,

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,540
you may choose whichever
position you like.

48
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,650
What do you want me to do, princess?

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,520
Keep an eye on the Night Immortal.

50
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,400
Every move he makes,

51
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,230
the people he meets
and things he says,

52
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,730
tell me everything regardless
of its importance.

53
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,480
Is it hard?

54
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,020
You'd have a promising future if
you work under Fire Immortal.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,870
This big fortune
is wanted badly by other immortals.

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,140
What good have I done...

57
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,140
to deserve such a big fortune.

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,920
I heard that Fire Immortal is
very strict with the army.

59
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,490
He personally picks
his own soldiers.

60
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,770
So, why is it that you
have the power...

61
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,190
to pick the soldiers, Princess Sui He?

62
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
Don't you worry about that.

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm a person of my word.

64
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,280
Actually, on conscription day,

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,710
it wasn't because I came late
that I had to go to Xuanji Palace.

66
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,980
I went there on my own will.

67
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,070
You're so lacking ambition.

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,350
So, you're not doing it, huh?

69
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,640
Everybody has his own aspiration.
Please forgive me, princess.

70
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,310
If you don't obey me today,

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,010
you'll be offending me.

72
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,610
Which means,
offending the Heavenly Empress.

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,210
Princess, you mean...

74
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,490
it's the Heavenly Empress's will
to keep an eye on Night Immortal?

75
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,990
Certainly.

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
It's only until today that I know...

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,750
why Xuanji Palace is so cheerless...

78
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,950
with only a few people.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,460
So, it's because...

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,400
the Heavenly Empress is
treating you like this.

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,590
During these thousands of years,

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,330
none of them had
gone through the test.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,250
They were all kicked out by me.

84
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,210
Aren't you afraid of
the Heavenly Empress?

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,630
I am.

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,430
But everyone has his own ambition.
They can't force me.

87
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,030
Moreover, I don't know how to lie.

88
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,370
I'd certainly expose myself.

89
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,670
But I've never wanted to betray you.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,480
You have to believe me, Your Highness.

91
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,040
Kuang Lu, thank you.

92
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,070
I hope that you will...

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
trust me like the way
you trust the beast of dream.

94
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,720
The Heavenly Empress is
still very suspicious of you.

95
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,630
It's hard to protect yourself.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,680
You must be careful, Your Highness.

97
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,710
I've got used to it. It's okay.

98
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,140
As long as she can't find my mistake,

99
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,020
she can't do anything to me.

100
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,660
If only there's meteor.

101
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,680
If there is meteor,

102
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,120
maybe the phoenix will be here.

103
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,790
Meteor.

104
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,350
Phoenix!

105
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,980
- Phoe...
- You're indeed bored, huh?

106
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,250
Fish Fairy, why are you here?

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,890
I came here without
informing beforehand,

108
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,670
please don't be angry.

109
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,320
What are you talking about?
I'm idle these few days.

110
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,060
You're most welcome to come here
to relieve my boredom.

111
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,220
You must be worrying about Xu Feng.

112
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,010
He's fine now.

113
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,630
He is recuperating at Qiwu Palace.

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,760
This time,
it's all thanks to you, Jin Mi.

115
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Luckily he's fine.

116
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,900
I was so worried about him.

117
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,670
I was just thinking that...

118
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,860
if there's a meteor,
maybe the phoenix will be here.

119
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,310
That's why I thought that
the meteor was Phoenix.

120
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,450
So, do you like it?

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,650
Yes, I do.

122
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,169
It's so beautiful.

123
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,940
Fish Fairy,

124
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,960
can you take me out of the Water Mirror?

125
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,380
I want to see the outside world.

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,060
Okay.

127
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,240
Yay!

128
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,710
That's great!

129
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,020
We're out.

130
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,090
You're so amazing, Fish Fairy!

131
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,910
The barrier can't be broken
by needles or water.

132
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,650
Fruits like us...

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,110
can only come out after
cultivating for 10,000 years.

134
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,390
Even Lao Hu has to...

135
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,590
chant the water-breaking spell
for a very long time.

136
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,530
But you,
you managed to bring me out so easily.

137
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,110
You'll indeed have a great future.

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
There's nothing special.
You've overpraised me.

139
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,240
Let's go, then.

140
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,000
This way.

141
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,750
King, the Heavenly Emperor
promised to...

142
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,020
attack the Demon Lord
after Qiong Qi's incident.

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,410
But nothing has happened until now.

144
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,710
The Heavenly Emperor...

145
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,300
is still unreliable.

146
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,460
In the war between Heaven
and Demon ages ago,

147
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,710
he did not keep his promises
but abandoned us.

148
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,900
If it weren't for you,

149
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,030
how did he become
the Emperor so easily?

150
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
If I'd known earlier,
I wouldn't trouble myself...

151
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,300
to let Qiong Qi go.

152
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,200
Now that Heaven Realm
had taken Qiong Qi back,

153
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,240
the Demon Realm has suffered
a great loss.

154
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,580
If that's the case,

155
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,570
your plan to eliminate Demon Lord
has come to nothing.

156
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,360
We can't rush in seizing
the title of Demon Lord.

157
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,140
About that throne,

158
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,480
I have my own way to get it.

159
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,900
Heavenly Emperor is very ambitious.
Heaven and Demon Realms...

160
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,420
can't satisfy his greed.

161
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,270
So now,

162
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,280
we can't fuss over our losses.

163
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,700
Since the Heavenly Emperor
has taken Qiong Qi,

164
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,320
I'll let him fight at the front.

165
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,720
When the time comes,

166
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,850
I will definitely rule
over the six realms.

167
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,590
You're almighty.

168
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,560
According to the scout we
sent to Demon Realm,

169
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,750
His Highness was indeed hurt by
Qiong Qi.

170
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,740
The 3 kings in Demon Realm have
no contact with Night Immortal.

171
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,070
I have thought too highly of him.

172
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,410
But of the people who went
to Demon Realm,

173
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,440
there was also the grape fairy,
Jin Mi,

174
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,560
other than Night Immortal.

175
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,590
You mean...

176
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,670
she has something to do
with Xu Feng's injury?

177
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,120
Was Jin Mi...

178
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,180
Xu Feng's reading assistant
at Qiwu Palace?

179
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,430
You even praised her before.

180
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,350
I was careless.

181
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,890
Back then, Chief Peony
stopped providing food...

182
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,960
to the bird tribe
because of a lost flower fairy.

183
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,030
I found out later that
the fairy was Jin Mi.

184
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,430
I see, it was her.

185
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,180
Go on.

186
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,150
The strange thing is...

187
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,930
Qiong Qi was sealed inside
Soul Cauldron by His Highness...

188
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,260
with Nine Luminaries Fire Seal,

189
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,580
but who knows he was still
able to escape the cauldron.

190
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,340
When Qiong Qi attacked him
with plague needle,

191
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,780
Jin Mi was in the room too.

192
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,180
But no one knows
what actually happened in there.

193
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,970
I think...

194
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,290
Jin Mi definitely has something
to do with this.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
What's even stranger is that....

196
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,450
when His Highness was
injured by plague needle,

197
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,830
only Night Rattan could save him.

198
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,880
But Night Rattan...

199
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,330
Night Rattan is Flora
Realm's sacred object.

200
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,440
But the Heaven and Floral Realms...

201
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
have had grudges
for thousands of years,

202
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,840
they would never save Xu Feng.

203
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,400
However,

204
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,760
they actually saved him with it.

205
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,100
This matter doesn't seem to be simple.

206
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,130
What is the Floral Realm's motive?

207
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,160
You've worked hard. Go get some rest.

208
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,090
Keep this a secret before it's clear.

209
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,780
Yes.

210
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,130
Go and check on a grape fairy
named Jin Mi at Floral Realm.

211
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,820
Yes.

212
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,700
Heavenly Empress,
everything is normal in Floral Realm,

213
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,350
except for one place.

214
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,950
I found that within
the Water Mirror Barrier,

215
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,060
there's a courtyard...

216
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,900
that was sealed by a powerful
Peony spell.

217
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,140
I was afraid I'd alarm the chiefs,
so I did not go in.

218
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,780
I'll have to go to Floral Realm
myself to find out then.

219
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,510
Chief Peony,

220
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,940
Xu Feng was seriously poisoned
while subduing Qiong Qi days ago.

221
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,250
Luckily you were generous enough
to heal Xu Feng with Night Rattan.

222
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,550
I'm here to thank you today.

223
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,030
I brought you a gift,
please accept it.

224
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,130
You're welcome, Heavenly Empress.

225
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,740
It was all fate.

226
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,810
It seems that his time
hasn't come yet.

227
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,170
As for your appreciation,

228
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,440
that is too much.
I can't bear it.

229
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,970
Everyone in Floral Realm
does not dare to accept it.

230
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,970
I heard that there's...

231
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,140
a grape fairy called Jin Mi
here in Floral Realm.

232
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,950
She was also there when
Xu Feng was wounded by Qiong Qi.

233
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,030
Can I see her?

234
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm afraid I have to say no.

235
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,180
Jin Mi has made a big mistake.

236
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,310
She's repenting,
won't be seeing anyone.

237
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,630
Fire Immortal was attacked,

238
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,540
I think it's more appropriate
if you ask him yourself.

239
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,350
What wrong did
Jin Mi do exactly...

240
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,430
to receive such a heavy punishment?

241
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,980
The Heaven Realm has no right to
intervene in Floral Realm's business.

242
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,300
Especially someone like you,
Heavenly Empress.

243
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,670
What do you think?

244
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,600
We're busy here.
There are a lot of jobs to do.

245
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,150
Please leave.

246
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,220
I won't disturb you anymore then.
See you again.

247
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,920
Heavenly Empress,
do we go back to Heaven Realm now?

248
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,510
Chief Peony kept on stopping me,

249
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,060
and even ordered me to leave.

250
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,450
It's obvious that she's
covering something up.

251
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,460
From the way she's acting,

252
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,080
I feel more like seeing Jin Mi
and see who exactly she is.

253
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,200
Heavenly Empress,
you actually lowered yourself...

254
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,330
trying to break into a fairy's room?

255
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,940
Where would Heaven Realm put
its face if others know about this?

256
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,640
Who exactly is Jin Mi?

257
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,220
You even set a double-layer barrier
to trap her here.

258
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,310
It's none of your business.

259
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,880
Jin Mi.

260
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,530
Your Highness.

261
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,330
Your Highness.

262
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,700
It's you.

263
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,720
How are you?

264
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,880
Why don't you stay inside the palace?

265
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,700
I'm fine now. I need some air.

266
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,310
Are you troubled?

267
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,700
You seem to immerse
in thought just now.

268
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,540
Just tell me if there's
anything troubling you.

269
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,600
I can share it with you.

270
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,800
This is all fate.

271
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,060
The so-called trouble
sounds more like a joke.

272
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,670
Your Highness.

273
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,330
Are you worried about Jin Mi?

274
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm afraid I'm not even
worthy enough to worry about her.

275
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,510
What a pity grape.

276
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Jin Mi.

277
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,150
Fish Fairy, you're here?

278
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,780
Jin Mi,

279
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,730
am I disturbing you?

280
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,270
No, no. Why would that be?

281
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,800
You seem sullen,

282
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,350
is it because of Xuanji Palace's
poor hospitality?

283
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,100
No, this place is great.

284
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,780
Everybody has taken great care of me.

285
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,540
Is there anything troubling you?

286
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,120
It's not quite so.

287
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
But after I parted with
Xu Feng the other day,

288
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,270
I've never seen him anymore.

289
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,010
I wonder how his condition is.

290
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
I want to visit him.

291
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,930
I see. You're sullen because of this.

292
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,100
Don't worry, Jin Mi.

293
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,010
I just visited him at Qiwu Palace.

294
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,400
So how? How is he?

295
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,210
Did he mention me?

296
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,090
After taking the Night Rattan,

297
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,560
he's basically fine.

298
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,240
It's just that at this moment,
everybody is queuing up...

299
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,980
in front of Qiwu Palace to visit him.

300
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,230
It's very crowded there.

301
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,420
If you go there now,

302
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,890
you'll be attracting attention.

303
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,210
Then the fact that you're
hiding in Heaven Realm...

304
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,750
can no longer be kept hidden.

305
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
You're right, Fish Fairy.

306
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,850
It's better if I don't visit him now.

307
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,510
I'll go some other time.

308
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,530
Fish Fairy, the meteor you
showed me the other day...

309
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,160
was too beautiful.

310
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,360
I want to see it again.

311
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,450
Just a simple trick,
it wasn't worth mentioning.

312
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,980
If you want,

313
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,070
I can show you something
even more special.

314
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,570
Something even more special?
Where?

315
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,780
After you get out of
Xuanji Palace, go south.

316
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,790
There's a milky way near the rainbow.

317
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,340
Milky way?

318
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,800
Let's go now.

319
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,950
Come on.

320
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,090
So this is the milky way?

321
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,390
Phenomenal!

322
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,180
I've never seen
such a beautiful place.

323
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,010
Fish Fairy, the position you hold...

324
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,940
is good in term of ranking.

325
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,160
But when it comes to joy,

326
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,110
I think it's not as good as
Maori Star Guardian.

327
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,630
What do you mean?

328
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,040
Well,

329
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,800
Maori Star Guardian is
on duty during the day.

330
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,370
There are sounds of cocks and dogs.
So it's kind of lively.

331
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,490
But you,

332
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,270
you only have that beast of dream
who can't speak as companion.

333
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,690
And everybody has
gone to bed at night.

334
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,070
How cheerless.

335
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,400
You're such a lonely immortal.

336
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,960
Only those who've
experienced liveliness...

337
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,490
understand loneliness.

338
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,270
I'm fated to be alone.

339
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,600
I eat alone, practice alone,

340
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,100
read alone and sleep alone.

341
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,580
Without knowing liveliness,

342
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,260
how'd I know loneliness?

343
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,720
Give me your hand.

344
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,290
For you.

345
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,240
This is the seed of
night-blooming cereus.

346
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,470
It is a flower that
only blooms at night.

347
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,660
In the morning,

348
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,040
it mostly sleeps while
closing its flower.

349
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,320
I think its habit
is more or less like yours.

350
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,630
That's why I gave it to you.

351
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,440
You can accompany
each other from now on.

352
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,920
All these years,

353
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,600
the Heaven Realm is full of
flowers transformed by clouds.

354
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,910
They will never wilt,

355
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,030
but it's still just a trick.
It's not real.

356
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,470
Thanks to you today...

357
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,000
that Xuanji Palace is able
to have a real flower.

358
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,350
But you still need to...

359
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,200
water and take good care of it.

360
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,770
I will give it my best.

361
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,570
Hopefully when the night-blooming
cereus blooms,

362
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,330
I can watch its beauty with you.

363
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,540
Sure. No problem.

364
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,390
Fish Fairy, please do me a favour.

365
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,760
Just say it.

366
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,030
Can you...

367
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,950
don't take me back to
the Water Mirror today?

368
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,360
I don't want to be
found by Chief Peony.

369
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,310
Is it okay if I stay and
disturb you...

370
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,870
for a few days at Xuanji Palace?

371
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,360
Since I've brought you
out of the Water Mirror,

372
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,620
I won't take you back.

373
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,420
As long as you don't mind
staying in Xuanji Palace,

374
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,080
that will not be a trouble.

375
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,430
I don't mind. I don't.

376
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,780
But even Phoenix
is afraid of Chief Peony.

377
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,610
Aren't you afraid?

378
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,770
I was disliked by many
people since little.

379
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,770
One more person means nothing.

380
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,020
Your Highness.

381
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,980
Your Highness,
I heard that Chief Peony...

382
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,780
is here to look for Jin Mi.

383
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,580
What? So fast?

384
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
No way.
I can't let her find me.

385
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,050
Otherwise I'm doomed.

386
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,030
Fish Fairy, I need to
quickly hide in your palace now.

387
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,140
I'm glad that
you think of Xuanji Palace first...

388
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,040
when you're in trouble.

389
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,560
But I think that
if you wish for a longer freedom,

390
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,300
hiding in Heaven Realm
is not the best option.

391
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,920
You're so thoughtful.

392
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,810
But... but I don't know much
about the six realms.

393
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,230
Please tell me what to do.

394
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,040
The mortal world is very complicated.

395
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,850
It wouldn't be an easy task
to track your scent...

396
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,950
among the mortals.

397
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,130
I was right about you.

398
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,740
You're indeed an exceptional
genius in Heaven Realm.

399
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,410
I have a lot of faith in you.

400
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,840
You actually look
good dressed like this.

401
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,000
Really?

402
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Have a sip.

403
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,190
Although this place is simple and
crude, it's very quiet.

404
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,160
If you're okay with it,

405
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,730
you may settle down here.

406
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,430
Thanks, Fish Fairy.

407
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,170
I like this house.
I like it very much.

408
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,220
Now you have a house and clothes,

409
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,480
but a pseudonym name in mortal world.

410
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,910
Pseudonym name?

411
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,970
Call me Mi then.

412
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,720
No. The name
sounds too much like a girl's name.

413
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,120
You're now a gentleman.

414
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,530
How about the name Ling Guang?

415
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
Ling Guang?

416
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,470
Sounds like brightness.

417
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,140
I like it. This is it then.

418
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,160
The Earth Immortal is so speedy.

419
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,720
We've just arrived,
and he's already here.

420
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,900
Just like a cat that got a fish.

421
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,180
He must have come by tracing
the immortal scent.

422
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,330
I'm using your place...

423
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,920
without informing you first.
Please forgive me.

424
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,030
Your Highness,
your visit to my territory...

425
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,480
has showered glory and...

426
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,250
bring colours around here.

427
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,260
Now that I have lived
to see your charming appearance,

428
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,060
I feel so lucky...

429
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,900
- and blessed.
- Enough.

430
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,600
This is Mister Ling Guang,
a friend I made recently.

431
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
He has encountered some troubles,

432
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,530
and will be staying here
for a few days.

433
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,830
Please take care of him,
Earth Immortal.

434
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,090
Greetings, Mister Ling Guang.

435
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,850
Don't worry, Your Highness.

436
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,890
This is my territory.

437
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,350
I'm in charge of this place.

438
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,750
If someone wishes to harm
Mister Ling Guang,

439
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,320
he'd have to go over my dead body.

440
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,880
Before he became an immortal,
he was a mountain thief.

441
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,740
Thanks then, Earth Immortal.

442
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,600
My pleasure. I'll take my leave then.

443
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,820
- I want this.
- Give me this.

444
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,710
Sirs, there's only 1 left.

445
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,730
Lord Puchi.

446
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,880
Jin Mi.

447
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,630
Lord Puchi, why are you here?

448
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,390
One gets silly easily when
stays too long in Heaven Realm.

449
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,300
Don't you think so?

450
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,890
That's why
I'm here to see the mortal's faces.

451
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,630
Now,

452
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,210
- I'm no longer Jin Mi.
- What are you then?

453
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,650
After I came to mortal world,

454
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,350
I have a mortal name.

455
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,990
Call me Ling Guang.

456
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,660
Ling Guang?

457
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,230
Why?

458
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,700
I made a
a small mistake.

459
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,450
I was locked up and asked to
repent by Chief Peony.

460
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,110
But I escaped.

461
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,160
After a careful thought,
I think this is the safest place.

462
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,180
Chief Peony will never find me here.

463
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,190
I see.

464
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,540
Then, do you have a place to stay?

465
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,360
Do you need me to find one for you?

466
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,330
Never mind. I've had one.

467
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,050
Fish Fairy had everything done for me.

468
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,290
Fish Fairy?

469
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,850
When did Heaven Realm
have this position?

470
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,440
It's the Night Immortal.
He's a very nice guy.

471
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,100
It's he who helped me escaped.

472
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,870
He even found a house for me.

473
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,760
But he's gone back to Heaven Realm.

474
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,090
Oh right. You're free anyway.

475
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,140
Why not I bring you to visit my house?

476
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,130
It's not as colourful as Floral Realm,

477
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,610
or as elegant as Heaven Realm,

478
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
but it is special.

479
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,760
- Great. Let's go.
- Come on.

480
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,460
"Luoxiang Mansion"

481
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,020
Are you paying respect to Zi Fen?

482
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,790
Can you pour me a cup of wine too?

483
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,070
Thank you.

484
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,270
Zi Fen loved Osmanthus wine the most.

485
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,440
All these years,

486
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,340
I've been dreaming about her.

487
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,290
In my dream,
she was still the old her.

488
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,410
Smiling,

489
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,180
but with tears in her eyes.

490
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,220
The past has passed.
There's no use to bring it up.

491
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,970
May I know why are you here,
Your Majesty?

492
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,880
The Heavenly Empress' birthday
is in a few days' time.

493
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,250
I know that...

494
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,660
you and Lin Xiu are
indifferent to fame,

495
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,390
nor do you like crowded place.

496
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,660
But the Heavenly Empress
is over sensitive.

497
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,830
She might think you are upset of her.

498
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,969
All the immortals have been
talking behind us as well.

499
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,530
So I hope that...

500
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,830
in her birthday banquet
a few days later,

501
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,560
you and Lin Xiu
will be there no matter what.

502
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,199
Since you have personally
come to invite me,

503
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,560
Lin Xiu and I will definitely go.

504
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,159
Okay.

505
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
You guys...

506
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,310
have kept my son waited for long.

507
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,710
The marriage was
arranged since 4000 years ago.

508
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,060
But where's your daughter?

509
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,500
What? Mother went to Floral Realm
to look for Jin Mi?

510
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,520
But what was unexpected was that...

511
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,150
Jin Mi wasn't in Floral Realm.

512
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,060
Even Chief Peony couldn't find her.

513
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:56,000
What did you say?
Jin Mi has gone missing?

514
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,800
Your Highness, you've just recovered.

515
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,370
Don't get too agitated.

516
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,770
Jin Mi...

517
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,860
Is Jin Mi that important to you?

518
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,040
Flower Immortals, you can't come in.
You can't...

519
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,640
Your Highness,
they insisted to barge in.

520
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,690
Your Highness.
I was incapable to stop them.

521
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,170
You're done here. You may leave.

522
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

523
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
Greetings, Chief Peony.

524
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,360
You came here in such a rush.

525
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,070
May I know what is it
that's so important?

526
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,680
Fire Immortal,
please hand over Jin Mi.

527
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,600
I think you've misunderstood.

528
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,810
Jin Mi is not in Qiwu Palace.

529
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,340
Jin Mi suddenly disappeared
from the Water Mirror.

530
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,740
Besides you,

531
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,480
I can't think of anyone
who is able to take her away.

532
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,060
Jin Mi is from Floral Realm.

533
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,460
If you've taken her,

534
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
please return her to us.

535
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,810
Since I've promised you...

536
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,080
I won't see her in
Floral Realm anymore,

537
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,720
I will never break my promise.

538
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,000
I was just about to look for her
since I've also just learnt that...

539
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,140
she's missing.

540
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,710
We've all agreed that...

541
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,700
it was Fire Immortal
who took Jin Mi away.

542
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,220
Nonsense!

543
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,560
You lost a person from Floral Realm,

544
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,670
yet you come here to Heaven Realm...

545
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,730
and blame Xu Feng?

546
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,910
The person you're
looking for is not here.

547
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,360
Even if you bring this to
the Heavenly Emperor,

548
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,860
the answer's still the same.

549
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,960
Please leave, Chief Peony.

550
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,770
As for Jin Mi, I'll find her.

551
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,800
"Fuxiang Restaurant"

552
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,550
Mister Ling Guang,
you've no idea that...

553
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,940
the best dish to go with wine is duck.

554
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,350
One sip of yellow wine...

555
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,310
with 2 bites of osmanthus duck.

556
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,310
This makes one's life perfect.
Perfect.

557
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,850
Here.

558
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,080
That's too strong.
Why is mortal's wine so strong?

559
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,090
But speaking of this wine,

560
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,410
the wine in mortal world...

561
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,720
when compared to the wine
brewed by an immortal like Yan You,

562
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,490
it's...

563
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,630
What do we call that?

564
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,520
It's just like diluted cat pee,

565
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,790
not presentable at all.

566
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,130
Three, two, one.

567
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,270
Done.

568
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,000
Even when the rich
are born into the mortal world,

569
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,020
they'd end up with a befuddled life
but not a desired life.

570
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,670
The 4 greatest pleasures
in one's life...

571
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,920
are none other than...

572
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,690
eating, drinking,
playing and enjoying.

573
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,180
Mi, can you get used to
the life in mortal world?

574
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,110
During these few days
I'm in mortal world,

575
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,860
Fish Fairy had been
keeping me company.

576
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,290
He is on duty at night.

577
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Besides taking a nap during the day,

578
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,350
he'd play chess, zither or
discuss about books and poems with me.

579
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,990
I wasn't so boring.

580
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,810
Night Immortal...

581
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,350
is indeed careful and thoughtful.

582
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,130
He had been taking good care of you.

583
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,240
That's for sure.

584
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,780
But, Lord Puchi,

585
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,770
you were talking about eating,
drinking, playing and enjoying.

586
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,350
Let's put aside eating and drinking.

587
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,520
What's so special about
playing and enjoying?

588
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,530
I'm new here,

589
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,240
I need you to teach me, Lord Puchi.

590
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,610
Let me tell you.

591
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,700
Everything about the heaven is good,

592
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,320
except that it's too boring.
No fun at all.

593
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,320
Such a rare place is of course good.

594
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,590
But,

595
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,610
it's not as enjoyable
as the fun in mortal world.

596
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,970
I'll bring you to have fun now.

597
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,390
Thanks then.

598
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,600
Do you know what does having fun mean?

599
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,860
I...

600
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,180
I'll take you to experience
the real fun today.

601
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,520
Okay. We're here.

602
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,440
Isn't... isn't this just
a cloth store?

603
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,410
You'll know when you get in there.

604
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,950
Come on.

605
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,820
Boss,

606
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,290
any fresh fish to sell?

607
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,670
Sirs, please follow me.

608
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,910
Come on.

609
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,640
Watch out the steps.

610
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,630
Please hold on,
I'll get someone for you.

611
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,840
Okay.

612
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,520
To gamble in big amount with
many skillful people,

613
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,880
you have to find the right place.

614
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,070
An underground gambling house
is the best.

615
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,430
Bingo.

616
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,390
"Gamble"

617
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,510
I won.

618
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,520
I won!

619
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,750
Just leave.

620
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
Go away.

621
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,700
Go.

622
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,490
Mister, we're doing small business.

623
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,830
We can't withstand torture from
a skillful person like you.

624
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,860
Please don't ruin my business.

625
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,720
Thank you very much.

626
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,740
This is weird.

627
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,340
Playing mahjong is so boring.

628
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,010
In a game, winning and
losing makes it fun.

629
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,130
Like when I was playing
chess with Fish Fairy,

630
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,410
he'd take 2 of my piece...

631
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,740
while I capture 5 of his piece.

632
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
It's more interesting if
we take turn in winning.

633
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,080
But in mahjong,

634
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,730
I got whichever tile I wished for...

635
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,120
and won every time.

636
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,300
Besides getting these heavy objects...

637
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,480
in yellow and white,

638
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,860
it's not interesting at all.

639
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,980
This is not fun. Let's go.

640
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,140
Hey, brothers.

641
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,310
Greetings, Fire Immortal.

642
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,690
Your Highness, your
visit to this place...

643
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,590
has showered glory and
added colours around here.

644
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,710
Save your pleasantries.

645
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,680
Qiwu Palace has lost a servant.

646
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I'm here to look for her.

647
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,750
Did you see
a very beautiful young lady...

648
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,810
or a fairchild with grape vine?

649
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,290
Did you see her?

650
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,370
- No.
- No.

651
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,670
Your Highness,

652
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,470
we've never seen the
person you're looking for.

653
