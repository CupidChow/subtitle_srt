1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
Ashes of Love


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Episode 20


3
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
He has really become a human.


4
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
Help me.


5
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
Help me.


6
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
She’s from the Heaven Realm.


7
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,400
Nether Fury reappears in the world


8
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
It turns out that the Mieling Family still exists.


9
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
The person from the Mieling Family
who can summon Nether Fury


10
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,080
is definitely not ordinary.


11
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
Is it him?


12
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
Xuan


13
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Demon Lord.


14
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Xuan.


15
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
Has the prince turned better?


16
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,040
Still the same.


17
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
There is no sign for him to wake up.


18
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,440
The Fire Immortal said the prince would wake up


19
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
three days after having the Golden Reinvigorating Elixir.


20
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,160
So many days have passed,


21
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
but the prince still hasn’t waken up.


22
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
I think people from the Heaven Realm


23
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
is really not trustable.


24
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Xu Feng.


25
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
I think


26
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,800
Fire Immortal deliberately


27
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,960
ignored the safety of the princes.


28
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Now Prince Xuan Shou is unconscious.


29
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,680
And Prince Chi Shou is mad.


30
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,200
The future of the Demon Realm is worrying.


31
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,840
This is clearly the scheme of Heaven Realm


32
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,920
to oppress we Demon Realm.


33
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,960
If Xuan can’t wake up,


34
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,440
I will not let


35
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,159
Xu Feng, the villain from the
Heaven Realm get away with this easily.


36
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,120
He killed so many soldiers


37
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,160
Is he a desperate bandit?


38
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,920
A doctor with conscience should treat
patients equally regardless of their identity.


39
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,920
But this bandit look


40
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,160
this bandit has fine skin and soft skin.


41
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,680
He just got skin trauma.


42
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
So the blood on his body belongs to others.


43
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Among so many people,


44
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
only you have survived.


45
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,400
You are so lucky.


46
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,760
The situation is a little tricky.


47
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,760
But you are lucky enough


48
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
to meet me, an outstanding doctor.


49
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,360
Otherwise, your will be in danger.


50
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,360
I am going to get you medicine now.


51
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Just lie down.


52
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,120
Your wounds are not a bruise.


53
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
They are obviously caused by sharp weapons.


54
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
How come?


55
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,720
I remember at the time


56
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,520
his long knife was coming at me.


57
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
She’s from the Heaven Realm.


58
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,760
I suddenly felt warmth in my heart at that time.


59
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,080
When I realized what’s happening,


60
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
I found I just got skin trauma.


61
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,200
That guy is a coward.


62
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
He ran way when he failed to kill me in one strike.


63
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,480
So I don’t know


64
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
what has happened exactly.


65
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
It’s a narrow squeak.


66
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Fortunately, God blesses me.


67
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
It’s good that you are fine.


68
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,240
Do you remember who did this?


69
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
The guy wore a mask.


70
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
I couldn’t see his face clearly.


71
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
Strange


72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,040
We Saint Doctor Family lives in isolation.


73
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,920
And we are always friendly to others


74
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
Who wants to you?


75
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,440
I don't think his goal is me.


76
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
It’s just because I was in the way.


77
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,400
By the way,


78
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
be sure not to


79
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,960
tell the elders and aunt about this.


80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
I just got skin trauma.


81
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
I don’t want them to get worried.


82
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Understand?


83
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,280
I finally found you.


84
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,560
What...what are you doing here in the middle of the night?


85
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,360
I was about to ask you this question, too.


86
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,960
This millennium snow ginseng


87
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
is used as the guiding herb of
Longevity Qiankun Pill for King Yi.


88
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,280
Why do you take it in the middle of the night?


89
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
Yes.


90
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,040
I am going to use it to make medicine for King Yi.


91
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Don't fool me.


92
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,920
The medicine has not been refined yet.


93
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,280
Why do you need this guiding herb?


94
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,680
Are you going to


95
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,240
use it to treat someone irrelevant ?


96
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,120
Don’t say nonsense.


97
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I didn’t meet anyone irrelevant.


98
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
When I bandaged your wound,


99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
you hesitated in speaking.


100
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,440
There must be something weird.


101
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
Is it true that you met someone


102
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,920
when you entered the mountain?


103
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,520
Doctors should be benevolent,


104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
doing good deeds for other regardless of their identity.


105
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Do you forget what


106
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,520
auntie teaches in daily life ?


107
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Sure enough.


108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Who is it?


109
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
It’s good for you


110
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,120
not to know about this matter.


111
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,520
If you auntie and the elders know about this


112
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,320
you will get into trouble.


113
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,360
I can bear to see you get killed.


114
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
Only we two know about this.


115
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,640
As long as you don't tell others, I won't die.


116
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:13,960
Qiang Huo.


117
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,520
But


118
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,960
Jin Mi, you are the Saint Girl in our family.


119
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,760
Give it to me.


120
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,840
Give me.


121
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Tell me.


122
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
In the one hundred years’ history
of we Saint Doctor Family,


123
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,480
we have served six Kings.


124
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
Did any Saint Girl


125
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
really make the medicine for longevity successfully?


126
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
Did any King Yi really become immortal?


127
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,160
If there is really medicine that can make people immortal,


128
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
why does the sixth generation King Yi exist?


129
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
The powerful people pursue long life.


130
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,880
But it’s just a dream


131
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
that can’t be realized.


132
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,240
And we still try to make this kind of medicine.


133
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
We know it;s impossible.
We are just fooling ourselves as well as others.


134
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
Why shouldn’t we give these herbs


135
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
to those in need.


136
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Anyway, I won’t let you to seek your doom.


137
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,200
We all have no reason to get killed because of you.


138
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Qiang Huo. Listen.


139
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I am a Saint Girl.


140
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
Don’t worry.


141
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,360
You all can count on me.


142
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,640
The worst result is that I pay him with my life.


143
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Anyway, my life is at the hand of King Yi.


144
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
You don't cherish your life,


145
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,720
but I can't bear to see you get killed.


146
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,160
I can obey you in terms of other matters.


147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,400
But I can’t obey you in terms of this one.


148
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,000
Qiang Huo.


149
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,560
Sorry.


150
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
You...again.


151
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,440
Sorry, Qiang Huo.


152
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
Dress for females.


153
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Am I...


154
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
Am I dead?


155
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,080
And my soul comes out from my body?


156
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,800
The sleeping manner of this guy


157
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
is so bad.


158
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,280
He even took off his clothes when asleep.


159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,000
The millennium snow ginseng is so awesome.


160
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
Why does this guy look so familiar?


161
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,880
Is he dumb?


162
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,280
How come I lost my voice?


163
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,920
Not me.


164
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
I also am deaf.


165
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,320
He is also deaf.


166
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Why did I take this damn sword back?


167
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
It’s only myself to blame.


168
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,680
I...


169
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
I...


170
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
Doctor.


171
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,800
It’s me. Is she the one who saved me?


172
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
I bandaged your wounds.


173
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Finally he realized the truth.


174
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,200
I am your benefactor.


175
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,760
I saved you with good intention.


176
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
But you are so ungrateful.


177
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
You almost made my waist broken just now.


178
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
Your clothes


179
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Your clothes are dirty.


180
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,560
With blood.


181
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,720
Very smelly.


182
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,400
You can't wear it.


183
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,920
You can't wear it.


184
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
What happened to me?


185
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,280
Who is the man in black?


186
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,640
Was he sent by Duke Nanping?


187
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,320
What do you want to say?


188
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,240
Write it down with this.


189
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,560
What’s wrong with me?


190
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,360
It’s so surprising that this bandit


191
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
are well-educated.


192
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Good handwriting.


193
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,040
Different deceases should be treated
with different kinds of medicine.


194
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,680
Would you mind telling me about your daily diet?


195
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,960
Stewed razor clam with snake gourd,
stewed reeve muntjac with kusnezoff monkshood root,


196
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,720
hellebore and liquorice soup,
stewed chicken with ginseng and phumile,


197
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,040
Stewed partridge with fritillary.


198
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,440
How can a bandit


199
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,440
afford to these good meals.


200
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
The reason why you fainted


201
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,080
is the exhaustion of physical strength


202
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
after you fought with others.


203
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
But your deafness and dumbness


204
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,840
has been brewing for quite some time.


205
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
Some herbs can produce poison if combined together.


206
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Poisoning?


207
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
Banlou,


208
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,720
snakegourd fruit, fritillaria


209
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,520
Zhushen,


210
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,440
Xinshao and Panlilu


211
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,340
In your daily meals


212
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,120
there were several dishes that are
poisonous if combined together.


213
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
You ate them everyday,
so the poison has been accumulated in your body.


214
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,160
If not treated in time,


215
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,040
you will die within one year.


216
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Is there any treatment for this?


217
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
The uncommon decease


218
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,120
happens to extraordinary people.


219
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,440
It’s just a piece of cake.


220
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,800
You looked so wicked just now.


221
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
You almost strangled me to death.


222
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
Then I’ll let you try some powerful herbs.


223
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
In the past, I checked these herbs by eating them myself.


224
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
Nowadays...


225
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,440
Your Highness.


226
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,040
You don’t like the knifes and swords.


227
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,240
How come you start to train the Phoenix Troop?


228
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,760
Because my cousin likes it.


229
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,800
Only the one who has strong power can be the king.


230
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,920
If I don’t even understand any military affair,


231
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,800
how can I become a helpful wife of my cousin.


232
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
If His Majesty knows about your good intention,


233
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,240
he must be very happy.


234
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,280
By the way, don’t let other know


235
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,480
that we are secretly doing military training here.


236
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
When my cousin comes back,


237
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,840
I will give him this surprise.


238
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,480
Yes, Your Highness.


239
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,920
Ask them to practice hard.


240
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
If they do well, I will give them big reward.


241
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Yes, Your Highness.


242
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
Bad news, Your Highness.


243
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,640
What happened?


244
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,720
Something bad happened to His Majesty.


245
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,600
What?


246
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,640
This time, Fire Immortal is
experiencing hardships in the Human Realm.


247
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,520
Is it true?


248
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,680
I saw him in person.


249
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,880
Fire Immortal is really a human being now.


250
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
He got injured badly after fighting
against about only one hundred people.


251
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,880
Since he is a human being and badly injured,


252
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
why didn’t he kill him?


253
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,680
My Lord.


254
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,760
I did want to kill him.


255
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,000
But when I was about to kill him,


256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
a girl with a mask suddenly appeared.


257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
I thought she was just a human.


258
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,800
But when I swept the knife toward her,


259
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,120
the knife was bounced back by a magic power.


260
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
She seems to have a something magic to protect herself.


261
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,880
I’m afraid there would be some
hidden soldiers from Heaven Realm.


262
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
I didn’t dare to take any action,


263
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
so I chose to come back and report this to you first.


264
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,480
You are useless.


265
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,480
You can’t even handle a badly injured human.


266
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
You are not capable of being a demon.


267
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,960
Go back and be a human.


268
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,760
Leave, now.


269
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,520
Thanks, My Lord.


270
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
The Mieling Family reappeared.


271
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
And the Fire Immortal becomes alert.


272
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,760
Is it that God wants me to die?


273
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,040
Congratulations, my Lord.


274
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
This is the sign of good luck.


275
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
Among the beings in Demon Realm


276
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
you are the most capacious one.


277
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,240
You words are not consistent.


278
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
Why did you say so?


279
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,160
If we use common knives or swords to kill Fire Immortal,


280
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,800
it will help him end his hardship experience


281
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,240
and returns to the Heaven Realm earlier,


282
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,600
which won’t bring any benefit to us.


283
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
So in your opinion,


284
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
we can just make him


285
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
live happily in the Human Realm?


286
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,600
My Lord, do you forget


287
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,800
the Mieling Arrow?


288
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,080
Fire Immortal is experiencing hardships,


289
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
and coincidentally the Mieling Family
reappears in the world.


290
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,320
Isn’t it a good chance for us?


291
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,800
You mean


292
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
To steal the Mieling Arrow


293
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,920
and use it to kill Fire Immortal?


294
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,640
You are so wise, my Lord.


295
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
We can take this good chance


296
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,160
to get justice for the two princes.


297
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,640
In the past, with the Fire Immortal,


298
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,440
the Heaven Realm made discreet remarks on Demon Realm,


299
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
attempting to impose their artificial rules


300
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,600
on us


301
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,560
and disturbing us.


302
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
Even if not for the sake of


303
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,800
my miserable sons,


304
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,960
I won’t make any compromise again.


305
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,240
You have always been reliable.


306
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
This matter is left up to you.


307
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,920
Remember.


308
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,040
Don’t let


309
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,200
King of Bian City, the old guy know about our plan.


310
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,040
Yes, my Lord.


311
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Xu Feng,


312
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,040
I must take revenge on you for my sons.


313
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,040
My sons,


314
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,000
I want to kill Fire Immortal and Qiong Qi


315
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,760
to take revenge for you.


316
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Your Majesty.


317
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,960
Look.


318
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,800
So this is Mieling Arrow
made from your blood and bones.


319
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,640
Yes, Your Majesty.


320
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,640
How to use it?


321
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,680
Shoot the arrow with strong power.


322
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,440
It can kill all living beings,


323
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,120
destroying their souls.


324
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,360
And they will be dead forever.


325
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,680
Very good.


326
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,040
I have already told Fairy Yuan about this.


327
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,360
Take actions without any worries.


328
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,040
Yes, Your Majesty.


329
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,080
If Jin Mi, the sprite returns to the Heaven Realm.


330
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,560
It will be your fault.


331
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
Yes, Your Majesty.


332
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,880
I must have been bewitched.


333
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
How come I took such a risk


334
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,040
to treat him with the precious herb.


335
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,000
Is it the so-called conciseness of doctors?


336
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Leave t it. Leave it.


337
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,040
Since you are the first patient


338
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
that I have taken care of in person


339
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,600
I did this for you as a greeting gift.


340
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Use my grape to remove the bitterness.


341
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,160
Is it sweet?


342
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,520
It is very sweet, right?


343
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,120
It seems that it’s very sweet.


344
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
So sour.


345
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Extremely sour. It’s not sweet at all.


346
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
Liar.


347
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
How dare you to tease me.


348
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
I like sour food.


349
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,560
You turn out to be a jealous man.


350
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Your wife will be unlucky.


351
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,760
When will I recover?


352
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,400
Within half a month, you will recover completely.


353
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,960
May I have your name?


354
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,160
Life in the mountains is slower than that in outside world.


355
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,160
The world has changed a lot.


356
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,800
Maybe you should ask me how old I am


357
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,760
Since the moment when I can keep a record of things,


358
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,640
I have learned these mysterious


359
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,160
and ambiguous words.


360
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,160
Otherwise, how can I build my authority
among the people of my family,


361
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,640
including the old ones


362
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
and the young ones.


363
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Judging from your appearance, you are of my age.


364
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,280
But in terms of skills,


365
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,560
you can call me master.


366
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,560
She is young,


367
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,840
but her words and manners are inconsistent with her age.


368
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
Is she really a wise person?


369
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
Or is she just bluffing?


370
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
Why do you provoke those soldiers?


371
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
They are from Liangguo.


372
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,040
They are from Liangguo.


373
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
So what?


374
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,040
They invade my country and took women and kids


375
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,280
They have done so many misdeeds.
We all have the right to punish them.


376
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,040
Your have a great mind.


377
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,360
Why didn’t you join the army?


378
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,880
Why are you a bandit instead?


379
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,000
I got it.


380
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,600
The world is in chaos.


381
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Soldiers and bandits are family.


382
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,640
I got it. Got it.


383
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,240
You are admirable.


384
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,400
I’m not kidding.


385
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Why is this bandit


386
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,080
so bad-tempered?


387
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Everything was OK just now.


388
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
But now he suddenly becomes angry


389
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,960
and ignore me again.


390
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Your face is so dark, like a crow.


391
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,320
Well, you really look like crow.


392
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,720
I will call you crow from now on.


393
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,680
Crow.


394
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
Crow.


395
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Why did you save my life?


396
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Don't talk about the conciseness of doctors.


397
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,000
I don’t believe it at all.


398
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,280
You look handsome.


399
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,040
You should thank your parents,


400
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
endowing you with such good look.


401
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
I won't feel bad


402
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
about using those precious herbs to treat you.


403
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,880
It’s the rule of survival.
The doctors are just following the rule.


404
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,400
The person chosen by the God will be blessed.


405
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
Don’t forget to share the bless with people in need.


406
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,720
Hundreds of people died,


407
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,960
making the mountain smelly.


408
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,560
Only you survived.


409
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
Who else should I pick?


410
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
You were picked by me.


411
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,080
So you might as well try the medicine for me,


412
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
which can be regarded as a bless
you give us Saint Doctor Family.


413
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
Other people use hands to play chess,


414
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,400
but we use them to write and chat.


415
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,880
I have no time to chat with you now.


416
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,200
I’m going to go down the mountain


417
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,200
and buy some food.


418
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,200
See you.


419
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,840
Don’t worry.


420
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,480
I will manage to find some clothes that fit you.


421
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,640
But you look pretty


422
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,160
in dress for females.


423
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,040
Village girl.


424
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Your Highness.


425
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,880
Many days has passed.


426
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,120
Haven’t you got in touch with His Majesty?


427
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Shence House has sent out twelve teams of soldiers


428
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
to every county to look for His Majesty secretly.


429
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
It won’t work by just sending twelve teams of hidden guards.


430
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
Why not send a larger troop?


431
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,480
At the moment, the soldiers of Lingguo are stationing
at the border, attempting to invade our country.


432
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
During this time of troubles, people are in panic.


433
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,440
The dukes negotiated and has reach an agreement


434
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,560
that this matter should be handled secretly.


435
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,320
The situation is very urgent now.


436
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,320
If something bad happened to my cousin,


437
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,800
who can take the responsibility?


438
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,600
I will devote my life to His Majesty.


439
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,800
Here is a message.


440
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,680
It’s very urgent, General Qin.


441
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,320
What is it?


442
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
According to the messengers, His Majesty and his followers


443
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,440
were attacked by the soldiers of Liangguo
at the Luoye Moutain ten days ago.


444
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,760
Did they see His Majesty?


445
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,040
His Majesty is missing.


446
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
All the guards died.


447
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
All of them die for their duty.


448
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,800
How many enemy soldiers did they encounter?


449
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
There about two hundred bodies
of the enemy soldier in the mountains.


450
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
They all were killed.


451
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,400
On the day when His Majesty went hunting,


452
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,800
he just took 18 guards,


453
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,800
who weren’t well armed.


454
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,400
I am going to discuss this with dad and find a solution.


455
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,200
Your Highness.


456
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
You haven’t got married yet.
How come you say this?


457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,480
Where’s your manner?


458
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I have been engaged with him for 18 years.


459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,920
The engagement


460
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,480
was made by the past king.


461
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
People of Huaiwu know about this.
Nobody dares to laugh at me.


462
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,440
I have already consider myself


463
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,080
as a member of the Palace of King Yi.


464
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,920
I will live and die with him.


465
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,200
If he is fine, it will be great.


466
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
If he dies,


467
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
I am will be his widow.


468
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,480
I’m serious.


469
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,800
I just have one daughter, you,


470
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,280
you hurt my feelings so much by saying like this.


471
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,560
I’m not filial. Sorry to make you sad, dad.


472
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,480
I said like this just to make you know


473
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
that I will do anything


474
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,520
for my cousin.


475
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,160
I understand.


476
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,680
I understand all.


477
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,280
Alright.


478
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,360
Stand up.


479
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,840
Calm down.


480
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,320
I also just heard the news,


481
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,720
and discussed it with grand preceptors


482
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
We have both internal and external troubles.


483
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,280
So we must find a perfect solution..


484
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Speed is the soldier’s asset.


485
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
I will wait until the mid-night.


486
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,560
If you still can't find a solution.


487
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,440
I took my Phoenix Troop first


488
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,680
to look for him in the Luoye Mountain.


489
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,720
Don’t take risk.


490
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,200
I will handle this.


491
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,400
Don’t not worry.


492
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,280
I will persuade the grand preceptors


493
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,520
to take His Majesty back.


494
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
Thank you, daddy.


495
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
I am waiting for your news.


496
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,880
Why?


497
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,440
You are deaf and dumb.


498
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,480
But you have sound hands and legs.


499
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,200
Why do you make me help you get changed?


500
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
Do the doctors in the outside world


501
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
have the duty of help patients get changed?


502
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,480
Who made the rule?


503
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
Hurry.


504
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,680
Help me get changed.


505
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,680
I, a Saint Girl


506
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,480
am reduced to be your servant.


507
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
It’s too bad.


508
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
The soldiers of Liangguo


509
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,920
are so useless.


510
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,960
They, so many of them couldn’t even


511
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,040
handle King Yi.


512
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,400
We even need to cope with the aftermath for them.


513
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,560
You lead some soldiers to search around Luoye Mountain.


514
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,840
Take his dead body.


515
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
Yes.


516
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,880
These are good herbs that can cool the blood, stop bleeding,


517
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,800
remove blood stasis and expel pus.


518
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,280
The juice of the herbs penetrates from the pores of your hands.


519
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,280
It can address both the symptoms
and the root causes, which is very effective.


520
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,160
Finally I have someone to help me wash these


521
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,360
stinging herbs.


522
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,239
The white powders are for external application.


523
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,440
She always covers her face with the veil.


524
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,120
She has profound medical skills,
and deals with affairs wisely.


525
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,680
Sometimes she fails to master the worldly wisdom.


526
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,920
Is she from the Saint Doctor Family?


527
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,040
This is not what a gentleman should do.


528
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,960
Since she saved me, she won’t hurt me.


529
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
Everyone has something embarrassing to mention.


530
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,800
She will let me see her face


531
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
when she is wiling to.


532
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
Sorry to have troubled you these days.


533
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,440
Take a good rest.


534
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,320
Although he is a bandit who killed many people.


535
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,320
But I find he’s not a bad guy


536
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,440
during these days of being together.


537
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,080
He’s very disciplined.


538
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,880
So being a bandit is not what he desires.


539
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
In troubled times, everyone
has his or her own difficulties.


540
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
I shouldn’t tease him anymore.


541
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
I should provide medical treatment to him.


542
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,160
Girl, look at our wind chime.


543
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,120
And this one.


544
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,600
Look. It’s so beautiful.


545
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,680
Buy one.


546
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,800
He uses invisibility spell even on the street.


547
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
So sneaky


548
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,080
Is he a hidden guard?


549
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Declare that you will reward
your hidden guards and demons


550
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,320
if they arrest and kill the remaining
member of Mieling Family.


551
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
Search for the Mieling Arrow.


552
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,600
I don’t know how many members of Mieling Family are still alive,


553
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
and how many Mieling Arrows are existing.


554
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,120
Do you know about this, my Lord?


555
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,480
Take them all back.


556
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,040
You don’t have to take the first one back.


557
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,680
Take it and use it to kill Xu Feng in the Human Realm.


558
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,720
If you catch the living members of Mieling Family


559
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
or know where they are,


560
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,560
Tell me immediately.


561
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,920
Mu Ci.


562
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,240
Xu Feng


563
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,480
Yes.


564
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
If this news leaks out...


565
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
Trespassing my house


566
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,360
and eavesdropping


567
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,520
are the manners of your family?


568
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,920
Kill me if you wants. Don’t mention my father.


569
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,400
I will kill you.


570
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,120
And I will also kill your father.


571
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,320
I think you are also scheming against the Demon Lord.


572
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,600
Hiding from the Demon Lord,


573
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,880
you secretly are looking for Mieling Arrow
and members of Mieling Family.


574
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,880
Your wide ambitions


575
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,440
are so obvious.


576
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
Kill her.


577
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,000
Liu Ying has repeatedly interfered with me.


578
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,960
Transmit my order.


579
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,440
Say it’s Demon Lord’s requirement.


580
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,600
Kill


581
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,000
Liu Ying, who is from Bian City.


582
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,120
Yes, my Lord.
