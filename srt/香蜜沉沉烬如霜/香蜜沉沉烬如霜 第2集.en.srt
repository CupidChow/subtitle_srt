1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 02"

3
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,980
How about this?

4
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,860
We will search this side

5
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,760
You guys search that side

6
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,440
Okay

7
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,840
Hey!

8
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,740
This...

9
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,620
What is this water used for?

10
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,060
Of course it's for washing feet, bathing, and washing clothes

11
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,440
You uncivilized little demon, unbearable filthiness

12
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,620
Friend, you really are strange

13
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,580
You just said this water is refreshing

14
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,600
But now you say I'm filthy?

15
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,460
Could it be that magpies all like to get angry often?

16
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
Let me ask you

17
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,160
This is the Floral Realm

18
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Precisely

19
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,380
Hey!

20
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,440
Are you leaving the Floral Realm?

21
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,960
But you haven't repaid me back yet

22
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,920
How would you like me to repay you?

23
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,720
Now we are talking!

24
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,040
Just bring me to the Heaven Realm

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,840
then we will be even

26
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,770
No way...

27
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,100
I thought his skills were great

28
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,060
How come with one tug and he fell into the water?

29
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
This wretched bird

30
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,380
We definitely need to find it

31
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's go over there to take a look

32
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes

33
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,120
Jin Mi

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,620
There was a bird yesterday that broke through the Water Mirror

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,320
Have you seen it?

36
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,420
Bird...

37
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
What bird?

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,500
Can fly, have wings,

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
and its body is burned with fire

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
What is that moving?

41
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
I'm washing my feet

42
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,100
Even if we have to dig several feet or turn the Realm inside out,

43
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,810
we have to catch that bird.

44
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Let's go

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Friend

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Friend

47
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,659
Friend

48
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
No way...

49
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,220
He couldn't have died again, right?

50
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,700
How can this be any good?

51
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
I got it!

52
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Six Auspicious Treasures!

53
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
Friend

54
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
Friend

55
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,660
You're awake!

56
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,980
My Floral Realm's Six Auspicious Treasures is really effective

57
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
What did you just feed me?

58
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Six Auspicious Treasures

59
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,700
What Six Auspicious Treasures?

60
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,200
This is it

61
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,540
Onion, ginger, garlic

62
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,320
Celery, cilantro, and Sichuan pepper

63
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,080
This is my ancestor's medicine for sickness

64
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,580
and specifically for birds who have fallen into water

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
Do you believe that I'll destroy you?

66
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,680
You want to destroy me?

67
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,280
Friend, I think you have it all wrong

68
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,680
Earlier, you most likely also heard Chief Begonia say,

69
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,220
even if the Floral Realm has to dig several feet to find you, they will still look for you

70
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,440
So now,

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,980
the only person that can help hide you in the Floral Realm,

72
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,159
is me

73
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,460
If I'm found out,

74
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,180
then you will be finished.

75
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
Once you are discovered,

76
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,100
they will cut your legs

77
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
and make you become flower fertilizer

78
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,420
My dignified Heavenly Realm

79
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,000
What about your dignified Heavenly Realm?

80
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,480
Why would someone as dignified as me

81
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,880
come here

82
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,060
and be afraid of some Flower and Fruit Spirits

83
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,720
You are too funny

84
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,180
The dignified great man in the Heavenly Realm

85
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,300
comes and goes freely

86
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,960
Then why every time

87
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,920
you are in trouble

88
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,840
It is me

89
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,080
the small fruit elf who saved you

90
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,540
You saved my life?

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,420
Two times

92
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,940
I saved you twice

93
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,100
But a person like me

94
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,980
is not that kind of

95
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,000
arrogant and prideful person

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,880
And I will not force you

97
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,020
into calling me your benefactor

98
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,320
It is clearly you

99
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,780
As the proverb goes

100
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,159
A drop of water should be returned by a spring

101
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,200
My kindness towards you

102
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,080
meant I not only used one drop,

103
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,700
but four drops

104
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,640
Four drops of fermented honey

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,280
A favor that saved two lives

106
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,720
The first time I saved your life

107
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,820
is at the night of the day before yesterday

108
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,200
I used 500 years old fermented honey

109
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
to save your life

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,700
and to help you transform back to your true form.

111
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Forget it

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,860
Hey! I'm not done talking

113
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
I'm not done yet

114
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,080
The second time was just now

115
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,170
I used 3 drops of fermented honey to help you gain consciousness

116
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,080
What on earth do you want

117
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,380
Friend

118
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,320
Didn't we discuss before?

119
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,680
If you can help take me out of the Water Mirror

120
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,880
and bring me to the Heaven Realm

121
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,020
then these 4 drops of fermented honey

122
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,900
and the two times I saved you can be even

123
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
What do you think?

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,460
No

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Wait!

126
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,660
Don't go yet!

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,400
There's something I just thought of

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
that I better tell you

129
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,710
Okay, please say it

130
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,340
My true body

131
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,780
is actually a bird

132
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Usually

133
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,440
I like eating fruits

134
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
Forget it

135
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,970
It seems like this place is not dangerous

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,720
I can rest for a few days

137
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,800
Thatâ€™s a very moody bird

138
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,800
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow

139
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,750
Really? Great!

140
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,920
We as fruits,

141
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,220
cannot lower ourselves to

142
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
the same level as a bird

143
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,910
King of Gu City

144
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Go ahead

145
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,050
Demon Lord

146
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Congratulations!

147
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,620
You can all take your leave

148
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
King of Gu City

149
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,920
Where is this congratulations coming from?

150
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,780
I just received information

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,300
that the Fire Immortal

152
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
has unexpectedly gotten into an incident

153
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,100
His whereabouts are unknown right now

154
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,420
Is this information credible?

155
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,240
I heard that the Heavenly Emperor is furious

156
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,200
that he ordered 10,000 soldiers to search for the Fire Immortal

157
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,960
Congratulations Demon Lord

158
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,020
Congratulations Demon Lord

159
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,260
Thank you!

160
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,460
Drink up!

161
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,460
Cheers, cheers!

162
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,680
That Fire Immortal

163
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,200
is always arrogant

164
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,600
He destroyed so many of soldiers In my Demon tribe

165
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,960
Godâ€™s way really goes in a cycle

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,680
He will pay for what he did

167
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,980
Phoenix Nirvana

168
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,420
is now escaping from death

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
Now the Heaven Realm has weak military power

170
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,460
I think that

171
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
We can strike while the iron is hot

172
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,540
and send soldiers straight to Huang Long

173
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,640
King of Gu City is right

174
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
Pass my order

175
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,060
Inform the six ministries

176
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,780
to recruit twenty thousand soldiers

177
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,020
Gather them at the riverside of Wangchuan River after ten days

178
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,740
March into the Heaven Realm

179
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,180
Mighty Demon Lord

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,280
Relax

181
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,240
The Heavenly Guards has already been sent to search

182
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,060
I believe that we will get some news soon

183
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,000
I have a request

184
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,700
If the Fire Immortal

185
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,200
safely comes back,

186
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,540
can you agree to my request?

187
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,280
What is it?

188
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,480
The position of crown prince has been empty for a while

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,340
All celestials are talking about it

190
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,340
Xu Feng is the first son of the legal wife

191
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,840
He has made great contributions in the battles

192
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,640
He is respected and supported by the public

193
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,180
I wish, your majesty

194
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
can appoint Xu Feng as the crown prince

195
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,520
as soon as possible

196
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,000
How come you suddenly brought this up?

197
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,380
What does the disappearance of Xu Feng

198
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,130
has to do with this

199
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,580
Your majesty

200
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,680
do you believe this is an accident

201
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,960
I believe

202
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
that someone has caught us off guard

203
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
to torment my son

204
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,960
Liaoyuanâ€™s words are still lingering

205
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,450
Will your majesty

206
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,410
excuse this person

207
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,410
Liaoyuan also said that

208
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,690
on that day

209
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,980
Run Yu did not enter the Qiwu Palace

210
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,900
If you want to place blame upon others

211
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,540
you should show convincing evidence

212
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,900
I did not want to be blunt before

213
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,300
Secrets of the heaven

214
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,980
is easy to bring trouble

215
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,160
but now Xu Feng is in danger

216
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,320
The ones who benefit from it

217
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,940
are those

218
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,630
who carry an ambitious heart like a wolf

219
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,500
Your majesty

220
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,240
You must appoint someone sooner

221
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,820
to end the greed of these people

222
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,060
Alright, alright

223
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
No need to say anymore

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,980
Lets wait until the Xu Feng returns

225
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
and discuss this afterwards

226
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,380
Xu Feng is fearless and the bravest in the army

227
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,550
How could he be so easily harmed by others

228
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,000
Run Yu is virtuous and kind-hearted

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,500
he would never harm others so easily

230
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
My queen

231
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,640
Do not believe

232
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,060
these villains who

233
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,880
stir up trouble between families of the heaven

234
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,000
Virtuous and kind-hearted, what a description

235
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,480
Are you ready yet?

236
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,640
I wonâ€™t wait

237
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm leaving

238
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,620
I'm ready, I'm ready

239
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,450
Let's go

240
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,040
Are you bringing the entire house with you?

241
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Not exactly

242
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,040
It is a long way

243
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,980
I donâ€™t even know if

244
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,160
I will be used to living in the Heaven Realm

245
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,700
Bringing more is better than bringing nothing

246
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,800
Wild evil

247
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,180
How could the Heaven Realm allow you to reside long

248
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,420
Do not bring one thing

249
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,500
Even one thing

250
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,340
to bring

251
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,620
Friend

252
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
Have you forgotten what this is?

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,560
This is the fermented honey that I spent 500 years cultivating

254
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,800
and used it to rescue you

255
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,340
You also drank four drops of it

256
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,840
Although when you were drinking it,

257
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,500
you weren't conscious,

258
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
the effects

259
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,000
you already know how effective it was

260
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,280
In case you run into

261
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,630
some emergencies

262
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,990
something of vital importance

263
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,520
Let's go

264
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,600
Wait! Give me a second!

265
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,320
Don't worry, I wouldn't abandon you

266
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm ready

267
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
You are really the oldest sister

268
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,110
This success

269
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
is not due to my own contribution

270
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,500
but thanks to the effort of all the sisters the people in the enchantment

271
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,240
the people in the enchantment

272
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
can enjoy peaceful days again

273
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,920
But recently

274
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
I still could not find

275
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,360
the breath of that flying bird

276
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I feel really anxious

277
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,540
Maybe it died

278
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,740
Or maybe it flew back the way it came

279
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,660
It is not yet known

280
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,860
Or maybe it has excellent skills

281
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,980
that can handle himself in all situations

282
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,220
with an untraceable track

283
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,840
You have worried too much, sister

284
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,000
Not that I am arrogant

285
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,920
The old enchantment

286
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
is established by the former god of flower before dying

287
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,860
At that time, the god is weak in his power

288
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,160
Now that four thousand years have passed

289
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,160
The enchantment is already unsteady

290
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,200
The birds just accidentally

291
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,740
took a strike

292
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,300
The person who breaks the enchantment

293
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,760
of we sisters this time

294
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,260
can be counted by two hands

295
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,980
in all the six domains

296
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,079
Was that the bird

297
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,119
He has gone too far

298
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,180
under our nose

299
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,060
Sister

300
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,140
I will catch it immediately

301
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,339
cut its legs

302
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,500
and use them as fertilizers

303
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
Fellow, can you be more steady

304
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,200
It is making me feel dizzy

305
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,140
If you keep doing this

306
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,540
I am about to throw up

307
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
Believe it or not

308
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
I am throwing you down here

309
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
I am really about to throw up

310
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,840
Don't throw up

311
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,400
You

312
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,660
I am flying in the sky

313
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I am in the sky

314
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,880
Watch out

315
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,320
Itâ€™s windy and foggy

316
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,820
Be careful that itâ€™s not steady

317
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,120
If you roll down I wonâ€™t catch you

318
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,980
Itâ€™s my first time flying up

319
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
I need to see the

320
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
beautiful scenery

321
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,900
This is just the third level of heaven

322
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
You are really inexperienced

323
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,200
Whatâ€™s there to see

324
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,760
Damn bird

325
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,100
Freeze there

326
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,540
No no

327
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Chief Begonia is near

328
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,320
Let's go

329
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,100
Go go

330
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,980
Are all the people in the Floral Realm

331
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,460
sticky like a limpet

332
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,480
Please donâ€™t abandon me

333
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,980
Even if you abandon me

334
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,480
She will also

335
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,540
Cut both your feet

336
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,620
and use them as fertilizers

337
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,340
This celestial looks fine

338
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,320
but has such a vicious heart

339
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,480
It truly doesn't match

340
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,940
Your great appearance

341
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,000
Damn bird

342
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,360
Trespassing my Floral Realm

343
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Destroying the Water Mirror enchantment

344
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,100
Was it your master Sui He

345
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,460
who sent you here

346
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,420
Sui He

347
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,940
She cannot control me

348
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
How confident

349
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,340
Your master Sui He is incompetent

350
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,360
I will place discipline in place of her

351
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,700
You evil animal

352
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,400
Sorry for offending you

353
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,820
This little naughty

354
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,020
has been chattering about leaving the Water Mirror

355
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,480
Has she really left

356
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
Thatâ€™s not possible

357
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,160
Where can she go

358
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,020
Mr. Hu

359
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,060
Chief Peony

360
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,540
Where did Jin Mi go

361
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,700
Picking flowers in the jungle, washing clothes in the backyard

362
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Picking flower, washing clothes

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,040
You have always been close with Jin Mi

364
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,700
Where on earth did she go

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,160
Chief Peony

366
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,280
We really do not know this

367
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,800
Everyone focuses on practicing

368
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,960
brewing honey

369
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
Every one cannot always

370
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,560
stay together

371
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,220
Could it be

372
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,860
that she is playing hide and seek

373
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,560
and hid herself

374
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,220
I have used my power

375
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,200
to detect the whole Water Mirror

376
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,820
I did not find

377
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,980
any breath of Jin Mi

378
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,700
She is not

379
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,320
in the Water Mirror anymore

380
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
These days

381
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,160
Did you notice her

382
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,620
doing anything unusual?

383
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,380
Yes

384
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,640
Recently

385
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,520
Her appetite has increased

386
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,360
Of course a bird tribe

387
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
The crow disappeared

388
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
Little naughty disappeared

389
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,100
Could it be the crow

390
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
who ate little naughty

391
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,440
Heavenly Empress used to be head of the bird trible

392
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,480
Although not harmonious with our Floral Realm

393
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,820
But with her position and honor

394
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,520
Thereâ€™s no reason for her to come to the Floral Realm

395
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,660
Plundering a little elf

396
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Could it be that

397
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,190
No matter what intention that bird has

398
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,560
Whether it is planned or not

399
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,380
We must get Jin Mi back

400
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,980
Mr. Hu

401
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,100
You did not take care of Jin Mi enough

402
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,600
Go look for her immediately

403
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,780
If you cannot find her

404
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,740
I will cut

405
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,820
your old skin

406
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,060
and send you to a rabbit hole

407
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,580
No no no

408
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,100
Chief Peony, I will go and look for her

409
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,820
I will go right away

410
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,320
I will go, too

411
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,640
What a crow

412
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,300
I was just about to look for you

413
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,920
and revenge for little naughty

414
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,240
But you came in yourself

415
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,920
Go go go

416
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,780
You old bungler

417
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,280
Just open your eyes

418
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,500
and look who I am

419
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,780
You

420
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Sister

421
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,180
You need to find justice for me

422
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,100
Why were you hurt like this

423
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,100
Who did this

424
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
It was that damn bird

425
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,120
I cut his path in the third level of heaven

426
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,520
Didnâ€™t expect he has such strong power

427
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,440
and is good at fire attacking techniques

428
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,580
and burned me like this

429
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,220
The bird tribe values fire

430
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,920
Sui He, the present leader of bird tribe

431
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,360
is good at fire techniques

432
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,980
This bird

433
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,940
must be her trusted follower

434
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,120
When you encountered the crow,

435
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,240
did you see Jin Mi?

436
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,440
Could Jin Mi also be kidnapped

437
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,780
That would be awful

438
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,060
The crow is cruel in its nature

439
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
That girl

440
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,920
Iâ€™m afraid bad things will happen to her

441
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
It won't

442
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,750
It won't

443
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,870
It won't

444
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,100
Turns out to be Chief Peonyâ€™s arrival

445
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,310
It is nice to meet you

446
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,010
Princess Sui He

447
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
Chief Peony would never

448
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,160
come for nothing

449
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,860
I wonder what

450
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,820
brought you here today

451
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,160
Even Chief Peony

452
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,280
Got into a fight

453
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,840
A few days ago

454
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,120
A flying bird broke into my Floral Realm

455
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,320
Plundered an elf

456
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,960
Hurt a master

457
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,680
whose whereabouts is still unknown

458
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,240
We hereby come to Princess Sui He

459
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,760
to ask for an explanation

460
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,320
Such thing actually happened

461
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,960
My Floral elf has witnessed it

462
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,590
Everyone witnessed it

463
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,980
Not fabricated at all

464
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,620
Although our Realm has always been in harmony with the rest of the world

465
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,600
No bullying from foreigners is allowed

466
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,320
If it is really the scum of our bird tribe

467
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,420
Stirring up trouble on purpose

468
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,220
No need for Chief Peony to step in

469
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,040
I will place punishment on my own

470
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,880
Que Ling

471
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,180
Yes

472
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,820
From whatâ€™s flying in the sky

473
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,020
to whatâ€™s not yet born

474
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,060
Interrogate them one by one

475
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,050
She has no proof

476
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,040
Who knows if she is provoking on purpose

477
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,040
I canâ€™t stand anything like this

478
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Chief Peony

479
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,360
Please calm down

480
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,000
After I arrest the murderer

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,680
You can do anything with him

482
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,640
Reporting to the princess

483
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,180
Nirvana, the Fire Immortal has gone missing

484
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
The Devil domain has sent a hundred thousand soldiers in the riverside of Wangchuan River

485
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,300
intending to attack the Heaven Realm

486
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
What

487
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,180
Follow me

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,940
Wait

489
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,800
Everything has its order

490
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,640
Today

491
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,980
Princess should give me an explanation

492
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,540
Everything has an order of priority

493
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,180
Sui He has important things to do

494
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,320
Today

495
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
I am afraid that I will let you down

496
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
If I cannot win her

497
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,700
How can I have the prestige to lead the bird tribe

498
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,890
Nice one

499
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,540
During emergency, we need to be flexible

500
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,570
We will surely catch the murderer in the future

501
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,750
and file lawsuit in Floral Palace

502
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,500
What happened, Chief Peony

503
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,020
What's wrong

504
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,380
I have been hurt by Sui Yushan

505
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,440
I need to rest

506
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,010
Pass my order

507
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,850
From today on

508
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,180
The bird tribe is forbidden to eat

509
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,060
If the bird tribe doesn't hand over

510
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,980
our elf

511
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,460
We will never provide them food.

512
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,780
Yes

513
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,460
If you donâ€™t hand in Jin Mi and the bird

514
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,620
We will not let go

515
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,100
Whatâ€™s the smell

516
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,380
Evil breath

517
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,100
Has the climate in the Heaven Realm

518
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
become so bad now

519
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,500
I am about to suffocate

520
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,540
The below domain is Wangchuan River

521
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Itâ€™s weird

522
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,320
Why is the evil breath

523
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
so heavy today

524
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,160
Thatâ€™s pretty big scale

525
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Wild evil

526
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,600
Today

527
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
I will show you around to the world

528
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
Great, great

529
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,260
King of Bian City

530
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,500
I asked you to recruit soldiers

531
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,160
You keep slacking

532
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,720
See

533
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
You recruited such a small group of soldiers

534
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Lord of the Devil, please allow me to report

535
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
I believe there are three setbacks to this battle

536
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,970
We recruited soldiers in a hurry, unprepared

537
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,470
I tried my best

538
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
to recruit only three thousand soldiers

539
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,080
the Heaven Realm has always trained the best soldiers

540
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,720
and they are not at the level we can achieve

541
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,850
This is one setback

542
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,820
The truce agreement between heaven and demon is still effective

543
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,100
If we openly tear up the agreement

544
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,140
We lose our integrity and support

545
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,600
This is the second setback

546
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,740
Fighting upfront alone on our own

547
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,520
This is not a feasible strategy

548
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
This is the third setback

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,180
Please think twice

550
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,140
I have been hearing a rumor

551
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,550
saying that King of Bian City and the Fire Immortal

552
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,680
are very close

553
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,740
I have always been reluctant to believe

554
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,780
But now we have this opportunity in front of us

555
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,360
While King of Bian city is here

556
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,680
Spreading fallacies to deceive people and delay the battle

557
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,480
It seems that this rumor

558
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,880
is going to be proved true

559
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
You

560
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,290
Demon Lord

561
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,560
Colluding with the enemy

562
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
What should we do about that

563
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,460
This crime should be sentenced to death

564
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,120
Dismember the body

565
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,140
and dump in the Wangchuan River

566
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,960
Take him down

567
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,820
Stop

568
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,880
Please allow me to report

569
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
My father never go against your order

570
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,480
He has recruited a number of soldiers as ordered

571
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,680
Where are the remaining soldiers

572
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,720
They are here

573
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,620
Do you remember

574
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,800
Our battle at Tushan Mountain thousands of years ago

575
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,400
Liu Ying has blocked eight thousand enemies alone

576
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,400
Lord of the Devil had given precious words

577
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,900
to compliment me

578
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,440
for fighting thousands of troops alone

579
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,920
Liu Ying has hereby come to request to be sent to the front

580
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,420
Liu Ying

581
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,040
This is not an usual war

582
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,860
You

583
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,870
The King of Bian City is weak and sly

584
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,410
But you have a wonderful daughter

585
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,160
Listen to the order, Liu Ying

586
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,340
I appoint you as the pioneer

587
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,490
Serve the wine

588
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,720
Wait until we drink it off

589
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,160
and lead the troop across the Wangchuan River

590
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,630
and wipe out the Empyrean Cloud Palace

591
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,530
and catch the Heavenly Emperor

592
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,940
I will award you a first class merit

593
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,530
Grant the wine

594
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,100
The Fire Immortal has come, it's the Fire Immortal.

595
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,680
Protect Demon Lord

596
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,280
King of Yan City is really arrogant

597
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,600
and ambitious

598
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,520
But occupying the Heaven Realm

599
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,960
You donâ€™t get a say in this

600
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,540
and King of Gu City doesnâ€™t either

601
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,500
Fire Immortal

602
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,300
I am reviewing troops here today

603
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,000
Do you want to step in

604
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,760
and restart the war

605
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,980
Quit finding excuses for yourself

606
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,180
I was just up in the heaven

607
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,840
and saw this evil

608
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,300
Leading the soldiers to cross over the Wangchuan River

609
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,580
King of Yan City

610
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,940
Since the battle between heaven and demon

611
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,680
Wangchuan River has become the boundary

612
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,080
across which no one offends the other

613
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,040
This rule has been followed for tens of thousands of year

614
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,020
Just as the King of Yan City review the troops

615
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
Did you forget about this rule

616
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,240
If you really want to occupy the Heaven Realm

617
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Please ask my Phoenix Feather Arrow first

618
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,400
I should say

619
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,780
There must be some misunderstanding

620
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Disordered people

621
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,130
King of Yan City

622
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,520
With incapable soldiers

623
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,240
and only an ambitious heart

624
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,500
Be careful

625
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,380
I have long heard that the Fire Immortal is very brave

626
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,860
and has been the top of the six domains

627
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,080
There is no time like now

628
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,040
Liu Ying is brave enough

629
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
To request a battle with the Fire Immortal

630
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,880
It turns out to be Princess of Bian City

631
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,220
I have heard a lot about you

632
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,340
Itâ€™s just

633
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,280
I never fight with women

634
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,580
There is no gender difference in the battlefield

635
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,560
Alright

636
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,200
Then I will make some concessions

637
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Thatâ€™s not necessary

638
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,260
We people in the Demon Realm

639
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,180
Not as weak

640
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,460
as you celestials in the Heaven

641
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,659
It has been a while

642
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,560
And still donâ€™t see attacks from soldiers of the heaven

643
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,699
Maybe it is only him

644
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,810
Itâ€™s better to design a trap

645
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
to capture him alive

646
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,440
Please think twice

647
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,739
Today, the Fire Immortal suddenly appears

648
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,440
We can tell that the Heaven Realm has released fake messages

649
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,580
Intending to trick us

650
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,000
The Fire Immortal leads three armies

651
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,460
There must be backups

652
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,260
I have already lost my face

653
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,840
Do I even have to lose my army

654
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,420
So that everything can end

655
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,580
No offense

656
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,000
I get to meet the Fire Immortal today

657
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,560
You really deserves the reputation

658
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,920
I never dare challenging you

659
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,320
Who else wants to take on the challenge

660
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,680
100 thousand Devil soldiers

661
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,700
are not comparable with a girl

662
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,470
Good

663
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Very good

664
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
King of Yan City

665
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,650
There hasnâ€™t been a battle in a thousand years

666
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,180
I am burning to do this

667
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,440
But the rules are strict

668
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,740
You can practice my soldiers more in the future

669
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,860
Feel free to come and attack us

670
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,980
I have millions of soldiers in the Heaven Realm

671
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,480
We are all set to start the battle

672
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Ready for it all the time

673
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,340
Fire Immortal

674
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,700
The battle between the two fields is not a game

675
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,100
I have always been

676
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,640
proposing for peace

677
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,820
About this

678
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,920
Please help me spread the words

679
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,660
Father

680
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,060
When he took my whip

681
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
He looked like Mu Ci

682
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,360
There will be one day

683
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,200
I can fight with him

684
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,500
simply and directly

685
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,770
How has Run Yu been preparing

686
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,480
Your Majesty

687
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
God of night has finished assigning soldiers outside the Southern Heavenly Gate

688
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,820
Come and report on the tasks immediately

689
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,820
Run Yu hasnâ€™t gone through a battle

690
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,340
This battle

691
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,000
Is just intended to make him settle in the army

692
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,600
and stabilize the army

693
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,080
As for the army lineup

694
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,040
We have to count on Liaoyuan

695
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,340
and the soldiers from other directions

696
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,160
I have followed the Fire Immortal for a long time

697
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Marching and fighting battles

698
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,180
Although not comparable to the Fire Immortal in any way

699
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,520
I am confident to succeed in the assignment

700
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,220
I hope that you can trust me and relieve

701
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,220
If Xu Feng is here

702
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,980
Why would I be so worried

703
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,580
Heavenly Empress arrives

704
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,400
Your Majesty, please take a look at what this is

705
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,040
This is

706
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,780
This is found

707
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,360
in the nirvana of Xu Feng

708
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,080
There must be someone who wants to hurt him

709
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,080
But if you look at the whole Heaven Realm

710
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,260
Who would it be

711
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
to have such strong power

712
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,020
Call Run Yu

713
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,400
Run Yu pays respects to father and mother

714
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,500
Somebody

715
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,720
Come take him down

716
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,180
What did I do

717
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,660
Please clarify for me

718
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,740
Look what you did

719
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,680
a hundred thousand of soldiers

720
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,800
How dare you to hand them to a

721
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,940
disloyal, unfilial

722
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,860
unjust and sinful person

723
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,760
This ice does not belong to me

724
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you really not know

725
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,120
This thing

726
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,520
is found in the nirvana of Xu Feng

727
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,180
He did not disappear with no reasons

728
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,460
but rather he was attacked by this

729
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,900
His nirvana was cut off

730
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,280
Such a strong water technique

731
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,900
In this large heaven

732
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Who could it be if it is not you

733
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,640
Besides, a celestial saw you on that day

734
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,840
near the Qiwu Palace

735
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,040
You were on duty at the Northern Heavenly Gate that night

736
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,560
At that time

737
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,020
Something was wrong with Xu Fengâ€™s nirvana

738
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,820
You tell me

739
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,120
Whether this is true

740
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Father

741
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
That night

742
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,440
I did go to Qiwu Palace

743
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
You Majesty

744
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,440
Welcome

745
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,080
Have you heard back from him

746
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,190
Your highness

747
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,540
You are finally back, your highness

748
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,940
What danger did you encounter

749
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,620
Were you hurt

750
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,200
No worries

751
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,580
I just wandered for a couple of days

752
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,480
I might have worried you all

753
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,520
Why are you here

754
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,500
I heard that the Devil domain has been intruding

755
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,320
Sui He has brought the bird tribe to assist

756
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
It is so great

757
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,200
that you can come back

758
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,560
You two may go

759
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,170
Yes

760
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,160
Sorry for bothering you

761
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,360
I am fine

762
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,780
It is aunt who worries about you

763
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,220
She could not sleep at night

764
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,720
Your Majesty

765
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,220
has sent out soldiers and troops

766
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,380
Looking for you everywhere

767
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,500
But have never hear back about you

768
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,700
Your highness

769
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,400
Where have you been these days

770
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,440
All wild places

771
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,860
It was also my first time there

772
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,620
But it was kind of fun

773
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,380
So I stayed there for a couple more days

774
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
Evil detected

775
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,640
Who are you

776
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,300
Why are you near your highness

777
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,260
I am, I

778
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,720
Never mind

779
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,520
Just an evil who wants to return a favor

780
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,540
Your highness, you have a kind heart

781
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,080
Even if you are in danger

782
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,980
You still care about others

783
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,860
No no you made a mistake

784
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,020
It is the magpie who owes me a favor

785
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,320
Not me

786
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,320
Fellow

787
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,720
Explain it to her

788
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,560
Fellow

789
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,410
Yourâ€¦Your highness

790
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,740
It is your highness

791
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,220
who was saved twice by me

792
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,900
So he should return the favor to me

793
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,140
Not I should return the favor to him

794
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,380
And one other thing

795
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,580
Make sure you donâ€™t misunderstand

796
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,800
I am not any evil

797
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,440
I am a

798
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,020
decent grape elf

799
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,820
Now that you saved your highness

800
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,680
Then to me

801
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,100
I owe you a favor

802
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,540
Wait until I report to the queen

803
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,700
You will surely be awarded

804
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Now

805
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,620
Please accept this

806
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,680
Take it as my gratitude

807
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,260
This Rose Medicine

808
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,800
Is a rare treasure

809
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,900
You can have a hundred years of spiritual power if you eat this

810
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,020
Do you like it

811
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,440
Yes, yes

812
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
This is my favorite

813
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,020
Congratulations on your nirvana

814
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,980
We did not protect you well

815
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,200
Please place punishments

816
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,520
Nirvana

817
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,090
A phoenix?
