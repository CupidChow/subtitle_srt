00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 40"


3
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,860
I’ve sacrificed everything


4
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,120
for you willingly this life.


5
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,700
I want nothing


6
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,960
but only one promise now.


7
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,100
I have only one child Xu Feng.


8
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,220
I believe Your Majesty


9
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,100
should understand what I want.


10
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,520
Stand up.


11
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,680
I had intended to pass the crown
to Xu Feng as promised,


12
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,680
but you have no virtue and public support


13
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,260
and implicate our child.


14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,900
You’ve always been aloft


15
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,540
and worshiped by the masses


16
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,880
in the past 10,000 years.


17
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,560
Have you considered


18
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,660
who wiped out the enemies


19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,500
and helped you consolidate
your position behind you?


20
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,500
It doesn’t matter I’m criticized by the public,


21
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,380
but you know well


22
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,079
why I did that


23
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,040
without caring about virtue.


24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,900
OK.


25
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,680
I promise you


26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,060
I’ll pass the crown to Xu Feng.


27
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,340
Your Majesty, please issue an imperial decree


28
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,340
and marry Sui He to Xu Feng as soon as possible.


29
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,820
In this case, the Bird Family will
surely pledge loyalty to the Heaven Realm.


30
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,160
You don’t believe me?


31
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,200
As long as


32
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,620
you plan far ahead for Xu Feng,


33
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,640
I want nothing


34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
and am willing to die.


35
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,060
We’re husband and wife.


36
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,780
Your dignity is also my dignity.


37
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,860
I won’t let you die.


38
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,480
I promise you.


39
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
After we got married,


40
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,840
we’ll love and trust each other.


41
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,420
If I’m still alive, I’ll return for sure.


42
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,980
If I die, I’ll miss you forever.


43
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,280
Tai Wei,


44
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,860
we finally get to this point.


45
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,130
"Xuanji Palace"


46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Mother,


47
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,220
I’m not a filial child.


48
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,360
I own you


49
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,900
two years and nine months.


50
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,880
After I seek revenge,


51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,420
I’ll observe mourning for you


52
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,800
according to the standard of the Arowana Family.


53
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,480
Have you heard that?


54
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,620
It has not been peaceful in the Bird Family recently.


55
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,800
Elder Yin Que visited the Demon Realm


56
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,100
and dined with Demon Lord.


57
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,220
Really?


58
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,780
It seems that


59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,300
Yin Que is going to betray
the Heaven Realm with the Bird Family.


60
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,640
Isn’t Princess Sui He the leader of the Bird Family?


61
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,240
Sui He has always been living in the Heaven Realm


62
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,800
and alienated herself from her family.


63
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Her ability, seniority and popularity


64
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,960
are all inferior to those of Yin Que.


65
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,260
Now Her Majesty lost her power.


66
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,460
Yin Que


67
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,100
has become a serious problem of Sui He’s leadership.


68
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,140
Maybe Her Majesty did order Sui He


69
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,960
to frame Yin Que for colluding with the enemy


70
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,500
to get rid of her enemy.


71
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,580
What if it’s true?


72
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,040
If it’s true,


73
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,420
Yin Que is really ambitious.


74
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
Yimiao Continent


75
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,240
has almost become the private property
of His Majesty in thousands of years.


76
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,120
The Bird Family has many complaints about it.


77
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,020
After Her Majesty lost power,


78
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,540
the chaos covered in the past


79
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,480
is revealed now


80
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,420
and no one can quell it.


81
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,800
The reason why Yin Que visited
the Demon Realm was that


82
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,940
he catered to the public opinion


83
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,200
and also,


84
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,020
taking advantage of Bird Family being reshuffled,


85
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,520
he want to press His Majesty


86
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,360
to renegotiate conditions with Heaven Realm again


87
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
with the Demon Realm as a bargaining chip


88
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,700
You mean


89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,159
after Her Majesty lost power,


90
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,020
His Majesty didn’t punish
the Bird Family out of kindness,


91
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,880
but the Bird Family didn’t restrain itself


92
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
and pressed the Heaven Realm instead.


93
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,780
Let’s see how Yin Que


94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,400
can press His Majesty.


95
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,700
The Bird Family tends to use checks and balances.


96
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,580
Now the Demon Realm
is getting stronger and stronger


97
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,540
and becomes their best target.


98
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,280
If the Bird Family really changes its side,


99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,280
it must be


100
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,140
a heavy blow to the Heaven Realm.


101
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,100
His Highness has totally changed


102
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,860
after his illness.


103
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,100
I must sharpen the sword


104
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,860
before I put my chest out and go to war.


105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Are you getting any better?


106
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,340
Father,


107
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,780
it’s a small injury. I’m fine.


108
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,620
But I hope


109
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,919
you can deal with Mother leniently


110
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,380
for the sake of your marriage.


111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,380
I’ve visited your mother.


112
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,560
She told me


113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,980
she’s willing to admit her guilt


114
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,580
and only


115
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,200
worries about your future.


116
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,800
Mother did a lot of wrong deeds for me.


117
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,100
I should take half of the blame for Mother.


118
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,820
This has nothing to do with you.


119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,040
I did intend to pass the crown to you.


120
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,480
After you marry Sui He,


121
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,240
I can reinforce my power in the Bird Family


122
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,720
and after Run Yu marries Jin Mi,


123
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,040
I can take back the influence of the Water Family.


124
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,700
In this case, the Heaven Realm
will be as solid as a rock


125
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,320
and the whole world will be peaceful.


126
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,020
I don’t like Sui He.


127
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
I know whom you like.


128
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
If you want to sit on the throne,


129
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,960
you must accept or reject a lot of things.


130
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,140
Jin Mi is just one of them.


131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,140
If I have to accept or reject a lot of things,


132
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,160
I’d rather choose Jin Mi.


133
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,780
You…


134
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,280
Do you think


135
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,840
you’re just an ordinary immortal?


136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,840
You personally descended to
mortal world with Jin Mi


137
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,160
and made a lot of trouble last time.


138
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,840
Now you even ignore the engagement


139
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,080
made by Water Immortal and me.


140
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
How can I pass the crown


141
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,100
and entrust the Heaven Realm to you in the future?


142
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,360
I know the proper way to act,


143
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,320
but Jin Mi is more important to me
than any other things.


144
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,780
I hope you can allow us to be together.


145
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,880
How dare you!


146
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,820
Don’t be mad, Father.


147
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,360
Father,


148
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,190
as the mortal saying goes,


149
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,480
a fair lady is a gentleman’s good partner.


150
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,020
But Xu Feng,


151
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Father and Water Immortal
have made an immortal promise


152
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,020
and Mi and I love each other deeply.


153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,760
Why do you trouble Father and others?


154
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,440
Love each other deeply?


155
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,600
Run Yu,


156
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,540
why do you still deceive yourself as well as others?


157
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,960
I know my future wife well.


158
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,660
However, Fire Immortal,


159
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,880
you persist in the short-lived love in the mortal world


160
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,200
and pester Mi.


161
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,160
This really bothers me.


162
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,980
Enough.


163
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,820
Stop arguing.


164
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,300
You two


165
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,700
are supposed to share my burdens,


166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,800
but now you fight instead.


167
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,260
That’s ridiculous.


168
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,620
Run Yu, the reason why I summon you here


169
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,440
is that your wedding date is coming


170
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,240
and you should get prepared for it.


171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,700
This is the wedding of my eldest son,


172
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,520
and a happy event of Heaven Realm
in thousands of years.


173
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,000
You must make it perfect.


174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,660
You’re free to use any rare curios and treasures


175
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,140
in the Heaven Mansion.


176
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,060
Thank you, Father.


177
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Father.


178
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,320
I beg you


179
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,900
to cancel the engagement
of Jin Mi and the first Prince.


180
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,480
Jin Mi and I do…


181
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,320
Shut up.


182
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,360
Your mother has spoiled you these years,


183
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,820
so your behavior is so outrageous.


184
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,760
How dare you covet your brother’s wife!


185
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,280
What a disgrace of the Heaven Realm!


186
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
You’re the black sheep of the family.


187
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,380
It seems that the punishment
for Tu Yao is too light.


188
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,320
This is my own idea


189
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,500
and has nothing to do with Mother.


190
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,220
Punish me


191
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,540
instead of Mother.


192
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,660
OK.


193
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,260
Fire Immortal Xu Feng,


194
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,680
you have no virtue and
are ill-behaved and perverse,


195
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,840
so you lose popular support.


196
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,840
From today on,


197
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,780
you’re removed from your military leadership


198
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,400
and should hand over Red Clouds Sword.


199
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,660
Mu Ci.


200
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,720
Mu Ci.


201
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,280
Mu Ci.


202
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,380
Take good care of yourself. Goodbye.


203
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,020
He ran away again.


204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,160
Cypridina with Soy Sauce.


205
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Boa Cooking On Special Stone.


206
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
Stir-baking Manjusaka with Vinegar.


207
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,280
Meng Po Soup with Nine Treasures.


208
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,140
Dishes don’t matter.


209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,460
Demon Lord loves wine.


210
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,240
Prepare more Zuifutu Wine


211
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,100
and Xiaoyue Wine.


212
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,580
I prepared


213
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,240
and placed it in the cellar yesterday.


214
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,900
OK.


215
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,340
He’s gone.


216
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,660
Who is gone?


217
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,240
Mu Ci.


218
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,120
Have you looked for him carefully?


219
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,760
He left this note


220
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,340
and disappeared without a trace.


221
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,560
He must have known


222
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,760
his condition.


223
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,060
You told him?


224
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,420
Of course not.


225
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,120
He’s always sensitive.


226
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,900
He must be afraid of being a drag on us.


227
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,520
He didn’t leave without
saying good-bye this time.


228
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,280
At least he left a note to me.


229
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,640
He’s improved.


230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,420
No, I must look for him.


231
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,680
Where are you going to look for him?


232
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,440
He’s so weak


233
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,700
and mustn’t have walked far away.


234
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,100
I’ll bring him back now.


235
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,400
What if you can’t find him?


236
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,020
Then I’ll keep looking for him.


237
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,180
Anyway I can live


238
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,780
longer than him.


239
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
I won’t give up.


240
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
Mu Ci.


241
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,160
Where are you?


242
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,960
We went through


243
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,280
several tests of life and death


244
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,360
and finally met,


245
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,140
but you broke your promise again


246
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,380
and ran away.


247
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,100
Why did you always lie to me?


248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,780
If you think this is wrong,


249
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,360
I’ll still insist on it with you this life.


250
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,000
The names we carved on it together


251
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,540
and the time we spent together


252
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,120
won’t disappear even after thousands of years


253
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,880
and will become


254
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,600
our memories that can never be erased.


255
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
Didn’t we make a promise?


256
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,500
Don’t ever think that I’ll let you go.


257
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,540
I’ll search every corner of the six realms


258
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
for you


259
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,520
until I’m old


260
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,300
or dead.


261
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,340
Mu Ci, wait and see.


262
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,980
Where on earth are you?


263
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,560
How cruel you are!


264
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,200
You disappeared


265
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,940
without a trace.


266
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,820
I have no choice,


267
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,320
but you can choose.


268
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,840
Forget me.


269
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,460
When will you stop looking for him?


270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
Don’t torture yourself.


271
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,240
Listen to me.


272
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,320
Go back with me.


273
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,040
No.


274
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,800
Ying.


275
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,300
Go back with me.


276
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,420
Let me go. I don’t want to go back.


277
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,680
Ying.


278
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,500
I won’t go back before I find Mu Ci. Ying.


279
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,900
I know you feel bad.


280
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,220
He’ll come back.


281
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,860
Listen to me.


282
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,860
Go back with me.


283
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,160
Isn’t it the seal of


284
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,540
Great Elder King of Qing City of our Demon Realm?


285
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
Great Elder is a bird of passage


286
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,960
and has traveled around the world
for more than 60 years.


287
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
No one knows his whereabouts.


288
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,200
Where did you get this seal?


289
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,880
Great Elder?


290
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,380
Great Elder is well informed


291
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,079
and the wisest man in the Demon Realm.


292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,920
If we find him


293
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,000
and ask him for help,


294
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,680
can we find a way to save Mu Ci?


295
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,960
Forget it.


296
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,800
Even if you find Great Elder,


297
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,839
it’s still useless.


298
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,040
Still,


299
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,440
Autopsy Wild Silkworms


300
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,099
can’t be cured


301
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,960
unless we find someone who
practices fire magic in the Heaven Realm.


302
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,200
Your Majesty.


303
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,980
It’s my fault that


304
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,020
Yin Que visited Demon Realm,


305
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,800
but he always does whatever he wants


306
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,320
and looks down on me.


307
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,880
Rome was not built in a day!


308
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,560
Didn’t you even notice it before?


309
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,470
Auntie's majesty was felt
throughout the whole realm in the past,


310
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,520
so no one dared to disobey her


311
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,580
and worked together with one mind
for the Heaven Realm.


312
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,700
Now Auntie,


313
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,760
Auntie is confined,


314
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,540
the Bird Family gradually wants to revolt.


315
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Who on earth is


316
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
the leader of the Bird Family?


317
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,980
I’m so useless


318
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,060
that I can’t even manage the small Bird Family well.


319
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,380
Please punish me, Your Majesty.


320
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,920
Your Majesty,


321
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,860
I want to redeem myself by good service.


322
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,700
Please allow Fire Immortal to dispatch troops


323
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
to help me bring order out of chaos


324
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,940
on the Yimiao Continent.


325
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,880
The matter has not been checked out.


326
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,280
What’s the hurry?


327
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,260
We should get ready for a fight.


328
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,260
But it’s just a preventive measure.


329
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,920
Father,


330
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,080
I’m here to consult books.


331
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,520
Sorry to disturb your discussion.


332
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,280
It doesn’t matter.


333
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,180
Since you’re here, you can discuss with us.


334
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,640
Go on.


335
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,520
Father,


336
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
the Bird Family has always
been loyal to the Heaven Realm


337
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,840
and most of them are loyal and kind-hearted.


338
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,410
I’m afraid the reason why
they changed their mind at this moment


339
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,920
was that they were fueled and fooled by someone.


340
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,520
I think


341
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,600
you can issue an imperial decree pacifying them.


342
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,320
First,


343
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,780
it can show compassion and
benevolence of the Heaven Realm.


344
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,320
Second,


345
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,140
the scheme of sowing dissension
adopted by someone with an ulterior motive


346
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,100
can fail itself.


347
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,940
Someone seizes this chance


348
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,320
to try to split the Heaven Realm and the Bird Family.


349
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,440
Such a tendency is not to be encouraged.


350
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,320
Father, I advise you


351
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,680
to select a special envoy


352
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,160
to command part of the heaven troops
to the Yimiao Continent


353
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,620
and investigate elders of the Bird Family
such as Yin Que carefully


354
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,520
so as to punish the wirepuller severely.


355
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,760
This is agreeable to me.


356
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,300
Draw up an edict at once


357
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,880
to instruct them the kindness of the Heaven Realm.


358
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,880
I accept the order.


359
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,100
I removed Xu Feng from his military leadership.


360
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,600
The special envoy and the garrison…


361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,860
Father,


362
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,080
the Bird Family hasn’t revolted yet.


363
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
We only need to take preventive measures


364
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,980
and terrorize them with military force slightly.


365
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Fire Immortal doesn’t have to
go to the Yimiao Continent in person now,


366
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,700
because this may frighten those birds


367
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,680
and cause panic instead.


368
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,080
We don’t have to kill chickens with phoenix feather.


369
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,820
Let me consider


370
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,500
the special envoy.


371
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,140
Send Star Lord Pojun to have troops stationed there


372
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,540
lest any accident happens.


373
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,200
Yes, Father.


374
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,640
Princess Sui He,


375
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,620
I think you know how to comfort


376
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,540
the family members well, right?


377
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,540
Yes.


378
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,280
This matter asks haste.


379
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,860
You should rush back to the Yimiao Continent to deal with this matter at once.


380
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,980
Yes.


381
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,260
I’m leaving.


382
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,400
I’m leaving too.


383
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,760
Wait.


384
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,000
How are you?


385
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,360
Thank you for caring.


386
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,620
I’m fine.


387
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,640
I often see you visiting Xingjing Court these days.


388
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
What books do you read?


389
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,700
I’ve found several books about self-cultivation


390
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,580
written by Supreme Clarity Heaven recently.


391
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,980
I’m reading them up.


392
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,520
Good.


393
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,940
You always do good things


394
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,580
and study hard.


395
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,080
This is great,


396
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
but you should also read
some books about heaven history


397
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
and art of war.


398
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,520
Why do you smile?


399
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,020
I suddenly think of


400
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,880
the first teacher in my childhood.


401
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,200
On the islet in the river
a pair of turtledoves is cooing.


402
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,740
A fair lady is a gentleman’s good mate.


403
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,760
A ragged fringe is floating left and right.


404
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,380
A gentleman yearns for a fair lady day and night.


405
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,500
You even remember that.


406
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,380
Tu Yao was selfish back then


407
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,240
and refused to hire a teacher for you.


408
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,440
I couldn’t stand it,


409
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,320
so I taught you a little bit.


410
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,420
But I was busy with military affairs


411
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,940
and could only supervise
your study for only half a year.


412
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,720
What a pity!


413
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,500
Thanks to your personal instruction,


414
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,740
I didn’t neglect study and fall from virtue.


415
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,380
I’ll benefit from


416
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,500
and greatly appreciate your instruction


417
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,240
all my life.


418
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,460
You did live a tough life.


419
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,200
As long as you want to study,


420
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,900
the door of Xingjing Court


421
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,660
is always open to you.


422
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,420
Thank you, Father.


423
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,040
Stand up.


424
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,640
As the mortal saying goes,


425
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,580
the emperor values the eldest son


426
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,060
while the common people love the youngest son.


427
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,640
That makes sense.


428
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,000
You’re my eldest son.


429
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,720
It’s impossible that I don’t cherish you.


430
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,940
You’ve always done good deeds and studied hard


431
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,640
from your childhood,


432
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,660
so I place great hopes on you.


433
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,360
However, you were weak
and couldn’t protect yourself at the time


434
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,080
while Tu Yao had many ears and many eyes.


435
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,080
If I treated you kindly,


436
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,660
you’d become the target of public criticism.


437
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,480
This would harm you instead.


438
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,320
I certainly know


439
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,940
you tried hard


440
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,080
to protect me.


441
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,680
I did something wrong


442
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,300
to your birth mother in the past.


443
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,920
Do you hate me?


444
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,940
The past is past.


445
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,740
Why did you mention it again?


446
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,580
I had no choice.


447
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,420
When the Demon Realm made
a massive invasion into the Heaven Realm,


448
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,840
the troops of the
southeast river system was powerful,


449
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,940
but they hesitated and looked on
my trouble with indifference.


450
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,560
I did such a thing helplessly.


451
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
I seized Lake Taihu


452
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,120
and raised the siege


453
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,220
through your mother.


454
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,100
I have always


455
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,960
felt sorry for you


456
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,540
and your birth mother


457
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,280
these years.


458
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,920
I always wanted to


459
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,380
make up for what I did to you two.


460
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,380
I’m very grateful that


461
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,300
you told me the truth.


462
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,280
Xu Feng is in charge of
the Five-Direction Heaven Troops


463
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,440
and controls the gates of the Heaven Realm,


464
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,690
which is heavy responsibility.


465
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,660
However, Xu Feng is ill-behaved and perverse.


466
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,660
I worry much about it.


467
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,780
I’ll temporarily


468
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,240
hand his position over to you.


469
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
I accept the order.


470
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,720
I’ll always fulfill my duties carefully


471
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,200
and won’t let you down.


472
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,320
Stand up.


473
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,380
Thank you for helping me just now.


474
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,120
Nature is the true law.
Everything happens for a reason.


475
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,340
I can’t bear to see the Bird Family


476
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,300
being persecuted on groundless charges


477
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,500
due to Her Majesty’s fault


478
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,020
and your mistake.


479
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,700
It’s just a small favor.


480
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,500
Never mind.


481
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,100
I wonder how Mother is.


482
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,860
Father is mad at me


483
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
because I asked him to call off
the engagement of Run Yu and Jin Mi


484
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,540
and he doesn’t even allow me to visit Mother.


485
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,760
As Fire Immortal,


486
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,020
I have never felt so useless.


487
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,690
Your Highness,


488
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,940
there is still a long time ahead.


489
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
You can’t solve


490
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
the problem of Her Majesty in a short time.


491
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,600
But the wedding of Immortal Jin Mi
is around the corner.


492
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
If you don’t find a way,


493
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,000
it’ll be too late.


494
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,600
Your Highness,


495
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,020
you're still grounded!


496
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,620
Auntie.


497
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,300
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.


498
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,560
Mister Immortal,


499
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,720
It is you let me win.


500
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,470
Wonderful!


501
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,640
You take action after 50 rounds.


502
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,850
You have the overall situation in mind


503
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,680
and play for safety.


504
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,520
After I captured your seven pieces,


505
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,680
you were still calm


506
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,340
and sure of success.


507
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,460
I’m flattered.


508
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,780
I arrange stars all the year round


509
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,380
and think the chess playing


510
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,120
is close to star arrangement.


511
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,720
The checkerboard is like the sky


512
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,260
while chess pieces are like stars.


513
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,320
A tiny star can change the overall situation.


514
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,680
How similar they are.


515
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,220
The black and white pieces of Go


516
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,640
represent heaven and earth, Yin and Yang


517
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,980
and embody pros and cons, conflicts


518
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,880
and victory or defeat.


519
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,090
This is quite different from


520
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,420
arranging stars and looking up the universe.


521
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,900
It’s great that you can master it thoroughly.


522
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
Chessboard is like a battlefield.


523
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,220
Even a piece is a life-and-death matter.


524
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,120
If there is no chance to win,
I don’t want to pursue the way too.


525
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,060
After observing mourning for three months,


526
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,640
your mood is totally different from before.


527
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,100
My Arowana Family was wiped out


528
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,080
and my birth mother died distressingly.


529
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,380
How can I be indifferent?


530
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,020
I will risk my life to fight


531
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,720
even for the future of Mi and me.


532
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,980
Mister Immortal, Fire Immortal wants to meet you.


533
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,540
Mister Immortal.


534
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,100
Fire Immortal, welcome.


535
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,940
What brings you here today?


536
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,500
Today I’m here


537
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,080
to visit Jin Mi


538
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,020
and apologize to you and Jin Mi
on behalf of Mother.


539
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,320
My daughter is too weak
and tired to meet anyone.


540
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,240
Her Majesty will be punished for her evil deeds.


541
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,240
You don’t have to apologize.


542
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,450
Please go back.


543
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,920
Mister Immortal.


544
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,860
As Mi was almost killed,


545
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,960
Mister Immortal is very mad now.


546
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,120
Don’t make it worse.


547
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,440
If you’re really good to her,


548
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,880
you’d better go back.


549
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,080
You’re so considerate here


550
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,120
to be a dutiful and virtuous son-in-law,


551
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,840
visiting here like coming your own palace.


552
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,840
Jin Mi is my future wife.


553
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,180
Since she is injured,


554
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,850
I will take good care of her for sure.


555
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,560
You don’t have to worry about her.


556
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,760
This is really


557
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,760
good for Jin Mi?


558
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,920
I really appreciate that


559
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,760
you two saved Jin Mi in a time of crisis.


560
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,920
Now Mi needs to recuperate


561
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
and she’ll decide


562
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,540
other matters herself


563
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,900
after she is recovered.


564
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,640
Mister Immortal.


565
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,880
I almost lost Mi.


566
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,800
Now I think


567
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,520
as long as Mi is safe, healthy


568
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,920
and happy,


569
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
nothing else matters.


570
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,040
Jin Mi,


571
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
how are you?


572
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,120
How about your injury?


573
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,340
Any better?


574
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,140
Just small injury.


575
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,270
I’m fine.


576
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,900
Don’t come again.


577
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,360
Why do you say that?


578
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,320
You come out


579
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,400
to ask me to get out again?


580
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,640
Follow me.


581
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
I have transferred my lifetime cultivation to you.


582
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,560
With the help of Glazed Pure Fire,


583
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,580
you must revitalize the Bird Family


584
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,300
and help my son Xu Feng


585
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,900
to succeed to the throne.


586
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,680
I will.


587
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,660
Xu Feng and the Bird Family will depend on you.


588
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,760
Don’t let me down.


589
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,540
Auntie,


590
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,160
I won’t let you down.


591
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,660
I know.


592
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,620
my mother harmed your mother.


593
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,900
I’m sorry for you.


594
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,320
Is that night meaningless to you?


595
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,820
It’s good that


596
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,940
you marry Sui He


597
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,600
and I marry Fish Fairy.


598
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,620
Then everyone is happy.


599
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,060
Who is happy?


600
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,220
Make it clear.


601
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,540
Sui He!


602
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,000
Liao Ting. Fei Xu.


603
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,360
Your Highness, is there any order?


604
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,000
Since when


605
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,219
can everyone come in and out
Qiwu Palace at will?


606
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,120
I’m sorry, Your Highness.


607
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,020
We don’t know


608
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,100
when Immortal Jin Mi came in either.


609
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,400
Jin Mi belongs to Qiwu Palace!


610
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,420
How dare you stop her!


611
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,699
I wonder why everyone of Qiwu Palace


612
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,199
is as silly as Lord Liaoyuan.


613
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,460
Your Highness, are you looking for me?


614
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,540
I want to know


615
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,659
whether Sui He visited me several days ago


616
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,400
when I was ill in bed.


617
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,739
Yes, she did.


618
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,780
She came here


619
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,480
and kept at your side every day


620
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,219
from day to night.


621
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,960
Who allowed her to come in?


622
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,960
You were injured and dizzy at the time.


623
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,900
Although you didn’t allow her to come in,


624
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,880
you didn’t forbid her to come in either.


625
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,679
Your Highness,


626
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,880
Princess Sui He


627
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,260
is an immortal


628
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,860
and your cousin.


629
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,000
She’s free to come in.


630
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,320
How can we stop her?


631
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,140
Well…


632
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,560
It’s improper to prevent her from coming in.


633
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,820
What are you talking about?


634
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,300
I never promise her anything.


635
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,300
Since today on,


636
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,100
nobody can come in without my permission.


637
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,140
Yes.


638
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:14,980
Yes.


639
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,500
You can leave.


640
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,600
Are you jealous?


641
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,320
No.


642
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,020
Jin Mi,


643
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,150
now my military leadership is removed,


644
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,570
Mother is in jail


645
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,040
and Father forces me to marry Sui He.


646
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,740
If you also change your mind,


647
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,960
I really can’t stand it.


648
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,840
You’re different


649
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,860
from your mother.


650
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,340
I won’t hate you.


651
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,920
But,


652
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,080
but


653
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,480
we can’t be together anymore.


654
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,460
I know.


655
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,900
My mother killed your mother.


656
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,820
I know


657
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,640
I don’t deserve you now,


658
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,860
but I want to atone for Mother’s crime.


659
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,100
I want to know


660
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,060
if you’re really willing to


661
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,620
marry Run Yu.


662
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,020
As long as Daddy and Fish Fairy are happy,


663
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,420
it’s all right.


664
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,960
If you’re happy,


665
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,700
I’ll give you my best wishes,


666
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,860
but I know you don’t love Run Yu.


667
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,240
If you marry him,


668
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,180
you won’t be happy.


669
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,700
Anyway we can’t be together.


670
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,680
If we are together,


671
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,100
Daddy and Fish Fairy will be sad.


672
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,300
If no,


673
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:31,940
I…


674
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,540
I…


675
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,780
I…


676
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,220
Don’t touch me.


677
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,040
I don’t know what happens to me.


678
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,680
I…


679
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,340
As long as you’re near me,


680
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,780
my heart hurts badly.


681
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,040
When you’re near me,


682
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,440
I feel miserable.


683
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,460
I don’t know why.


684
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,820
I have no way.


685
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,700
Stop following me.


686
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,680
Stop following me.
