
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 47"



00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,579
It seems you’re in good spirits today.



00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,300
What brings you here, Moon Immortal?



00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,460
I don’t want to



00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,820
stay in Heaven Realm any more.



00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,260
Ever since Run Yu became the Heavenly Emperor,



00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,360
Heaven Realm is as deserted as the Xuanji Palace.



00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,120
It’s the landscape here



00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,290
still with the feeling of warmth.



00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Moreover, Yuan Ji has left.



00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,140
Now I can talk to no one,



00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
so I come here to divert myself.



00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,260
Fairy Yuan Ji is in charge of the fates of human beings.



00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,820
Where has she gone?



00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,760
Experience hardships in Human Realm.



00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,680
She goes to Human Realm to experience hardships



00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,600
as a fairy in charge of the fates of human beings?



00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Does she observe the conditions of the people?



00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
She is shrewd.



00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,360
She won’t experience hardships herself.



00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
It's Run Yu,



00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,980
who is filled with hate.



00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,720
He keeps thinking about what Xu Feng and Jin Mi



00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,000
have experienced in Human Realm,



00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,160
so he made an excuse



00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,160
to send Yuan Ji in Human Realm too.



00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,360
Now



00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,560
nothing can stop him.



00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,079
Well, has Jin Mi regained consciousness?



00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,040
Don’t mention her.



00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,220
She has come to herself,



00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,920
so I don’t want to stay in Heaven Realm.



00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,940
She has come to herself?



00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,600
Why didn’t she summon me?



00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,800
You still want to meet her?



00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,760
Such a ungrateful one



00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,900
should be hacked to death,



00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,200
throw into Taihu Lake



00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,400
and be eaten by the catfish.



00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,200
I still don’t understand something.



00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
It’s known to all that



00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,880
she likes Xu Feng,



00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,980
but at last…



00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,600
Maybe



00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,760
she has made a choice



00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,440
between Xu Feng and Run Yu.



00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,360
Could it be...



00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,860
What?



00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,420
The late Heavenly Emperor
destroyed his own primordial spirit,



00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,660
but he was just poisoned
with the Evil Incense Ashes.



00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,700
Why was he so cruel to himself?



00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,459
He witnessed



00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,240
his son died



00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,120
and the other son seized the throne.



00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,220
Maybe he was utterly dissipated.



00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,460
He is to blame.



00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,380
If he didn’t destroy his own primordial spirit,



00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,980
he wouldn’t have come to this



00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,159
as he was protected by the Phoenix Hairpin.



00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,140
Strangely,



00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,900
after that day,



00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,159
Xu Feng’s Phoenix Hairpin was missing as well,



00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,860
leaving no hope for me.



00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,140
Run Yu is to blame.



00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,020
You know what,



00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,940
Run Yu is my brother.



00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,500
Su Li



00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,820
was my foster mother.



00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,180
What?



00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,380
I have suffered too many blows recently.



00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,540
You…



00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,280
You…



00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
But I didn’t help him seize the throne.



00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,600
I am different from him.



00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,620
But I have known Jin Mi for long.



00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,860
She stands to sense.



00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
I saved her by accident back then,



00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,420
and she insisted to return
the 1,000-thousnad-year magic power to me.



00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,050
So I think



00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,550
Xu Feng must have done something unforgettable.



00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,260
I think



00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,060
I shouldn’t stay here.



00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,280
All the people in the world are blind.



00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,680
I,



00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,800
I’d better go to experience hardships
in Human Realm with Yuan Ji.



00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,620
You’re old.



00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,220
You should have a benignant look.



00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,660
Jin Mi, I become an accomplice at last.



00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,720
How can I face you now?



00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Hope I can



00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,720
make it up to you in the future.



00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,460
"Qiwu Palace"



00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
Immortal.



00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,740
Where are Liao Ting and Fei Xu?



00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,500
Moon Immortal has summoned them.



00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,320
Can we help you?



00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,690
No need.



00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
I just want to walk around.



00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,260
I am putting on weight,



00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,320
but I find other parts don’t grow fat,



00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,400
except for this part.



00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,920
Phoenix flower blooms in two seasons.



00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,980
One brings fate,



00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,159
and the other takes away fate.



00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,360
People will part with each other eventually.



00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,539
Blooms and dead flowers will fall without exception.



00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,740
How could this happen?



00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,040
Come to life.



00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,940
Why are they dead?



00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,160
Why?



00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,480
Why are they dead?



00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,560
Why are they dead?



00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,640
Come to life.



00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Why are they dead?



00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
Come to life.



00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,400
How could this happen?



00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
Why are they dead?



00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,040
Jin Mi, what are you doing?



00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,500
He killed your father.



00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,680
He killed your father.



00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,940
It’s really you.



00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,860
How dare you come here?



00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,860
Fox Fairy, I…



00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,840
Stop that!



00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,080
I tried hard to bring you and Xu Feng together,



00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,420
but you took this opportunity to kill him.



00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,680
He killed my father.



00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,700
Impossible!



00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,820
He is not a man of that sort.



00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,340
I have known him since he was a little boy.



00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,340
I know him well.



00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
He wouldn’t do that.



00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,760
I don’t want to believe it,



00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,880
but it’s the truth.



00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,460
My father was killed by Glazed Pure Fire.



00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,220
Phoenix personally admitted that



00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,880
the matter was related to him.



00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,360
Moreover,



00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,320
the dream of the Beast of Dreams can prove it.



00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,760
I saw it personally.



00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,320
Dream?



00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,030
Just a dream?



00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,460
It is Phoenix’s real dream.



00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,280
He killed my father personally.



00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,380
How can you make sure it’s real?



00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,820
The real dream shows



00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,860
what one sees in the daytime.



00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,790
Seeing is believing.



00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,120
How could it be false?



00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,540
Seeing is not necessarily believing.



00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,120
I don’t believe it,



00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,820
because I just believe here.



00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
Even if the Heavenly River flew backward,



00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,240
Xu Feng would never be a murderer.



00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,200
Why do you bring me here secretly?



00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,180
Do you know



00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,680
who entered the Qiwu Palace?



00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,360
Who?



00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,220
Jin Mi.



00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,740
Jin Mi?



00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,720
How shameless she is.



00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,460
The Heavenly Emperor



00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,480
took care of her all the time
when she was in a coma,



00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,680
so we didn’t have any opportunity.



00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,140
Now she has come to herself



00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,500
and can go everywhere.



00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,260
I think



00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,480
it’s a good opportunity.



00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,860
What do you mean?



00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,160
The second Prince loved her dearly,



00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,140
but she killed him in return.



00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,300
The second Prince was nice to us.



00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,420
We must avenge him,



00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,540
or we will fail him.



00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,840
What’s your plan?



00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,100
Lead her to Linyuan Abyss and push her down.



00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,320
No.



00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,700
There are the spies of
the Heavenly Emperor everywhere.



00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,740
It’s too noticeable.



00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,840
I have an idea.



00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,100
Shoot it.



00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,200
First, we have to figure out



00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,880
where the Internal Dan essence is in her body.



00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,900
Then,



00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,380
we pretend to forgive her



00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,010
and ask her out to drink.



00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,610
While talking about the old days,



00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,640
make her drunk



00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,280
and stab her Internal Dan essence.



00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,600
Then she will die.



00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,600
Good idea.



00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,390
Let’s do it.



00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,380
-Go.
-Go.



00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,100
How do you figure out



00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,300
where the Internal Dan essence is in her body?



00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,980
Mister Immortal.



00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,500
If I knew you wanted to court death,



00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,760
I wouldn’t have saved you



00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
and taken you to the House of Marriage.



00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,460
If you really want to kill Jin Mi,



00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,000
the Heavenly Emperor won’t spare you.



00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,500
And I’ll also be implicated.



00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,880
Mister Immortal, she killed the second Prince.



00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,580
Yes.



00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,540
If you kill her,



00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,160
will Xu Feng come back to life?



00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,820
When I met her just now,



00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,940
I wanted to hack her to death.



00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,980
But it’s useless.



00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,840
Xu Feng won’t come back to life.



00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,300
It’s a doomed love affair.



00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,540
I shouldn’t have brought them together blindly.



00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,220
Mister Immortal, we…



00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,100
You’d better



00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,620
go back to the House of Marriage.



00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,150
You can’t hurt Jin Mi



00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,610
just by yourselves.



00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,140
Live a peaceful life from now one.



00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,760
Don’t implicate me.



00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,700
Yes.



00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,620
As a man sows, let him reap.



00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,960
No.



00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,900
I haven't made a mistake.



00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,420
No.



00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
I like you.



00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,940
I,



00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,650
I like you as well.



00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Fish Fairy?



00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,960
Kuang Lu?



00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,280
Fish Fairy, let’s be together this life.



00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,960
What do you think?



00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,160
OK.



00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,380
Don’t betray me.



00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,600
Jin Mi.



00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Tjhe Yun Elixir really cracks.



00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,880
Mi,



00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,440
sorry.



00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,099
Even if you don’t know what love is in this life,



00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,760
I don’t want to lose you.



00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,140
Forgive me, okay?



00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Fish Fairy. Mi.



00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,660
Sorry.



00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Fish Fairy,



00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,980
I like you.



00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
I like you as well.



00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,840
Fish Fairy,



00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,440
let’s be together this life.



00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,320
What do you think?



00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,160
I know it’s a dream,



00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,800
but I don’t want to wake up.



00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,840
Yun Elixir?



00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,300
What’s it?



00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,580
Is that the Yun Elixir?



00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,160
Why is it in my body?



00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,300
Why did Fish Fairy repair it without telling me?



00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,280
The flowers have been
arranged properly in Human Realm.



00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,680
Please do it for me.



00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,680
No problem.



00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,240
I’ll go to visit Jin Mi in Heaven Realm tomorrow.



00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
I wonder how she is.



00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,680
Chief Peony.



00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,840
Chief Peony.



00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,640
Little one…



00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,100
Little one is back.



00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,700
Jin Mi,



00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
you have avenged Water Immortal



00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,200
and Wind Immortal



00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,680
and done your filial duty.



00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,460
They don’t want to see you’re sad.



00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,780
You should bestir yourself.



00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,840
Chief Peony,



00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,520
I come



00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,160
to ask you something.



00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,300
What’s it?



00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,660
In front of my parents



00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,020
and Auntie Lin Xiu,



00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,100
please tell me the truth.



00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,160
What’s the origin of Yun Elixir in my body?



00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,080
How do you know about this?



00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
I accidentally saw it from
the dream of the Beast of Dreams.



00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,520
And I saw Run Yi repaired it.



00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,720
Repair?



00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,690
It’s gone.



00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,400
How could this be?



00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,980
Sure enough.



00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,940
It’s really related to Yun Elixir.



00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,040
After I stabbed Xu Feng to death that day,



00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,640
I was heartbroken



00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,580
and felt something exploded in my body.



00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,500
Phoenix!



00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,660
I thought I had such a feeling



00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,460
because I hated him deeply.



00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,920
Now it seems to be caused by Yun Elixir.



00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,060
But why is Yun Elixir in my body?



00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,820
Your mother gave it to you.



00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,660
My mother?



00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,900
She was lovesick



00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,680
and suffered much when she was alive.



00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,660
I love the Heavenly Emperor only.



00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Go back to marry Lin Xiu.



00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,620
So when you were born,



00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,560
she gave Yun Elixir to you.



00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,080
The one who takes Yun Elixir won’t fall in love.



00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,380
Without love, she will be strong



00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,340
and live a carefree life.



00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
This is the best blessing I can give her.



00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,700
You won’t fall in love.



00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,880
She hoped you could be strong



00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,880
and live a carefree life.



00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,880
It’s for your own good.



00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,320
She didn’t want you to repeat her mistake.



00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
Without love, I will be strong.



00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,160
Why did she think that?



00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
The current Heavenly Emperor



00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,380
doesn’t have an amorous nature as his father.



00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,360
We can see that



00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,540
he loves you only.



00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,010
You should cherish his love



00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,020
and don’t fail him.



00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,280
But I just



00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,560
feel guilty for Fish Fairy.



00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,140
You still miss Fire Immortal?



00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,020
I don’t know.



00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,940
I always miss him.



00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,360
As long as I miss him,



00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,700
I’ll feel pain in my heart



00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,200
and guilty.



00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,140
He killed my father.



00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,240
I fail my father.



00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,880
But,



00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,460
but I can’t control myself.



00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,220
As long as I close my eyes, he appears.



00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,560
I…



00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
The late lord didn’t want to see this,



00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,960
so she gave Yun Elixir to you.



00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,160
Since you have got rid of Yun Elixir,



00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,740
you have to suffer.



00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,440
Don’t think about rights and wrongs anymore.



00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,040
Now you’re Water Immortal with mighty power.



00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,440
The new Heavenly Emperor takes the throne
and enjoys a good reputation worldwide.



00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,240
He stands high in popular favor.



00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,520
You’ll become the new Heavenly Empress.



00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,380
Everything will go smoothly,
and you’ll have a good life afterwards.



00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,360
Mom,



00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,160
thank you for being considerate to me.



00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,360
But as my mom,



00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
you can’t deprive me of the right to love.



00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,640
I was controlled by Yun Elixir,



00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,500
so I did many stupid things



00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,980
as I was childish.



00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,700
Now I have got rid of Yun Elixir,



00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,740
so I can’t avoid love anymore.



00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,370
"Linyuan Tower"



00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,640
Get out.



00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,320
I can rest my heart



00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
as you lead a miserable life.



00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,760
You killed my mother,



00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,120
and your son killed my father.



00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,220
I killed Xu Feng



00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,060
to avenge my father.



00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,320
Avenge?



00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,260
For what?



00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,860
You killed my son?



00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,140
Yes.



00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,280
Xu,



00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,880
I told you repeatedly



00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,900
to leave this woman alone,



00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,040
but you didn’t listen to me



00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,640
and asked me



00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,600
whether I killed Luo Lin.



00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,900
What did you say?



00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,520
Did you ever fight against Water Immortal?



00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,100
What’s wrong with him?



00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,840
He and Wind Immortal were killed.



00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,220
Did this have something to do with you?



00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,300
Now Run Yu has lost his advantages.



00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,720
He won’t shake your standing
for the Heavenly Emperor



00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,240
even if he marries Jin Mi.



00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,760
Even the prison can’t keep your ambition.



00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
You thought you did these for me,



00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,120
but you just put me in an immoral situation.



00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,000
Impossible.



00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Son, how stupid you are.



00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,200
I tried every means to plan and prepare



00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,860
for you,



00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,380
but you



00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,320
trusted this woman.



00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,660
I’m the most sincerest to you in this world.



00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,780
If you listened to me,



00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,180
you wouldn’t be killed by her.



00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,460
I didn’t…



00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,060
I didn’t kill him by mistake.



00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,400
Tell me.



00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,660
If Xu Feng didn’t kill my father,



00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,420
then who killed my father?



00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,920
It’s me.



00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,360
Impossible.



00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,120
When my father died,



00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,900
you were in prison.



00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,120
You couldn’t kill him.



00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,060
The murderer must be someone else.



00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,480
Who is the murderer?



00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,700
Tell me.



00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,820
Listen.



00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,240
You will never know.



00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,080
I won’t tell you.



00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,580
Moon Immortal.



00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,040
Liao Ting, Fei Xu,



00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,080
drive her out.



00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,120
I may kill Phoenix by mistake.



00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,940
You want to reverse the case?



00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,280
You have wronged one.



00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,860
Don’t wrong anyone else.



00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,760
I know



00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,600
you hate me.



00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,560
I know you all hate me.



00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Don’t worry.



00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,620
If I find out the truth



00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,220
and really killed Phoenix by mistake,



00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,120
I’ll kill myself.



00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,220
It’s useless.



00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,300
If



00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,700
I really killed Phoenix by mistake,



00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,080
I don’t want to live alone.



00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,580
Even if you die,



00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,560
Xu Feng won’t come back to life.



00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,940
But,



00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,260
but Xu Feng can’t be wronged.



00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,340
"Pixiang Hall"
Hurry up. The guards will wake up soon.



00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,940
Mi, have you found it?



00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,180
Not yet.



00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,800
Where did you find it last time?



00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,960
Right there.



00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,180
Why can’t we find it?



00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,060
We can’t give up.



00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,120
Go on.



00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,600
Look for it separately.



00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,180
The ward.



00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,600
It’s sealed.



00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,100
It’s strange.



00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,000
Let me help you.



00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,900
How could this be possible?



00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,240
How could this be possible?



00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,680
The Beast of Dreams didn’t go to the Qiwu Palace.



00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,000
It stayed in my room.



00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,550
How could this be possible?



00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,670
It’s impossible.



00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,120
Jin Mi,



00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,620
what you have seen



00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,060
is your own dream.



00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,640
No.



00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,020
You suspected Xu Feng.



00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,360
You dreamed of what you though
in the day at night,



00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,080
so you had such a dream.



00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,500
Impossible.



00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,900
It’s different from what I saw before.



00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,820
It’s fake.



00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,820
It must be fake.



00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,560
The authenticity of the Dream Register
remains to be verified.



00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,180
No matter whether it tells the truth,



00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,060
someone must cause trouble.



00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,400
The blue one is a real dream.



00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,340
The blue dream is real.



00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,240
I…



00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,560
I didn’t witness my father’s death.



00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,500
So it’s not my dream.



00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,140
If it’s my dream,



00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,300
I must have an impression.



00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,500
Impossible.



00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,560
It’s not my dream.



00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,400
Impossible!



00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,980
Jin Mi,



00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,680
Maybe someone



00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,280
did something to the dream on purpose.



00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,260
Phoenix.



00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,860
I really wronged Phoenix?



00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,980
I killed him by mistake.



00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:19,960
Mi.



00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,240
-Immortal.
-Immortal.



00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,040
Immortal.



00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,460
Immortal.



00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,560
Immortal, you’re finally back.



00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,880
Where have you been?



00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,800
His Majesty is worried about you.



00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,980
Where is he?



00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,380
In the Qizheng Hall.



00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,420
Mi, I don’t see you all day.



00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
I’m quite worried about you.



00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,400
You just came to yourself,



00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,730
so you should have a good rest to recuperate.



00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,940
Before you recover completely,



00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,320
please don’t go around.



00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,520
If you really want to go out,



00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,040
take Kuang Lu with you.



00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,040
With her company,



00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,400
I can feel at ease.



00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I’m afraid



00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
I really wronged Xu Feng.



00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,660
Why did you say that?



00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,220
After my father was killed,



00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,440
I saw a dream from the Beast of Dreams.



00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,380
It was about Phoenix killing my father.



00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,320
I thought it was Phoenix’s real dream,



00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,940
but today



00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,640
I went to Pixiang Hall with Moon Immortal



00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,860
and found the record of the Beast of Dreams



00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,220
about that day.



00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,820
Then I found that



00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,120
the Beast of Dreams didn’t go to the Qiwu Palace.



00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,120
Instead, it stayed with me.



00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,740
Your Majesty,



00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,720
It wasn’t Xu Feng’s dream.



00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,300
It was my dream,



00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,420
but I didn’t see personally Phoenix killed my father.



00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,220
If I had that dream because I had a doubt,



00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,400
it should be a yellow imaginary dream.



00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,600
But I remember clearly



00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,520
I saw the blue real dream



00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,520
that day.



00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,280
So,



00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,760
so



00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
someone must have done something to that dream



00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,720
and turned the imaginary dream



00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,080
into the real dream.



00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,880
Who do you think did it?



00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,720
You led



00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,500
the Beast of Dreams there that day.



00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,920
Mi,



00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,540
to investigate the case of
the late Water Immortal’s death,



00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,920
I collected thousands of dreams.



00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,560
Before I checked them one by one,



00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,700
my father took them away and sealed them.



00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,120
I really didn’t see the dream you mentioned.



00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,360
The Chief of the Pixiang Hall



00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,900
is responsible for the files of Heaven Realm.



00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,620
He should have an impression



00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
whether it’s a yellow imaginary dream



00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,140
or a blue real dream.



00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,140
OK.



00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,300
I’ll call in him



00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,140
and ask him about it.



00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,800
"Qizheng Hall"



00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,620
Your Majesty,



00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,640
the Pixiang Hall reports that



00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,120
the chief committed suicide.



00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,140
Your Majesty.



00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,760
Your Majesty.



00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,160
Why are you scared?



00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,940
I saw Water Immortal



00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,680
wasn’t her usual self today,



00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,360
so I followed her secretly.



00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,960
I found that



00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,900
she and Moon Immortal



00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,520
slipped into the Pixiang Hall secretly.



00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,080
The Chief of the Pixiang Hall must die.



00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,640
"Pixiang Hall"



00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,360
Your Majesty.



00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,300
Why did he commit suicide?



00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,480
Your Majesty,



00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,100
this is a suicide note we just found.



00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,860
In the note, he confessed



00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,740
he changed the file without authorization.



00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,660
So he suicides for fear of punishment.



00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,500
Have you compared the handwriting?



00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,120
Yes, I did.



00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,420
It was really written by him.



00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,100
Since he committed suicide for fear of punishment,



00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,820
why did he take the trouble to



00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,900
write this note?
