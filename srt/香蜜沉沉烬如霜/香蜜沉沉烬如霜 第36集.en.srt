
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,540
"Episode 36"



00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,440
Jin Mi.



00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,560
Jin Mi.



00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
Have a look. I got something interesting.



00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,920
I didn’t expect that such a piece of thin paper



00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,500
can be made into a shape of phoenix.



00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,540
I planned to open it to have a look



00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,020
and learn the skill to make a paper phoenix.



00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,079
However, this paper phoenix



00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,660
is injected with magic power.



00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,240
We can’t open it.



00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,860
How amazing it is!



00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,860
Let’s meet and drink osmanthus wine together



00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,840
by Liuzi Pond tonight.



00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,200
What is written on it?



00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Did,



00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,140
did you hear



00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,180
or see anything?



00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,460
No.



00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,740
-I heard nothing.
-What did you hear?



00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,080
Nothing.



00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,040
I’m relieved then.



00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,840
Who are you?



00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,120
Princess of Bian City.



00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,960
I want to visit the Qiwu Palace.



00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,820
Your Highness.



00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,100
His Highness, Fire Immortal
has been grounded by His Majesty now.



00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,020
I’m afraid you can’t meet him.



00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
I have something important to tell him.



00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,260
It turns out that it was
the descendant of Spirit-Vanishing Family



00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,460
who assassinated Jin Mi.



00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,040
He’s Mu Ci, a member of Spirit-Vanishing Family.



00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,940
A member of Spirit-Vanishing Family?



00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,100
No wonder he has a Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.



00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,380
The Spirit-Vanishing Arrow is cast
with his bones and blood.



00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,720
Once it is made, it’ll cause
Nether Fury of Wangchuan River.



00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,260
If he isn’t threatened,



00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,480
he won’t cast the arrow at the risk of



00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,420
being spotted by the Demon Family.



00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Moreover,



00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,500
Mu Ci was absolutely not a person
who knew nothing of good or evil before.



00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,720
I just saw a shadow entering Zifangyun Palace.



00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Is Mother in danger?



00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Her Majesty is safe.



00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,880
But I overheard a conversation



00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,540
between that man and Her Majesty.



00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Her Majesty intentionally
sent you to Wangchuan River



00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
and wanted to



00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,440
kill Jin Mi furtively in the mortal world.



00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,480
If we can find the one
who has threatened Mu Ci,



00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
we can know who wants to kill Jin Mi.



00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
I can save Mu Ci as well.



00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,660
It’s concerning the life of Jin Mi.



00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,220
I’ll definitely find out the truth.



00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,560
But what Mu Ci has done…



00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,720
Xu Feng,



00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,220
can you spare his life for the sake of me



00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,740
as he once saved me
and is a man good by nature?



00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,519
I know without you,



00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,220
Jin Mi must have been dead.



00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,980
You saved her and I owed you a life.



00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,680
Don’t worry.



00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,320
If there is any message of Mu Ci,



00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,900
I’ll be sure to inform you of it in time.



00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,900
Thank you.



00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,420
One more thing,



00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,140
you must watch out for demon King of Gu City.



00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
When you experienced hardships
in the mortal world,



00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
he once wanted to seize the
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow to harm you.



00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,840
Fine.



00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,280
I haven’t seen him for a long time.



00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,980
Now I have become an immortal again.



00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,500
He’s less likely to harm me.



00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,960
I’ve got to go.



00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,820
Lord Liaoyuan.



00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Your Highness.



00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,920
Assist Princess Liu Ying



00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
in looking for Mu Ci in the dark.



00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,660
This may be related to Mother.



00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,740
Keep an eye on this



00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,300
and find Mu Ci as soon as possible.



00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,180
Send for Mother.



00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,100
Yes.



00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,820
Xu.



00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,860
You have suffered a lot.



00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,440
You can’t do that again.



00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,220
I can’t fall asleep at night



00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
when thinking about
your suffering in the mortal world.



00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,420
What’s more,



00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,900
others will surely gossip about you



00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,180
after you experienced hardships
with Jin Mi in the mortal world.



00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,760
Don’t ever do such a silly thing again.



00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,240
Even if they gossip about me,



00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,500
I’ll bear it.



00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,600
Nonsense.



00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,140
What’s special about Jin Mi?



00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,000
Why did you chase after her again and again?



00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
You can see that



00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,240
no matter whether I’m a mortal or an immortal,



00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,920
I only love Jin Mi.



00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,900
Don’t try to change my mind.



00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Did you forget?



00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,620
Did you forget the wedding day
of Run Yu and Jin Mi has been decided?



00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
If you keep acting recklessly,



00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,160
you’ll become a joke in the Heaven Realm.



00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,740
I’ve worked hard to pave the way for you.



00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,000
You can’t go on like that.



00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to ask you about something.



00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Is the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow



00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,620
related to you?



00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
All right.



00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,900
You question me today



00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,440
for Jin Mi.



00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,260
You really disappoint me.



00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,220
Do you want to break my heart?



00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Do you want to break my heart?



00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,820
Why did you insist on killing the one I love
with the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?



00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,980
Where did you get that rumor?



00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
How dare they slandered me
I’m related to the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?



00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,530
If you didn’t want to assassinate Jin Mi



00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,540
when she experienced hardships
in the mortal world,



00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,659
I wouldn’t have experienced hardships
in the mortal world too.



00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,659
If you killed Jin Mi,



00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,060
I would be dead too.



00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,960
How come you’re so stupid?



00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,720
I have to remind you that



00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,620
if you’re still



00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,220
obsessed with Jin Mi,



00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,160
you’ll regret someday.



00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,020
Since that Jin Mi is safe and sound now,



00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,180
I can let it go.



00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,100
If anything happens to Jin Mi,



00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,180
I’ll never turn a blind eye to it.



00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,240
You…



00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,020
Your Highness, please stay.



00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,680
Lord Liaoyuan, what’s going on?



00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
His Highness ordered me



00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
to assist you in looking for Mu Ci,



00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,180
but I have never seen Mu Ci,



00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,820
so I don’t know his look.



00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,060
Please instruct.



00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,960
I was confused. I even forgot it.



00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,820
Wait a minute.



00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,140
He usually wears a mask.



00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,659
Thank you, Your Highness.



00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,040
I should thank you.



00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,180
Thank you.



00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,440
My pleasure.



00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
His Highness told me



00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,100
he can’t go out freely,



00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,520
so I’m at your service.



00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,020
I’ll do my best to help you.



00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,110
Xu Feng is considerate and warmhearted.



00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,570
I can never repay his kindness.



00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,400
By the way, Your Highness,



00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,420
do you know this object?



00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,580
Where did you get this seal?



00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,980
When I experienced hardships
with His Highness in the mortal world,



00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,340
I helped a strange person by accident.



00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
This seal was given by that person.



00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,920
He even cast



00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,100
a following spell on it.



00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,460
When I was in the mortal world,



00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,200
it never left me.



00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,700
This spell wasn’t broken
until I returned to the heaven.



00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,120
It seems to be an object of
Demon Realm based on its shape.



00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,039
This seal



00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,020
is indeed made of
demon iron of Demon Realm,



00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,700
but I don’t know



00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,100
whom it belongs to.



00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,120
Since it is an object of Demon Realm,



00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,140
it’s better to be kept by you.



00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,060
No.



00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,460
This was given to you by others.



00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,080
How can I keep it for you?



00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,260
That man promised that



00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,900
I could fulfill a wish



00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,880
with this object,



00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
but I just did him a small favor



00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,840
and wanted nothing in return.



00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,980
You can bring it back to Demon Realm.



00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,720
Maybe you can meet its owner



00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,060
and return it to him



00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,220
or ask him to do you a favor
when you need it.



00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,900
It’s better for you to keep it.



00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,040
Fine.



00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,740
I’ll ask about it for you.



00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,380
Now you’re in the Heaven Realm.



00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,060
If you’re found by Xu Feng and others,



00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
you’ll be in great trouble.



00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,980
Go to hide in the
underground palace of the mortal world



00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,020
and don’t go out



00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,240
without my order.



00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,140
How about Autopsy Wild Silkworms?



00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes.



00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,560
How beautiful.



00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,760
How did you



00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,440
bring them to the Heaven Realm?



00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,960
I’ve cast a spell on them



00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,540
and they’ll never go off.



00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,140
You can visit Liuzi Pond
whenever you want.



00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
That one is so ugly.



00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,060
Why did you bring it here too?



00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,020
Instead, I feel this lantern



00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,360
is the most beautiful
among all the Phoenix Lanterns,



00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,260
because it contains our memory.



00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
This is the memory of Saint Girl and King Yi.



00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
What a beautiful view!



00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,480
It’ll be great



00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,540
if we can drink self-made osmanthus wine.



00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,510
In fact,



00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,020
before I descended to the mortal world,



00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,080
I buried osmanthus wine I made here.



00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,000
I dug it out several days ago.



00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,280
Let’s try your wine today.



00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,260
The wine you made
is indeed savory and mellow.



00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,640
I must have some skill
to live among six realms.



00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,280
Why are you staring at me like that?



00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,480
It’s great that



00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,360
I don’t need to look at you through the veil.



00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,680
<i>From the love letter, </i>



00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,520
<i>I find the places
where we will meet in each life.</i>



00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,540
<i>I will wait for you there…</i>



00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Is it beautiful?



00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,900
<i>From the love letter,</i>



00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,220
<i>I find the places
where we fell in love in each life.</i>



00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,660
<i>I will sing there, </i>



00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>



00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,620
<i>From the love letter, </i>



00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,750
<i>I find the places
where we made wishes in each life</i>



00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,980
<i>and plant a red lotus to perfume time.</i>



00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,680
<i>From the love letter, </i>



00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,640
<i>I find the places
where we fell in love in each life.</i>



00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,430
<i>I will sing there, </i>



00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,230
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>



00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,780
When in the mortal world,



00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,580
you promised to marry me.



00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,180
Will you keep your promise?



00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,560
But…



00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,000
What?



00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,820
But I’m engaged to Fish Fairy.



00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,580
What if you’re not engaged to him?



00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,380
Will you keep your promise?



00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,920
I’ll explain to Daddy



00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,340
and ask him to break off my engagement.



00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,220
By that time,



00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,360
by that time I’ll…



00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,440
What will you do?



00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,060
By that time



00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,240
I’ll keep my promise.



00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,560
Can you repeat



00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,720
what you said just now?



00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,560
I said



00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,800
by that time



00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,880
I’ll keep my promise.



00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,540
<i>I hope to wash away the vanity,</i>



00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
<i>wipe the dust on me</i>



00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,760
<i>and get drunk with you again</i>



00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,240
<i>with a pot of clear wine.</i>



00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,620
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>



00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,340
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>



00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:15,720
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>



00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,760
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>



00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,640
"Qiwu Palace"



00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,660
Xu Feng, you’re so delighted.



00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,380
It seems that



00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,900
you’re glad to get grounded.



00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,220
Stop joking.



00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,720
Tell me what happened to you.



00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,580
You think too much.



00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,830
Tell me.



00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,830
Something good must have happened.



00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,860
Uncle,



00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,740
I have something to ask you today.



00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,840
Go ahead.



00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,900
It’s about the birth mother of Night Immortal.



00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,940
Can you tell me in detail?



00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
King of Gu City doesn’t know
you have returned to Demon Realm.



00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,600
I think you can’t hide from him for a long time.



00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,480
You’d better stay away from here.



00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,600
Why should I leave?



00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,710
I must report it to Demon Lord



00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,800
and ask Demon Lord to deal with King of Gu City.



00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,000
King of Gu City is very flattering



00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,480
and trusted by Demon Lord.



00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,340
Do you think Demon Lord will punish him?



00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,770
It makes sense.



00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,940
That good-for-nothing is
never able to distinguish right and wrong.



00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,680
Nonsense.



00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,570
Leave with me.



00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,620
I have a lot of things to handle in the Demon Realm



00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,450
and can’t leave.



00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,020
King of Gu City



00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,740
won’t let you go.



00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,820
He always wants to defeat you.



00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,310
I won’t be defeated by him.



00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,050
Who is that?



00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,770
Mu Ci.



00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,970
His Highness said



00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,850
this man is temporarily handed over to you.



00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,510
Hope you can look after him.



00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,450
If the heaven court needs his witnesses,



00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,620
he should speak the truth.



00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,200
I’m extremely grateful to His Highness.



00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,570
Please tell His Highness



00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,680
I won’t disappoint him.



00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,570
Thank you.



00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,540
I’m leaving.



00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,000
It seems that no one can leave now.



00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,820
Father,



00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,450
what on earth happened to Mu Ci?



00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,420
Autopsy Wild Silkworms are planted in his body.



00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,280
Autopsy Wild Silkworms?



00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,710
Can they be removed?



00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,310
This magic



00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,940
is said to continue the life of someone dying.



00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,970
When the silkworms exist, he exists, or he’ll die.



00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,000
Autopsy Wild Silkworms are
divided into the child and the mother.



00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,680
The mother must be fed with



00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,140
the blood of the silkworm keeper regularly



00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,910
and then the mother will feed



00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
the child planted in the body of the host.



00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,170
If the child can’t be fed regularly,



00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,140
it’ll absorb the magic power of the host.



00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,620
To completely remove Autopsy Wild Silkworms,



00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,370
fire magic is needed to refine the child,



00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,850
but I’m afraid that



00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,970
the host can’t live long in this case.



00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,850
Looking at his situation,



00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,080
I think Autopsy Wild Silkworms



00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,710
have absorbed his magic power.



00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,310
He’s indeed forced to do that.



00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,880
Father,



00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,940
what should we do now?



00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,800
Now



00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,940
I can only control his situation
for the time being,



00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,860
but if the child of



00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,000
Autopsy Wild Silkworms can’t be fed,



00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,250
I’m afraid…



00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,680
Who is so cruel



00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,600
to use such vicious Autopsy Wild Silkworms



00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,620
to control Mu Ci?



00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,170
Autopsy Wild Silkworms



00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,460
can only be fed with the blood



00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,450
of those with strong fire magic,



00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,770
and can’t be used by others.



00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,540
Those with strong fire magic



00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,850
are all in the Heaven Realm.



00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Honey,



00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,140
I know you like Mu Ci sincerely,



00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,370
but he is a member of
Spirit-Vanishing Family after all.



00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,850
What’s more, he’s somehow



00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,510
related to the Heaven Realm now.



00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,800
I just want to ask you a question.



00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,420
Do you really want to keep him here?



00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,420
Father,



00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,170
I must get the former Mu Ci back.



00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,480
I got it.



00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,600
I’ll figure out a way.



00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,880
You’re safe in the mansion



00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,020
as it is full of our trusted followers,



00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,370
but when you get out alone,



00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,910
you must be more careful



00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,510
and not let others of the Demon Realm



00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,110
know Mu Ci is here.



00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,540
Otherwise,



00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,280
not only Mu Ci, but also we will be in danger.



00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,370
Do you understand?



00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,910
Yes.



00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,800
Thank you, Father.



00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,340
Why do you remove it?



00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,010
We can play chess.



00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,800
When we play chess,



00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,080
it is always the case that
you win one game and I win one game.



00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,800
It’s not surprising at all,



00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,110
so it’s meaningless.



00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,400
Fine.



00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,050
I’m here



00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,510
to drink with you today.



00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,220
I’ve known



00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
what happened to your birth mother.



00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,910
I want to make an apology for Mother



00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,600
with this glass of wine.



00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,420
I’m in deep mourning



00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,480
and can’t drink.



00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,370
Sorry.



00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,110
Mother



00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,740
just killed



00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,220
an insignificant sinner.



00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,940
You don’t have to make an apology.



00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,020
I know you feel bad.



00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,170
Your birth mother…



00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,600
You know nothing.



00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,770
It’s better not to know it.



00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,880
You’re still grounded.



00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,800
Don’t make Father and Mother
unhappy again.



00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,740
Go back.



00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,080
I want to speak my mind to you.



00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,570
I don’t agree with what Mother has done.



00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,740
I venture to say that



00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,280
both of our mothers



00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,080
planned for us after all.



00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,420
They loved us in a wrong way.



00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,340
I think you also have fully the same feeling.



00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,540
I’m not interested in



00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,450
the way of the heaven emperor
paved by Mother at all.



00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,880
You’re better and more reliable than me.



00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,740
I’ll follow you



00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,400
and submit myself to your rule in the future.



00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,400
I hope



00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,850
you can forgive Mother.



00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,400
Xu Feng,



00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,020
I appreciate



00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,370
what you said,



00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,480
but



00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,340
you’re not here



00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,910
only for this matter, right?



00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,400
Can you do me a favor?



00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,000
Jin Mi?



00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,000
You seem to like



00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,170
my fiancée very much.



00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,540
I hope you can call off
the engagement with Jin Mi.



00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,600
I won’t compete with you



00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,020
for the authority of the Heaven Realm,



00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,910
and I’ll also make up for Mother’s errors.



00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,450
I only hope you can give up Jin Mi.



00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,340
The marriage between Jin Mi and me



00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,370
was arranged by Father and Water Immortal.



00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,020
I have no right to give it up,



00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
and,



00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,340
the authority of the Heaven Realm



00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,080
is always mastered by Father and Mother.



00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,250
You can’t determine it,



00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,570
whether you’re willing or not.



00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,170
Do you know?



00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,450
Jin Mi and I love each other.



00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,450
You won’t be happy if you’re together.



00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,880
Give me,



00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,540
or grab from me.



00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,260
I always live on the alms



00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,220
given by Mother and you.



00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,140
You always determine what to give me



00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,310
or what to grab from me,



00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,420
and then I must accept it.



00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,600
From now on,



00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,140
I’ll be the dominator of my fate.



00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,170
From now on,



00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,880
I’ll make a decision freely.



00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,540
I won’t absolutely



00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,280
give up Jin Mi.



00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,620
This is Daddy’s gift,



00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,620
and this is Auntie Lin Xiu’s.



00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,510
Do I need to present something to Phoenix?



00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,140
After all, he was willing



00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,080
to die for me.



00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,880
What should I present to him?



00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,480
I have an idea.



00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,170
Phoenix, I’ll present you
one petal of my real body,



00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,620
which can show you the spring flowers
and autumn fruits for a moment.



00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,370
Auntie Lin Xiu, here you are.



00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,120
This is Ganoderma Nourishing Skin Ointment,



00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,620
which can nourish and moisten your skin.



00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,310
You must consume much energy while working.



00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,940
You can firm your essence
and strengthen your vigor after eating it.



00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,110
Thank you, Mi.



00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,220
What’s wrong with you?



00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,200
You hurt your primordial spirit in the practice?



00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,620
It’s not serious.



00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,400
Daddy should be to blame for it.



00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,710
He always urges me to practice



00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,200
after I return from the mortal world.



00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,310
Well,



00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,220
this is yours.



00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,370
Are you happy?



00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,440
This is Ginseng Fleece-flower Root Ointment,



00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,370
which can blacken hair, prolong life,
enrich and benefit essence and blood.



00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,680
It’s suitable for you.



00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,800
After you return,



00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,310
when did I urge you to practice?



00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,480
All these are prepared by you?



00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,650
Good.



00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,740
You know how to care about others.



00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,340
You finally grow up after
experiencing hardships in the mortal world.



00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,740
In fact, I gained a lot



00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,140
after returning from the mortal world.



00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,280
I experienced parting forever,



00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,850
sought but failed, loved but parted,



00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,430
witnessed the life and death



00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,970
and was disillusioned with the mortal world.



00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,400
I seem



00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,940
to know many things overnight.



00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,000
What did you learn?



00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,110
Nothing special.



00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,970
Have some tea, Daddy.



00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,110
Good girl.



00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,220
Auntie Lin Xiu,



00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,080
recently,



00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,170
I heard from some talkative fairies that



00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,080
Fairy Wen Yue wanted to
get back her marriage contract



00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,220
from Immortal Meng Zhang.



00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,250
Is it true?



00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,020
I didn’t hear of it.



00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,630
They have been engaged with each other.



00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,380
It’s impossible to get back the marriage contract.



00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,570
Daddy,



00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,370
in the Heaven Realm,



00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,800
can we get back



00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,710
the established marriage contract?



00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,800
You want to call off
the engagement with Night Immortal?



00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,850
Fish Fairy’s mom is just dead.



00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,310
I can’t propose it now,



00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,680
but…



00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,770
Let’s go to



00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,940
visit your mom later.



00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,650
In front of your mom’s memorial tablet,



00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,140
tell me the truth.



00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,400
Did you refuse the appointment of Floral Immortal



00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,690
for Fire Immortal?



00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,620
Yes, Daddy.



00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,020
I’ve promised



00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,770
to be with him.



00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,250
I know



00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,650
there was an unforgettable love
between Xu Feng and you



00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,970
when experiencing hardships in the mortal world,



00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,650
but it’s just an insignificant memory



00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,680
in your life.



00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,050
No, Daddy.



00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,050
Although my lifetime in the mortal world



00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,770
seems to be very short



00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,480
in the Heaven Realm,



00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,310
but I bear it in mind.



00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,020
In the mortal world,



00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,880
I didn’t regret to be buried with Xu Feng,



00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,140
so did he.



00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,370
I think it’s love.



00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,110
The love between my mom and you



00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,540
was also the same.



00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,400
For the sake of her,



00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,620
you were also willing to give up everything.



00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,820
It’s easy to be in love,



00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,680
but this case is not as simple as you think.



00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,600
Her Majesty,



00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,710
she is merciless.



00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,850
In the mortal world,



00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,480
I witnessed she killed Night Immortal’s mom.



00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,820
She’s so cruel.



00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,110
If you’re with Xu Feng,



00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,540
you’ll suffer.



00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,080
Daddy,



00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,800
I know,



00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,940
but I’ll face such problems sooner or later.



00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,880
Now that I’ve decided,



00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,170
I won’t avoid them.



00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,970
I don’t want you
to follow in your mom’s footsteps.



00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,800
Daddy,



00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,770
those are the past things.



00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,080
They won’t



00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,250
happen again.



00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,540
As an immortal,



00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,340
if I can’t protect



00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,140
and be with the one I want,



00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,280
my life will be meaningless.



00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,020
I’d rather be a mortal in the mortal world.



00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,970
Although my life won’t be long,



00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,420
I can live heartily



00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,020
and happily.



00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,450
Not everything



00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,740
can be solved with enthusiasm.



00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,400
But how can we solve problems



00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
without enthusiasm?



00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,820
It still needs to be thought deeply.



00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,220
Before having a solution,



00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,170
you can’t be impetuous.



00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,620
I see, Daddy.



00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,200
Help me.



00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,680
Your Highness.



00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,110
Mu Ci.



00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,940
Help me.



00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:58,910
Your Highness.



00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,170
Have you fed the medicine
given by the demon doctor to him?



00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,200
Your Highness,



00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,850
we have fed the medicine to him
according to the demon doctor’s instructions.



00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,050
But it doesn’t help at all.



00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,050
Why?



00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,370
Give me. Give me.



00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,000
OK, I’ll give you the medicine.



00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,310
I’ll bring it here.



00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,400
Is there any other medicine?



00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,860
Bring me all the medicine.



00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,650
Bring it here.



00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,820
Wild Silkworms.



00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,880
What’s it?



00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,739
Your Majesty.



00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,880
Your Majesty, forgive me.



00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,540
I’m wrong.



00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,969
It seems that



00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,620
Mi really falls in love with Fire Immortal.



00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,739
She’s not serious.



00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,800
She liked Night Immortal before.



00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
She grew up after this experience



00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,200
but she also changed her mind.



00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,650
Maybe she’ll change
her mind again in the future.



00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,650
We must stop her from acting recklessly



00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,540
for the time being.



00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,280
I think Mi is serious this time.



00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,110
You also hope



00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,110
she can marry the one she loves.



00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,220
You worry about Her Majesty?



00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,450
Although Fire Immortal
is different from Her Majesty,



00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,600
after all,



00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,000
she is his mother.



00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,370
Her Majesty won’t live with Mi in peace.



00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,770
If she wants to hurt Jin Mi in the future,



00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,880
what will Fire Immortal do?



00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,710
I worry



00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,770
Mi can’t deal with her relationships
with Fire Immortal and Night Immortal.



00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,370
Both of them are unyielding,



00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,200
so they won’t give up Mi easily.



00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,940
They behave like



00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,710
young Heavenly Emperor.



00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,250
Zi Fen suffered a lot because of His Majesty.



00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,770
I absolutely won’t



00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,400
let Jin Mi follow in her mother’s footsteps.



00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,280
After this experience,



00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,570
I think Fire Immortal deeply loves Mi.



00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,400
He is different from his dad.



00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,480
His Majesty also deeply loved Zi Fen,



00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,080
but it was just obsession,



00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,140
which could kill others.



00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,650
His Majesty couldn’t be with Zi Fen,



00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,170
so he hurt so many people,



00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,480
but even if he was with Zi Fen,



00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,170
the world couldn’t be peaceful, either.



00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,770
"Qizheng Hall"



00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,170
According to Her Majesty’s instructions,



00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,650
when you’re in mourning,



00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,160
you can stay in Xuanji Palace



00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,050
and don’t need to go out
to be on night duty for star arrangement.



00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,970
Yes.



00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,800
Her Majesty shows solicitude for you,



00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,600
so we’re specially ordered



00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,710
to send you two kinds of
different mourning dresses



00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,740
for selection.



00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,970
Put them down.



00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,570
Her Majesty said



00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,770
you can decide



00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,510
to choose the one of Heaven Realm
or that of Arowana Family,



00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,740
and then we need to take the other one back.
