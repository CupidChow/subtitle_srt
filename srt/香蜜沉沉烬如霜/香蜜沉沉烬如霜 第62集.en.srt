"Ashes of Love"



00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 62"



00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,820
Fine, fine.



00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,540
As a fruit,



00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,250
I'll not argue with birds like you.



00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,820
Phoenix,



00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,400
I love you.



00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,110
Now that you are gone,



00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,080
Is there any reason for me to live alone in the world?



00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,420
I'm Jin Mi.



00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,850
If you marry me in the future,



00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,850
you may need to suffer some grievances.



00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,740
Will you mind it?



00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,450
I won't.



00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,780
"Imperial Decree of My Sins"



00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,910
Can we go back to the past?



00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,910
No, we can't.



00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,450
Perhaps,



00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,110
we can make a fresh start.



00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Jin Mi.



00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,910
Ever since Jin Mi has gone,



00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,080
he's always been like this.



00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,310
He doesn’t say a word,



00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,310
and looks neither like an immortal nor a demon,



00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,080
just drowning his sorrows all day.



00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,820
Xu Feng,



00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,050
the Chief Peony has come to see you.



00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,450
I'm the one who should be blamed for Jin Mi’s death.



00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm sorry for her.



00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,710
I'm sorry for Floral Realm too.



00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,510
Don't say that, just get up.



00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,050
Come on.



00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,650
When the former Floral Immortal gave birth to Jin Mi,



00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,480
she entrusted her to us.



00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
We didn't take good care of her.



00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,420
To say who should be blamed,



00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
we should be the one to bear the unpardonable sin.



00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,340
I'm the one who killed Jin Mi.



00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,220
It's all my faults.



00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,940
These days,



00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,250
I've thought many things about Jin Mi.



00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,250
Since the love doom is unavoidable,



00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,740
there are a few things I should let you know.



00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,310
Love doom?



00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,310
I'm all ears.



00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,310
In the last days, the former Floral Immortal



00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,060
has predicted that



00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,080
Jin Mi would have to go through
a love doom within ten thousand years.



00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
That may be life threatening.



00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,400
So Jin Mi took the Yun Elixir at birth



00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,400
to cut off her love.



00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,420
At the night of Run Yu's mutiny,



00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,480
she spit the Yun Elixir out after killing you by mistake.



00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,340
I remember clearly



00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,570
that when I was at death's door,



00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,710
you said a word to me.



00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,370
Never.



00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,310
I still hold it as sacred by now



00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,799
and bear it in mind.



00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,370
That's because I ate the Yun Elixir.



00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,570
I have cut my love feelings since I was born.



00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,510
I didn't know what love was at that time.



00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,740
Yun Elixir?



00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,740
It is true.



00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,050
The former Floral Immortal was intended to



00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,880
protect her from the suffering of love and affection,



00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,200
but didn't think this love doom



00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,220
couldn't be avoided in the end.



00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,280
So I'm the love doom of Jin Mi.



00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,170
I let her be bothered by love and hurt by affection,



00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,620
and finally fall into infinity.



00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,200
I only thought she was cold-blooded.



00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,450
It turns out she was affectionate but didn't realize that.



00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,450
She didn't know that at all.



00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,310
And I also never tried to know her.



00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,650
I failed her.



00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,020
In the past, I abided by the teachings
of the former Floral Immortal



00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,650
and blindly stood in the way between you and Jin Mi.



00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,310
I've come to understand it over these years.



00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,940
You and Jin Mi really have a
transcendent and rare predestined relationship.



00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
Your affection is deep and strong.



00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,940
Now if I want to save the situation,



00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,450
I can only put my hope on you.



00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,280
You mean there's a hope to save Jin Mi?



00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,850
What's your idea, Chief Peony?



00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,850
I'll be willing to go all out.



00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,880
It's just



00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,220
a glimmer of hope.



00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,540
The former Water Immortal
told me one thing when he was alive.



00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,680
He had taken Jin Mi to see the Xuan Ling Lord Doumu,



00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,510
who had then predicted



00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,200
what happened today.



00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
She also gave incense ashes to protect Jin Mi.



00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Perhaps,



00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,540
she knows the way to help Jin Mi to revive.



00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,200
I beg you



00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,940
to remove the Garan Seal for my daughter.



00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,940
She is a dying person.



00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,220
There is no difference to unlock the Garan Seal.



00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,770
May the incense ashes help you go through the doom.



00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,680
That's great.



00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,910
It's always good to have another way out.



00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,050
Great.



00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,850
I'll go and see the Lord Doumu immediately.



00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,570
My respects, Lord Doumu.



00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,940
You don't have to beg.



00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,000
If you can do it, you don't need to beg to make it.



00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,000
If you can't,



00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,250
you'll fail even you beg for thousands of times.



00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,310
I know that.



00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,020
The consequences I caused myself



00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,650
shall be taken by myself.



00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,400
But,



00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,170
I can't let go of it.



00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,280
She has stuck in my mind



00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,420
that I always think



00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,140
it would be good to see her for another glance.



00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,850
Even



00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,570
hearing a word from her would be fine.



00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,280
You also know that a glance or a word



00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,620
can't remove your sorrow.



00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,110
Even ten thousand glances and ten thousand words



00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,450
will not make you contented.



00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,370
The destiny is preordained by the Heaven.



00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,200
Since you got such result, there must be a cause for it.



00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,140
You can't go against the way of Heaven,
why do you insist like this?



00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,310
These days,



00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,420
although I know she is dead,



00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,600
but I don't know why



00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,200
I always feel that she is right by my side.



00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,570
I have no other demands today,



00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,820
but please give me some suggestions.



00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,080
She may be not living



00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,800
but she may be not dead, either.



00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,820
In Heaven Realm, Human Realm and Demon Realm,



00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,420
the different manifestations of all living creatures,
including love, hatred, sadness and misery,



00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,420
are just wild fancy



00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,880
and a delusion.



00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
It's close at your sight.



00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,620
What you see in your eyes
is right what you see in your mind.



00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,140
What you see is exactly what she sees,



00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,910
and what she sees is exactly what you see.



00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,910
I don't quite understand.



00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,600
Is there a slim chance of survival for Jin Mi?



00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,970
You two meet and break up again and again,
and your fate begins and ends.



00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,710
The destiny has been preordained.



00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,480
In this world,



00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,450
you miss each other but can't see each other.



00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,600
you love each other but can't be together.



00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,800
The fate has ended but you still hold together.



00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,110
The fate has extinguished but you're not apart.



00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,110
That is destiny.



00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,200
Where can I find the primordial spirit of Jin Mi.



00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,110
If you can't attain enlightenment,
the door of your wisdom won't open;



00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,480
if you can, the door of your wisdom will open.



00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,620
Thank you for your suggestion.



00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,170
Here is the letter from Xu Feng.



00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,340
Lord Doumu has reckoned that
some primordial spirit of Jin Mi



00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,250
still survives in the world.



00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,400
He has set out to find it.



00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,650
Go tell the other chiefs



00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,740
that we'll retreat



00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
and use all forces of Floral Realm to look for it.



00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,170
I'll go immediately.



00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,820
All flowers and trees in the six realms
listen to my order now.



00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,020
You should try your best to
search for Jin Mi's primordial spirit from now on.



00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,940
Once Jin Mi's primordial spirit is found,



00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,600
we should open the Time Gallery,



00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,080
trying everything to save Jin Mi.



00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,970
Jin Mi.



00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,200
Where are you?



00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,880
You can't ask where her soul is,
and the way to the netherworld is long and deep.



00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,600
Great.



00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,600
Why do you say it's great?



00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,340
She got away and attained great ease.



00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,940
You're not her,



00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,140
how do you know she attained great ease?



00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,140
With her own power,



00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,400
she suppressed the war
between the Heaven and the Demon.



00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,620
Don’t you think it is a great wisdom and great ease?



00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,080
You're right.



00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,480
She was the most intelligent.



00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,480
But when she was alive,



00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,110
I never praised her.



00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,680
The tables are turned.



00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,450
She searched for you that year,



00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,680
and now you are looking for her.



00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,170
Why do you always have to leave your eternal regrets



00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,910
in the Wangchuan River with endless sorrow and misery?



00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,340
Phoenix.



00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Phoenix.



00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,780
Phoenix.



00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,900
Please turn around and take a look at me, Phoenix.



00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,220
Phoenix.



00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,340
Phoenix.



00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,420
Jin Mi.



00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Where are you?



00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,850
Jin Mi.



00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,080
Jin Mi.



00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,620
Jin Mi.



00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,420
Don't go.



00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,540
Jin Mi.



00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,910
Jin Mi.



00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,910
Jin Mi.



00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,820
Jin Mi.



00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,000
Jin Mi.



00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Jin Mi! Don't go.



00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,540
Don't go.



00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,110
Don't go.



00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,770
Xu Feng, have you thought clearly?



00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,540
I've made up my mind that I’m going to find Jin Mi.



00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,800
I trust Demon Realm to you.



00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,170
When you find Jin Mi,



00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,020
I’ll return Demon Realm intact to you.



00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,280
There's no need.



00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,280
There's nothing



00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,310
more important than her.



00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,250
My respect, my lord.



00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,480
The destiny is preordained by the Heaven.



00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,970
Since you got such result, there must be a cause for it.



00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,800
What you see in your eyes
is right what you see in your mind.



00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
What you see is exactly what she sees,



00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,050
and what she sees is exactly what you see.



00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,710
Jin Mi.



00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,600
Jin Mi.



00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,250
I'll take you to see the Aurora in Demon Realm,



00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,110
experience the glittering lights in Human Realm,



00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,970
feel the beauty of four seasons in Floral Realm,



00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,970
and taste all the fine food in the six realms.



00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,170
Jin Mi.



00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,910
I don't believe you're still willing to leave me



00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,910
and the world.



00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,220
In this world, you miss each other
but can't see each other.



00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,570
The fate has ended but you still hold together.



00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,940
The fate has extinguished but you're not apart.



00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,910
Jin Mi.



00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,650
If the time can turn backwards,



00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,080
I'd rather not see you,



00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,080
not miss you,



00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,080
not love you,



00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,080
and not fail you.



00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,280
I only hope



00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,280
you're safe and sound in this world.



00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,140
But you...



00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,850
Where are you in the end?



00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,620
Jin Mi.



00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,620
Do you remember the place we declared our love?



00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,730
The life in the mountain is easy;



00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,150
while the prosperous world
has gone through thousands of years



00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,150
At that time,



00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,860
both you and I were mortal.



00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,860
We were carefree,



00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,400
and we felt the pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy.



00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,620
We had no Yun Elixir and misunderstanding,



00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,110
nor hatred.



00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,000
But we had the beautiful days we spent together,



00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,420
and the most sincere feelings we shared together.



00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,770
I miss those days very much.



00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,330
I am thinking that when you come back,



00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,440
we'll live as a mortal couple



00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,880
that we’ll help and love each other,



00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,550
and grow old together.



00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,770
Okay?



00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,110
I'll be waiting for you right here.



00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,400
Wait for you to come back.



00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,750
Your Highness!



00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,240
I've already joined Demon Realm.



00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,020
I have nothing to do with Heaven Realm anymore.



00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,170
Your Highness!



00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,680
I can't afford it.



00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,680
Your Highness,



00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
we come here today



00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,680
to bother your Highness!



00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,040
That's because we have
important things to discuss with you.



00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,680
Heaven Realm and Demon Realm are at daggers drawn.



00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,740
We'll just have disagreeable conversation.



00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,700
There is no need to discuss.



00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,170
I heard that your Highness
have resigned as the Demon Lord.



00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,680
This time,



00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,680
we come to beg you



00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,570
to return to Heaven Realm and take over the reins.



00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,260
Isn't there a person in charge in Heaven Realm?



00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,280
His Majesty practiced the forbidden technique



00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,860
and started the war between Heaven and Demon.



00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,330
He doesn’t deserve the place by virtue.



00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,150
I'm afraid there'll be a disaster.



00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,400
Days ago,



00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,730
his Majesty has



00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,970
announced his own sins through an edict.



00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,840
We would like to support your Highness as the Lord.



00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,600
And I hope your Highness will bury the hatchet



00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,350
and put the Heaven in the right way.



00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,350
Your Highness.



00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,880
Your Highness.



00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,440
You came in just right time.



00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,370
Come on.



00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,110
Do it.



00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,220
Kill it.



00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,860
Kill it.



00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,110
Your Highness.



00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,130
Your Highness. Don't do it.



00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,860
He's locked himself up.



00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,510
He won’t hurt anybody else.



00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,420
Your Highness, I beg you.



00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,220
He's got nothing now.



00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,510
Kill it now.



00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,510
If you want to make his Majesty



00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,040
to be a walking dead body



00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,040
You just stop me.



00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,840
Your Majesty!



00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,440
Your Majesty.



00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,170
Your Majesty.



00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
How much more room have you left for maneuver?



00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,420
Your Highness, I beg you.



00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,460
You spare his Majesty, I beg you.



00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,150
You asked the Supreme Lord Lao to see me.



00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,420
You let them overthrow our father at that time.



00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,820
And today you let them overthrow you again.



00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,080
Where exactly are you going to put yourself?



00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,260
What do you think they should do now?



00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,510
In my lifetime,



00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,950
I hate betrayal most.



00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,820
Have you ever thought that



00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,060
the Heavenly Emperor changes,
the courtiers will change too.



00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,130
How do you want me to do with this bunch of betrayers?



00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,550
You won't.



00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,660
From beginning to end,



00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,110
it was all my fault.



00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,260
The immortals were not involved in it.



00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,130
By now,



00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,660
do you still think that



00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,440
everybody is your chess



00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,440
that controlled by you



00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,130
and maneuvered by you.



00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,130
What do you think the throne of Heavenly Emperor is?



00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not what you want to
usurp and abandon as you wish.



00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,000
You've endured hardships for
thousands of years to accomplish your ambition.



00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,660
When you took your revenge



00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,620
and enjoyed yourself enough as the Heavenly Emperor,



00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,530
you want to walk away.



00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,460
In the world,



00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,570
how could there be such a good deal?



00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,460
Kuang Lu, you can leave now.



00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,180
I stole what was entrusted to my care,



00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,460
practiced the forbidden technique secretly,



00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,860
started the war,



00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,220
and plunged the people into an abyss of misery.



00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,040
I violated the law of the Heaven.



00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,770
And now



00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,080
someone should stand out



00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,910
to initiate the useful and do away with the harmful.



00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,400
You’re fire and I’m water. We are Incompatible.



00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,640
But we're both sons of our father.



00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,420
If you stand out and bring order out of chaos,



00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,820
that would be the best.



00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,350
You've always led an honest and clean life,



00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,840
you don't even care the eternal infamy now?



00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,840
I’ve lived a solitude life.



00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,020
My body and my primordial spirit will extinguish.



00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,020
The undeserved reputation,



00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,020
power and position



00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,770
are merely as transient as a fleeting cloud to me.



00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,660
How do I fear the infamy after death?



00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,400
What I thought and schemed in the past



00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,130
was just to seek justice and take revenge.



00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,440
As for killing our father and usurping the throne



00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,930
and imprisoning the Heavenly Empress,



00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,910
I have no regrets by now.



00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,710
All what I said is just personal hatred.



00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,060
I can't ruin Heaven Realm.



00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,060
The public utility can't serve personal interests.



00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,710
Right now,



00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,219
it's time to make things right again.



00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,150
You're talented and outstanding,
but you're also forthright.



00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,550
You've made a lot of enemies in Heaven Realm.



00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,620
Overthrow my tyranny and kill me.



00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,620
It will be a meritorious deed.



00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,400
After that,



00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,679
you can choose the able and
virtuous immortals to establish your court,



00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,679
and support you to ascend the throne.



00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,219
This would be what happens without extra effort,



00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,170
and it can also help the situation
of Heaven Realm to transit stably.



00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,170
That year,



00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,820
our father granted me the Red Clouds Sword



00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,770
to kill Qiong Qi



00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,400
not for fratricidal fighting.



00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,420
I was blinded by my obsession and hatred



00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,950
and made irreparable mistakes.



00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,130
Whatever punishment I should take,



00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,130
I'll be willing to accept it.



00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,350
Xu Feng,



00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,350
this is a chance for you.



00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,420
You shouldn't be softhearted.



00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,440
You've weighed gains and losses
and racked your brains in scheming all your life.



00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,260
What are you doing that for?



00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,200
Don't you have nothing else in your mind?



00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,860
I also loved.



00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,640
Xu Feng, I also loved.



00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,480
It's just that



00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,770
my love was too humble



00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,220
that I always worried about personal gains and losses.



00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,570
I wished, but I couldn't make it.



00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,970
One day,



00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,600
it cooled down suddenly.



00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,020
leaving only hatred and jealousy



00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,570
and the heart to win.



00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,080
In the end.



00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,600
In the end.



00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,260
My heart has distorted so much
that even I felt disgusting of myself.



00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,260
In my lifetime,



00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,620
I could never escape my destiny of being despised.



00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,710
Looking back,



00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,480
what leaves behind is a big mess.



00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,280
That's enough.



00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,260
And I'm tired.



00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,510
Do you think I will be obliged for you?



00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,660
I told you early that



00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,750
from beginning to end,



00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,330
I have no intention of competing with you.



00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,880
From beginning to end,



00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,680
what I care in my mind is only Jin Mi.



00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,220
Ironically,



00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,130
I also only have Jin Mi in my heart.



00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,400
I don't need you to be obliged.



00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,000
It's all my faults.



00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,420
The Yun Elixir in her body



00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,220
was restored by me.



00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,930
What did you say?



00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,040
At that time,



00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,040
when you two experience hardships in the mortal world,



00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,840
the Yun Elixir in her body split.



00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,220
She fell deeply in love with you,



00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,930
and you didn't know it at all.



00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,570
However, I saw it clearly.



00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,510
She always wanted to be with you,



00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,510
and tried to break off the engagement with me.



00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,910
I knew I had no hope.



00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,310
But every time



00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,420
when I saw her worry about you,



00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,530
my mind was disturbed.



00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,640
Seeing the date of wedding came close,



00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,370
I'd rather let her not love anymore in her lifetime,



00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,530
I must tie her to me.



00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,530
In the end.



00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,970
In the end, I hurt both of you,



00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,970
making it beyond redemption.



00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,530
So,



00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,930
So her heart had never changed.



00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,550
Why didn't you tell me earlier?



00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,930
Why do you say it till now?



00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,620
I once thought we were well-matched.



00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,680
As long we kept our dignity



00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,280
and our standpoint,



00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,770
we could just hold on



00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,000
and stalemate like this.



00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,240
One day, one of us would finally be the winner.



00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,730
Till today, I get to know that



00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,730
I was wrong.



00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,910
We both were wrong.



00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,060
I got the beginning wrong,



00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,730
and you got he ending wrong.



00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,570
We missed too many things.



00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,460
If I met her first,



00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,600
the outcome might be totally different.



00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,460
You didn't miss it.



00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,130
You did it wrong.



00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,600
Haven't you even seen it through today?



00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,600
At all times,



00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,730
there's no triumph or defeat.



00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,260
It's just about scheming,



00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,200
which is a great taboo for love.



00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,150
From beginning to end,



00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,660
you didn't scheme a wrong step.



00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
Just that I never scheme.



00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,770
Now that she's gone,



00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,730
what's the point of saying it?



00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,840
This is left by Jin Mi.



00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,860
She probably wanted to leave it to you.



00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,750
At that time, to defeat you,



00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,770
I pledged in blood with Qiong Qi.



00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
So now,



00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm at the dead end and my time is running out.



00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,680
The Hairy Feather Jin Mi gave you



00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,420
should have dissolved your countercharge by the elixir.
