1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"


2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,360
"Episode 63"


3
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,760
This is left by Jin Mi.


4
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,800
She probably wanted to leave it to you.


5
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,590
I'll also give you the Heaven Realm.


6
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,579
I just transmuted Qiong Qi
with the Red Clouds Sword


7
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,850
and Pure Glazed Flame.


8
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,150
You won't die.


9
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,710
That Hairy Feather...


10
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,080
I threw it away.


11
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,420
Now that she's gone,


12
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,940
how could I live alone in the world?


13
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,810
Run Yu,


14
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,579
be alone like this in the future
tens or hundreds of thousands of years,


15
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,140
and redeem your sins.


16
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,510
What you see in your eyes
is right what you see in your mind.


17
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,990
What you see is exactly what she sees,


18
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,060
and what she sees is exactly what you see.


19
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,010
Jin Mi,


20
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,910
Where are you?


21
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,600
How can I find you?


22
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,550
It’ll be your greatest honor


23
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
to marry me as your queen.


24
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Don’t think of taking consorts afterwards.


25
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,490
You can’t even take a look at other girls.


26
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,280
Got it?


27
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,550
You're already my man now.


28
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,180
Don’t worry.


29
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,500
I’ll be responsible for you.


30
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,850
The flowers here grow well.


31
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,550
They're just wild flowers and weeds,


32
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,150
not like what in your Xuanji Palace.


33
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,550
Soon after she's gone,


34
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,100
those night-blooming cereus in the Xuanji Palace


35
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
also vanished.


36
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,450
There is still no news from her?


37
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,200
It's been three years.


38
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,750
Over the three years,


39
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
was your countercharge by the elixir still severe?


40
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,450
It actually never had a seizure.


41
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,450
This osmanthus wine


42
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,050
was made by Jin Mi.


43
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,990
This is the last bottle left.


44
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,450
I won't drink anymore.


45
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
The life is like a dream,


46
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,000
I've been drunk for too long.


47
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,950
I should wake up now.


48
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,050
These days,


49
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,200
I'm getting to know that


50
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,650
if you seek virtue you'll acquire it.


51
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,050
Since I won over the Heaven Realm,


52
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,980
I should perform my duties
as the Heavenly Emperor.


53
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,590
The sages won't be affected by emotions.


54
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,800
They should balance the heaven and earth.


55
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,500
and behold all living creatures.


56
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,500
And the pleasure, anger, sorrow and joy


57
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,650
shall never belong to the Heavenly Emperor.


58
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,950
Xu Feng,


59
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,450
our lifetime is too long,


60
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,250
and we’re too lonely.


61
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,050
It would be good if you
can hold the hands of someone.


62
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,680
However,


63
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,860
even if you love someone,
you may not necessarily grow old with her.


64
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
You may go together but not return together.


65
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,960
She belongs to you.


66
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
From beginning to end,


67
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,050
you're the only one she loves.


68
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,000
And I am only an outsider.


69
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,180
What's the point of saying it?


70
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,950
Now she's gone,


71
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
she won't come back again.


72
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,900
And that box,


73
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,200
have you opened it?


74
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,000
Seeing what’s inside, I'll think of her.


75
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,600
It will only make me sad.


76
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
The flowers bloom and the leaves fall.


77
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,980
Things change and stars shift.


78
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,980
But it's all preordained by Heaven.


79
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,050
Don't ask for anything by force.


80
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,650
If it doesn't belong to me,


81
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,350
I won't get it even I ask.


82
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,250
If it belongs to you,


83
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,550
it won't run away from you.


84
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,500
We shall let nature take its course.


85
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,520
And wish all to be well.


86
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,850
brother.


87
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,560
Take care.


88
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,080
I'm Jin Mi.


89
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,050
looking for peace among the blooming flowers;


90
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,650
leading a life of floating clouds and water.


91
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Am I cool?


92
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,500
These phoenix lanterns are gifts for you.


93
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,150
Do you like them?


94
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,090
Yes, I do.


95
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,100
I like all of them.


96
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
You...


97
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,900
How dare you do such things?


98
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,050
So in the future


99
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
you should put your eyes on me.


100
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,550
Why?


101
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,700
You killed my father,


102
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,750
You killed Aunty Linxiu.


103
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,500
Idiot.


104
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Why are you so silly?


105
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,890
I've taught you for hundreds of years.


106
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,780
You didn't learn anything,


107
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,720
but the obsession and stupidity?


108
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,250
Jin Mi,


109
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,700
you're stupid!


110
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,870
The rabbit...


111
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
I recognized you at the first glance.


112
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,670
I pretended not to know that.


113
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,960
Because I knew I would
kill you if I met you again.


114
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,540
But I couldn't do it.


115
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,050
Not only that,


116
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,100
I actually often expected to see you


117
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,030
as if I was poisoned.


118
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,150
Even I disdain myself for this.


119
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,890
On that night,


120
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,670
I was not drunk.


121
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,550
But I had to pretend to be drunk.


122
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,300
I hugged you,


123
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,150
and held you tightly.


124
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,860
With you in my arms, I really felt drunk.


125
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,900
I secretly felt contented,


126
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,060
only wishing that moment
could last till the end of time.


127
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
I felt that whatever grudges


128
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
were merely as transient as a fleeting cloud.


129
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I hated myself for having this kind of thought.


130
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,000
I hated myself for being so soft


131
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,200
that I could even give up
my dignity and life for you.


132
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,550
I deliberately called Sui He,


133
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,220
just to remind myself


134
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
not to be bewildered by you.


135
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,200
But that night when I saw you run away in panic,


136
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,100
my heart hurt a lot and clenched tightly.


137
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,200
Even the breathing was painful.


138
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,800
I hated myself not to be able
to follow you and tell you


139
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,640
that it was not like what you thought.


140
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,500
I was going to cut off our love
by Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.


141
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,100
That day,


142
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,900
you came alone,


143
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,090
and told me you loved me.


144
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,950
My heart stopped beating at that moment.


145
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,560
Even though I knew clearly that


146
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,660
it was just a lie,


147
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,450
I did believe it.


148
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,700
I couldn't control myself like
having to drink poison to quench thirst.


149
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,690
I forced myself to say hard words to you.


150
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,100
If you say you love me again,


151
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,400
I'll kill you right away.


152
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,250
I will cut a slice of you


153
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,300
every time you say it.


154
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,600
Actually, I knew that


155
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,100
as long as you said it again,


156
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,450
I would give up everything


157
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,150
and not care anything


158
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,660
to tie you to me by all means.


159
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,330
I would leave behind whatever hatreds.


160
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,150
But you got away,


161
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,250
leaving me alone to regret deeply.


162
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,300
You left.


163
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,100
How could you leave like that?


164
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,050
Phoenix...


165
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,100
Jin Mi...


166
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,150
Jin Mi...


167
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,450
Jin Mi...


168
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,850
Jin Mi, where are you?


169
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,350
Jin Mi...


170
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Where are you?


171
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,260
Look, look, look at that!


172
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,180
Look, this is...


173
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,250
This...this is...


174
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,740
Jin Mi's primordial spirits are reunited.


175
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,350
So Xu Feng has found her primordial spirits.


176
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,540
That's great!


177
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,100
There's a good chance for Jin Mi to revive.


178
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,800
Flowers are withering.


179
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,150
Damn!


180
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,500
Jin Mi's primordial spirits are vanishing.


181
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,250
All chiefs listen to my order.


182
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.


183
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,800
Open the Time Gallery now,


184
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,150
and try everything to save Jin Mi.


185
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.


186
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Where are you?


187
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,500
Is it you?


188
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,250
Is it really you?


189
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,400
It's me.


190
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,350
Phoenix,


191
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm back.


192
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,050
I've been looking for you for three years.


193
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Over the three years, where have you been?


194
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,780
Over the three years...


195
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,150
Over the three years, I've been by your side.


196
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
I can see what you see.


197
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,650
and hear what you hear.


198
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,660
You and I seem to share the same body.


199
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
I thought you would never come back again.


200
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,200
It's so nice that you come back.


201
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,400
Jin Mi...


202
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,700
Jin Mi, I was wrong.


203
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Forgive me, okay?


204
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,750
Don't leave me again.


205
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,650
I'm not going to leave you again.


206
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,300
We won’t be apart again in the future.


207
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,850
I won't leave you again.


208
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,550
I won't leave you again, Phoenix.


209
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,100
What's wrong with you?


210
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,750
Why is this, Jin Mi?


211
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,550
Don't leave me.


212
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,650
Please don't leave me.


213
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,450
So,


214
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,000
I was actually a teardrop in your eyes.


215
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,850
It was doomed from the start that


216
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
we'll be apart at the end.


217
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,400
Jin Mi...


218
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,600
You just said we were going to be together,


219
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,700
and not be separated for ever and ever.


220
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,750
Jin Mi, you just promised me.


221
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Don't...don't...


222
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,500
Jin Mi...


223
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,640
Jin Mi, I beg you, okay?


224
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
Please don't leave me.


225
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,990
Farewell, Phoenix.


226
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,700
Jin Mi...


227
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,850
Jin Mi...


228
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,650
Jin Mi...


229
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,650
Jin Mi...


230
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
What you see is exactly what she sees,


231
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,900
and what she sees is exactly what you see.


232
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,130
So that's


233
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,530
what Lord Doumu meant.


234
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,850
Over the three years,


235
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,800
I have searched the six realms but couldn't find her.


236
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,960
Who could have thought that


237
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,250
she's been in my eyes all the time.


238
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,860
With great difficulty,


239
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,700
I met her after being apart a long time,


240
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,980
but we’re separated by death once again.


241
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Is this the will of God?


242
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,950
When I opened the Time Gallery,


243
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,650
I felt her primordial spirits were not weak.


244
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,100
Who knows it was just a lightning before death.


245
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,000
So it should be Jin Mi!


246
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,100
During the three years she stayed in my eyes,


247
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
my elixir countercharge never had a seizure.


248
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,450
So, it was her


249
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,500
who absorbed the chill in my body.


250
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,000
This virtually


251
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,100
helped me dissolve the countercharge.


252
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,000
Meanwhile


253
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,450
she condensed into a teardrop gradually


254
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,450
and transmuted her genuine incarnation to save herself.


255
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,250
She even remembered me till she died.


256
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,050
She did so much for me.


257
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,600
Perhaps,


258
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
you will meet each other again


259
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,350
at a certain time and place.


260
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,350
It's probably the will of the Heaven?


261
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,900
Jin Mi,


262
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I'll wait for you.


263
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,300
Even if you're reborn to the bottom of the underworld.


264
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,800
and I go to the vast wasteland,


265
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
I'll find you.


266
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
I heard that the daughter of Tangyue Mansion


267
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,550
is going to marry to the Prime Minister.


268
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,650
This girl is not a normal person.


269
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,650
I heard that this girl


270
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,900
had been obsessed with ghosts
and demons since childhood.


271
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,180
After she grew up,


272
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,060
she is obsessed with the way of cultivation.


273
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,100
Other people is looking forward to be immortal,


274
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,550
but this girl


275
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,380
is wondering how to become a demon.


276
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,200
Master Jin was scared and in frustration every day.


277
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Good, good, good…


278
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,000
Look, a phoenix.


279
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
It's a phoenix.


280
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,740
Look at that!


281
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,380
Phoenix!


282
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
Amazing! Amazing!


283
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,500
Run! Run!


284
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,700
If the heart does not die, the fate will not perish.


285
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,600
Jin Mi has the incense ashes to protect herself.


286
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,900
She sacrificed her life for suppressing
the war between the Heaven and the Demon,


287
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,700
saving the six realms from extreme misery.


288
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,750
It's a supreme merit.


289
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,400
Now the doom has removed.


290
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,080
She will wait for you where
you fell in love with each other.


291
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,550
I'm here.


292
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,550
But,


293
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,750
I've already accepted
the dowry of the Prime Minister.


294
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,900
What should I do now?


295
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,000
What a pity it is!


296
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,100
I've prepared


297
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,100
six thousand years of psychic power?


298
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,050
If so,


299
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,300
I'll just accept it.


300
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,100
In this life


301
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,550
and the future lives,


302
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,400
you can only be my wife.


303
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,700
This is the story of my father and my mother.


304
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,050
After my father took
my mother for marriage by force,


305
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,100
I was born


306
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,250
the next year.


307
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
How time flies!


308
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
While time flees,


309
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
seven years has passed by.


310
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,400
Our family of three


311
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,450
are living a happy and
peaceful life in the mortal world.


312
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,650
My Sister, Qin Tian, the daughter of Aunty Liu Ying


313
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,900
is very gentle.


314
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,200
If the full score is one thousand…


315
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,700
Qin Tian!


316
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,900
Bai Lu, what are you doing?


317
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
To hook a wife.


318
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,100
Are you silly?


319
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,500
You should rob a wife.


320
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm going to Kunlun tomorrow.


321
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Why?


322
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,620
Last month


323
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,740
when I was on Qingcheng
Mountain to give vent for Pig Elf,


324
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,000
I saw a disciple of Kunlun


325
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,700
who had red lips and white teeth
and was as pretty as a picture.


326
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,850
I can't forget him.


327
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,450
I even dreamed about him.


328
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
I was wondering


329
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,400
to rob a brother-in-law for you


330
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,700
and to celebrate my 510th birthday.


331
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
My mother doesn't know about this.


332
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,600
It's well known that it’s dangerous
to go to Kunlun Mountain.


333
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,350
So if I was captured by those immortals on the way,


334
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,050
you should ask Uncle Xu Feng to save me.


335
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,740
Got it.


336
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,950
I must leave now.


337
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,650
Aunty Liu Ying is said to be
the noblest and most elegant woman


338
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,460
in the six realms for thousands of years.


339
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,650
Today of five hundred years ago,


340
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Xu Feng handed the
position of Demon Lord over to me,


341
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,400
at that time I said


342
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,600
I would lead Demon Realm to a new era.


343
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,150
Over the past five hundred years,


344
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,750
you did a nice job, guys.


345
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,450
Recently, everyone has
meat to eat and wine to drink.


346
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,950
Great!


347
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,700
Great!


348
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,350
But...


349
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Fighting and brawling


350
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,450
and fight for territories


351
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,300
still happened despite repeated prohibitions.


352
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,000
When we eat meat and drink wine,


353
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,650
we should also reflect ourselves.


354
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,350
Why have we always been notorious in the past?


355
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,700
What does the carefree that we are advocating


356
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
really mean?


357
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Only when we have the law in our eyes


358
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
and limits in our hearts,


359
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,700
and when we stop internal friction


360
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,900
and being disunited,


361
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,350
can our Demon Realm really be strong.


362
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,100
In the next five hundred years,


363
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,990
I hope every of you have


364
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,300
a bottom line in your heart,


365
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,050
and choose wisely what to stop doing.


366
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
You can follow your heart and not exceed the rules.


367
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,200
Do you agree?


368
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
Yes, yes, yes…


369
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,100
Yes, yes, yes…


370
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,800
The envoy from Floral Realm is here.


371
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,900
I am Lian Qiao, the envoy from Floral Realm.


372
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,300
By order of the chiefs, I hereby offer the gifts


373
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,050
to congratulate the Demon Lord
to live thousands of years more.


374
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Bring it to me.


375
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,450
What is this flower?


376
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,050
This flower is a new breed
cultivated by the Water Immortal.


377
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,950
It has no name yet.


378
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,200
Please grant it a name, my Lord.


379
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,050
I don't care if you're M u Ci or Qi Yuan.


380
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,550
Anyway, in this life


381
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
I would be your tail.


382
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,420
Don't you dare to throw me away!


383
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,500
Just call it Iris.


384
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,900
And I have also an Aunt Sui He
whom I've never met.


385
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,850
Father and mother
never say a single word about her.


386
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,600
But she was constantly


387
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,700
appeared in the conversations
of our relatives and friends.


388
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
She is a woman who dares to love and hate.


389
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Xu Feng...


390
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,200
Xu Feng...


391
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,300
you're bewildered by the demon.


392
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,650
You're fooled.


393
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,850
You're fooled, you're fooled.


394
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,200
The heart-testing stone is a fake.


395
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,300
It's a fake, a fake, a fake.


396
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,050
The heart-testing stone is a fake.


397
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,750
It's a fake, a fake.


398
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,650
I should be the Heavenly Empress.


399
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,600
I should be the Heavenly Empress.


400
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,500
That's the throne of the Heavenly Empress.


401
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,100
Immortals...


402
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,449
Come, come with me, come with me.


403
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
We're home.


404
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,250
Go home, home...


405
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,050
My throne...


406
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,000
I didn't kill them.


407
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Who...who’s that?


408
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Xu Feng, Xu Feng...


409
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,100
Xu Feng...


410
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,350
Xu Feng, is it you?


411
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Xu Feng...


412
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,500
My meal...


413
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,950
No!


414
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,050
Xu Feng...


415
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,500
- My meal... - No!


416
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,000
Xu Feng, Xu Feng...


417
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,350
And the most mysterious


418
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,900
is my Uncle Run Yu.


419
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,450
People call him the Heavenly Emperor.


420
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,850
There are many legends about him.


421
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,450
Some say he's a white bearded old man,


422
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,500
some say he's a


423
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
white-scale monster with long green hairs,


424
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
and some even say he's a male mermaid,


425
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,350
whose tears can turn into pearls.


426
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,600
He is the only one in the world


427
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,000
that remembers my name.


428
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,150
Tang Yue


429
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,800
Uncle!


430
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,650
You're fishing!


431
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,850
Hooking my wife.


432
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,400
That's what you mother teach you, right?


433
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,050
You can do it with me, okay?


434
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,200
Mother says


435
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,850
there are many good-looking girls in the river.


436
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,850
As long as you are patient and meticulous,


437
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,050
you'll be able to hook your wife.


438
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,350
Lu!


439
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,200
Mom!


440
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,650
Well,


441
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,350
I was wondering why there's a
stream of fairy air lingering around here.


442
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:47,900
So it is you.


443
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,900
I went handling some business,


444
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,450
and passed by here.


445
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,000
So I stopped by to have a look.


446
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,150
Handle some business?


447
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
I don't know what business you handled.


448
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,800
Is it that you now also administered


449
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,400
the mortal men's fighting in the mountain.


450
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,050
Over these years,


451
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
are you happy?


452
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,050
You are naturally happy.


453
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,000
I’d like to say it again:


454
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,600
leading a life of floating clouds and water.


455
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,750
leading a life of floating clouds and water.


456
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,550
That would be good.


457
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,450
I must leave now.


458
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,250
Lu,


459
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
say goodbye to your uncle.


460
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,900
Goodbye, Uncle.


461
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,600
Tangyue, farewell.


462
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,250
Okay, let's go home.


463
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,850
But I haven't get my wife yet.


464
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,650
Master Keung's fishing


465
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,250
is about to hook the one who is willing to bait.


466
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,750
And


467
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,750
tell you a secret!


468
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,250
Your father at that time


469
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,050
cried and shouted to take my bait.


470
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,950
Mother, where's my father?


471
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,950
Lu!


472
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Daddy!


473
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,250
Daddy, I'm hungry!


474
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,950
You're hungry?


475
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,200
So what do you want to eat tonight?


476
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,100
What do you want to eat?


477
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,550
How about donkey meat sandwich?


478
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Fish!


479
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,800
Fish.


480
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,050
Let's steam it with ham slices and mushroom slices.


481
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,050
How about that?


482
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes, yes.


483
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,500
-Let's go home!
-Be careful.


484
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,550
In the lifetime,


485
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,100
everybody will meet two persons in the world.


486
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,350
At the end, one will be borne in mind,


487
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,550
and the other in distance.


488
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,450
I took revenge,


489
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,100
mastered my own destiny,


490
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,000
became the supreme Heavenly Emperor,


491
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,500
and got everything I wanted.


492
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,500
But I still have nothing.


493
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,100
I couldn't get what I wish.


494
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,500
Even the Heavenly Emperor is helpless with it.


495
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,000
Your Majesty,


496
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,550
you actually have something.


497
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,700
I and the Beast of Dreams


498
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,650
will always stay by your side.


499
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,750
On the long way to be a great immortal,


500
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm going to accompany you all the time.


501
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,100
Though my eyes still don't see any colors


502
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,000
but black and white.


503
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,750
Phoenix,


504
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,300
it's good to be together with you two.


505
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,200
Your eyes and his smile


506
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,050
are the most beautiful scene in my heart,


507
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,250
far better than all other sceneries in the world.


508
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,600
We're going home!


509
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,300
We're going home!
