1
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,940
“Ashes of Love”

2
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,090
"Episode 12"

3
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,530
Earth Immortal, how may I help you?

4
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,190
Greetings to Night Immortal.

5
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm going to report myself
at the mansion of Lord Lao.

6
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,450
I've come here to bid farewell to
Your Highness and Mister Ling Guang.

7
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,620
Unfortunately, Lord Fire Immortal and
Mister Ling Guang are not here.

8
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,960
And this fairy is?

9
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,510
The birthday of the Heavenly Empress is coming up.

10
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,430
Every immortal will celebrate the birthday.

11
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,390
If you catch up the Celebration now,

12
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,470
you would probably get a blessing from the Heavenly Empress.

13
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,200
Thank you so much for telling me that! My lord.

14
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,070
I've always heard that Night Immortal
is the kindest in the Heaven realm.

15
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,050
Now I can see that you are just as good as others said.

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
You don't have to thank me.

17
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,940
And for the so called goddess....

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,940
Don't you think the sun is too bright today? It may hurt your eyes.

19
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,220
ohhhhhh

20
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,490
Yes, yes, yes! You are right, my lord!

21
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm getting old, and my vision gets blurry sometime

22
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,040
I didn't see anything at all!

23
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,550
If there's no order to take

24
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,340
I'd better get going now

25
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,260
Leave

26
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,940
Good-bye, my lord.

27
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,579
The Fish Fairy, today is the celebration of Heavenly Empress' birthday

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Wouldn't you go attend the celebration?

29
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,440
No worries, I'm not in a hurry

30
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,460
There’s a lot of time before the Celebration starts.

31
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,320
What’s more,

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,600
there are more than millions gods and fairies
from Heaven to Earth, and from all directions.

33
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,800
No one would notice if I was not there. It's not a big deal for me.

34
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,220
But Phoenix has already visited the Heavenly Empress in the early morning

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,070
Would the Heavenly Empress get angry if you don't go?

36
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,500
Phoenix and I are different for the Heavenly Empress.

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,760
If I visited her earlier, she would have been upset

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,140
Why would she be like that?

39
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,210
The Heavenly Empress is not my biological mother.

40
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,960
Sorry for being so nosy. So...
which goddess is your biological mother?

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,300
My biological mother is not a goddess and has no position in the Heaven Palace.

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,380
I heard that she is only a spirit

43
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,680
can't be more common.

44
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,940
Though she is just a little spirit, so unnoticeable

45
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,680
She still cannot escape her miserable fate
and keep herself from danger. She is dead

46
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,140
I don't have any memory of my childhood,

47
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,280
and also don't know who on earth is my biological mother

48
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,140
I just know that after the death of my biological mother

49
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,040
I was adopted by Heavenly Empress

50
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,860
There used to be time that Heavenly Empress and I could get along with each other.

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,760
But, as time goes

52
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
Heavenly Empress became more and more worried that

53
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I would compete with Phoenix for the throne

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,720
That's why Heavenly Empress gradually isolates me

55
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,920
What about you? Who is your parents?

56
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,180
Mr. Hu told me, I am a grape vine that empowered by Chief Peony

57
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,980
A grape vine?

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,780
But you just make hail happens

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,180
That’s supposed to be water-related magic

60
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,040
Oh, Phoenix told me that my body is suitable for being cultivated by water.

61
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,940
So, I started learn water-related magic.

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,020
Now that I can't make buns with my magic

63
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,040
I will still keep my word. Let's go out to get some buns, Fish Fairy!

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,080
Let's go!

65
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,640
These are your buns, enjoy the meal!

66
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,640
Little two (waiter), a plate of buns please!

67
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,970
OK, wait a minute!

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,300
Little two? What is that?

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,280
Is there little three, little four, little five?

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,360
Little three (nickname for the mistress), Can I have the menu please!

71
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,820
Little three!

72
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,450
Are you insane! Don't bother us having lunch!

73
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,300
What’s wrong with them? Are they afraid that I would cut in line?

74
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,600
Fairy Jin Mi,

75
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,600
in mortal world, "little three" can't be used casually.

76
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,240
Are you ready to order?

77
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,360
Things are so weird in human world,

78
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,370
why I can call people "little two", but cannot call them "little three"

79
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,600
That is so pedantic.

80
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,280
Fruit pancake?!

81
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,400
You guys are so cruel!!

82
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,740
Fairy Jin Mi, the "fruit" is not what you thought of.

83
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,460
The "fruit" here just refers to the crust.

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,490
Oh, I get it.

85
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,280
it almost freaks me out.

86
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:55,409
So can I have this, and two cups of soymilk?

87
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,520
Alright.

88
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:01,200
Does Fairy Jin Mi know that the breakfast in human world is very delicious and has many kinds.

89
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,960
It can compete with the breakfast in Heaven. Sometimes, human breakfast can be better than ours.

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,700
I'm ready to try the human delicacy

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,890
This are your crab buns, enjoy the meal please!

92
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,900
Sorry, Fish Fairy

93
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,560
Never mind.

94
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,140
Fish Fairy, your magic is awesome.

95
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,040
to be honest

96
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,040
I think you should attend the Birthday Celebration
of Heavenly Empress.

97
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,300
I know that the relationship between you two are not close

98
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,060
but it would get worse, if you don't go

99
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,880
Even though Heavenly Empress maybe upset for your presence,

100
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,560
You've tried your best to do what you should do as the son of Heavenly Empress.

101
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,560
You don't own anyone.

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,180
like the relationship between me and Chief Peony

103
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,600
though I'm really afraid of her,

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,560
it is impossible for me not to attend her Birthday Celebration

105
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,380
I agree with you

106
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,580
okay, I will return to Heaven Realm after finishing the breakfast.

107
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,720
my lord

108
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,200
why are you coming here?

109
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,940
My lord, you asked me earlier to find a good-looking china for dews collected at night

110
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,080
how do you think about this one?

111
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,500
To be honest, you don't need to show me how good it is

112
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,440
What your father Immortal Tai Si has

113
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,980
is absolutely nice

114
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,570
you've already found out who I am

115
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,240
How long do you want to hide your true identity?

116
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,000
The dew that is irradiated by the starlight is precious

117
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,720
For the past three years,

118
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,290
you have been guarding the sky

119
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,240
and gathering the dew.

120
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,440
It must have taken a lot of effort.

121
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,270
Is it a gift to the empress?

122
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,310
Let's go.

123
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,050
they are all going to attend the Birthday Celebration.

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,900
leave me here alone

125
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,670
it is so boring!

126
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,250
I should not let Fish Fairy go to the Celebration

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,920
who can hang out with me!!!!!

128
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,120
Lord Puchi! I know it's you!

129
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,670
I'm on the way to the Birthday Celebration, and just got to the 4th layer of the sky

130
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,930
I felt a strong power that dragged me here

131
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,260
Tell me when your power starts being so strong

132
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,620
Maybe because Phoenix has given me a thousand-year power

133
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,800
last night, I was so smart to ask Phoenix to give me a huge red packet

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,300
That could be the reason

135
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,860
But we haven't met for a half day

136
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,580
why you are so hurry to call me here

137
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,200
Is it because you are dying to see me?

138
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Not at all. Phoenix and Fish Fairy went to the Birthday Celebration

139
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,120
I am so bored for staying here, alone

140
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,960
Since you are here

141
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,500
Let's hang out together!

142
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,920
Today is a Big day for Heaven Realm! All gods have to celebrate Heavenly Empress's Birthday.

143
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,040
Don't you want to join the Celebration and have fun?

144
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,780
I do want to go

145
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,620
No no. I can't

146
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,610
I can't go

147
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,030
There are so many gods gathering together

148
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,960
If the Chief Peony knows that I were there

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,230
She would catch me back home

150
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,070
I've heard that Heavenly Empress have prepared

151
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,820
thousands holy peach ( looks like donut peach) to treat the gods

152
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,400
The holy peach is from the holy peach tree

153
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,860
which has grown for thousand years and watered by holy water

154
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,220
It gives fruits every three thousand years.

155
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,040
it tastes juicy and delicious,
and it is good for empowering your magic

156
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Take me there please!

157
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,370
Don't you be afraid of exposing yourself?

158
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,760
there would be so many gods gathering there

159
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,120
if i'm lucky enough, I would met Da Luo Jin Xian,

160
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,860
He could save my friend Rou Rou!

161
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,440
If I couldn't meet him, I could still treat my self with the holy peach to empower myself

162
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,580
Lord Puchi, Lord Puchi

163
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,280
Take me there, please, please!

164
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,440
We are friends!

165
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,560
If you take me there, I will keep away from you and be careful,

166
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,050
it you wouldn't take me there

167
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,530
Well, I could find a way on my own!

168
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,450
Since we are friends, I can take you there

169
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,010
Do you guys have invitations?

170
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm a close friend of the God - Under-the-moon,

171
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,090
let us pass please

172
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,550
That's unfortunate.

173
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,920
Today is a big day, it's the birthday of Heavenly Empress.

174
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,580
The Northern Heavenly Gate and the Southern Gate
won't open for those who don't have invitations.

175
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,340
I am a very close friend of the God -Under...

176
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,100
Come on.

177
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,660
I've never expected that mentioning the title of the God Under the Moon still wouldn't let us pass...

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,460
these two heaven Guardians are so strict and stubborn

179
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,240
Wait!

180
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,490
How can you get this?!

181
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
What?

182
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,860
I've find a pass card, we don't have to waste our time arguing with those guards. let's go!

183
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,220
Excuse me, please

184
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,670
See!

185
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,790
My apology! Please get in!

186
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,490
Wow.

187
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,460
I‘ve never thought that the feather can work as a pass card

188
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,400
Phoenix is really a bird with so many pass cards

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,020
It is the treasure of Fire Immortal, of course, it represents power

190
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,460
Take care of it, it would help you someday

191
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,530
Why you have to leave so early?

192
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,660
It won't be late if you stay till the Birthday Celebration ends

193
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,200
I've got the message from fatgher in the early morning,

194
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,920
saying that the lords of the cities
started fighting each other again

195
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,780
I have to leave as soon as I can, to calm down the fight

196
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,540
I just got in and gave birthday wishes to Heavenly Empress

197
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,360
It is emergency, if I am not polite enough
according to Heaven manners,

198
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,720
please forgive me

199
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,160
Okay, take care of yourself, if you need help, just let me know

200
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,170
I am still confused about one thing

201
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,640
I hope you could explain to me honestly

202
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,270
I will

203
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,630
Don't you love Fairy Jin Mi?

204
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,180
Why I heard that Princess Sui He is going to get married with you?

205
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm not interested in getting married

206
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,860
It maybe just rumors spread by Heavenly Empress

207
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,760
Sorry, Brother Feng, I misunderstood you

208
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,290
That you just played around and never took Fairy Jin Mi seriously

209
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,120
But,

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,180
Fairy Jin Mi and I

211
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,800
are unable to be together

212
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,720
My beauty, are you alright?

213
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,210
I dont know why

214
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,930
my heart feels so painful

215
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,230
Let me see!

216
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,850
Stop!

217
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,660
Do you feel better?

218
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
I feel much better now

219
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,060
I feel the pain this time!

220
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,450
Let’s go

221
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,240
It is so spacious

222
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,790
There are so many people here

223
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
You’ve lived in the Water Mirror for a long time
and haven't experience so much before

224
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,440
Today, I will show you the world!

225
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,160
Sit, sit, take your seat!

226
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,820
So much food!

227
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,190
Do you wanna eat this?

228
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,860
-No, I want to eat that one
-okay, I will take this!

229
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,300
Don't be so surprised, you are so inexperience!

230
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,780
This is the Wushan Goddess, Yao Ji

231
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,080
She is chubby in a very sexy way,

232
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,480
but her waist is kinda thick, not my type

233
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,810
This is the Nvying from Xiangshui

234
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,300
People love her weak posture

235
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,360
But a goddess who is as weak as Tou Fu is not attractive either

236
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,280
It would be better to add some heroic spirit

237
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,850
Who is it?

238
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,310
The female hero, Jing Wei, who used to be a bird,

239
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,940
pecking stones to bury the sea, and force the king of the Dragon to move around

240
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,540
But her personality is so strong, no man could bear it

241
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,990
Lord Puchi, you are so knowledgable, why you know everything

242
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,500
Have you heard The Beauty Encyclopedia before?

243
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,120
I wrote it!!

244
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:21,960
But there are not so many beauties nowadays

245
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,190
Speaking of the ex- god of flower Zi Fen

246
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,990
She is the most beautiful one that no one can compare with

247
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Sad that the beauty always can't live long

248
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,820
Lord Lao is here.

249
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,200
Who are those two?

250
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,380
The man is Water immortal, the woman is Wind immortal

251
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,930
They are unhappy couples

252
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,890
They got married for many years, but still treated each other respectfully as guests

253
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,040
They don't even have a kid till now

254
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,720
I feel that Water immortal looks so elegant

255
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,440
Your taste is really good

256
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:32,880
The Water immortal has been ranked no.1 on the most handsome faces among whole realms for 10 thousand years

257
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,460
But he's also getting old now

258
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,620
Of course, it also because of the handsome young man like me,

259
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,080
So that the rank of Water immortal has been lowered

260
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
I don't know why

261
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,540
But I feel so calmed and relaxed after I saw Water immortal

262
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,580
And he looks so familiar to me

263
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,980
Familiar to you? you'd better be kidding me

264
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
Water immortal is detached from the outside

265
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,880
And he is indifferent to others

266
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,760
It is possible that looking at him could make you feel calmed and relaxed

267
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,120
But he is not the type of guy who would look familiar to you

268
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,150
Except Floral Realm

269
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,120
The birthday celebration of Heavenly Empress gathers all goddess from Heaven to Earth

270
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,440
Does it indicate that Heavenly Empress would arrange the marriage of Fire Immortal at the Celebration?

271
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,220
Hey friends! So today is the day for the selection for Phoenix's potential wife?

272
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,620
Yeah, you are right!

273
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,860
I bet you a holy wine that Jing Wei would win!

274
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,780
But I heard that Fire Immortal likes male fairies rather than female fairies

275
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,940
Earlier before, there is a good-looking Page Boy attendant with him

276
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,790
Fire Immortal seems to love that young attendant very much

277
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,660
Later, the attendant uses some magic to turn himself into a female fairy

278
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,580
So she is abandoned by Fire Immortal

279
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,850
Fire Immortal is in high position, which seems to be powerful

280
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,080
But he can't make decisions on his own marriage

281
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,080
His marriage is just a power game

282
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,200
Heavenly Empress, Heavenly Empress, Fire Immortal, Night Immortal are coming

283
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:40,760
Happy birthday, Heavenly Empress, wish you live long and prosper!!

284
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,150
Everyone, sit down please!

285
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,180
Thank you all for coming to my birthday celebration!

286
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
You guys bring so much fun in the Palace

287
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,100
I feel so happy now

288
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,780
Alright, let's start the banquet!

289
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,160
You’ve just promised me that

290
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,360
You will never let Lord Puchi get close to Fairy Jin Mi

291
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Now what is this?!

292
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,820
My bad, I will try to let him out

293
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,580
Let them be this time. I don't want to make troubles on the birthday celebration. watch out for these two

294
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,320
Why the bird gets upset again for no reason

295
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,260
Has he found out that I tricked him for one thousand year magic power?

296
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,520
Fish Fairy!

297
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,730
Why Fish Fairy becomes weird too

298
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Coming to this Birthday Celebration really makes him feel so bad

299
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:42,540
Let’s eat something, take this, take this

300
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
Lord Liaoyuan

301
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,670
send order to General Po Jun, double the Heaven guardians to guard the Heaven Palace

302
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,970
Yes, your honor

303
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
Who is this one?

304
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,840
He is Rat Fairy

305
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,590
Rat Fairy?!

306
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,210
Rat is the scariest thing in the world, I don't like mice

307
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,380
He is not a common rat

308
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,140
He’s our boss in the Chinese zodiac

309
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,920
He is really smart and talented. He is a good player of chess

310
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,360
When your favourite Water immortal was detached from the outside world,

311
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,610
the Rat Fairy is the only one that accompanied with the Water immortal to play chess

312
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,000
Did he?

313
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,250
So he is a nice guy

314
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,900
Run Yu wishes Heavenly Empress

315
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,520
live long and prosper

316
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,540
Night Immortal has become increasingly frugal recently

317
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,520
you come to the banquet only with the wooden hair pin

318
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,040
I appreciated your simple personality

319
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,140
But...

320
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,940
It looks like something from Floral Realm

321
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,740
Reply to Heavenly Empress

322
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,060
It is just a usual hair pin made from a vine

323
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,760
How can such a usual thing

324
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,580
get into the eyes of Night Immortal?

325
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,510
The vine is a gift from a very special friend of mine

326
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,820
It is meaningful to me

327
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,450
Jade hairpin, diamond hairpin,

328
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,080
gold hairpin,

329
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,060
those are very rare and expensive

330
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,540
But for me, they are all worthless compared with this vine hairpin

331
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,320
Today is Heavenly Empress's Birthday Celebration,

332
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,360
I think the vine hairpin is a perfect match

333
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,600
Exactly, Fish Fairy is really my best friend!

334
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,600
This vine looks interesting

335
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,620
Could you tell me who gave you this?

336
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,680
Whether this one attends the banquet today?

337
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,160
Reply to Heavenly Empress, this friend
is neither a god nor a spirit, she is not here today

338
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
What a pity!

339
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,000
It must be a very special existence

340
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,560
Next time, if there's a banquet

341
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,580
Please remember to send him an invitation!

342
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,040
Fish Fairy is so smart!

343
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,920
But Heavenly Emperor is so sharp

344
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,500
He has never met me before

345
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,380
but he could tell my personality only by a grape vine

346
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,300
such an accurate comment on my personality

347
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,160
Rat! Rat!

348
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,340
The Fairy guest, watch your manner!!

349
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,000
What are you doing?

350
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,350
This is The Empyrean Heaven! it is impossible to find a rat here!

351
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,770
Hahhah, Sorry that my little friend scared you guys! It is totally my fault!

352
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,880
You, such a naughty thing!

353
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,820
Who are you?

354
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,870
Why do you hide your true identity with the illusion magic at my banquet!

355
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,000
Heavenly Empress!

356
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,330
It's you! God of Flower from Flower Palace -- Zi Fen!

357
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,540
You took a good care of your skin!

358
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
You look so young,

359
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,050
and prettier than before!

360
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,510
God of wine! Are you drunk or insane?!

361
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,520
Zi Fen has been dead for thousand years

362
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,940
Exactly!

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,860
God of Wine, you'd better be sober now!

364
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,540
This is not Zi Fen!

365
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,440
This is the attendant of Xu Feng -- Jin Mi!

366
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,440
The red threads in my palace are all messed up.

367
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,140
It made me dizzy trying to untie those knots

368
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,870
So that I forgot the time.

369
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,500
Hope that my brother and sister won't blame me.

370
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,790
This is Jin Mi, it's really nice to see Heavenly Empress and Empress

371
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,140
Jin Mi... you look just like her...

372
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,140
Could you tell me where you are from, Fairy Jin Mi?

373
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,540
Brother, you are so isolated from the outside world

374
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,980
Jin Mi just lived in Phoenix's Palace

375
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,860
Phoenix has taken care of her for a long time

376
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,980
My son, could you tell me where you could find a fairy so pretty like this?

377
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,280
Jin Mi is randomly picked up by Phoenix

378
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,940
No, Fairy fox misunderstood

379
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,260
I picked up Phoenix by accident

380
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,490
I feel shy to mention it...

381
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,500
But I have saved Phoenix's life for three times

382
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,140
Are you the one who gave the night spirit the hairpin made from a vine

383
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,720
and helped Fire Immortal go through trials and tribulations?

384
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,660
Yes, that is me

385
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,860
as you just said

386
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,760
Heavenly Empress and I have to thank Fairy Jin Mi for saving our son's lives

387
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,220
My pleasure! Not worth to mentioning it!

388
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,780
It’s not a big deal

389
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,230
Could you tell us

390
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,730
where did you meet Fire Immortal by accident?

391
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,580
in The Water Mirror!

392
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,100
Oh! Why did I say that! Chiefs would definitely catch me back home.

393
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,460
Fairy Jin Mi, Are you a Flower Fairy?

394
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,820
NO

395
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,870
I am just a spirit of fruit

396
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Fruit?

397
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,060
I am a spirit of grape

398
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,420
Could you tell us how old are you?

399
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,790
Around 4 thousand years

400
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,980
I could understand that Heavenly Empress and Empress want to find a good match for the Phoenix

401
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,980
But she is just a shy little girl

402
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,080
Please don't be so straight forward

403
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,600
I heard that Sui He prepared something special for Empress's Birthday

404
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,300
She prepared a dance called Feathers Dancing in Clouds

405
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,650
Don’t know if Heavenly Empress is ready to watch it with me

406
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,800
Sure

407
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,000
Let’s go and sit there

408
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,710
Take a seat

409
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,260
All the bird fairies and I, wish Heavenly Empress Happy Birthday!

410
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,100
Wish the Empress live long and prosper

411
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,060
You are so sweet Sui He

412
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,980
I wouldn't ask for more if Phoenix could be as considerate as you

413
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,020
Thank you so much for the compliment!

414
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,280
I was nothing compared to Fire Immortal

415
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,190
Fire Immortal is such a fierce fighter conquering around

416
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,260
We are family

417
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,240
We should spend more time together and become more intimate

418
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,520
Please sit by Xu Feng's side

419
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,240
And it would be more convenient for me to talk with you

420
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,030
Today is auntie's birthday.

421
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,860
Let’s drink more holy wine to celebrate

422
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,180
Mi, how do you feel when watching this scene? Aren't you jealous?

423
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
You do feel jealous!

424
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,210
I don't feel anything at all

425
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,970
I just feel so familiar with this scene

426
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,620
Heavenly Empress, see these two

427
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,920
Sitting there

428
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,080
The scene is like the picture that hangs on the wall at my personal palace

429
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,220
The picture depicts a lovely couple walking in the spring drizzling rain

430
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:22,230
I remember that there's a title for the picture, "A Perfect Match of Pearl and Jade"

431
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,990
Oh, yeah! I remembered it!
It is exactly A Perfect Match of Pearl and Jade!

432
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,910
I saw the scene from the Picture book
--Tianxiang Secret book

433
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,740
So the Peacock Fairy has done spirit training with Phoenix

434
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,090
You are talking nonsense!

435
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,840
I did not make it up

436
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,180
I just wonder if the Peacock Princess is willing to share me some tips about spirit training

437
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,300
So that we can increase our magic power and make a progress together!

438
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,460
How dare you say that!

439
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,180
How dare you say those offensive things!

440
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess! Drag her out of this holy palace and kill her immediately!

441
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,550
Wait!

442
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,240
Today is Heavenly Empress's birthday, it is supposed to be a day full of joy!

443
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,580
It is not a day for killing. Reconsider your decision please, Mother!

444
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,020
This kid is from Floral Realm. I'm afraid that she knows nothing about Heaven disciplines

445
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,940
Please be merciful, Heavenly Empress!

446
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,240
What she said is just so offensive and indecent

447
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,380
It offended our dignity and honor

448
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,380
It is impossible for me to forgive it

449
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,140
Calm down, Heavenly Empress

450
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,880
If you want to punish her, please punish me first

451
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,440
Jin Mi is my best friend

452
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,380
If it is not me telling her that today is the birthday celebration

453
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,100
Jin Mi wouldn't be here

454
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,090
I will take full responsibility of that

455
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,680
your hairpin has the other pair, hasn't it?

456
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,140
So, if the spirit of grape is the one you just mentioned? Is she your best friend who gave you the hairpin?

457
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,480
If my memory is correct

458
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,740
Night Immortal just mentioned that the one who gave you the vine hairpin is not here

459
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,420
So you were lying to us

460
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,680
Do you intend to take the blame

461
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,660
to cover her up?

462
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,120
I am willing to take any punishment

463
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,720
and won't complain a word!

464
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,300
Phoenix Feather!

465
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,660
I don't know that Phoenix Feather is as powerful as an Amulet!

466
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Xu Feng!

467
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,800
Hope Heavenly Empress would forgive her this time!

468
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,180
Empress, please, give her one more chance

469
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,980
How dare you! The Snake Fairy!

470
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,290
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess, catch them!

471
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,180
Yes, Your highness!

472
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,220
Sorry for interrupting your birthday, Heavenly Empress

473
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,960
I will take the responsibility and the punishment after coJin Mig back

474
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,320
Xu Feng!

475
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,500
It is my fault, I can't let Fire Immortal take the responsibility

476
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,220
I'm gonna go and make up for my mistake

477
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,680
I'll come back later!

478
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,639
Oh my god

479
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,820
I moved so fast, sorry for those poor Heaven guardians since they are unable to catch us!

480
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,880
I am such a powerful man!

481
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,880
Lord Puchi

482
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,440
Thank you so much! You saved my life again!

483
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,300
So... How would you pay back to me

484
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,020
What do you want?

485
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,389
How about being my woman

486
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,889
We can explore the secrets of spirit training

487
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,860
Spirit training?

488
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,639
Do you wanna turn into ashes?!

489
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,360
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess are coming soon, come with me!

490
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,400
I wonder why Fire Immortal wants to turn me into ashes

491
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,300
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you

492
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,560
If you keep trying step over my bottom line, I would turn you into ashes in seconds

493
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,580
Maybe he is the only one who can protect Jin Mi

494
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,740
My little beauty, Sad that we have feelings with each other but intervened by others

495
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,400
No worries, I will train myself hard, then take you back!

496
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,180
Going to the Birthday Celebration was

497
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,840
Just for a bite of the holy peach to increase my magic power

498
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,300
would you catch me back to the Heaven Palace and let Empress kill me?

499
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,910
let her kill you?

500
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,600
I only have one Phoenix Feather

501
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,860
and I give it to you

502
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,680
Why you still cannot understand my heart?

503
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,340
Even though...

504
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,800
We are destined to be separated

505
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,520
Thank you

506
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,240
Please wear this Phoenix Feather

507
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,280
Wish it could protect you for me,
protect you to be safe and secure

508
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,230
I'm gonna send you back to Floral Realm right now

509
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,610
After you come back home, we will never meet each other again

510
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,380
Fairy Jin Mi

511
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,840
Fish Fairy!

512
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,590
Are you alright?

513
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,840
Chief Peony

514
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,540
It is great that Fire Immortal has made this decision

515
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,660
Chief Peony

516
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,190
No worries, I am a rational person

517
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,820
Now that I know that Jin Mi is related to me, I definitely don't wanna bring any trouble to her

518
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,820
Fire Immortal is such an understanding person

519
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,820
Please keep the secret

520
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,040
for peace of Floral Realm

521
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,880
What? What’s the secret?

522
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,540
Stop asking!

523
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,410
If not the flowers here sent us signals,
it would be so hard for us to track you

524
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,820
How long do you plan to hide from us!

525
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,290
Today is the Birthday Celebration of Heavenly Empress

526
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,820
Jin Mi got in accidentally and exposed her true identity. Heavenly Empress and Empress became suspicious about her identity

527
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,550
At this moment

528
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,080
The Heaven Guardians are looking for Jin Mi

529
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,680
What? Jin Mi!

530
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,780
I don't mean to bring troubles to you guys!

531
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,920
There was a rat which freaked me out

532
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,100
I'm not surprised at all.. if you were not a trouble maker

533
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,680
Moon Immortal would be the Heavenly Empress someday

534
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,780
Your Highness, Fire Immortal. We took an order from the Empress,

535
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,300
Fire Immortal, please don't be in the way

536
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,410
Jin Mi is the spirit of Floral Realm

537
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,040
No matter what mistakes she made, she can only
be judged according to the Rules of Floral Realm

538
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,420
Anyone who's not from Floral Realm has no right
to do anything to her

539
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,920
There are 36 Heaven Generals and
millions Heaven Guardians in Heaven Realm

540
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,210
If I remembered correctly,

541
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,020
none of them is under charge of Heavenly Empress

542
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,010
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

543
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,300
you guys probably forgot whom you guys should follow

544
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,880
Calm down, Your Highness, we are followers of the you

545
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,510
Certainly, we should take orders from you

546
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,400
So, take my order right now, bring Heaven Guardians back to Heaven Realm immediately!

547
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,500
I will explain to Heavenly Empress in person

548
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,060
Yes, your Highness.

549
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,780
Two Chiefs

550
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,030
It is me who broke in the Water Mirror and took Jin Mi out

551
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,080
I did not expect to make so many troubles. My apology!

552
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,590
Two honorable immortals from Heaven
bursted into our place many times

553
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,380
We have just figured out why Fire Immortal
accidentally got in our place

554
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,060
Could you explain the intention of breaking into our place?

555
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,060
Fairy Jin Mi is such an outgoing and energetic lady.
She is curious about everything

556
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,890
But she seems unhappy to be restricted in the Water Mirror

557
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,270
As a friend of Fairy Jin Mi

558
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:10,910
I just want her to have more freedom

559
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,730
I dont think you are honest to us

560
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,370
Fire Immortal is pretty straight forward

561
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,280
Why can't Night Immortal tell us the truth

562
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,080
I have never done anything that cross the line, so I am telling the truth

563
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,100
I do treat her as my friend

564
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,120
Two Chiefs, please don't blame on Fish Fairy

565
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,540
Fish Fairy is a good dragon, and I like him

566
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,830
What did you just say?!

567
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,260
I said, Fish Fairy is a good dragon, I...
