GANGDONG MUNICIPAL CIVIL AFFAIRS BUREAU

2
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,120
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION OFFICE

3
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,800
Here.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
This is it.

5
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,040
Mumu, why are we here?

6
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,840
We have to end the engagement contract
before we can get married.

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Since the engagement was your scheme,
then I'll help you succeed.

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,440
As far as I'm concerned,
marriage is a gamble.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Dare to take a chance?

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Yes.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,680
So long as you're not what's at stake,

12
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
I'll bet anything.

13
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
Ms. Jiang.

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,560
Mr. Ling, aren't you going
to wait for Xia Lin?

15
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
Didn't I warn you about the contract?

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't understand what you're saying.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,280
I didn't show it to anybody.

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
This is my last warning.

19
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,720
Mumu is where I draw the line.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
Tread carefully.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,760
What do you all think about my proposal?

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
Chu Yan.

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,000
We approve of
the transformation you propose.

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
That is unavoidable for the company.

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,360
However, I believe
there is too much risk involved

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
in the projects you just mentioned.

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
As I said,

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
it's just an experiment.

29
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,760
During the investment stage,

30
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,480
we will still need the support
of our traditional businesses.

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,640
Our conventional model
cannot support this transformation.

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
I still think we should take it
one step at a time.

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Chu Yan, you closed the deal with Puhua.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,080
We are aware of your capabilities.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,600
However, you just took over.

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,840
There is a lot for you to learn.

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
How about this?

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,240
We will go home
and consider your proposal.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,840
Please think over our suggestions as well.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
Let's go.

41
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,600
ZHEN BAOHUI, XIA LIN

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,560
What's wrong, Ms. Jiang?

43
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,720
Are you feeling sick?

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
It's nothing. How did it go?

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,360
It went well.

46
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,040
I should be able
to wrap up work early today.

47
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,000
By the way, I don't have anything
on the schedule tomorrow night, right?

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,959
-Do you have plans?
-I have a high school reunion tomorrow.

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,680
I haven't attended one in years.

50
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm excited about the meet-up.

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,520
High school friends?

52
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,440
We all got along quite well
during high school.

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,640
All right. Have fun.

54
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Work hard, play hard.

55
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay.

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,400
-I'm taking off.
-Bye.

57
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Boss.

58
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,400
Your dad prepared these profiles
of blind date candidates.

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Discard them.

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,640
If he gives you more,
just throw them in the trash.

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
All right.

62
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,120
HUANG AIXI, FATHER: HUANG JIANJUN

63
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
Is Huang Aixi

64
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,840
the daughter of one of the directors?

65
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Yes, I heard Ms. Huang
recently returned from abroad.

66
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I'll meet her.

67
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,240
Boss, don't you hate these blind dates?

68
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes,

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
but I don't want to hear
the old man's nagging.

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,640
If I have to choose,

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
I'll go with the least likely choice.

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
Okay.

73
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,840
Does that feel good, Mumu?

74
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,440
Mumu, you were amazing today.

76
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,080
Zhen Baohui wants
to drive a wedge between us.

77
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,360
I would never trust her.

78
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,000
That's why I say you're the best.

79
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Don't try to skirt the issue
by sweet-talking me.

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,480
We need to lay out some ground rules,

81
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
so this doesn't happen again.

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
-Mumu.
-Yes?

83
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I promise you

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,840
something like this
will never happen again.

85
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,560
How can you guarantee it?

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Like this.

87
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Ling Yizhou, I have something to tell you.

88
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Go on.

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,520
I am...

90
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
hungry.

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,800
You glutton.

92
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
I'll make noodles for you.

93
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,960
Okay.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,280
By the way, I'm going
to a high school reunion tomorrow.

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,440
Okay, I'll leave work early
and go with you.

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't bother.
We can't bring family to the reunion.

97
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
You can do your work.

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
Why not?

99
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm losing another chance
to show everyone that you're mine.

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm sure a lot of people
adored you at school.

101
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,120
You're right. I was so popular.

102
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,120
Are you jealous?

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,480
No, I'm not.

104
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,360
I heard from my dad
that you just took over the company.

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,160
Yes.

106
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,200
There are no secrets
between you and your dad.

107
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,840
I do have a solid relationship
with my dad.

108
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,920
What about you?
Don't you tell your family everything?

109
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,720
I personally feel that bringing work home

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
is disrespectful to my family.

111
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
I just returned from abroad.

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
I studied jewelry design in college.

113
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,000
That's incredible, Ms. Huang.

114
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
You're awe-inspiring like your dad.

115
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
You flatter me.

116
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
Perhaps my studies
could be useful to your company.

117
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm afraid not.

118
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,320
Our company doesn't have
any business in that field.

119
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,960
Mr. Chu, what is your astrology sign?

120
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,159
Do you believe in astrology?

121
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,280
Just making small talk.

122
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Maybe we'll see how compatible we are.

123
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm an Aries.

124
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Aries?

125
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,320
Aries is enthusiastic and optimistic,
but also impulsive and self-centered.

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm a Virgo, a perfectionist.

127
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
So that means...

128
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
We're not compatible.

129
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Sorry, I wasn't interrupting, was I?

130
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
Here, Feifei.

131
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,920
Thank you.

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,720
Don't worry.
Chance favors the prepared mind.

133
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,840
Don't worry, Feifei.

134
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm completely prepared.

135
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,720
I hope you'll give me a chance this time.

136
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,160
-I'll try my best.
-Thank you.

137
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,160
You have potential. I believe in you.

138
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,400
Feifei!

139
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,480
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,120
I bought the fish you like.

141
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,760
I'll make spicy poached fish
for you tonight.

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,440
Didn't you say that
I eat too many heavy foods

143
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,040
and should try a lighter diet?

144
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
Why the sudden change?

145
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,960
Indulging once in a while is fine.

146
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
My spicy poached fish is here.

147
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
-So you...
-I...

148
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
Should I leave now?

149
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
Sure.

150
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
Let's go.

151
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey, Feifei.

152
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
See you tomorrow.

153
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,160
Pick up the pace.

154
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,880
Ms. Huang, what do you like to do?

155
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,920
I like art so I often check out exhibits.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,480
I also like traveling and sports.

157
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,640
That's quite classy.

158
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,520
So that must mean
you like traveling around

159
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,080
rather than staying at home.

160
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
We only live once.

161
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,240
Shouldn't we see the world while we can?

162
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,040
I mean

163
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
is family life not enough?

164
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,200
Work takes up a lot of my time.

165
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
If we get married,

166
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,760
will you continue traveling for leisure?

167
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
I think women should place family first,

168
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
look after the elderly,

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
and manage the household.

170
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,160
Mr. Chu, what age are we living in?

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,880
How can you still think this way?

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Perhaps my family is just traditional.

173
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,640
I hope my future wife
will be a model wife and mother.

174
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,440
This is only our first time meeting.

175
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
Why are we even discussing
our thoughts on married life?

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,880
Shouldn't we find out
if we're on the same page?

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,440
By the way, Ms. Huang,

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,960
I think you're right about one thing.

179
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm beginning to believe in astrology.

180
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't think we're a good fit.

181
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,280
Sorry!

182
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
Miss.

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,760
Don't you know eavesdropping is very rude?

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

185
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,480
I have no idea how the chair
moved all the way here.

186
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,640
I'll move it back.

187
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
Sorry.

188
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
Sorry.

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,680
My dear.

190
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
-You--
-Ms. Huang.

191
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,160
She is actually my girlfriend.

192
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,680
My dad won't let us be together

193
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
and forced me to come to this blind date.

194
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,320
She secretly followed us.

195
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,880
My dear, I would never cheat on you.

196
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,040
Don't worry.

197
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,120
Mr. Chu, you can't be serious.

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,760
Just be frank if you want to turn me down.

199
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,600
Or maybe acting out idol dramas
has become the norm for you.

200
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,360
Talk to your dad
if you don't want to go on blind dates.

201
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,080
Don't waste other people's time.

202
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm sorry about that.

203
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
Wait.

204
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,840
Well...

205
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
Can you touch me again?

206
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
Don't get the wrong idea.

207
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,360
I just want you

208
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
to repeat what you just did.

209
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,560
Can we be friends?

210
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,800
Are you sure that's it?

211
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,160
This isn't a scam?

212
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
Are you hurt anywhere?

213
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,440
My name is Ruan Meng.
You can also call me Xiaoyou.

214
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,480
What about you?

215
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Me?

216
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,560
I forgot what my name is.

217
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Don't leave yet!

218
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,520
-I'm really busy.
-I just want to be friends!

219
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,080
I don't have time to play games.

220
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm really busy.

221
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,640
It's all the old man's fault
for making me come to this blind date.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
This ended so badly.

223
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
Xiaoyou?

224
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,320
Why does that name sound so familiar?

225
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
How could she not know me?

226
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,600
Ms. Ruan, are you all right?

227
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm fine. Don't worry.

228
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
That man just now...

229
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,320
He's interesting, isn't he?

230
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,720
He looks familiar.

231
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,920
I think he's a celebrity.

232
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,160
Really?

233
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
So your name is Chu Yan.

234
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,760
"Former superstar with a huge following.

235
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,640
Left showbiz
to take over the family business."

236
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,640
Ms. Ruan, should we bring that man back
to apologize to you?

237
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
Don't scare him.

238
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,520
Stay at least ten meters away from me
from now on. Okay?

239
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,840
-Yes, Ms. Ruan.
-Yes, Ms. Ruan.

240
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,920
Chu Yan.

241
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,600
This is so sour!

242
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,000
How many pickled vegetables
did you add to this?

243
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,920
I can't take this. I need some water.

244
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,120
BAI: FEIFEI, YOU MUSTN'T ABANDON ME.

245
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,560
Dig in.

246
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,480
Who was that guy outside earlier?

247
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,720
Also, someone just sent you a message,

248
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,480
begging you not to leave him.

249
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,200
Who are these two people?

250
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,840
It's not two people.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,120
Just one.

252
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
So which one is it?

253
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
No, it's not a person.

254
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,200
I mean, it is a person.

255
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,360
What am I saying?

256
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,280
What I mean is

257
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,480
I have nothing to do with him.

258
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
He just has a minor role in my drama.

259
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,080
Then why didn't you keep a distance
when he stepped in close to you?

260
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,320
And why does he keep messaging you
asking you not to leave him?

261
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,600
How do you explain that?

262
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,440
See for yourself.

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,119
Bai has an insignificant role
in my new drama.

264
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,400
He said he really likes my script

265
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,880
and keeps pestering me
to add more lines for him.

266
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,200
He hopes his character
can be more well-rounded.

267
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,240
His character only appears
in a few episodes.

268
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,319
I can't change the plot just for him.

269
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,160
Are you not angry anymore?

270
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,440
Angry?

271
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,360
Why would I be?

272
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm not angry. Let's eat.

273
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,120
I guess it is a bit sour.

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,960
-It has been so long.
-It has been so long.

275
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,280
-My goodness.
-It's been so long.

276
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,640
-Hi, Xia Lin!
-Xia Lin!

277
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,800
-Where do I sit?
-Xia Lin!

278
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,000
Sit over there. Come on.

279
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
-I'm going to that table.
-Come, sit here.

280
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
-Xia Lin!
-Xia Lin!

281
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,560
-Xia Lin!
-Sit here.

282
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,120
You're so pretty today.

283
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,360
I can't believe you're here.
Sui Peng said you weren't coming.

284
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,800
-Nonsense.
-Xia Lin, I saw your latest drama.

285
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
I was hooked.

286
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,200
When is your next drama airing?

287
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,520
Xia Lin, do you remember
our class teacher who always said

288
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,400
that you only had your looks
going for you?

289
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,480
Look at her now.

290
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,400
Her beauty has made
the class teacher so proud.

291
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,480
He tells everyone
that you were his favorite student.

292
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,360
He's still the same.

293
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
-He hasn't changed at all.
-Right.

294
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,720
Xia Lin, why didn't your rich fiancé come?

295
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,480
Are we not good enough for him?

296
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,200
I heard he has brought you
a lot of resources.

297
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,160
Is that true?

298
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Is it really a romantic relationship?

299
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,600
You two got engaged so suddenly.

300
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,840
Sui Peng said we can't bring our family.

301
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,040
That's why I didn't ask him to come.
You can blame Sui Peng.

302
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
-That's true.
-Who's talking about me?

303
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,200
-There you are.
-Was it you?

304
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,000
-It wasn't me.
-Hey, Xia Lin.

305
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
I just got here.

306
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,520
Xia Lin, you've made it big.

307
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,840
I see you on TV all the time
and you're gorgeous.

308
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,480
I also remember you stood up
for a student in another class.

309
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
-You were like a heroine.
-I remember that.

310
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,040
It caused a sensation at school.

311
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,360
-I remember now.
-I didn't.

312
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,720
Wasn't it Yao Liang in the class next door

313
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,520
who was always bullied
but never told the teachers?

314
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,640
Yes.

315
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,960
I remember now.

316
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,480
I think he was beaten up so badly
that he was hospitalized.

317
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Actually,

318
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,760
when I went to the hospital last week,

319
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
I ran into Yao Liang's mom.

320
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,320
She told me

321
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Yao Liang was hit
by a drunk driver two years ago.

322
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
He's still in a coma.

323
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,400
It's not clear when he'll wake up.

324
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,520
How could this happen?

325
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,280
Back in high school,

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,360
he didn't talk much.

327
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,240
But he was very kind.

328
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,320
Yes, he's a nice person.

329
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
He's also a bit shy.

330
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,600
Even if he was misunderstood,

331
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,080
he wouldn't defend himself.

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,920
Xia Lin.

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,920
Didn't you help him out back then?

334
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,920
He must have felt very grateful.

335
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,680
I actually didn't do much.

336
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,480
Let's not talk about this.

337
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,400
I was just feeling emotional.

338
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,400
Me and my big mouth.

339
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Come on, guys.

340
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
-Liu, sit at the other table.
-Sit down.

341
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,080
Let's raise our glasses for this reunion.

342
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,680
-Come on, everyone.
-Here.

343
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,040
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

344
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Sit.

345
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,840
Dig in.

346
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,000
FILM SET, PLEASE WAIT QUIETLY

347
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
<i>Xia Lin, this is Yao Liang.
I went to high school with you.</i>

348
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
<i>You might not remember me,</i>

349
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>but I still remember that</i>

350
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,200
<i>when I was bullied at school,</i>

351
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,280
<i>you were the only one who stood up for me.</i>

352
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,640
<i>These memories have been so vivid lately.</i>

353
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
<i>It's a sign that</i>

354
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,280
<i>I should tell you
what I was never able to tell you before.</i>

355
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>I like you.</i>

356
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>I'm sorry if this comes as a shock.</i>

357
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,440
<i>Is there any chance</i>

358
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,280
<i>you would accept me as your boyfriend?</i>

359
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,120
<i>Hi, Yao Liang.</i>

360
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,560
<i>Of course I remember you.</i>

361
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,680
<i>Thank you for telling me this.</i>

362
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,480
<i>But I'm very sorry.</i>

363
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,040
<i>I am currently focusing on my career.</i>

364
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,040
<i>I don't plan on dating for the time being.</i>

365
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,640
<i>Okay, but can we meet and talk?</i>

366
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
<i>I haven't seen you in a long time.</i>

367
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,760
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

368
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,720
<i>I have to attend a dance at a bar tonight.</i>

369
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,280
<i>Can I meet you there?</i>

370
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,880
-Come on in.
-Okay.

371
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Look.

372
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Come here.

373
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,320
Eat up. What's the matter?

374
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,280
-Dig in.
-Eat.

375
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,600
-Here.
-Xia Lin, sit down.

376
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,680
Xia Lin, we're thinking about
visiting the class teacher next Monday.

377
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,520
Do you want to come with us?

378
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,560
Sure, tell me once you've set a time.

379
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
I'll be there.

380
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,960
Let's dig in.

381
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,320
-Okay.
-Let's eat!

382
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,280
Come on.

383
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,080
Mumu, you're drunk.

384
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,160
No, I'm not drunk at all.

385
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,360
But so what if I am?

386
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,080
You're here to wait with me
until I sober up.

387
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
Sure, I'll wait with you.

388
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,720
Here.

389
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,560
Ling Yizhou, thank you
for picking me up today.

390
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
Did you see my friends?

391
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
They were all so envious of me.

392
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,880
Really?

393
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,360
Did you have a good time today?

394
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,040
Yes, I had so much fun.

395
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,400
Guess what?

396
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,960
I was the class monitor in high school.

397
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,240
Do you know what that is?

398
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,800
That's the student in charge of the class.

399
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,680
Everybody in the class had to listen to me
except for the teacher.

400
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,720
Although, I was more like an errand girl.

401
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,480
I haven't seen everybody since graduation.

402
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,240
Seeing them all today

403
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,360
makes me feel like
I was 18 years old again.

404
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,880
We even talked about the last class
before college entrance exams.

405
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,120
Mr. Wu, as in our class teacher,

406
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,960
told us to tell the class our dreams.

407
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,800
I confidently told everyone

408
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,920
that I wanted to be an actress.

409
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,440
Many of them thought I was joking.

410
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,200
The Mumu I know would never
take her dreams lightly.

411
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,360
Yes, when a dream is put into words,
it must be turned into reality.

412
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,920
Why mention it otherwise?

413
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,200
Yes, you're very brave.

414
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,160
Many people don't even have
the courage to speak of their dreams,

415
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,520
much less realize them.

416
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,880
What's wrong?

417
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,880
Ling Yizhou.

418
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,480
In one of our conversations
at dinner tonight,

419
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,280
they mentioned a classmate.

420
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Who?

421
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,920
<i>Ling Yizhou has nothing to do
with Yao Liang.</i>

422
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,120
<i>He has enough on his plate already.</i>

423
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
<i>I shouldn't bother him with this.</i>

424
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,840
It's nothing. Just a classmate.

425
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,640
It's okay. You can tell me anything.
I won't mind.

426
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,120
I just want to tell you

427
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,160
that I'm very happy right now.

428
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,880
Thank you, Ling Yizhou.

429
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,640
I'll continue to make you happy.

430
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,360
Your phone is ringing.

431
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,760
Who is it?

432
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
-Hello?
<i>-Boss!</i>

433
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,280
<i>Your grandma fainted.</i>

434
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
<i>She's at the hospital!</i>

435
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,480
What did you say?

436
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,760
EMERGENCY ROOM

437
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,680
It's going to be okay.

438
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,400
She'll be fine.

439
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,160
Don't worry.

440
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,000
Everything will be okay.

441
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,360
GANGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

442
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,120
Doctor, how is she?

443
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,400
The patient is stable now.

444
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,960
We'll need to monitor her for a few days
and watch how she recovers.

445
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,400
-She's not in danger?
-Correct.

446
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
-I see. Thank you, doctor.
-No problem.

447
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,040
The doctor says she's fine. Relax.

448
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,160
Grandma.

449
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,440
You're finally awake.

450
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,960
-You're here.
-How do you feel?

451
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,960
I'm fine.

452
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm just old.
My blood pressure got a bit high.

453
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
Look at how worried you are.

454
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,440
Grandma.

455
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,560
You have to watch your diet from now on.

456
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,600
Can you promise me that?

457
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,640
Okay.

458
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,040
I'll listen to you.

459
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
Where's Mumu?

460
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,200
She said my flowers aren't pretty enough.

461
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
She went out to buy
a better-looking bouquet for you.

462
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,680
You know what?

463
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,520
She stayed here with me all night.

464
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Good.

465
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,560
Yizhou, listen.

466
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,720
I just had a dream.

467
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
I dreamed of your grandpa and your dad.

468
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,560
They asked me how we're doing.

469
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,400
I told them you're doing so well

470
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,760
and you have someone that you love.

471
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,800
She's a nice woman
who loves and understands him.

472
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,480
Yizhou.

473
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,880
I'll get to see you get married
and have children.

474
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,360
-I'll hold your child in my arms.
-Your hand.

475
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,280
Grandma, I'm going to tell you something,
but don't yell at me.

476
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,000
That day when I brought Mumu home
to see you,

477
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,800
we had already gotten
our marriage certificate.

478
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
I'm married.

479
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Now you just have to wait
for great-grandchildren.

480
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
Yes, okay!

481
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,280
Yizhou, you did the right thing.

482
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,360
I need to recover quickly

483
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,280
so I can attend your wedding ceremony.

484
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
This is wonderful, Yizhou.

485
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
You're getting married.

486
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,160
It's Chu Yan.

487
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
It's Chu Yan.

488
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,840
Hey, what's up?

489
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,480
<i>Hello? How's your grandma?</i>

490
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Grandma? She's fine now.

491
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,640
The doctor said she needs to be monitored
for a few days

492
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,120
before she can be discharged.

493
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,920
<i>I wouldn't have known
if Xia Lin hadn't told me this morning.</i>

494
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,960
Grandma, do you want to talk to him?

495
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,400
-Yes.
-Here.

496
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,200
Hello, Chu Yan?

497
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,640
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

498
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,160
<i>Are you feeling better now?</i>

499
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,000
From the sound of my laughter,

500
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,880
don't I sound much better already?

501
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,880
Don't worry about me.

502
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,360
<i>Grandma, you have to get better soon.</i>

503
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,160
<i>I miss your cooking.</i>

504
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,800
I miss you too.

505
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,760
I'll definitely cook for you
when you visit.

506
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,760
<i>Sure!</i>

507
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,240
I'll let you talk to Yizhou.

508
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,920
You must have some business to discuss.

509
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,760
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Bye.

510
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,880
Hello? Do you have anything else you need?

511
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,320
<i>No.</i>

512
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,760
But I do.

513
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,400
Yizhou.

514
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,800
How are things at work?

515
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,440
Did they put up a resistance?

516
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,120
You were right.

517
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,280
They must be dinosaurs.

518
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,600
I understand the pain you went through
when you took over your family business.

519
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,680
It's a no-brainer.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,280
Your proposal doesn't tie in
with the company's business.

521
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,200
It's normal that
they wouldn't want to take the risk.

522
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,000
It seems that I'm more suited to be there

523
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,400
than in business.

524
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,080
Unlike you,
I'm not a successful business whiz.

525
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,480
That is also a business.

526
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,800
Have you ever thought about
going back to what you're good at?

527
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,800
For example, photography.

528
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,440
Guess what?

529
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,640
Mumu told me

530
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,600
she wants a destination wedding.

531
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,880
Does this bring any ideas to mind?

532
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
Photography.

533
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,720
Travel.

534
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,680
Wedding.

535
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,520
Do you mean

536
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,760
an idea focused around wedding photos?

537
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,720
Wedding photos...

538
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,760
while traveling.

539
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,920
In that case,

540
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,560
this could also be applied
to best friends and couples photo shoots.

541
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,920
Sure, of course.

542
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,360
Look, you came up with an idea.

543
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,200
Who says you're not fit for business?

544
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,040
While on vacation,

545
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,120
people can have
their precious moments recorded

546
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,880
while making beautiful memories.

547
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,920
Yizhou, your suggestion is invaluable.

548
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,280
Okay.

549
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Now you have a way to combine
traditional business and innovation.

550
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,240
You're not new to funding and marketing.

551
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,720
Your shareholders will gain faith in you.

552
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,760
You're right.

553
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,520
Starting out from this angle

554
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,600
would make this more feasible
for our company

555
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,640
than previous proposals.

556
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,280
Stay realistic.

557
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,480
You only have an idea right now.

558
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,480
You haven't determined
what makes it superior.

559
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,000
How will you convince the shareholders?

560
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,040
Isn't the combination
of travel and photography

561
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,480
makes it superior?

562
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,080
No, I believe photography and travel
are only a form of delivery.

563
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,800
You should have something competitive
that nobody else can offer.

564
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,120
If you only innovate
your form of delivery,

565
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,120
then others will likely copy you

566
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,320
and even do it better.

567
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,640
Do you mean

568
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,760
I should offer unique travel options

569
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,800
or have more professional photographers?

570
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,720
Something like that.

571
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,280
You'll have to come up
with your own ideas.

572
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,280
And one more thing.

573
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,840
You also need to think
about how to keep your customers

574
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,960
and make them trust you.

575
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,000
How am I going to carve out
a niche in this field?

576
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,760
I can hire
the top photographers and stylists

577
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,000
that I worked with
during fashion magazine photo shoots.

578
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,720
I can also use my connections
in the entertainment circle.

579
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,280
This is what gives you a leg up.

580
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,680
Now I want to hire you.

581
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,240
However, this comes with increasing costs.

582
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,280
Online advertisements and brand promotions

583
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,800
don't come cheap.

584
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,560
Why are you worrying about that?

585
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,800
I can invest.

586
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
Yizhou.

587
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,000
Don't look at me like that.

588
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,640
This is business.

589
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,840
Lingshi Group happens to be
considering new projects.

590
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
Just prepare a flawless proposal
and convince me.

591
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,080
One more thing.

592
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,160
Can I count on you
to take wedding photos for me and Mumu?

593
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
You bet.

594
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,320
But you still have to pay.

595
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
Forget I said anything.

596
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,440
I'm just kidding, Yizhou.

597
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
All right.

598
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,480
Come here.

599
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,480
Enough already.

600
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,520
I can't help you with anything else,

601
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,560
but I can still treat you to a meal.

602
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,520
Boss, they said everything is ready.

603
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,159
Hello, Mumu?

604
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
I'm meeting
a very important client tonight.

605
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,880
I need a partner. Come with me.

606
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,280
Pidan, what are you doing here?

607
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,440
Ling Yizhou, come out.

608
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Mumu.

609
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,960
I prepared this for you. Do you like it?

610
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,680
Your photo editing skills are terrible.

611
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,960
Mumu.

612
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,840
I couldn't take part in your past.

613
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
But I hope

614
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,160
I won't miss a day of your future.

615
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,120
I'll watch the sunset and stars
with you every day.

616
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
I'll grow old with you.

617
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
We already have
our marriage certificate, but...

618
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm sorry.

619
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
I never gave you the perfect proposal.

620
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,640
I hope you'll give me a chance.

621
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,040
Let me do this properly

622
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,560
and be in your world.

623
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,880
I designed this wedding gown.

624
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,680
I meticulously chose every detail,
from its color to the materials.

625
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,800
I spent a lot of time on it.

626
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,760
In the end,

627
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,720
I decided to name it after you.

628
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,040
The World's One and Only Xia.

629
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,600
It's beautiful.

630
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,240
Mumu?

631
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,080
Will you marry me?

632
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,280
Yes.

633
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,640
You're finally mine!

634
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,360
You're mine too.

635
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,760
Mumu.

636
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,320
Do you know what I'm thinking?

637
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,520
What?

638
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,840
I want our wedding to be held
as soon as possible.

639
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,280
I can't wait anymore.

640
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,600
I want to tell the whole world
that you're my bride.

641
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
EARN MONEY TO SUPPORT MUMU:
SHARED THIS PHOTO

642
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,240
Hello, Linlin?

643
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,680
Hi, Ms. Jiang.

644
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,960
There's something I haven't told you.

645
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,360
Ling Yizhou and I are married.

646
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,360
<i>Considering our identities,</i>

647
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,640
<i>we've kept a secret from the public.</i>

648
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,600
But we now want to find a chance

649
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,480
to tell the public and our fans

650
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,080
the truth that we're married.

651
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,640
<i>Don't worry though.</i>

652
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,560
<i>This won't affect my work.</i>

653
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,560
Why are you only telling me this now?

654
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
We need to think about this first.

655
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,120
<i>After all, you're an actress on the rise.</i>

656
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
<i>You have to consider this carefully.</i>

657
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,440
I know.

658
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,440
But I still think

659
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
it would be better
to be honest with the public.

660
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,480
We'll need to see what the company thinks.

661
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,000
By the way,
don't forget the fitting tomorrow

662
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,160
for your red carpet outfit
for the Television Festival.

663
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,080
Don't worry, I remember.

664
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,600
Boss, it's late. You're not leaving yet?

665
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,160
You can go home first.

666
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,480
There's nothing more for you to do.

667
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,240
Do you need help?

668
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,160
Only I can do this.

669
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,040
I'm going to go.

670
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,360
I'm really going.

671
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,240

00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,640
Black will always be a classic
on the red carpet.

673
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,000
The material of this dress
can show off your slim waist.

674
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,040
The tailoring is perfect.

675
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,800
You clearly have your motives.

676
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,720
I do.

677
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,160
I want everyone to know

678
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,840
we're married.

679
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,280
Who are you?

680
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,440
Hello, ma'am.

681
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,920
I was Yao Liang's classmate.

682
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,080
My name is Xia Lin.

683
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,480
So you're the tramp
who left my son for money.

684
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,800
