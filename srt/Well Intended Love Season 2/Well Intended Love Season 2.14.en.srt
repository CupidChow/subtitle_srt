1
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
Read it and give it back to me.

2
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,640
I can't stay for long.

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
<i>You're...</i>

4
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,200
The supervisor just asked for you.
I'll take care of that.

5
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
Okay. Here you go.

6
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
Fill it with confetti.

7
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,000
He's always asking for me.

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
I'm so busy.

9
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
Dad.

10
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
Who are we having dinner with?

11
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,680
You're being so mysterious.
Why aren't they here yet?

12
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,120
You'll see it soon.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,640
I don't know why you kept me in the dark.

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,600
There's nothing you can't tell me.

15
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
If you had told me,

16
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
I couldn't have been happier.

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm so sorry!

18
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,560
Sorry that we're late.
We were stuck in traffic.

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,520
You're not late.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Have a seat.

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,160
Mengmeng, sit.

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Okay.

23
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,360
Is this Mengmeng?

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,160
She's a pretty lady.

25
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,960
Mengmeng, this is Mr. Chu.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
She's beautiful and polite.

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
She was taught well, my future in-law.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
Yanyan, are you all right?

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
In my opinion,

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,600
you're the one who raised your son well.

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,320
Yanyan is handsome and capable.

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,160
My husband and I both like him very much.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
Not at all.

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,640
We won't interfere
with the two of them dating.

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
However,
with their relationship confirmed,

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,200
it's best for our two families to meet.

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Absolutely.

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,000
We should get to know each other.

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
This is wonderful.

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
Mom.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,880
We're not like that.

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,280
Mengmeng, I know you're just being shy.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,360
It's okay.

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm delighted that you're dating!

47
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,200
Dad? Ma'am?

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,800
It's probably not what you're thinking.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
It's all your fault.

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,040
She's shy.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
What's your excuse?

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,040
Why did you hide it?

53
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm telling you,

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,920
you can't be an irresponsible man.

55
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
-Dad.
-Dad!

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I mean, Mr. Chu.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
My relationship with Chu Yan
is not like what you think.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,279
Mengmeng, we already saw it.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,959
Don't hide it from us any longer.

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
If I hadn't seen it online,

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,960
how long would you have kept it from us?

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
Do you know how your dad reacted
when he found out?

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,480
He was overjoyed to the point of tears!

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,800
I need to talk to you.

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Sir, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

66
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,600
-What...
-They...

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Chu Yan.

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,160
I didn't know my mom
was bringing me to see you.

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
And she even thinks you're...

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,920
She must've seen the photos
on Weibo and misunderstood.

72
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,360
Who would have thought

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
that those silly photos
came with complications.

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,760
Are you angry?

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
No.

76
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
I find it amusing.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm sorry for disrupting your life.

78
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,240
It's no big deal.

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,720
Our parents merely misunderstood.

80
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,200
We just have to explain it to them.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,920
Besides, we have nothing to hide, right?

82
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,440
What if I do?

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,160
What did you say?

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,840
Chu Yan, I like you.

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,000
Ruan Meng, you must've felt
that our first meeting was unique,

86
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,920
so you mistakenly believe you like me.

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,760
But if I were anyone else,
you would feel the same.

88
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,520
No, you're different!

89
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,640
I...

90
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,720
I...

91
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,840
I didn't even hear you come in!

92
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Mumu, when are we going
to try on the wedding outfits?

93
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,840
Sorry, I'm busy for the next few days.

94
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll go once I have free time.

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,200
All right.

96
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
As your husband,

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,360
I have to support your career path
to become the best actress.

98
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,440
Thank you for your support, my dear.

99
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,320
Since I'm so understanding
and considerate,

100
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,120
don't I deserve a reward?

101
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,440
What are you doing?

102
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Getting my reward.

103
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,440
Don't push your luck.

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Ling Yizhou.

105
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
I have to discuss something with you.

106
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,559
What?

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,559
Can you not assign
so many bodyguards following me?

108
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Two bodyguards are enough.

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,320
People will think I'm a diva.

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,720
I understand.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,640
I guess I'll have to be
the only bodyguard following you around.

112
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,520
Fine, forget I said anything.

113
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,160
You should focus on your work.

114
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,280
Okay, behave now.

115
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
I have to finish packing.

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,160
Mumu, can you hurry up?

117
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm far from finished.

118
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
Hurry up.

119
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,840
Your phone rang.

120
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,960
I know, but I can't get up.

121
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,080
I got it.

122
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
-Here.
-Thank you.

123
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
Pack up faster.

124
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,320
<i>Boss, Fu Weining recently bought
several plane tickets</i>

125
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,480
<i>flying out of the country
at different times.</i>

126
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,720
<i>It could be a diversion.</i>

127
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>Station men at the airport just in case.</i>

128
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
<i>Yes, Boss.</i>

129
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,800
Did something come up?

130
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,040
No.

131
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Good.

132
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Mumu, are you almost done?

133
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,040
Soon.

134
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,280
I'll give you five minutes.

135
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,240
If you're not done by then,
you'll have to give me another reward.

136
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,480
I'll wait right here.

137
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Bojue Photography's sales have reached
a new high this month.

138
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,520
Customers continue to leave
positive feedback

139
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,720
and we continue to gain popularity online.

140
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,960
Excellent.

141
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,800
This is thanks to all of you.

142
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Bojue Photography couldn't
have been this successful without you.

143
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,880
You can look forward
to a bonus this month.

144
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,400
All right.

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,680
Let's keep up the momentum next month

146
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,080
and aim for a 20 percent increase
in sales next quarter.

147
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,920
Twenty percent?

148
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,040
-That'll be hard.
-Okay.

149
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,680
Today's meeting is adjourned.

150
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,520
Go home.

151
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Another day of working overtime.

152
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,480
Let's go.

153
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,640
JIALAN KONGKONG: HEY, CONGRATULATIONS!

154
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,520
IF THERE'S ANOTHER SWEET JOB LIKE THIS,
COUNT ME IN!

155
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,680
<i>Thank you.</i>

156
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
RUAN MENG

157
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,960
THAT KISS...

158
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,840
I KISSED YOU BECAUSE I LIKE YOU

159
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
How should I explain it?

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,800
MANAGER NICKY

161
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,160
WAY TO GO!

162
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,920
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT YOUR BRAND NOW.

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,280
THANKS. DON'T FORGET TO SPREAD THE WORD.

164
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,480
RUAN MENG

165
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
Why am I so flustered?

166
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,240
Why do I keep thinking about her?

167
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,280
I'm not the one who made the move.

168
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,480
Xia Lin, I'll head to my room now.

169
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
We set out at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow.

170
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Okay. Get some rest.

171
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

172
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,840
Ling Yizhou?

173
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,200
Why are you here?

174
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Here's a hint.

175
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,600
What day is it today?

176
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
What day is it today?

177
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
Birthday?

178
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,680
No, that's over already.

179
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,160
Wedding anniversary?

180
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,760
That's not it either.

181
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,120
It hasn't been a year yet.

182
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
What day is it?

183
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,160
This is our first Chinese Valentine's Day
since we got married.

184
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
Right! Chinese Valentine's Day!

185
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,960
I remember.

186
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,840
I planned on taking a hot bath

187
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,280
as soon as I got back
to the hotel after work

188
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,760
and then have a video chat with you.

189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,720
It's even better now that you're here!

190
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,640
I can still video chat with you

191
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
while you take your bath.

192
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,160
Did you prepare all this?

193
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,880
Isn't it romantic?

194
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,080
Aren't you touched?

195
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,640
Absolutely!

196
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,880
It's even more touching than in my dramas.

197
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,080
Did you think this was all there is?

198
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
There's more.

199
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,080
How did you know this is my favorite place
to get <i>malatang</i>?

200
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,400
I told you I've known you for a long time.

201
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,200
I know all your favorite things.

202
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,920
<i>Malatang</i> is the best.

203
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,960
It's better than the red wine
and steak you prepared.

204
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,520
You didn't even touch those.

205
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,200
I hope that

206
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,040
every Chinese Valentine's Day from now on

207
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,200
will be spent with you.

208
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,960
Mumu.

209
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,120
I'll be there for you
on every Chinese Valentine's Day.

210
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
Cheers.

211
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,320
Cheers.

212
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,360
-Delicious.
-Do you have noodles in yours?

213
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,080
-Yes.
-How come I don't have any?

214
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,520
There they are.

215
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
Tasty.

216
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
Head on home.

217
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,000
Make sure to drive safely.

218
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,160
Mumu.

219
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,800
You're so busy that
you don't have time to marry me.

220
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,920
Don't you feel guilty?

221
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,200
Well...

222
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,120
There is only one way to fix that problem.

223
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
That would be to hold our wedding
as soon as possible.

224
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,360
Don't you agree?

225
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,560
As soon as my movie is wrapped up,

226
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,960
we'll have our wedding ceremony.

227
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,280
You've said it.

228
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,760
I'll hold you to it.

229
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,480
Okay.

230
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,920
All right now.

231
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,480
Head on home.

232
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,319
I need to get ready for work.

233
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,240
Go on.

234
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,440
-Bye.
-Go.

235
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,880
Mumu!

236
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,119
I just want to see you one more time.

237
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,079
I'm heading up.

238
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,040
Go, quickly.

239
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,200
Mumu!

240
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
What now?

241
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,280
Bye.

242
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
Go.

243
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
Bye.

244
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,280
Mumu!

245
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,680
Remember to call me when you get there.

246
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
I know.

247
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,080
<i>As soon as my movie is wrapped up,</i>

248
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,120
<i>-we'll have our wedding ceremony.
-You've said it.</i>

249
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,440
Hello?

250
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>Let's meet somewhere to talk.</i>

251
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,200
-Okay, send me the address.
<i>-Okay.</i>

252
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,080
What is it now?

253
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,640
Mumu, are you in your room yet?

254
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,840
<i>I just got back to my room.</i>

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,920
Good.

256
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
Listen to me.

257
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,960
<i>Don't be on your own today.</i>

258
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,280
<i>Have Yuyuan stay with you.</i>

259
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
Did something happen?

260
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
Fu Weining just asked to meet me.

261
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,200
Don't be alone before I get back. Okay?

262
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,920
Are you meeting him on your own?

263
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,600
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

264
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,960
He won't do anything to me
in broad daylight.

265
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,280
I...

266
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
-Who is it?
<i>-Xia Lin.</i>

267
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,840
<i>Let's go over today's schedule.</i>

268
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
Yuyuan, hold on.

269
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,600
Yuyuan is at my door.

270
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,000
Stay in and don't go anywhere.

271
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,160
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Good.

272
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,640
Get back to work.

273
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,080
LINGSHI GROUP

274
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,960
-Hello?
<i>-Mrs. Ling?</i>

275
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
<i>Is Boss with you? I can't reach him.</i>

276
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
Don't you know?
He said he's meeting Fu Weining.

277
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,760
Fu Weining?

278
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,400
I just got word that he left.

279
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
<i>I was just on the phone with Ling Yizhou
20 minutes ago.</i>

280
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,040
<i>He told me he was meeting Fu Weining.</i>

281
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
Check for properties owned by Fu Weining
or places he frequents

282
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,800
within a 20-minute drive
from Mrs. Ling's hotel.

283
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
Mrs. Ling, continue.

284
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,400
He said Fu Weining
won't do anything to him.

285
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,680
Found it.

286
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,400
There are two properties
and a cold storage warehouse.

287
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Two properties
and a cold storage warehouse?

288
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
<i>Why would he have a cold warehouse?</i>

289
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,640
Cold storage warehouse?

290
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
It's so hot today.

291
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Aren't you hot?

292
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,360
Wen Li, give me
the address of the warehouse.

293
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,040
<i>Notify Chu Yan and you two can
check the other properties.</i>

294
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
<i>We'll search separately.</i>

295
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,560
Okay, Mrs. Ling.

296
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,760
Yuyuan, I'm heading out for a bit.

297
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,680
COLD STORAGE

298
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,680
COLD STORAGE

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,080
Fu Weining!

300
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,480
WAREHOUSE AREA, STAFF ONLY

301
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,640
Ling Yizhou!

302
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,440
Ling Yizhou, are you in there?

303
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Ling Yizhou!

304
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,680
Here comes another.

305
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,320
Excellent.

306
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,080
Buy one, get one free.

307
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,560
A hot sale.

308
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,960
COLD STORAGE

309
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Go on.

310
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,720
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

311
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

312
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,560
COLD STORAGE

313
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,080
Ling Yizhou!

314
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,760
Ling Yizhou, wake up!

315
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,920
Wake up!

316
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,160
Ling Yizhou, wake up!

317
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,440
Ling Yizhou!

318
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Ling Yizhou!

319
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,760
Ling Yizhou!

320
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,280
<i>Mumu, what are you doing here?</i>

321
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,400
-Didn't I tell you not to go anywhere?
-Save your nagging.

322
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,280
Let's figure out how to get out of here.

323
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,000
Did the door close behind you
when you came in?

324
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,920
Yes.

325
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,320
Did you see any other exits?

326
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,600
That's the only door.

327
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
No way. I'll search for another door.

328
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,320
Wen Li said Fu Weining left on a flight.

329
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,760
Did he really leave?

330
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,240
Or is he watching us?

331
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,240
Fu Weining,
why are you locking us in here?

332
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,480
<i>You're a coward!</i>

333
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,200
<i>I dare you to come out!</i>

334
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,600
<i>-I loathe such cowardly men!</i>
-Why is it so hot?

335
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,520
REFRIGERATION, DEFROST

336
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,800
Why is it so hot?

337
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,080
It's burning hot.

338
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
<i>Ling Yizhou.</i>

339
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,000
Why did you give me your jacket?

340
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,200
-Aren't you cold?
-It's okay.

341
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,280
Just hug me.

342
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm not cold. It's okay.

343
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,440
Your handsome face
is about to turn to ice.

344
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
Take my hand.

345
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
-Don't worry about me.
-Is that better?

346
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,880
Much better, Mumu.

347
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,160
Wen Li is such a dummy.

348
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,360
Why hasn't he found us yet?

349
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,360
When we get out of here,

350
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I'll send him off to the North Pole.

351
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll never let him return.

352
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,120
You can't.

353
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,480
What will Feifei do if he's gone?

354
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,040
Why are you bringing her up?

355
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
I...

356
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,440
It's stifling here.

357
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,160
Hot like a furnace.

358
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
Mumu, don't fall asleep.

359
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Don't close your eyes.

360
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,240
Mumu, when are we having
our wedding ceremony?

361
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,880
We...

362
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,720
We'll get married

363
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,120
as soon as we get out.

364
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
Yes, we'll get married
as soon as we get out.

365
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,920
Once we're married, we'll have kids.

366
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,040
Mumu.

367
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,320
Who do you think our child
will take after?

368
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
Definitely...

369
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,520
me.

370
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,400
Yes, that would be nice.

371
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,240
Don't sleep, Mumu.

372
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,320
No, our child won't take after you.
Our child will be like me.

373
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
That would be fun. You'll be so mad.

374
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,280
Our child won't be like you.

375
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,880
Mumu?

376
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,800
Mumu, don't fall asleep!

377
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,920
Mumu!

378
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,000
Mumu!

379
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,600
Mumu?

380
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,320
Mumu, wake up!

381
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Mumu!

382
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,880
Fu Weining!

383
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,080
I know you're watching.

384
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,080
You wouldn't miss a chance to mock me.

385
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>Okay.</i>

386
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,920
<i>I'll give you a chance.</i>

387
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,680
Come out.

388
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,960
Do this face-to-face.

389
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,320
<i>Ling Yizhou.</i>

390
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Are you having fun?

391
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,080
<i>Let Xia Lin go!</i>

392
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,520
<i>I'll play with you.</i>

393
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Wait a minute.

394
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,160
This is my game.

395
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,920
I make the rules.

396
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,040
You could beg me.

397
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,720
<i>If I'm pleased,</i>

398
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
<i>maybe I'll release her.</i>

399
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm begging you.

400
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
-Release Mumu.
<i>-Hold on.</i>

401
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,520
<i>Where's the sincerity?</i>

402
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,200
I want to see your sincerity.

403
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,960
Why don't you kneel and beg me?

404
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
Kneel for me.

405
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,520
Kneel.

406
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
Come on.

407
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,000
No.

408
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,200
I won't allow my man to kneel for anyone.

409
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,760
Don't.

410
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
<i>Happy now?</i>

411
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,480
This still doesn't seem like enough.

412
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,920
Not like this.

413
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,560
LING YIZHOU'S WHEREABOUTS IN JULY

414
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,720
Ling Yizhou.

415
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,560
I'm displeased.

416
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,440
I'm very displeased.

417
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,040
Why don't you kneel at my feet?

418
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,920
Crawl your way here.

419
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,480
I might be happy then.

420
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,000
Come.

421
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,480
Come on.

422
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,000
Crawl here! Now!

423
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Yes.

424
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,440
Come.

425
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,440
Come here.

426
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,920
Ling Yizhou.

427
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,760
You never imagined
this would ever happen, did you?

428
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,080
Fu Weining, you can't escape.

429
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,280
Let us go now.

430
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,640
I...

431
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,600
I promise not to pursue charges.

432
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,440
What do you mean?

433
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm not even here.

434
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,000
I already left this city.

435
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,440
I'm on a plane.

436
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,040
Didn't you have Wen Li on my tail?

437
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,280
Wen Li is my witness.

438
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Are you cold?

439
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,000
Are you cold?

440
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,640
No, I find the temperature just right.

441
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,680
Only in these conditions,

442
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
do I feel somewhat at ease

443
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,240
and able to forget those agonizing days.

444
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,640
Xia Lin.

445
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,520
Look.

446
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,280
This is your man.

447
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,240
He has no dignity.

448
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,120
Not a shred of self-respect!

449
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,800
Ling Yizhou.

450
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,560
You were born with a silver spoon
in your mouth,

451
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,400
but you're being crushed
by the likes of me!

452
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
Tell me.

453
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,760
Were you envious of me back then?

454
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,320
Did you hate that
I was better than you at everything,

455
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,160
so you reported me?

456
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,160
Fu Weining.

457
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
You can't be serious.

458
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,600
I told you it wasn't me.

459
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
You were expelled because you cheated!

460
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,160
I saw you go
into the academic affairs office!

461
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,800
After you came out, I was expelled!

462
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
It was you, you know?

463
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,320
It was you!

464
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,400
-Didn't you hear him?
-Mumu.

465
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,640
-He said it wasn't him!
-Mumu.

466
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
Mumu.

467
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,760
You believe him?

468
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,080
I do.

469
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
-I believe everything he says.
-If not for him,

470
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,040
my mom wouldn't have died!

471
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
If not for him,
I wouldn't have been expelled!

472
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,120
I didn't even get
to see my mom one last time!

473
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
And you believe him?

474
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,720
Get out!

475
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,160
Get out!

476
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
Mumu!

477
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
Mumu.

478
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
Wake up soon.

479
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,080
There are so many things we have to do.

480
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,440
We haven't taken wedding photos yet.

481
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,560
And I still owe you
the wedding of your dreams.

482
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,640
Wake up soon.

483
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,400
Give me a chance.

484
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,240
Let me make it perfect for you.

485
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,080
Mumu, wake up.

486
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
Our future is still...

487
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,080
Mumu?

488
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,040
Mumu, how do you feel?

489
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,400
Mumu?

490
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,400
Who are you?

491
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,080
I...

492
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,719
Who is Mumu?

493
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,239
My name is Xia Lin.

494
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,400
Ma'am, since Mumu is awake,

495
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,840
does that mean she's fine now?

496
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,199
Ms. Xia's vitals are normal.

497
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,040
However, we'll need
to continue monitoring her for a few days.

498
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,000
But...

499
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,040
But why doesn't she remember me?

500
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,040
You see,

501
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,360
Ms. Xia suffered head trauma,

502
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,800
resulting in a blood clot in her brain

503
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,239
which is pressing down on some neurons
linked to memory, causing a memory loss.

504
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,600
Fortunately, the blood clot is
rather small and isn't doing much damage.

505
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,040
How can the blood clot be removed?

506
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,159
There are two options.

507
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,679
One option is surgery.

508
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,480
Once the blood clot is drained,
she will recover her memory.

509
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
The other option is
a conservative approach with medication.

510
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,480
This will take time.

511
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,240
It may take months or years to work.

512
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
Does the surgery have risks?

513
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
It's considered minor surgery.

514
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,760
But there are no absolute guarantees.

515
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,200
Let's go with the conservative approach.

516
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,800
Okay.

517
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,120
Linlin?

518
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
Do you know who I am?

519
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,920
Feifei.

520
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,520
Is this a joke?

521
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,520
What about me?

522
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,680
Do you remember me?

523
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,840
Chu Yan.

524
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,960
-You still remember me?
-Of course I do.

525
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,520
We're in the same company.

526
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,600
You're the company's top idol
at the moment.

527
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,720
Why would you visit

528
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,680
a nobody like me?

529
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,280
How come your hairstyle has changed?

530
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,680
Is the company filming
this hospital visit?

531
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,520
No, I came by myself.

532
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,000
Linlin, do you know who Wen Li is?

533
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,000
Wen Li?

534
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
Him.

535
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,680
Who's that? Your friend?

536
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,920
My boyfriend!

537
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,040
When did you get a boyfriend?

538
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,800
Didn't we agree to prioritize our careers
just two days ago?

539
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,120
Do you know today's date?

540
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
June 8, my birthday.

541
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,400
By the way,
didn't you say there's an audition?

542
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,640
Is the audition still on?

543
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,520
Did they pick someone?
Do I still have a chance?

544
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,920
Linlin, I have something to tell you.

545
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,120
You better prepare yourself.

546
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
What is it?

547
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Me?

548
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,640
Xia Lin?

549
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,440
I'm now a B-list actress?

550
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm no longer a nobody?

551
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,400
I've even been in several dramas with you?

552
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,800
Yes.

553
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,200
And I'm now retired from showbiz.

554
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,480
Retired?

555
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,200
Linlin, there's something very important
you have to know.

556
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,040
He is your husband

557
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,400
with legal certification.

558
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,920
Husband?

559
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,720
Feifei, are you writing a new script
and pranking me?

560
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,920
Or are we on a show?

561
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
<i>X-Change</i>?

562
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,000
Is there a hidden camera in the room?

563
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,320
Mumu, they are telling the truth.

564
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,600
We're really married.

565
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,240
Look. This is our marriage certificate.

566
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,480
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

567
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
Does this trigger your memory?

568
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,120
Chu Yan?

569
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,440
Am I dreaming?

570
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Pinch me.

571
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,400
See for yourself.

572
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,720
This really is your marriage certificate.

573
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,440
Now do you understand
that you're not dreaming

574
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,040
and we're not filming?

575
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,320
Have I been asleep for two years?

576
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,320
Don't worry, Mumu.

577
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,160
I will take good care of you.

578
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,800
I'll make sure you remember.

579
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,480
Sir?

580
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,240
I'm sorry.

581
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,880
I really don't know who you are

582
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,840
and I don't know why we got married.

583
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm still so young.

584
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,600
Why would I get married so early?

585
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,960
The best-laid plans are no match for love.

586
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,240
Don't interrupt.

587
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,680
And even if we are married,

588
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,000
I don't know how well we got along
after being married.

589
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,360
So, I just can't accept

590
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,320
the fact that you're my husband.

591
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,880
Right, Chu Yan?

592
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,360
Yizhou, don't worry.

593
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,240
Fu Weining has been apprehended
for homicide.

594
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,920
Don't dwell on it.

595
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,400
She just woke up.

596
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,840
She'll remember soon.

597
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,880
All right.

598
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,600
I should go.

599
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,960
Call me if anything changes.

600
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,240
Everything will be fine.

601
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,400
What a coincidence.

602
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes.

603
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Don't be scared.

604
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,360
Hello, is anyone there?

605
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,680
We're stuck in the elevator.

606
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,600
<i>We've sent for a maintenance crew.</i>

607
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,120
<i>Please wait patiently.</i>

608
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Okay.

609
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,320
Don't worry. Someone should be here soon.

610
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,000
All right.

611
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,440
You didn't bring your inhaler?

612
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,920
Here, use this.

613
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,920
Do you feel better?

614
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,680
Thank goodness.

615
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,960
By the way,

616
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,440
you told me last time

617
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,000
that someone in your family

618
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,680
also has asthma?

619
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,280
To tell you the truth,

620
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,480
nobody in my family has asthma.

621
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,920
Because you have it,

622
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,760
I began carrying an inhaler with me

623
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,960
in case you needed it one day.

624
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Did you come to the hospital
to see a doctor or...

625
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,240
I wasn't stalking you!

626
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,920
I really wasn't.

627
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,280
Don't be so nervous.

628
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,080
That's not what I was thinking.

629
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,520
You said I was special.

630
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,440
Why is that?

631
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Chu Yan, do you know?

632
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,520
In the past,

633
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,840
I never imagined that I would
ever interact with a man so naturally.

634
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
I...

635
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,000
I was kidnapped when I was a child.

636
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,680
I was rescued,

637
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,320
but I later grew to be afraid of men.

638
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,600
I'm really scared of being with men.

639
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,640
I sometimes even have an allergic reaction
if there's physical contact.

640
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,920
It sounds fake,

641
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,760
but it's true.

642
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
At the café that day,

643
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,360
I discovered that
I didn't have a reaction to you.

644
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,400
<i>I was so happy that day.</i>

645
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,520
<i>That was the first time
I had genuine interaction with a man.</i>

646
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,040
So that's why

647
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,440
you used to always wear gloves.

648
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,640
I came to the hospital today
for my regular psychological therapy.

649
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,960
My condition has improved a lot.

650
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,920
And that night...

651
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,240
<i>Can the people inside hear me?</i>

652
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,360
We're here.

653
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,400
<i>Hold on. We're working on the problem.</i>

654
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,440
<i>We'll be done soon.</i>

655
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,840
Okay.

656
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
Sorry.

657
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,480
Why are you apologizing?

658
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,320
Did I startle you the other day?

659
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,720
I like you a lot.

660
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,680
But I shouldn't have been so impolite.

661
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,480
The door is open.

662
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Okay.

663
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,200
What's wrong, Feifei?

664
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Writer's block?

665
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,640
I'm just thinking

666
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,760
that Linlin must be panicking right now.

667
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,360
Everybody and everything around her

668
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,720
has changed.

669
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,520
She is the only one

670
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,120
still living two years in the past.

671
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,120
Her memory loss is temporary.

672
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,840
She will recover.

673
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,320
Wen Li?

674
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,840
If I were to forget you,

675
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,880
would you...

676
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,320
I would wait for you.

677
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,760
Forever.

678
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,520
It doesn't seem safe
for you to live by yourself.

679
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,480
Maybe you should stay with Mr. Ling.

680
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,880
What's the problem?

681
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I lost my memory. I'm not handicapped.

682
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,760
This is your apartment.

683
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,240
How do you know my passcode?

684
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,880
The passcode is the date
you won your first award.

685
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,200
It's 180716.

686
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,760
Mr. Ling, thank you for giving me a ride.

687
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,440
You should head home too.

688
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,720
Goodbye.

689
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,040
Come in.

690
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,920
Mumu.

691
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,720
Is there anything else?

692
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,200
This is also my home.

693
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,920
Mr. Ling, since you're my husband,

694
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,560
can you indulge me for a while?

695
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,280
I need some time

696
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,400
to process the fact that we're married.

697
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,360
If you're here,

698
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,680
I don't think I'll be at ease.

699
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,920
Mr. Ling, you should go for now.

700
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,160
Mumu is right.

701
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,360
You need to give her time
to process all this.

702
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,560
Okay.

703
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,040
Call me immediately if you need anything.

704
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,320
Sure. Get some rest.

705
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,280
Bye.

706
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,320
Wen Li?

707
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,560
How are you spending
Chinese Valentine's Day?

708
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,400
Chinese Valentine's Day?

709
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,480
I prepared
a romantic candlelight dinner for Feifei.

710
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,360
Wine and candles.

711
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,960
I hear women like the romantic ambiance.

712
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,040
Are you sure?

713
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes.

714
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,440
Candlelight dinner?

715
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,720
That's so corny!

716
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,040
What age is this?

717
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,440
Do you think women would like
such an old-fashioned idea?

718
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,880
I'm telling you,
if you prepare that for Feifei,

719
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,840
your relationship will go downhill.

720
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,000
No way!

721
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,280
You bet! Giving her money
would be better than this.

722
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,960
I suggest you come up with something else.

723
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,800
Boss, I have to make a call
to cancel reservations.

724
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,040
Come up with a new idea.

725
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,760
Candlelight dinner.

726
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,240
Did Ling Yizhou send Ms. Huang
to spy on me?

727
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,280
Where are the marriage certificates?

728
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,800
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

729
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,840
