1
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,120
This is to make us seem
more like a real couple.

2
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,080
LING

3
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,280
Don't you need to get into character?

4
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,280
"Xia's Baby Zhou"?

5
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,960
Interesting name.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
What's the name you entered for me?

7
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,920
Ling's Mumu.

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,680
Even runners are faster than us.

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,919
The cars behind us
keep flashing their headlights.

10
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,400
Can't you speed up a little?

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
Mumu, do you like men who drive fast?

12
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
-Sir.
-Ms. Xia.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,320
In a bit, you and Mr. Ling

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
-will bathe the dog over there.
-Film the outdoor scene like this.

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
-Okay.
-Where's Mr. Ling?

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
Mr. Ling is...

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,280
suffering from traveler's diarrhea.

18
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,480
He's using the restroom.

19
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
-Diarrhea?
-Sorry to make everybody wait.

20
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,880
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's give him some time.

22
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
Let's give him some time.

24
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,680
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,400
Let's give him some time.

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
Traveler's diarrhea?

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,840
We're going to give you a bath
and you'll be squeaky clean.

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
Good boy.

29
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,280
-What's that?
-Stay.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
-Does he need to go to the hospital?
-Good boy.

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,200
Who said I have traveler's diarrhea?

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,280
Sorry to make you all wait.
I was changing into this.

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
Okay, let's start filming.

34
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
-Get into place.
-Let's go.

35
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,400
Here.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,040
We're just giving Pidan a bath.

37
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Is this outfit necessary?

38
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,520
Pidan?

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
I named the dog.

40
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,560
I'll hold on to the dog

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,680
and you can direct the hose to it
from a distance.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
Who says I'm afraid of it?

43
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Then you hold it.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,080
Come on.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Hurry up.

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,800
Stay, Pidan.

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
You're getting a rinse.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Why did you spray me? Was that on purpose?

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,920
No, I was testing it.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,360
I haven't even turned it on yet. Look.

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
Ling Yizhou, you did that on purpose!

52
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,600
-I'll do it myself!
-No, I really didn't mean to...

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,880
I didn't mean to--

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
-You did it on purpose!
-I didn't.

55
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,160
-Let go! Give it to me!
-I really didn't mean to.

56
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,600
-You did it on purpose!
-No, I didn't.

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,880
-Stop spraying me! Get the dog!
-You did it on purpose!

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
Take this!

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
Here's a payback!

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,680
Are you two ready?

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
-Ready.
-Yes.

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,400
The live interview begins now.

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,400
How long have you and Mr. Ling
been together?

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,560
That's a secret between me and Mr. Ling.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,000
<i>You didn't seem to know
that he's afraid of dogs.</i>

66
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
THIS IS SO FAKE

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,440
IS IT A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE?

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,560
<i>I'm not allowed to have a pet dog
at home or the office,</i>

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,600
so I have to thank the film crew

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
for giving us this chance
to learn more about each other.

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
What about Mr. Ling?

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,360
How do you rate
Xia Lin's performance today?

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
Her performance today?

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,680
I think this is her true self.

75
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
<i>It's a different side of her
than the one you see on the TV screen.</i>

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
This is her real self.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,800
She may be cheeky, but I think...

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
that's cute.

79
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
You're so dirty!

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,080
How so? I think I'm fine.

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,720
Sorry, I forgot to tell you

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,200
that the resort has running hot water
only until 8:20 p.m.

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,000
It's already 8 p.m. now.

84
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
The hot water will be shut off
in 20 minutes.

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,760
There are no cameras in the bathroom.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll let you rest now.

87
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,840
Okay, thank you.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
Ling Yizhou!

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,600
What?

90
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
All right, Mumu.

91
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
You first.

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,920
That's more like it.

93
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,560
Where's the door?

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,440
-What door?
-The bathroom doesn't have a door!

95
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,080
-This won't fit in the allotted time.
-How is it?

96
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,520
What's the big deal?
I think it's a nice design.

97
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
When I get home, I'm going to take down
all the bathroom doors.

98
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,400
It would be so convenient when I...

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,480
I mean, it's more convenient for us to go

100
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,600
-to the bathroom.
-How is it convenient?

101
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,880
Remember the cameras.

102
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,680
My dear fiancée,

103
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840
it's just a door.

104
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Why are you making a fuss?

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,360
Okay, you must be tired today.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,720
You'll sleep better with an eye mask on.

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,480
Can you see?

108
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
-Perfect.
-I can still hear you.

109
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm done. It's your turn.

110
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,920
Mumu?

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,040
What smells so good?

112
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,720
Mumu.

113
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,480
-What?
-There's no more shampoo.

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,000
It's on the bottom half of the shelf.

115
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,720
I can't find it. Can you get it?

116
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,760
Fine, I'll get it for you.

117
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Why didn't you put on clothes first?

118
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,880
It's right here
and it's even the Adolph brand.

119
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,480
A towel?

120
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
-It's mine.
-Whose?

121
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
-Mine.
-So you're...

122
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,520
Naked.

123
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,320
What happened?

124
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
You have no idea how awkward it is.

125
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,840
When I think about having to spend
three days and nights with him,

126
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
I could just jump into a river.

127
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't believe Mr. Ling
is such a pervert.

128
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,000
What are you going to do?

129
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
I don't know.

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,360
This won't end well.

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,000
I have a feeling I'm going to screw up.

132
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
I will be scolded by netizens.

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,160
Feifei, maybe I shouldn't have
signed the contract.

134
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
Ms. Xia Lin,

135
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
there's no time for regrets.

136
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
You should be thinking about what to do.

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,040
<i>All I know is that I nearly slipped up
when we arrived on set.</i>

138
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,800
I didn't even know he's afraid of dogs.

139
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
But you're already on the show.

140
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,600
You can't leave now.

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
Hold on.

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
I have a message from Ms. Jiang.

143
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,160
<i>During the live interview,</i>

144
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,280
<i>there were already people
questioning your relationship.</i>

145
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,320
<i>Photos on set were also leaked.</i>

146
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,760
<i>You and Ling Yizhou
don't interact much in private.</i>

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,480
<i>-You don't seem like a couple.</i>
-You're kidding.

148
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,240
<i>It has been shared over a thousand times.
We're working on containing it.</i>

149
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,560
<i>I swear I'm doing my best already.</i>

150
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
<i>I'm back, Feifei.</i>

151
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,640
Ms. Xia, it's really not the time
to be whining.

152
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,400
You only have one choice right now
and that is to carry on.

153
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
<i>The public sees the end result.</i>

154
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,360
<i>You're on the show
to prove your relationship is real.</i>

155
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,640
<i>Don't let this backfire on you.</i>

156
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
<i>There are two days left.</i>

157
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>Remember, follow through the act.</i>

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
"Follow through on the act."

159
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,280
<i>Since you've signed the contract,</i>

160
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,960
you need to play your role
as Ling Yizhou's fiancée.

161
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,640
Once this year is over,

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
you can announce your breakup

163
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
and you'll be free once again, right?

164
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,080
<i>Hang in there.</i>

165
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,480
You're right.

166
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
I'll do my best.

167
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
<i>Got it, Ms. Jiang.</i>

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,200
-Let's go over the schedule again.
-Okay.

169
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,400
Ms. Xia, what are you doing here?

170
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,880
Miss,

171
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,040
are the cameras filming
even while we're sleeping?

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,240
No, you're mistaken.

173
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,880
Am I?

174
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,440
Where did you go?

175
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
Nowhere.

176
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
-What's up?
-Nothing.

177
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
You must be exhausted.

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Let me give you a massage. Lie down.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,280
I'll give you a massage.

180
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,040
-Lie down. Come on.
-Sure.

181
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
That feels so good.

182
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
Enjoy it.

183
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,400
Mumu, are you tired?

184
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
No, I'm not tired at all.

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,440
-Mumu, let's go to sleep.
-Get off!

186
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,080
Sleep in the tub!

187
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,520
Good night.

188
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
<i>-Chu Yan!
-Chu Yan!</i>

189
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,240
<i>Chu Yan!</i>

190
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,200
-It's so noisy.
<i>-I love you!</i>

191
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,760
<i>Chu Yan!</i>

192
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,520
<i>Chu Yan!</i>

193
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,120
<i>-Chu Yan, I love you!
-Huohuo! I love you!</i>

194
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,640
<i>-Look over here!
-Huohuo!</i>

195
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,280
<i>-I love you, Chu Yan!
-I like you so much!</i>

196
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
<i>Chu Yan!</i>

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,280
<i>-I love you so much!
-Chu Yan!</i>

198
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,200
<i>-I love you!</i>
-Sir, look!

199
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
It's Chu Yan!

200
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,720
-Chu Yan?
-Look.

201
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,400
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

202
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,480
-All right! We'll get a lot of views!
-It really is Chu Yan.

203
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,800
You...

204
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,040
Are you two really engaged?

205
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
When did you two meet?

206
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,360
When did you get engaged?

207
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,920
Well...

208
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
Are you hiding something from me?

209
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,840
Why else would you be engaged already?

210
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,160
Are you giving up on your acting career?

211
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Stop asking.

212
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,080
I'll tell you later.

213
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,200
Have you had breakfast yet?

214
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I'll make something for you.

215
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,400
Go and get some rest.

216
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,400
Have a seat.

217
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,040
<i>I'm going to see what these two are up to.</i>

218
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
-Hello.
-Welcome.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
Sir, I'm okay
with appearing as a special guest.

220
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,360
I don't approve.

221
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,880
We've brought friends of guest stars
onto the show before.

222
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,320
-That can improve couple's--
-Sir, here's the problem.

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
I don't know him. He's not my friend.

224
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,400
Mumu, is he your friend?

225
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,280
Why haven't you ever mentioned him before?

226
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
Mr. Ling, aren't you two engaged?

227
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,960
Is this how you treat
your fiancée's friend?

228
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,640
Or perhaps you don't
respect Xia Lin's friends

229
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
because you don't like her?

230
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,880
<i>What the heck are you doing?</i>

231
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
<i>Isn't it complicated enough?</i>

232
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,160
<i>I'm here to help you.</i>

233
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,080
Is that true?

234
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,280
Of course not.

235
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,240
My friends are your friends, Baby Zhou.

236
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,840
I guess I'll consider you a friend.

237
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,360
We'll do what was suggested.

238
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
We'll go ahead
and arrange for the next segment.

239
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,600
The film crew
won't be supplying lunch today.

240
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,960
-What?
-Our two male guests here will be cooking.

241
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,320
You will be tasting their dishes.

242
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,880
Our show could really need
a superstar like you.

243
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,080
This episode is going to be a hit.

244
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,560
I have one condition though.

245
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,160
-Tell me what you need.
-Here's the thing.

246
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,440
Ling Yizhou and I will both cook
for Xia Lin.

247
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,080
She will have to guess
who cooked which dish.

248
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,760
I think that will create some suspense

249
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,480
and also show the reality of couples,
which is what your program aims to do.

250
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,000
Any problems with that?

251
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,800
-No.
-Not at all.

252
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,000
Then, let's do it.

253
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
<i>There's no way Yizhou knows
what Xia Lin likes to eat.</i>

254
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,200
Finally, you must guess
which dish was made by your partner.

255
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,440
Wait, a correction.

256
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
There's only one male guest here.

257
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,080
The other is just a friend.

258
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,040
Isn't that right, my friend?

259
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,080
Yes, Baby Zhou.

260
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,640
These chips are sold here too.

261
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,560
Never mind.

262
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,640
Ling Yizhou.

263
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,880
You never eat processed foods.

264
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,079
Mumu likes them.

265
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,240
Are you trying to ruin her acting career?

266
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm helping my wife succeed.

267
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,520
-Ling Yizhou, you're really something.
-You too.

268
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,160
You shouldn't even be here.

269
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,120
I came here to expose your true colors.

270
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
You sound like you're on to something.

271
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,880
I've watched the press conference.

272
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,000
Xia Lin was flustered
and completely dazed.

273
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
She took the photos just to play along.

274
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,320
You clearly set her up.

275
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,720
Yes, she was flustered and in a daze.

276
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,960
Do you know why?

277
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,480
That was because of the butterflies
in her stomach.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Do you want juice?

279
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

280
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,360
Chips probably pair well with juice.

281
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,360
That's right.

282
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,320
I knew Mumu would like it.

283
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,280
My friend, keep up.

284
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Xia Lin?

285
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,520
Don't you like

286
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,360
-the fragrance of this Adolph shampoo?
-Yes.

287
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,040
ADOLPH

288
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,480
Yes, it's quite fragrant.

289
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,360
I'm going to look around somewhere else.

290
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,560
What's your purpose here?

291
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,960
My purpose? I love Mumu.

292
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Bullshit.

293
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,160
<i>The mysterious Mr. Ling,
the richest man of Gangdong, is cooking!</i>

294
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,840
<i>He is quick and skilled with a knife.</i>

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,840
<i>What has Ms. Xia done
to be blessed with this man?</i>

296
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,080
<i>He is the perfect fiancé.</i>

297
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
<i>Not only can superstar Chu Yan
sing, dance, and act,</i>

298
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
<i>he can even cook!</i>

299
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,800
<i>Whose dish will Ms. Xia like more?</i>

300
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,360
<i>We can't wait to see.</i>

301
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,160
We will now have Ms. Xia try
each dish in front of her

302
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
and guess which one Ling Yizhou made.

303
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,240
Okay, I'm going to eat it now.

304
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,040
<i>Goodness, is this a prank?</i>

305
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,400
<i>How am I supposed to know
which one Ling Yizhou made?</i>

306
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,400
Try it and see if you like it.

307
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,360
It's not bad.

308
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,120
Ling Yizhou made this.

309
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
Congratulations, Ms. Xia.

310
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,720
She was able to tell
just from a simple creamy mushroom soup.

311
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,400
This dish was indeed made by Mr. Ling.

312
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,640
It tastes just like the one we had
at the restaurant.

313
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,480
-Do you like it?
-It's not bad.

314
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,120
Did you make the one from last time too?

315
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,560
-Did you like it?
-Yes.

316
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,200
If you like it,

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
I'll make it for you every day.

318
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,760
Okay.

319
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,240
<i>Xia Lin.</i>

320
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,600
<i>What kind of spell has he put you under?</i>

321
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
My friend,

322
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,120
try it.

323
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,760
No, thank you, Baby Zhou.

324
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,960
Next up, we'll have Ms. Xia

325
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,440
record a segment
for our sponsor, Inglemirepharm's.

326
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,480
Then the two of you
will have a couple photoshoot.

327
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
-Couple photoshoot? Great.
-Okay.

328
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,840
Hi, everyone. I'm Xia Lin.

329
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Moisturize with Inglemirepharm's
to restore and protect your skin.

330
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
A unique blend
of hyaluronic acid molecules

331
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,640
hydrate your skin from the inside out.

332
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,800
It's the star moisturizer of the year.

333
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,680
Every drop in this little white bottle
is super hydrating.

334
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,080
Thank you Inglemirepharm's
Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Base Solution

335
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,480
for sponsoring <i>Romantic Departure</i>.

336
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
Come over here.

337
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,320
Place your hand here
and then give me a haughty look.

338
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,240
A haughty look.

339
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,880
Haughtier.

340
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Put your hand here.

341
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,600
Good.

342
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,440
Here.

343
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Hold the flower higher.

344
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,760
Hey.

345
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
It's stuffy here. Mumu, let's go outside.

346
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,960
Let's shoot outside.

347
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,600
Mumu, let's get an outfit change.

348
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,560
Sure.

349
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,680
Hi, I'll have a latte.

350
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,880
Okay, just a moment.

351
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,960
Hello, I'll have a latte.

352
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
Okay.

353
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,760
Are you avoiding me?

354
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
Are you stalking me?

355
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,120
Is this your ring?

356
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,320
Ring?

357
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
It's not mine.

358
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,400
It really isn't.

359
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,320
It has "JF" carved on it,
which stands for Jia Fei.

360
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,720
JF doesn't have to stand for Jia Fei.

361
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,320
It could be "Just Fine."

362
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,280
Look, it's not even the right size.

363
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,760
It's clearly not mine.

364
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Mr. Wen,

365
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,680
if you're looking for the owner,
you should search harder, right?

366
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,520
Or else you'll seem...

367
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,080
I finally found it.

368
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,320
I've been searching for so long.

369
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Thank you so much, Mr. Wen.
You're such a nice person.

370
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,840
Put his coffee on my tab.

371
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,240
You can give him my coffee.

372
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,400
Sure. Thank you.

373
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,840
Don't you want to know
what happened that night?

374
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,200
You two don't have any chemistry at all.

375
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,040
What are you even doing here?

376
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
We don't have chemistry?

377
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
I know.

378
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,960
It might be because we're both engaged
for the first time.

379
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Thank you for your concern.

380
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,520
We'll work on it.

381
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
All right, my friend.
Don't interrupt our photoshoot.

382
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,120
Next up, we'll be taking photos
of you two with the dog.

383
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,080
I'll hold the leash.

384
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,600
Let's go.

385
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,800
What a big sacrifice.

386
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,680
Drink!

387
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,720
Hello!

388
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,400
I want the strongest whiskey you have.

389
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,280
Here's your whiskey.

390
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,840
Feifei, you ordered the whole bottle?

391
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,400
This is very expensive.
I'm not paying for it.

392
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,440
It's my treat.

393
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,280
All right. To our best screenwriter.

394
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,720
Why worry so much?

395
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Just be happy.

396
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,280
You can say that again.

397
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
Hello, Ms. Jiang?

398
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,600
Do you need me there right now?

399
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,160
All right, I...

400
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,080
I'll be there soon.

401
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Feifei?

402
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,600
Ms. Jiang says
she needs to see me urgently

403
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,400
and wants me to head over now.

404
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,800
-Go on.
-What about you?

405
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,520
Why don't you come with me?

406
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,280
You go on.

407
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,960
Why don't you wait here?

408
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,480
I'll call Yuyuan over to get you.

409
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,160
I'll come back if I finish early.

410
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,320
-Okay.
-You have to stop drinking.

411
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,280
-Swear on it.
-I swear.

412
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,040
Sir.

413
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,600
Don't serve her any more alcohol.

414
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,600
Okay.

415
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,960
Don't drink anymore.

416
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm leaving now.

417
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,960
Okay.

418
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,960
Bye.

419
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,640
<i>Ms. Xia has left.</i>

420
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,920
<i>Okay.</i>

421
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,360
-Is she okay?
-Ma'am, are you all right?

422
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
Who are you calling "ma'am"?

423
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
Call me miss!

424
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,360
-You're drunk. I'll get a taxi for you.
-What taxi?

425
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,840
You better explain.

426
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,360
Explain what?

427
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,360
You better...

428
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,680
That's embarrassing.

429
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,640
She's even puking on him.

430
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,160
-That's right.
-Hey.

431
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,760
-My goodness.
-Where do you live? Don't fall asleep!

432
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,040
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to take you.</i>

433
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,480
Stand up.

434
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
Be careful.

435
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,040
Hey.

436
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,480
Don't move, my dear.

437
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,760
I want something from you.

438
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Miss, what are you doing?

439
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,880
I didn't know
I was such an indecent person.

440
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,280
You were drunk.

441
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,800
Pidan?

442
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,920
<i>ROMANTIC DEPARTURE</i>

443
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,360
Pidan didn't follow us.

444
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,280
You're so immature.

445
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,440
Hey.

446
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,720
Do you really like Xia Lin?

447
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes.

448
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,000
-Why don't I believe you?
-Believe what you want.

449
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,720
-Wait--
-Get in.

450
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,880
Yizhou.

451
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Just wait.

452
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,760
Did you see my note?

453
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,160
Yes.

454
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,680
A piece of candy was on top of it.

455
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,040
Candy?

456
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,520
<i>Duty calls. May we never meet again.</i>

457
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,640
No, it's not like that.

458
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,440
I'm not that petty.

459
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,080
There's no meaning to that candy.

460
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,800
This is what happened.

461
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,880
Mr. Wen?

462
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,120
Let's just pretend nothing ever happened.

463
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,400
How's that?

464
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,760
Ms. Jia, I...

465
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,600
Then what do you want?

466
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,680
I think

467
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,440
we can

468
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,000
get to know more about each other.

469
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
No, thank you.

470
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,960
I have to go. Bye.

471
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,440
I'm warning you.

472
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,560
Don't let anybody else know about this.

473
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,840
Otherwise...

474
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,760
I'll stick to you

475
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,360
like a con artist.

476
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,720
Chu Yan left?

477
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,880
-When did he leave?
-In the afternoon, before dinner.

478
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,960
He left before dinner?

479
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,480
All right, thank you.

480
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Why did he leave?

481
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,800
How strange.

482
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
Why isn't he picking up?

483
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
<i>Ling Yizhou is a sly fox.</i>

484
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,520
<i>You must protect yourself.</i>

485
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,760
<i>I don't know how you two made it so far,</i>

486
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,560
<i>but I'm sure you have your reasons.</i>

487
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,560
<i>If it's your decision,</i>

488
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
<i>I will fully support it.</i>

489
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,400
<i>Xiaolinzi, keep it up.</i>

490
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,440
What? How could he leave
without telling me?

491
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,520
What a terrible friend you are, Chu Yan.

492
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,640
What made you so angry
that you tossed your phone?

493
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,920
It's none of your business.

494
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,840
What if your phone broke?

495
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,040
I won't be able to reach you.

496
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,280
Or what if you damaged the table?

497
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,280
In the end, I would have to pay
for the damages.

498
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
As your fiancé,
I bear joint responsibility.

499
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,760
Ling Yizhou.

500
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,639
Would you keep secrets
from your best friend?

501
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,560
I don't have any friends.

502
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,080
Nonsense. Everybody has friends.

503
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,920
Let's go. Come with me.

504
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,880
Where are we going?

505
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,440
This place is beautiful.

506
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,679
Did you prepare this?

507
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,960
It's pretty here,

508
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,200
but it's too bad that
we have to leave tomorrow.

509
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
If you like it here,

510
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,960
we don't have to leave.

511
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,320
You must be kidding.

512
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
You're the boss of Lingshi Group.

513
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,000
How can you stay here with me on vacation?

514
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,360
I'll go where you go.

515
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,280
Look, the Well Mansion.

516
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Do you see it?

517
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,400
It's those few stars that look like a well
when connected together.

518
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,080
It's part of the Gemini constellation.

519
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,360
It's the first constellation
of the Vermilion Bird,

520
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
Guardian of the South.

521
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,160
It seems you're not just an ignorant,
airheaded actress.

522
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,040
When was I ever ignorant and airheaded?

523
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
Mumu?

524
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,160
Why did you become an actress?

525
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,440
I did poorly in school when I was a kid.

526
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,040
I didn't have many friends either.

527
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,880
I felt like there wasn't
anything special about me.

528
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,280
Later on, I played
the part of Cinderella in a play

529
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,160
and everybody applauded me.

530
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,200
That feeling of confidence
and acknowledgment

531
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,840
stayed with me for a long time.

532
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,320
I worked my way up step by step

533
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,680
and finally became an actress.

534
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,280
Through my roles,

535
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,040
I've had a taste of happiness, sorrow,

536
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,920
and all the experiences of life.

537
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,960
I feel as if
I've lived many different lives.

538
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,560
It's an incredible feeling.

539
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,280
Would you still be content
with acting in minor roles?

540
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
What's wrong with minor roles?

541
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,560
Even if I only appear in one scene,

542
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,080
I will still take it seriously.

543
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,880
I believe you will become

544
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
the world's best actress.

545
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,280
Ling Yizhou.

546
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Thank you.

547
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,560
For what?

548
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,520
Thank you

549
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,640
for taking part in this show with me.

550
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,640
Mr. Fu,

551
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,440
I heard you were college classmates
with Ling Yizhou.

552
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Wasn't that fun?

553
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,360
I made a smart wardrobe choice today.

554
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,760
You just wait, Ling Yizhou.

555
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,160
-Just wait.
-What?

556
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,160
I'll get you back.

557
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,240
Why did you name it Pidan?

558
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,120
It's a strange story.

559
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,560
I once had a dream

560
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,200
that I had a dog that looked just like it

561
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
and it was called Pidan.

562
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,200
Let go of me. Just tell him you like him.

563
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,320
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Come here!

564
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,800
<i>He's mine.
You can't steal him from me, you bitch.</i>

565
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,720
<i>I'll teach you not to mess with me!</i>

566
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Help!

567
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,960
-Xia Lin's acting is amazing.
-Help!

568
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,320
-If Zhen Baohui didn't tell me about it,
-Help!

569
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,840
I would think this is real.

570
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,000
<i>-You can scream all you want.
-Help!</i>

571
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,560
<i>-I already cleared the area.
-Help!</i>

572
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,360
<i>It's just you and me here.</i>

573
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,480
<i>Help!</i>

574
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Help!

575
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
