1
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,120
It's so late. What are you doing?

2
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,640
Drinking before bed
can help you sleep, my dear.

3
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,199
Did you hear something?

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,039
It's the air-conditioning.

5
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,960
Why would the air-conditioning work
when the power is out?

6
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Are there pets in your office?

7
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,960
No.

8
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,560
Linlin.

9
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Ms. Jiang, is there any news
about the script I read last time?

10
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,520
I liked that character a lot.

11
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
I was just going
to talk to you about that.

12
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,320
The Ling Yizhou incident
has hit you pretty hard.

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Some have terminated contracts,
some are wary and ignoring us.

14
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,840
Even though we posted a clarification,

15
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
public opinion has affected
your image and reputation.

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,600
TV shows and movie producers
are still waiting to act.

17
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm trying to get
an advertisement gig for you.

18
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,040
Let's just keep waiting for a bit.

19
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,920
Just be prepared. Don't panic.

20
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
I understand.

21
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
Even though the Ling Yizhou
incident has passed,

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,640
the aftermath won't go away that soon.

23
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,680
I think we should take the initiative.

24
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,880
Good opportunities need to be fought.

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,160
Of course.

26
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm going to meet up
with some directors and producers.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
I'll ask if they have
any characters that fit you

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
and try to secure those roles.

29
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I also have some ideas
about the roles I want to try.

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,440
I hope that I can talk to the boss

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
and see what he thinks.

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,160
It's good to have ideas.

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll arrange a meeting
with him this afternoon

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
-if he's free.
-Okay.

35
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
You can take that.

36
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Hello?

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,560
<i>Hello, is this Ms. Xia?</i>

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
<i>I'm the producer, Zhang Hong.</i>

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,320
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,640
Can I help you?

41
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,120
-<i>Here's the thing, Xia Lin.</i>
-Thank you.

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
<i>I've always liked your acting.</i>

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,040
<i>I think you're a very talented actress.</i>

44
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,160
<i>I know there has been some trouble lately,</i>

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
-<i>but you've cleared that up.</i>
-It's Mr. Zhang.

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,000
-Mr. Zhang?
-<i>I think</i>

47
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
<i>you give people a very positive image.</i>

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
<i>I have a role that suits you very well.</i>

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,960
<i>Maybe we can meet up to talk about it.</i>

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
<i>When are you free?</i>

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,640
Thank you for your kind words, Mr. Zhang.

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm very interested.

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,200
My manager is in charge of my schedule.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>-Okay.
</i>-She's right here.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
Maybe you can talk to her.

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
<i>How about this?</i>

57
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
<i>Let me check my schedule.</i>

58
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
<i>Thank you.</i>

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
He hung up.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,200
He said he'll call me
after he checks his schedule.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,240
Mr. Zhang? Zhang Hong?

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Yes, that's right.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,200
He has a role for me.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
I need to tell Ling Yizhou the good news.

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,320
You and Ling Yizhou...

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,720
We made up.

68
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,560
Xia Lin,

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,280
being with him does no good
to your career.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,240
You know how bad it was
when you were all over the news.

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,960
You should think about this carefully.

72
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,000
We know the truth now, don't we?

73
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,680
Ling Yizhou was framed.

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,280
Right now, the netizens are on our side.

75
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
I won't interfere with your personal life.

76
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,280
Don't let it affect your work.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
Ms. Jiang.

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,600
I know you really care about my career.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
That's why you're always so worried
when anything happens to me.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
But actually,

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
I don't want to mix
my personal and work life.

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm sure you know best.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,880
My relationship with Ling Yizhou
didn't start from a contract.

84
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,040
When I first met Ling Yizhou,
I thought he looked very familiar.

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
A few days ago, I found out

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
that two years ago,
we met at a masquerade ball.

87
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,800
A masquerade ball?

88
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
What happened at the ball?

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
I remember it so clearly.

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,920
There were a lot of people there.

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,000
I got bumped and almost fell.

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
A man in a mask helped me steady myself.

93
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,080
I didn't know who he was.

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Then, I found the mask
in Ling Yizhou's room.

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
That's when I realized

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
that the man that night was Ling Yizhou.

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,640
I didn't expect you were fated to meet.

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,840
Your love must be destiny.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,960
I want to hold a masquerade ball

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,080
to bring back those memories

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,320
as a surprise for him.

102
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,720
How lucky he is.

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,800
You're probably going to spend
a lot of time preparing for it.

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,640
That's why I'm telling you in advance.

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm worried that
my schedule might be tight.

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,240
But don't worry,
I won't let it affect work.

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,040
I'll get going now, Ms. Jiang.

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Let me know if anything happens.

109
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,920
-Okay.
-See you.

110
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,520
Read it and give it back to me.

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
I can't stay for long.

112
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,040
You're being very cautious this time.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
An engagement contract?

114
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,080
This is huge news.

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
You probably know what to do with it.

116
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
I don't have to teach you.

117
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Tonight at nine o'clock.

118

<i>The number you...</i>

127

<i>Mr. Wen, I got the contract.</i>

<i>They can't have</i>

134
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
<i>what you can't have.</i>

135
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,760
Ms. Jiang, the boss wants to see you.

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
Jiang Yushi!

137
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,320
How dare you do this to our own artist?

138
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Do you even respect me as your boss?

139
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,480
Pack up your stuff and get out of here.

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,120
You're not in charge of Xia Lin anymore.

141
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,480
If you pull any more tricks,

142
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll make sure you never get another job!

143

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,960
That's right.

146
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Wait.

147
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,840
Check her things.

148
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,560
Ruan Meng, you haven't been posting
on Sohu Friends lately.

149
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,760
You've only posted a few times
when your new clothes came out.

150
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,880
I haven't seen anything
about your daily life.

151
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
This isn't good for your brand.

152
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,440
What if you lose your followers?

153
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,640
It's fine.

154
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
I've just been busier lately.

155
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
I'll post something now.

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
No worries.

157
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Ruan Meng. Hey!

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,160
Hey, what are you looking at?

159
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,160
Hey!

160
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,440
What is it?

161
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm taking a photo
to post on Sohu Friends.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
And over here...

163
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Come here.

164
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,320
Ms. Ruan.

165
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,320
That's my fiancée over there.

166
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
We're getting married next month.

167
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,880
We'd be happy to see you there.

168
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,400
I love your business philosophy.

169
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,120
I've always hoped to do my wedding photos

170
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,960
while traveling with my husband.

171
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,280
This way, we can see new places

172
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,120
and create sweet memories together.

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
When we get back,
we'll have beautiful photos too.

174
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
The thing is,

175
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,360
you have so many destinations
to choose from.

176
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,520
I could do
my wedding photoshoots anywhere.

177
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
I don't even have
to introduce our services.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,920
-You know so much already.
-I'm going to take photos over there.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
-You can stop by next time.
-Wait a moment.

180
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,960
We can adjust the plans
according to what you need.

181
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
What do you think?

182
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm so lucky to meet someone
I really connect with.

183
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
That's true.

184
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,840
Ruan Meng?

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,240
Don't be mad, my dear.

186
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,920
This is...

187
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
Hello.

188
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
Chu Yan is just on a date with you
because he's mad at me.

189
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Don't believe anything he says.

190
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Mr. Chu, this is my fiancé.

191
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,000
Hello.

192
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
We'll see you next time at the company.

193
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,200
We'll talk about
the details of our trip then.

194
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay.

195
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,320
I'll let the two of you
spend time together then.

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,640
Take care.

197
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,680
-See you.
-See you.

198
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
They are gone. You can let go now.

199
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,200
Stop.

200
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,560
That lady is my client.

201
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,040
She wants to do a photo shoot
with her fiancé.

202
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,280
What are you doing?

203
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,760
I understand now.

204
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,160
I thought you were in trouble
like last time.

205
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,640
So I came to help you.

206
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,440
So you do remember the first time we met.

207
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Was that fun for you?

208
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,240
Maybe next time
my dad tells me to get married,

209
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
I'll ask you to help me again.

210
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,360
-You're pretty good at it.
-What?

211
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,200
What? I'm just kidding.

212
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
You scared my client away.

213
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,600
You'll need to pay for that.

214
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,320
They are your clients,
but I'm your client too.

215
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,640
If you take photos for them,
you'll have to take photos for me.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
Here.

217
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,760
-Now?
-Yes.

218
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,600
Don't forget to pay.

219
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,400
We'll see about that.

220
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,040
The supervisor just asked for you.
I'll take care of that.

221
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,160
Okay. Here you go.

222
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,520
Fill it with confetti.

223
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,760
He's always asking for me.

224
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,920
I'm so busy.

225
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,240
Mumu, you...

226
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,400
Is it the same?

227
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,600
This is how it all happened.

228
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,840
Mumu, I've waited two years

229
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
for this kiss.

230
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,120
Everyone, we're here today

231
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,200
to celebrate this beautiful couple
who met here two years ago.

232
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,920
That's wonderful.

233
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,080
-How great.
-Yes.

234
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
So sweet.

235
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,000
Ms. Jiang.

236
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't think you were
on our list of guests, Ms. Jiang.

237
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,520
Your outfit...

238
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't know what you mean.

239
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,640
Could you play the security footage
from the bar? Thank you.

240
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,160
Watch carefully.

241
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,840
SECOND FLOOR STAIRWELL

242
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,560
Wen Li.

243
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,560
-Did you get the evidence?
-Yes.

244
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
So you already noticed.

245
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,200
So,

246
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,360
it was you

247
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,360
who swapped the engagement contract?

248
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,720
Xia Lin.

249
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,400
Take a look at how sly this man is.

250
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,640
He broke up with you
so that I'll let my guard down.

251
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
Then, he investigated me.

252
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,360
He even took advantage
of this party you held.

253
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
Ms. Jiang,

254
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
did you do all those things?

255
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
Stop playing dumb.

256
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
Ling Yizhou is the murderer
who hurts my brother.

257
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
Didn't you see that?

258
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
He's still in the hospital,

259
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,400
like a living dead man.

260
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,320
You saw all the evidence.

261
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,960
How can you only believe
what you want to believe?

262
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Evidence?

263
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,200
Don't be so naive.

264
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,400
Are you talking about the recording?

265
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,000
If he could get someone
to take the blame two years ago,

266
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,960
he could easily find someone
to make up evidence to escape punishment.

267
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Unfortunately,

268
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,040
he can fool others, but not me.

269
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,000
You can't get revenge on an imaginary foe
just because your family member was hurt.

270
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,440
The police already found out the truth.

271
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Stop acting so irrationally.

272
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,320
You and Ling Yizhou held this big party
just to frame me?

273
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,640
Did you hire them
to put on an act for you?

274
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,280
The party was for Mumu and I.

275
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,880
It wasn't an act.

276
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
You're the one with bad intentions,
so I had to take precautions.

277
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
I didn't tell Mumu

278
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,160
because I didn't want her to be sad.

279
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,760
I didn't want her to know that

280
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,360
her partner, who she trusts the most,
has been scheming to hurt her.

281
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,840
You're the murderer!

282
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,720
Yao Liang, where are you going?

283
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,280
I'm going to look for Xia Lin at the bar.

284
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,440
Bar?

285
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,840
Xia Lin?

286
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Hello?

287
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,160
<i>Are you Yao Liang's sister?</i>

288
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,800
If you didn't reject Yao Liang that day,

289
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,800
he wouldn't go looking for you at the bar.

290
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,240
If he didn't witness the two of you meet,

291
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
he wouldn't get drunk
and get into an accident.

292
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,800
And you?

293
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,280
You don't even know
what Yao Liang did for you.

294
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,840
You've just been
enjoying your life guilt-free.

295
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,280
Enjoying all the attention and praise.

296
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,840
Enjoying love and everything.

297
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,680
You've been living
the life of an innocent person,

298
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
but what about him?

299
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,080
He's still in the hospital.

300
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,880
My mom cries every day.

301
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
And me?

302
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,280
I had to quit my job and start over.

303
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,560
I had to see the person
who caused my family pain every day.

304
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,840
Not just one,

305
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,040
but two.

306
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,040
You became my manager

307
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,720
one year ago,

308
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,520
just so you could avenge your brother?

309
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,600
You ruined his life.

310
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,120
You took everything from him.

311
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,080
Of course I had to do something.

312
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,600
Didn't you want to be a movie star?

313
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,920
Sure.

314
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,040
That's why I helped manage your career

315
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,960
and brought you a lot of attention.

316
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,280
Once you get used to the vanity,

317
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,440
I'll then show you
what it feels like to be despised.

318
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,400
I didn't expect

319
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,680
that Ling Yizhou would be able to stop me.

320
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,560
He became your strongest support.

321
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
The heavens are just though.

322
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,320
They let me know that Ling Yizhou
is the one who harmed my brother.

323
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,200
Why are you still lying to yourself?

324
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
You think that you're doing this
for Yao Liang.

325
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,480
You've spent an enormous amount of energy

326
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,320
to get your so-called "revenge."

327
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,880
But what has happened to your own life?

328
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
You're caught in your own trap.

329
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,800
Mumu, everything is fine now.

330
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,760
Ms. Jiang, we've called the police.

331
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,000
Ling Yizhou, did you know?

332
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,920
When Jiang Yushi first became my manager,

333
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,800
we were both very inexperienced.

334
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,160
But we got things through.

335
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,040
She would go to the film site with me

336
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,040
and stay up through the night with me.

337
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,560
Again and again,

338
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,560
she would get good roles
and opportunities for me.

339
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,480
Whenever I had a scandal,

340
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,280
she'd be even more worried than me.

341
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
But today, she told me

342
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,680
that she only did all that

343
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,520
to make it hurt more
when she pushed me off the top.

344
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,040
I can't believe that

345
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,200
people can be this hard to see through.

346
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,760
Bad people have their own misfortunes.

347
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,880
Even though she only became so extreme

348
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
because she was used,

349
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,880
everyone in this world
needs to pay for their own actions.

350
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,600
The real perpetrator was found,

351
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,240
but Yao Liang will probably never wake up.

352
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,560
He's the most innocent victim

353
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,600
in this whole event.

354
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
Mumu, don't worry.

355
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,360
I've sent some experts
to inspect his situation.

356
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,080
They'll see if there are
any new treatments to cure him.

357
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,840
Medicine is so advanced nowadays.

358
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,760
He might have a chance to wake up.

359
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,760
Thank you.

360
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
You're so kind, Mr. Ling.

361
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,360
That's because I married
such a good-looking and kind woman.

362
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
I held the party

363
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,040
to give you a surprise.

364
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I didn't expect

365
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,480
that all this would happen.

366
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,560
It's fine.

367
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,000
That's not important.

368
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,760
Meeting you was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

369
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
I didn't know that

370
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,880
you remembered the night we met
two years ago.

371
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,600
That's the biggest surprise.

372
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,000
GANGDONG DETENTION CENTER

373
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,560
Jiang Yushi.

374
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
We came here today
to talk about your brother.

375
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
Stop faking mercy.

376
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
Wait.

377
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,440
You can make a decision

378
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
after we finish talking.

379
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,360
Sure.

380
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Get to the point then.

381
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,800
Ling Yizhou found the most
prestigious brain surgeon in the world

382
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,000
to treat Yao Liang.

383
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
The doctor said

384
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,080
that he might be able to wake up.

385
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,760
Why?

386
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,320
Why are you doing this?

387
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
Why would you?

388
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
Yao Liang and Mumu used to be classmates.

389
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,320
Even though you had an ulterior motive,

390
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,520
you worked very hard
to help Mumu build her career.

391
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,520
Mumu wants to help him,

392
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,640
so I'll support her for sure.

393
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,840
We just came to tell you about Yao Liang.

394
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,560
We'll let you know
if there's any progress.

395
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,040
Ms. Jiang, think it over.

396
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,160
We'll get going now.

397
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
Wait.

398
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,680
It was Fu Weining.

399
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,880
He gave me the information to frame you.

400
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,760
It was Fu Weining.

401
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Thank you.

402
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,920
So Fu Weining is behind everything.

403
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,480
Don't worry about it.

404
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
I'll take care of things.

405
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,120
Hello, Wen Li.

406
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,320
Keep an eye on Fu Weining.

407
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
<i>Yes, Boss.</i>

408
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,920
Hello, Boss.

409
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,800
I went to his house and law firm.

410
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,800
The places he frequents are being watched.

411
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
But we haven't seen him yet.

412
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,120
He wouldn't leave Gangdong.

413
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,240
I don't care how many people it takes.

414
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,640
-Find him.
<i>-Yes, Boss.</i>

415
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,080
Mumu!

416
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,120
Mumu!

417
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,680
What is it? Did you have a nightmare?

418
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
Go to sleep. I'm fine.

419
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,760
Go to sleep, okay?

420
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,480
Let's go to sleep.

421
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,320
Everything is okay.

422
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,760
This is good.

423
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,920
We can do more projects like this.

424
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,760
-Okay.
-Give her these two to look over.

425
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
Let me know if there are any problems.

426
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,400
Okay. Let's wait for Xia Lin.

427
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,200
-Okay.
-You're in charge now.

428
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,720
Xia Lin.

429
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,480
Let me introduce you to your new manager.

430
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,440
Yuyuan, you know each other well.
I probably don't have to say anymore.

431
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,800
Xia Lin, I'll do my best.

432
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
I look forward to working with you.

433
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Let's work hard together.

434
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,920
I'll let you and Yuyuan talk
about your future jobs now.

435
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
I have other appointments.

436
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
-Okay.
-Sure.

437
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,720
Yuyuan,

438
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,640
now we can talk about work.

439
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,640
That's right.

440
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Xia Lin, I picked these two screenplays.

441
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,280
One is a thriller movie with a low budget.

442
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,800
One is a national crime drama.

443
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,520
I think they are both really good.

444
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,840
You can decide which one you like.

445
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,800
Which one do you think suits me better?

446
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,120
It's okay. You can tell me.

447
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
You're my manager now.

448
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
I need your expertise.

449
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,880
The thriller movie has a lower budget,

450
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,880
but the plot and message
are really meaningful.

451
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,560
It would challenge your acting skills,

452
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,080
which means it'll be harder.

453
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,760
But the crime drama has a bigger audience.

454
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,440
You will be seen by more people.

455
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,000
That's quite a professional analysis.

456
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,320
I think that the character

457
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,880
in the thriller movie
is more interesting to me.

458
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,840
She's complex and intelligent, but kind.

459
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,680
There's a lot of room for expression.

460
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,080
It'll be a huge challenge.

461
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,560
So you mean...

462
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,600
I chose the thriller movie.

463
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,000
I should step out of my comfort zone

464
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
and take on bigger challenges.

465
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,160
Don't worry. I can do it.

466
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,640
I trust you, Xia Lin. You can do it!

467
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,360
We can do it!

468
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,800
<i>Yuyuan has a good eye.</i>

469
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,760
Really?

470
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,800
Mumu.

471
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,840
Now that everything is going smoothly,

472
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
when are we going
to have our wedding ceremony?

473
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,520
I want to complete my job first.

474
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,840
I know. Mumu, you always work so hard.

475
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,200
Now...

476
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,440
Never mind. You should get back to work.

477
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,320
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Ling.

478
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
See you later, Mumu.

479
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,000
I have a meeting.

480
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,600
Text me when you get home.

481
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,680
-What is it?
-Boss.

482
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,120
The man I sent to follow
Fu Weining lost track of him.

483
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,760
Send more people to protect Mumu.

484
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,760
Yes, Boss.

485
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Hello. Where's Mumu?

486
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,200
<i>Xia Lin just left.</i>

487
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Mumu, where are you?

488
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,120
I was in the elevator.
My phone signal was weak.

489
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,280
What is it?

490
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,320
Nothing. It's just...

491
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I wanted to ask
what you want for dinner tonight.

492
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
Okay. That's all.

493
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,960
Boss, Mrs. Ling's bodyguard reported
that everything is fine over there.

494
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,840
Sorry about that.

495
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
It's fine.

496
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,560
Hurry!

497
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,200
BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY

498
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,360
THANK YOU FOR THE ROMANTIC GETAWAY,

499
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,840
BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS!

500
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,600
SO PRETTY! I WANT TO GET PHOTOS LIKE THIS

501
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,480
I'M SO JEALOUS. I'M STILL SINGLE

502
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,360
AWESOME JOB!

503
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,560
CHU YAN IS SO TALENTED

504
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,800
HUOHUO, COME VISIT US

505
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,239
NEW POST

506
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,440
<i>Thank you all so much.</i>

507
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
WHAT DID I JUST READ?

508
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,199
HUOHUO IS BACK!

509
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,080
HUOHUO, DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND NOW?

510
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,520
HUOHUO, ARE YOU MARRIED?

511
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
SO HANDSOME!

512
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,800
IS THAT GIRL YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

513
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,000
My girlfriend?

514
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,040
YOU'RE THE BEST, MY IDOL!

515
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,480
What are they talking about?

516
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
HUOHUO, COME AND VISIT US!

517
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,239
RUAN MENG: SUMMER DAYS

518
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,520
ARE YOU DATING CHU YAN?

519
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
GOODNESS! WHAT A COUPLE!

520
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,480
THAT GIRL IS SO SHAMELESS

521
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,320
HUOHUO GOT OUT OF SHOWBIZ.
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

522
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,239
SHE'S EMBARRASSING HERSELF

523
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,040
Ruan Meng?

524
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,320
Isn't this that girl the other day?

525
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,080
Is she really dating Mr. Chu?

526
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,440
I can't believe she did it.

527
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,320
If I knew it was that easy...

528
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,560
What? You wouldn't have a chance.

529
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
Mr. Chu probably liked her before that.

530
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,680
They're both so beautiful.
They make a good couple.

531
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360
You--

532
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,480
What are you doing? Are you working?

533
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,400
Or are you gossiping about me?

534
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,040
-This one is good.
-Right?

535
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,080
-Yes.
-So nice.

536
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,960
<i>Hello? Chu Yan.</i>

537
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,240
I'm sorry.

538
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
I just thought that was a nice photo.

539
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,360
I didn't mean to...

540
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
I know.

541
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,200
Sorry about all the trouble.

542
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,520
It's fine.

543
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Don't worry about it.

544
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,840
I'll just post on Sohu Friends

545
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,880
<i>that my girlfriend is Bojue Photography.</i>

546
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,840
<i>It'll be an advertising opportunity.</i>

547
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,560
Chu Yan, I actually...

548
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,320
-I--
-<i>Mr. Chu, everyone is here.</i>

549
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,280
Okay, bring them in.

550
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,400
Sure.

551
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,680
I need to work now. Bye.

552
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,440
Okay. Talk to you later.

553
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,440
CHU YAN:
MY GIRLFRIEND IS BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY

554
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,600
Does he even know that I like him?

555
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,760
Should I just tell him?

556
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,880
No.

557
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,240
That's it.

558
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,520
I've told you everything I know.

559
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,560
My goodness.

560
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Jiang Yushi is so scary.

561
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,720
It's like an extreme thriller drama.

562
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,040
She has been plotting her revenge
since she volunteered

563
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,680
to be your manager one year ago.

564
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
She helped you become popular

565
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,280
just to tear you down afterward.

566
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,360
That's terrible.

567
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,920
I should actually thank her

568
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,400
for getting me where I am today.

569
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,120
She actually contributed a lot.

570
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,040
But whenever I remember
that she did all this for other reasons,

571
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,760
it gives me the chills.

572
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,400
You're where you are today
because you're a hard worker.

573
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,160
She hasn't helped you that much.

574
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
Didn't she pull some shady tricks before?

575
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,440
The rumors last time
and the breakup incident.

576
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,120
She made it seem like she was helping you,

577
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
but actually...

578
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,360
The truth is,

579
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,280
if her brother wasn't in that accident,

580
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,760
she probably wouldn't have
become like this.

581
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,920
It's all that drunk driver's fault.

582
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,640
So I've been thinking.

583
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,080
If I told her about Yao Liang sooner,

584
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,920
we wouldn't have
such a big misunderstanding.

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,920
And she wouldn't be like this today.

586
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,600
But then I realized

587
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,880
that she was always biased towards me.

588
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,680
No matter how hard
I tried to explain things,

589
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,640
she'd only think I was making excuses.

590
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
People

591
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,000
only believe in what they want to believe.

592
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,400
Now that all of this is behind you

593
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,800
and you already have
your certificate and proposal,

594
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,120
when are you going to take
wedding photos and hold a ceremony?

595
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,080
Probably next year.

596
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,080
Right now,

597
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,440
I want to focus on

598
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,280
shooting this movie first.

599
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,800
I probably won't be able to wear
a bridesmaid dress this year.

600
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
You can wear a wedding dress first.

601
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,560
I think wedding dresses are much prettier.

602
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,800
I don't want to be like you.

603
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,600
I wouldn't cave in that easily.

604
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,400
If he wants to marry me,

605
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,560
he'll have to hold a huge

606
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,880
and romantic wedding proposal.

607
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,880
The venue of the proposal
has to be special too.

608
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,320
It must be where ice and fire meet.

609
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,480
As for my engagement ring...

610
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,880
I don't want a diamond.

611
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,200
That's too tacky.

612
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,320
My ring has to be made
from ice that never melts.

613
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,400
It has to have at least
11 shades of the Northern Lights.

614
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,960
Only a unique ring like that
will be able to impress me.

615
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm so worried about Wen Li.

616
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Who says I'm marrying him?

617
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,360
Really?

618
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,440
If you don't want to marry him,
I'll introduce him to someone else.

619
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,840
How dare you?

620
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,000
-I'll kill you!
-I will.

621
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,800
Feifei.

622
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,320
-Mr. Wen.
-Mrs. Ling.

623
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,040
These are some necessities
Boss prepared for you.

624
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,400
That's so sweet of him.

625
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,120
Let me see what's in here.

626
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,680
Coffee.

627
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,560
A tiny fan. That's necessary for filming.

628
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
Cookies.

629
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,640
"ABC herbal cotton sanitary pads."

630
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Mr. Ling knows about sanitary pads?

631
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,280
They are herbal
which are good for your health.

632
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,120
What a model husband!

633
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,120
Are you jealous?

634
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
You can have one too.

635
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,800
Who are you talking to?

636
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,920
Did you hear her?

637
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,120
Will you get some for me?

638
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,280
Feifei, next time you get your period,

639
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,800
-I'll get some for you.
-Okay, stop talking.

640
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,440
Boss, Mrs. Ling is holding a party.

641
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,200
-Really?
-Yes.

642
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,320
Look.

643
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,160
My Mumu is preparing a surprise for me.

644
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Are you jealous?

645
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,120
Feifei has prepared surprises
for me before.

646
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,360
Really?

647
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Hello, Feifei.

648
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,080
Can I talk to you about something?

649
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
<i>What is it?</i>

650
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,640
Could you...

651
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,840
prepare a surprise for me?

652
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm telling you.

653
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,480
You can't be an irresponsible man.

654
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,040
-Dad.
-Dad!

655
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,960
I mean, Mr. Chu.

656
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,600
Chu Yan, I like you.

657
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,880
Get out!

658
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,320
Get out!

659
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
