CHARITY NIGHT

7
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Hey.

8
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
Mr. Li, it has been a while.

9
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
-Hello.
-You look well.

10
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Thank you.

11
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
Chu Yan, let me introduce you.

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
This is Wu Wei, a producer.

13
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,840
This is Yuan Xiang,
chairwoman of Wansheng Media.

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

16
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,880
Allow me to introduce

17
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,440
one of our company's artists.

18
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
Her name is Xia Lin.

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
She's well-liked as a supporting actress

20
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
in the recent drama, <i>Kindred Spirits</i>.

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
Mr. Li, I am a big fan of your films.

22
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
I hope to work with you one day.

23
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,080
Certainly.

24
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,120
She's an ambitious young lady.

25
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,400
-That's good.
-Mr. Ling!

26
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
-Mr. Ling!
-Mr. Ling!

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,640
Where are you going?

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
Mr. Ling, let's talk.

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,920
-Mr. Ling!
-Mr. Ling!

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
-Mr. Ling!
-Chu Yan?

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,440
-We'll let you two talk. Please excuse us.
-Mr. Ling!

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Of course.

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
We'll see you later.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
Who is that person?

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,240
No idea. Just some jerk.

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
I've never seen anyone
get on your bad side.

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,200
What happened?

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,160
Nothing happened.

39
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,120
Chu Yan, come with me for a second.
Mr. Wang wants to see you.

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,240
You should mingle on your own.
I have to go.

42
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
Excuse me.

43
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
Zhen Baohui?

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
You appeared out of nowhere.

45
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,880
Did I?

46
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,960
You must be talking about yourself.

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,440
You're still as cryptic as ever.

48
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,160
I don't have spare time
to decipher your words.

49
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,560
Look at your outdated outfit.

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,280
And that necklace.

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
Is it a rental?

52
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
I guess it suits you.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,040
It's just as tawdry as you.

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Right.

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,320
Weren't you just a two-bit actress
two years ago?

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,840
You may have gained a bit of recognition,

57
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,840
but beneath it all,

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
you're just a worthless nobody.

59
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,640
Yes, I am a nobody

60
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
who pulled herself up in two years
to the same level as you,

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
a talentless looker who cost the company
big money to promote.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
So who is more worthless?

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,120
You...

64
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,480
That's a nice speech,

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,000
but you should get off your high horse.

66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
You're just relying on Chu Yan.

67
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,960
You wouldn't have any exposure
without him.

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
Didn't he help you networking just now?

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
I see.

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
I was wondering

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,560
why you would bother being angry
at a small fry like me.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
So it's because of Chu Yan.

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
You can relax.

74
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,000
He and I were only a couple
on the TV screen.

75
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Your new project won't be affected.

76
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
Or could it be that
you're interested in him in another way?

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,840
Excuse me.
Which one of you requested soda water?

78
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ling!

79
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,760
It was an accident!

80
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm so sorry!

81
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,120
My hand slipped.

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,440
I apologize.

84
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,640
Sorry.

85
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,560
I ducked so quickly
that it splashed you instead.

86
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
<i>Where did she go?</i>

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
Wait!

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Why did you follow me?

91
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,000
I wanted to apologize.

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,760
I was also at fault.

93
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720
Your clothes are wet.

94
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
-Why don't--
-No, thanks.

95
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,120
Please, I'll feel guilty.

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I didn't throw the drink at you,
but I'm responsible for it as well.

97
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
What brand is your suit?
I'll get you a new one.

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,880
That's not necessary. Thank you.

99
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,240
Sir.

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,800
Do I look familiar to you?

101
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,960
So cliché.

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,160
Come up with a better pick-up line, miss.

103
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
No, look.

104
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
How's this?

105
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
Do you recall anything?

106
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
What am I supposed to remember?

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
Miss, don't you think
this is inappropriate?

108
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,560
Sorry.

109
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,800
Don't I look familiar to you at all?

110
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Have we met before? Also...

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,080
Are you sure you want to come in?

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
Go ahead.

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
-Hello?
<i>-Boss.</i>

114
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,680
Lingshi Group's recent defamation cases
have been investigated.

115
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,800
It was indeed an inside job.

116
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
All right.

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,000
There are also words
that they might make a move.

118
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,520
They won't just sit back.

119
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
Call an emergency meeting right away.

120
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Yes, Boss.

121
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,560
And regarding her medical records...

122
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Put that on hold.

123
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
<i>Understood.</i>

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
What's wrong?

125
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
Are you feeling unwell?

126
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,480
No, yesterday's nightmare came to mind.

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,520
I dreamed that I had leukemia.

128
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,720
You've had too much work lately
and been under too much stress.

129
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,400
Listen to me.

130
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
This is a crucial period
in your rise to stardom.

131
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't fall sick on me.

132
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
I know, bossy manager of mine.

133
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
<i>It's said that</i>

134

<i>the flap of a butterfly's wings

135
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>could set off a tornado in Texas.</i>

136
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,120
<i>If not for Feifei's call two years ago,</i>

137
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,000
<i>I would probably still be
an obscure two-bit actress.</i>

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,000
<i>Hello, Linlin?</i>

139
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,760
<i>Do you have free time right now?</i>

140
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
<i>Come for an audition for a role
at Tianyi Media.</i>

141
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
Really? I'm in the area.

142
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
I'll come by right away.

143
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,680
Boss, I've done as you asked.

144
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,560
Do you want to go home or to the office?

145
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,680
The office.

146

What's the matter?

154
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,720
Get up!

155
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,400
Everybody is talking about you.
You're in the limelight!

156
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
Isn't that good?

157
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,280
Why do you make it sound like a bad thing?

158
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,720
Look at the latest news.

159
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,440
That's a pretty nightgown!

160

Where did you buy it?

161

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,200
You ruined the main couple's relationship
and killed the female lead's brother

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,120
in yesterday's episode of <i>Kindred Spirits</i>.

170
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,560
Everybody is giving you a warning online.

171
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,720
Doesn't that mean
everybody is impressed by my acting?

172
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,200
If only it were so simple.

173
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,480
Look at the third post.

174
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
LING YIZHOU TANGLED WITH ACTRESS XIA LIN
OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM

175
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,320
MY INNOCENT MR. LING
HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN BY XIA LIN

176
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
What is this?

177
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,240
I went after him
because he looked familiar.

178
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,680
Why was it taken like this?

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,360
You don't know Ling Yizhou?

180
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,280
Then why were you two tangled together
outside the men's room?

181
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,000
We weren't! We didn't do anything!

182
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,240
Don't tell me you don't know who he is.

183
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
Am I supposed to?

184
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,240
He's Ling Yizhou!

185
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,040
He's the chairman of Lingshi Group
and the richest man in Gangdong.

186
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,240
The entire Asia trembles
at the stamp of his foot.

187
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,800
He's also the ideal husband

188
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,400
for all women in Gangdong.

189
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,000
You must be exaggerating.

190
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
If he could do that to Asia,

191
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,640
he must be a 200kg fat guy.

192
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,120
You're just ignorant.

193
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm not making things up.

194
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
Look.

195
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,200
Ling Yizhou, 29 years old.

196
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,000
Gangdong elite
and Chairman of Lingshi Group.

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

198
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,280
My dear, you finally picked up my call.

199
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,400
Ms. Jiang, nothing is going on
between me and Ling Yizhou.

200
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
The photo was just taken
at a certain angle.

201
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
<i>I understand. Don't panic.</i>

202
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,080
<i>We've already started writing up
a statement.</i>

203
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,480
<i>Stay offline for a while.</i>

204
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Don't let the rumors affect you.

205
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,320
I have to get back to work. Take care.

206
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,760
Okay. I got it, Ms. Jiang.

207
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
Sorry for the trouble.

208
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,640
What the heck is this?

209
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,400
What?

210
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
They are all cursing you now.

211
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,000
They're digging out
your pre-plastic surgery...

212
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,200
No, wait.

213
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,920
They are claiming you had plastic surgery.

214
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,560
There's also some cock-and-bull gossip.

215
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
They are saying you're promiscuous

216
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,040
and even stole
your best friend's boyfriend!

217
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,800
It's so easy to spread rumors nowadays.

218
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,080
They'll say anything.

219
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,040
I would thank the heavens
if you had a boyfriend.

220
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,200
Don't worry.

221
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,240
They just have nothing better to do,

222
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
but vent their frustrations online.

223
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,120
Everything will blow over
once the company releases a statement.

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,760
You're so naive.

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,680
They don't care what you say.

226
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,600
They will trash-talk you regardless.

227
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,640
You should be careful.

228
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,760
If...

229
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,240
Hello, Chu Yan.

230
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
Xia Lin, what's going on
between you and Ling Yizhou?

231
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,560
Nothing is going on.

232
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,760
-Don't worry.
-<i>Good.</i>

233
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,520
<i>I'm still on set.</i>

234
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,600
We're filming in the mountains
in a few days.

235
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,760
If anything comes up, contact Zhao.

236
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
He'll let me know.

237
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay, just focus on your work.

238
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,720
I can handle this.

239
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,760
All right, enough.

240
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,040
Chu Yan cares quite a lot about you.

241
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
Talk about something else.

242
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Linlin,

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,480
maybe you should go to the office.

244
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,400
Talk with Ms. Jiang
about how you'll resolve this matter.

245
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,320
I'll go with you.

246
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
Jia Fei.

247
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,600
Why didn't you take your shoes off
when you came in?

248
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,440
I was in a hurry.

249
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, you can tidy up my place
while you're here.

250
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm heading to the office.

251
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
I'll be stealing your nightgown.

252
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,480
<i>Yes, you're absolutely right.</i>

253
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,840
-Okay.
-Ms. Jiang, why was the contract canceled?

254
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,920
Mr. Liu,

255
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,280
you know Linlin by now.

256
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,480
This is a misunderstanding.

257
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,240
We'll be releasing a statement.

258
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
Rest assured.

259
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,720
This won't affect your new film.

260
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
All right, thank you.

261
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,520
What happened to the movie contract?

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,320
The producer wants to back out
of the contract we signed last week.

263
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,640
It took a lot of persuading
for him to reconsider.

264
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Is the situation that dire?

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,280
Public opinion is a double-edged sword.

266
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Place "female actress" and "rich man"
in the same sentence

267
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,800
and imaginations will run wild.

268
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,520
When will we release our statement?

269
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,800
Come in.

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,280
Ms. Jiang, Xia Lin.
Someone posted a video.

271
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,360
Public Relations is ready
to publish a statement.

272
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Now that there's a video,
do we still release the statement?

273
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,480
Hold that off.

274
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,200
Contact several influencers
and ask them to post about cyberbullying.

275
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
Compile a list of actors

276
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,720
who have been subjected to cyberbullying
because of their roles as antagonists.

277
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
Highlight all of these topics.

278
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,640
Understood.

279
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,880
Please believe me.
He and I didn't do anything.

280
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,760
It doesn't matter if I believe you or not.

281
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,839
When there were just photos,
we could have blamed creative angling.

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,280
But now that there's a video,
this is a real scandal.

283
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,840
Making a statement on our own
will only backfire on us.

284
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,680
Those narrow-minded netizens
will only believe what they see.

285
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
And with your unlikable role,

286
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,480
everybody will think
you're just like your character

287
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,240
who would do anything
to enter high society.

288
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,560
Is there anything I can do?

289
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,880
If we have to wait for this to die down,

290
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,440
will I be out of work for a long time?

291
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
Why don't I go to see him?

292
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,000
If we release a statement together,
it will have more credibility.

293
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,080
That could work.

294
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,920
But it might be difficult to do right now.

295
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,560
Lingshi Group was exposed today for having
their hotel customer data leaked.

296
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,000
With the addition of their chairman,
Ling Yizhou's scandal,

297
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,640
Lingshi Group's stock took
a nosedive today.

298
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,080
It's odd that
they haven't made a statement.

299
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,080
So far,

300
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,680
Director of Information Security, Mark,
has voluntarily resigned

301
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,240
and all other related personnel
are being investigated.

302
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,720
-Excuse me, Mr. Ling.
-Indeed...

303
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,960
Are these the only people
being held accountable?

304
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,480
Mr. Jin, what are you implying?

305
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,800
What I mean is that

306
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,240
Lingshi Group is currently
under your management.

307
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,560
This data leak

308
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,000
and your scandal with some unknown woman

309
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,280
-That's...
-has caused our stock to plummet.

310
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,280
Don't you owe us an explanation?

311
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,600
-Ms. Jiang! Xia Lin!
-What now?

312
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,000
This post has been shared
over 200,000 times!

313
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,600
Someone must've dropped hints
that this is Xia Lin's personal account.

314
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,320
-I didn't know I had a personal account.
-It's trending in the top five!

315
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Everyone, calm down.

316
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,720
Yuyuan, make a clarification
using Xia Lin's official account.

317
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
Write a draft but don't post it yet.

318
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,680
-Get my approval first.
-Yes.

319
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,400
Xue, use the company's account
to share Xia Lin's post.

320
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,320
Post a formal explanation

321
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,200
and stress that we reserve the right
to take legal action.

322
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,600
Susu, bring the legal team in on this.

323
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,600
The rest keep monitoring social media.
Got it?

324
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,560
-Understood.
-Got it.

325
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
Linlin, stay here. I have to head out.

326
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,040
Where are you going, Ms. Jiang?
I'll come with you.

327
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,200
Stay here.

328
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,840
I'll handle this. Don't worry.

329
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Rest assured.

330
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
The scandal is being taken care of.

331
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
It will be over soon.

332
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,360
This wasn't simply an external attack.

333
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
An investigative report
will be prepared and sent out

334
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
to answer all of your questions.

335
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
I want to stress that

336
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,000
Lingshi Group grows
under everyone's attention.

337
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,520
An incident like this

338
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,440
doesn't have to be a crisis
for Lingshi Group.

339
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,040
It could be a turning point.

340
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,840
It has given us the chance
to see who are the trustworthy ones.

341
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,240
This is prompting crisis management.

342
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,320
We'll be waiting for your report.

343
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,720
-Okay.
-Good.

344
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,600
If there are no other issues,

345
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
this shareholders' meeting
will be adjourned.

346
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,720
Wen Li.

347
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,520
We can take action when the time comes.

348
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,880
-Yes.
-Agreed.

349
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
Look at this.

350
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,120
NO. 1, XIA LIN ACKNOWLEDGES SCANDAL

351
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,240
NO. 2, LINGSHI GROUP CUSTOMER DATA LEAK

352
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,520
NO. 4, NO COMMENT
FROM LINGSHI GROUP'S CHAIRMAN

353
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
NO. 5, LING YIZHOU TANGLED WITH
ACTRESS XIA LIN OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM

354
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,840
How are things?

355
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,120
Commercial Affairs told me
the advertiser wants a new spokesperson

356
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,040
because you currently don't fit
their pure and innocent brand image.

357
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,720
We're still negotiating with them.

358
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,440
Is it the beverage deal
that we signed yesterday?

359
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,600
That's the one.

360
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,440
Isn't it for lemon soda?

361
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,400
How are they affected?

362
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,160
Advertisers care more
about their spokesperson's public image.

363
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,000
There goes another one.

364
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,200
No, I can't just let this happen.

365
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,880
I have to see Ling Yizhou.

366
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,240
Thank you.

367
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Mr. Ling is in a meeting.
Please wait here.

368
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,720
-Of course.
-I have to get back to work.

369
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,400
Let me know if you need anything.

370
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,680
Okay, thank you.

371
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Let's be patient.

372
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,520
I understand. Thank you.

373
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,520
<i>Yes, we're handling it right now.</i>

374
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,000
<i>I see.</i>

375
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
<i>I'm sorry for the trouble.
Let's work together another time.</i>

376
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,840
Hey.

377
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,080
Another endorsement was dropped.

378
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,320
I don't care about that.

379
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm more afraid
that I'll lose acting roles.

380
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,600
You don't have to worry about that.

381
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,720
Since Mr. Ling has agreed to meet with us,
he should know why we're here.

382
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,760
The situation will improve
once things have been clarified.

383
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm very sorry.

384
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,760
I was just informed that

385
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,920
Mr. Ling has to leave
for a last-minute site inspection.

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,840
I'm afraid--

387
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,000
Can I meet him there?

388
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,440
I just have a few words to say.
I won't take up much of his time.

389
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm sorry, Ms. Xia.

390
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,640
Mr. Ling's schedule is packed.

391
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,040
He doesn't have time today.

392
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,680
-But I--
-All right.

393
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,560
Since Mr. Ling is busy,
we won't bother him.

394
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,920
Can we come back tomorrow?

395
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,280
Sure, I'll confirm a time
with his assistant, Mr. Wen.

396
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Have a good day.

397
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
Thank you. Let's go.

398
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,880
Bye.

399
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,240
Come on.

400
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
We'll come back tomorrow.

401
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,640
How did your meeting
with Mr. Ling go today?

402
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
Don't ask.

403
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,920
I waited all afternoon
and didn't even see a glimpse of him.

404
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,640
You didn't see him?

405
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,840
The media is outrageous.

406
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
What is it?

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
GOLD DIGGER DREAMS SHATTERED.
WAS XIA LIN DUMPED?

408
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,640
Are you kidding me?

409
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,040
Linlin, it's important to stay calm.

410
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
Have you forgotten who you are?

411
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,880
You're the actress, Xia Lin.

412
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,280
You're going to be
the future best actress.

413
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,120
Use your acting skills
to appeal to his emotions.

414
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,560
"Mr. Ling.

415
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,080
You are my last resort.

416
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm sure

417
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,680
you won't leave me in the lurch."

418
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,000
Forget about it.

419
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,880
If I do that,
I will be thrown out by security.

420
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,960
However, there's one thing
you're right about.

421
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,000
What?

422
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I'm sure I can convince Ling Yizhou.

423
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,720
Convince?

424
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
Mind out of the gutter!

425
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,440
I won't allow these fictitious rumors
to destroy my career.

426
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,360
And my image.

427
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,440
Now that's the Xia Lin I know.

428
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,320
And right, your image.

429
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
Don't waste this.

430
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,080
I did some digging on Mr. Ling
on gossip forums last night

431
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,120
and found out that he practices fencing
at a private club on his days off.

432
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,520
Hey, Linlin.

433
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,960
Don't you think

434
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
that the other guy

435
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,240
looks familiar?

436
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,200
Does he? I don't think so.

437
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,880
Have you been stuck at home,
writing scripts for too long?

438
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,480
They are taking a break.

439
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,640
-Go on and do some convincing.
-Quit it.

440
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
He left me waiting for so long.

441
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
People are saying

442
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,080
my gold digger dreams have been shattered.

443
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,400
I won't let him off easy.

444
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
So what's your plan?

445
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,560
Just wait and see.

446
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
You're getting worse.

447
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,840
Let's go again after a break.

448
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,440
Boss!

449
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
You already won. Don't rub it in.

450
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,680
When will I get a raise?

451
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,960
Do you want a raise?

452
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,720
No.

453
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,160
It's no big deal. Be honest.

454
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,760
I'll give you a raise after you beat me.

455
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,440
Boss, that's the 17th time
you've said that.

456
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,480
Is it?

457
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,080
I'm serious this time.

458
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,560
Win and you get a raise.

459
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm going to the restroom.

460
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,520
Are you done yet?

461
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,080
Almost.

462
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,760
This fencing outfit
is so difficult to put on.

463
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,360
Weren't you bragging
about being an excellent fencer?

464
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,480
Why are you having trouble
putting on the outfit?

465
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,040
I had three months of special training
in fencing for a role.

466
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,120
But that was three years ago.

467
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,080
Acting isn't real life.

468
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
As an actress,

469
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,440
shouldn't you take up sophisticated sports

470
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,280
and join high-end clubs
to promote yourself?

471
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,880
Well, it's too late now.

472
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,040
Here's what I think.

473
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,560
You're better off
doing some special convincing...

474
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,200
Hello.

475
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,720
This is a private club.

476
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,920
How did you get in?

477
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,440
I'm a special correspondent

478
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,120
invited by Mr. Ling.

479
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,200
I'm writing a report to explain
that scandal with the actress.

480
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,200
Really?

481
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
Why didn't I know about this?

482
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,200
Why would you?

483
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,200
Mr. Ling invited me himself.

484
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,160
Why do you look

485
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,480
so familiar?

486
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,080
Which newspaper do you work for?

487
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,440
Please show me your credentials.

488
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,600
Nice try.

489
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,440
Hey, stop!

490
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,080
Stop right there!

491
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,560
Hey!

492
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,240
Stop running!

493
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,800
Hey!

494
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,720
Hey!

495
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Stop!

496
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,040
Hey!

497
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,280
Stop!

498
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,520
Ms. Xia, you lost.

499
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,640
Ling Yizhou, you already knew it was me!
Why didn't you say anything?

500
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
You seemed furious at me.

501
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,440
I gave you a chance to take it out on me.

502
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,400
You knew I was waiting for you
at your office.

503
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,880
Why did you avoid me?

504
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,800
Ms. Xia, don't you need something from me?

505
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,680
Have you forgotten who you are?

506
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,640
You're the actress, Xia Lin.

507
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,960
You're going to be
the future best actress.

508
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,920
<i>Use your acting skills
to appeal to his emotions.</i>

509
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
Mr. Ling,

510
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm sorry for showing up so suddenly.

511
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,160
I didn't know what else to do.

512
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,080
Did you see the news a few days ago?

513
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,120
What news?

514
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,840
Do you mean

515
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
the restroom incident?

516
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I didn't pay anyone to get the attention
and I didn't take the photos.

517
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
I didn't suspect you.

518
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm glad you didn't get the wrong idea.

519
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,000
To be honest,
this has a huge negative impact on me.

520
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,280
I know you're busy
with many important matters

521
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,240
and this gossip must be trivial to you.

522
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,600
But it's fatal for me.

523
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,640
It's causing
a lot of inconveniences for me

524
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,000
and I've lost many jobs.

525
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,840
Moving forward, I'll have to live
with this undeserved notoriety.

526
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Given my current reputation,
nobody will believe my explanation.

527
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,920
That's why I'm here to see you.

528
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,880
Mr. Ling.

529
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Please help me.

530
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,120
-Please?
-Sure.

531
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,440
Really?

532
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,080
Thank you so much.

533
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,920
Let's discuss our next steps.

534
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,600
You don't have to worry about a thing.

535
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,240
Lingshi Group has an excellent PR team.

536
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,080
They will work out the best solution.

537
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
You just need to be prepared
for the press conference.

538
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Okay, you have my full cooperation.

539
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
Tell me what to do.

540
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,840
Do you see my pocket?

541
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,720
Take out the item that is inside.

542
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,480
Got it.

543
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,960
Put it on for me.

544
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,960
Okay.

545
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,719
Stop running!

546
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,320
Hey!

547
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,120
Hey!

548
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,280
-Hello, Boss?
-Wen Li, where are you?

549
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,520
Why aren't you back yet?

550
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,000
-<i>I'm working off my excess energy.</i>
-You...

551
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,159
Arrange a press conference
at 7 p.m. tonight.

552
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,159
I want all media outlets to attend.

553
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,120
<i>Understand?</i>

554
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,159
Yes, I'll arrange it right away.

555
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,639
Ms. Xia, it's done.

556
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,080
Did you really make the call
or is this a trick?

557
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Tonight at 7 p.m. Press conference.

558
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,000
Tonight? So soon?

559
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,760
-Isn't that better?
-That's not it.

560
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,400
Isn't it a bit sudden?

561
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,040
At least let me get changed first.

562
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,640
I'll take care of your appearance.

563
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,480
You'll have the best styling team.

564
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,240
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

565
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,560
Is this also a part of fencing etiquette?

566
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,360
I'm kidding.

567
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,560
But...

568
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,680
I'm amused by your naiveness.

569
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,320
<i>It's done!</i>

570
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,040
Running two kilometers was worth it.

571
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,400
Linlin.

572
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,760
You're amazing.

573
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,160
How did you convince Ling Yizhou?

574
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,720
With my acting skills, of course.

575
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,080
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

576
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,640
<i>Does the stylist like to match outfits?</i>

577
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
-This is good.
-Okay.

578
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,440
Wait. Shouldn't I take a look?

579
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,440
Ms. Xia, didn't you promise me
your full cooperation?

580
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,360
I'll do the talking.

581
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,840
As an actress,
you should be able to improvise, right?

582
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,240
Of course.

583
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,280
Boss, it's almost time.

584
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,960
Ms. Xia, your purse.

585
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,760
I get a purse too?

586
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,680
To complete your look.

587
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,000
Thank you.

588
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,920
After you.

589
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,360
-There they are.
-They are coming.

590
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
-Look.
-They are here.

591
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,560
-Take photos.
-They are here.

592
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,200
-Okay.
-Take photos.

593
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,000
Good evening, everybody.

594
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,120
<i>Thank you for attending
Lingshi Group's press conference.</i>

595
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
We will be making a statement

596
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,160
to clarify the false reports

597
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,520
<i>regarding Mr. Ling Yizhou and Ms. Xia Lin.</i>

598
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,200
<i>Xia Lin, is there a monetary transaction
between you and Ling Yizhou?</i>

599
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,840
<i>Is it a carnal or romantic relationship?</i>

600
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,640
<i>Were you the one who leaked the photo?</i>

601
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,600
Was Mr. Ling aware of this?

602
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,320
Xia Lin, you've maintained
an innocent image since your debut,

603
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
but you've been caught making out.

604
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,160
Was it just a facade?

605
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,160
<i>Xia Lin, it's said that
you seduced Ling Yizhou to get ahead.</i>

606
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,320
Is that true?

607
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,000
Why have you been frequenting
Lingshi Group's office?

608
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,400
To take advantage of their influence?

609
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,960
Does acting your duplicitous character
come naturally to you?

610
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
Please allow me to say a few words.

611
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,160
There have been recent reports
saying that Xia Lin and I are dating.

612
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,640
<i>I just want to say that</i>

613
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,720
<i>these reports are wrong.</i>

614
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Because Xia Lin and I

615
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,880
are already engaged.

616
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,240
-Engaged? Seriously?
-Really?

617
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,880
-This is huge.
-Right.

618
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,800
-Exactly.
-Since when? We had no idea.

619
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,840
-Right?
-Is it because they can't hide it anymore?

620
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,600
Let them finish first.

621
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,400
-Let's hear them out.
-Be quiet.

622
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,800
-Due to her profession,
-It's true.

623
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,160
she hasn't been able to wear
her engagement ring in public.

624
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,320
-Really?
-Mumu?

625
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,440
-Mumu, where's the ring?
-Really?

626
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,880
-Ring?
-I have no idea...

627
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,640
-For real?
-Is it true?

628
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
-It's true.
-Do you believe it?

629
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,760
-It's true.
-My goodness.

630
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,200
They really are engaged.

631
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,920
-My goodness.
-It's true.

632
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,880
-Right?
-What a match.

633
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,600
-Quickly.
-Take photos.

634
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,600
Okay.

635
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,240
-Move forward.
-Take photos.

636
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,720
What's done is done.

637
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,040
Mumu has been my fiancée
for some time now.

638
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,280
When did you two start dating?

639
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,200
<i>How long has it been?</i>

640
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,000
<i>When do you plan on getting married?</i>

641
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
<i>Mumu and I are dating normally.</i>

642
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
We didn't want to reveal our relationship,

643
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,200
but there has been
a lot of unpleasant media attention.

644
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,640
Some people are even judging her
by her acting role

645
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,560
and this is bringing great damage to her.

646
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,640
That is why we decided
to break our silence.

647
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,000
<i>If anybody makes slanderous statements
or hurts Mumu,</i>

648
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,520
<i>I won't hesitate to pursue legal action.</i>

649
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,040
-Thank you.
-How about a photo now?

650
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
<i>Come on.</i>

651
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,000
Please look this way.

652
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,680
-Over here, please.
-Who are you calling Mumu?

653
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,400
-Stand closer.
-It's just acting.

654
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,680
Look at the center.

655
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,200
How did you two meet?

656
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,400
<i>Can you reveal some details?</i>

657
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,720
<i>Look this way. Thank you.</i>

658
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,200
-Look here.
-How did you two meet?

659
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,160
-Please move back a bit.
-Forward, please.

660
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,560
Look this way, please.

661
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,800
Wen Li.

662
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,800
Yes?

663
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,440
Give this purse to Ms. Xia.

664
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,880
Yes, Boss.

665
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,040
I do.

666
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,760
This is to make us seem
more like a real couple.

667
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,760
LING

668
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,200
Don't you need to get into character?

669
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,000
"Xia's Baby Zhou"?

670
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,640
Interesting name.

671
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,320
What's the name you entered for me?

672
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
Ling's Mumu.

673
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,440
Even runners are faster than us.

674
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
The cars behind us
keep flashing their headlights.

675
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,160
Can't you speed up a little?

676
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,440
Mumu, do you like men who drive fast?

677
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,680
