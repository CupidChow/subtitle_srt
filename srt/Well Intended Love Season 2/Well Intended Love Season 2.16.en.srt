1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,760
Did Ling Yizhou send Ms. Huang
to spy on me?

2
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Where are the marriage certificates?

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,280
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

4
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
Do you recall anything, Mumu?

5
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,680
A bit. This seems familiar.

6
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,200
Did something happen here?

7
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,720
Look.

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,880
How cute!
How come he's dressed so formally?

9
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,920
Is he attending a ceremony?

10
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
Yes.

11
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520
What is it?

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
Was I there?

13
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,520
The ceremony was held just for you.

14
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,720
Aren't these photos of me from my drama?

15
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,480
How come you're in them too?

16
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,240
This is such terrible photoshopping!

17
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,040
Don't tell me you made this.

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
Mumu.

19
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,240
You had the same reaction that day.

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,640
It was right here.

21
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,560
This is where I proposed to you.

22
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Proposed?

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,360
That day,

24
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,160
I told you I was sorry

25
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,320
that I couldn't take part in your past,

26
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,040
so I edited these photos
to make it up to you.

27
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,000
I told you

28
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,160
that I would watch
the sunset and stars with you.

29
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I would grow old with you.

30
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,680
All I hoped for

31
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,280
was to be able to be in your world.

32
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,720
You agreed.

33
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
You said yes.

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
Sorry, I...

35
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,120
I really don't remember.

36
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480
It's okay.

37
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,960
Let's go to the next place.

38
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,360
You were sitting right here.

39
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
Jia Fei was in this seat.

40
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
I was behind you.

41
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,040
Wen Li was over there.

42
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,200
Is this the last place?

43
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,080
This is a very important location for us.

44
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,280
Do you remember anything?

45
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you remember why we came here?

46
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,280
I was at the office one day

47
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,920
when Wen Li showed me

48
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,520
a photo of you and Jia Fei
at the gym with personal trainers.

49
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
We got jealous.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
We immediately drove there.

51
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,320
Why would you be jealous of a gym trainer?

52
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
I just was.

53
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
You told me you liked watching
muscular studs bursting with testosterone.

54
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
So we came here.

55
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,880
I had Wen Li arrange a ball game for you.

56
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
We were sitting right here.

57
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
We were watching the game.

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,840
Everything was going well.

59
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,200
Everybody was cheering and clapping.

60
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,480
But I didn't know

61
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,640
that you and Jia Fei
had never been to a game before.

62
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,240
You didn't know which team
we were supposed to be rooting for.

63
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,000
We wore red jerseys
so we should be cheering for the red team.

64
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,560
But when the blue team scored a goal,

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,520
you and Jia Fei jumped up,
started hugging, and yelled out,

66
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,560
"Yes! Goal! Way to go!"

67
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,040
There was a guy over here.

68
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,040
I don't know how he managed to do it.

69
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,640
He ripped off the seat

70
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,880
and threw it at us.

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,160
You were below us
and I was afraid you would get hurt.

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,800
So I hauled him up here
and we started fighting.

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,400
He punched me,

74
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,520
so I fought back.

75
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
Mumu, are you okay?

76
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
He kicked me right in the stomach.

77
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,520
You were right here.

78
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,160
I said, "Stop it! Don't hurt Mumu!"

79
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,040
I pushed him away

80
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,920
and dragged him up there,
but he was so strong.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
-Stop fighting.
-He punched me again.

82
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,760
-Then I punched him back.
-Enough, stop it!

83
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,880
It's okay. I can keep acting.

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,440
It's enough.

85
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Did you remember something?

86
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,919
I remembered some.

87
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,120
Do you remember where we went afterward?

88
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,919
-Afterward?
-Yes.

89
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,360
We went to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

90
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
-Civil Affairs Bureau?
-Remember?

91
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
You dragged me there.

92
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,920
Was I that forward?

93
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
On the way there,

94
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,400
you said that

95
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,640
<i>our marriage was a scheme.</i>

96
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
<i>My scheme.</i>

97
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,960
<i>But you didn't mind
helping my scheme succeed.</i>

98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,920
It's okay if you don't remember.

99
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
Let's go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

100
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
I'll act it out for you.
Maybe you'll remember something.

101
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,680
You don't have to.

102
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
I believe you.

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
What did you say?

104
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,560
You once said that

105
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,240
even if you forget everything,
you wouldn't forget me.

106
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm not giving up on you
because you've lost your memory.

107
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,920
Even if your past is blank for you,

108
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,560
there will be a future.

109
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
I will be here for you from now on, okay?

110
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Before I agreed to your terms,

111
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
I thought

112
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,280
about leaving you no matter what.

113
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,400
But everybody said we were in love.

114
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,960
Without my memories,

115
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,760
this love doesn't feel real to me.

116
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,040
After moving in with you,

117
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,560
I fell into your trap.

118
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,880
It became harder
to distance myself from you.

119
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
Just now,

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
when you stood in front of me

121
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,640
the fuzzy memories in my mind
turned crystal clear.

122
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,800
And this.

123
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,880
This is the ring you gave me.

124
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,920
My subconscious mind
still remembers this ring.

125
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,760
Ling Yizhou.

126
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
Thank you for not giving up on me.

127
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,160
For not giving up

128
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
on the love we had.

129
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,240
If this was your scheme,

130
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,160
then I won't mind

131
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
helping you succeed once again.

132
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,160
<i>It's recording.</i>

133
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,240
<i>This is Xia Lin and Ling Yizhou's
wedding planning vlog series,</i>

134
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,680
<i>wedding photos edition!</i>

135
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,920
Mumu, do we have to film everything?

136
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,320
Of course.

137
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,880
This only happens once.

138
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,880
I want everything on film

139
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,960
so I can watch it when we're old.

140
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
All right, you're up now.

141
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,160
Okay.

142
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,560
<i>On the second of next month,</i>

143
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,360
<i>the wedding dresses we ordered
should be ready.</i>

144
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
I'll take Mumu to the fitting
on the third.

145
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,680
The sixth and seventh
will be for a two-day photo shoot.

146
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,480
We'll get to pick out the photos
on the eighth.

147
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,680
-On the ninth, we'll--
-Stop.

148
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,240
Ling Yizhou, I just realized
how old-school you are.

149
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,640
Did you come up with this schedule?

150
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,280
Of course. This is our wedding.

151
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
I want to plan everything myself.

152
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,760
How do you have time for this
with your busy schedule?

153
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,960
Weren't you the one who said it?

154
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,480
Wedding photos are very important to you.

155
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,040
I'm more than happy to take the time
to plan this out for you.

156
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,600
<i>Wedding photos are important,</i>

157
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,520
but I don't want them taken
just for the sake of taking them.

158
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,400
I want our wedding photos to be meaningful

159
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,480
and capture a genuine snapshot of us.

160
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
-Right.
-When we look at our photos later,

161
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,840
we'll be able to reminisce
about these beautiful moments.

162
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,200
Most importantly,

163
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,440
I must wear an Alex Wang wedding gown.

164
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,080
I think my plan is perfect already,

165
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,440
but if you have any opinions,

166
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,840
I'll respect them.

167
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,520
I don't have a lot of energy

168
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,840
to spend on this though.

169
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,560
Why?

170
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,080
Are you feeling sick?

171
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
Take a guess.

172
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,200
You're kidding.

173
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,480
Is it what I'm thinking?

174
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,200
Are you serious? I'm going to be a father?

175
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>Wait, you have to tell me.</i>

176
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,880
<i>I need you to say the words.</i>

177
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,240
You can't...

178
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,480
Is it true?

179
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,520
Yes.

180
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm a father.

181
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
Sorry, I'm just...

182
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,960
I don't know what...

183
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
Mumu, this is...

184
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Ling Yizhou, thank you for waiting.

185
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,080
You've given me time and respect
during the time I forgot about you.

186
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,800
I had actually fallen in love with you
all over again

187
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,800
before my memory returned.

188
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
I told you we were meant to be!

189
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
But we have to push up our wedding

190
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
or I won't be able to fit
into Alex Wang wedding dress.

191
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,640
What about this?

192
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,480
We can wait for the baby to be born first.

193
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,840
-Then we can have--
-No!

194
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,080
We're not postponing the wedding!

195
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,720
Sit down.

196
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,800
The wedding will be held as planned.

197
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,880
We'll have our wedding photos
on the sixth and seventh.

198
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,120
<i>Then we'll pick out the photos.</i>

199
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,280
<i>Boss.</i>

200
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
Bojue Photography has built up
a good reputation.

201
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,000
Orders keep increasing.

202
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,320
If this keeps up,

203
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
we might not be able
to deal with the demand.

204
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,840
Even so, we have to maintain
the quality of our products

205
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,360
and attentive service.

206
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,400
We're not just aiming to be
the biggest brand.

207
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,480
-We also aim to be the best.
-Yes.

208
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,080
By the way,

209
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,040
there is a particular case
that requires your attention.

210
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,560
This customer claims to be
your hardcore fan

211
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
and has been following you
since your debut.

212
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,560
She was sorry
that you retired from showbiz.

213
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,400
She said that she hopes
to receive her idol's well wishes

214
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,320
in the happiest moment of her life.

215
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,680
Okay.

216
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,680
I'll supervise the photo shoot myself.

217
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,480
Smile a little wider.

218
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,080
Very good.

219
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
Move in a little closer.

220
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,200
Yes, smile.

221
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,240
Big smile!

222
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,880
Good work, everyone.

223
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,840
-Hi, Mr. Chu.
-Hi, Mr. Chu.

224
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,160
-Here.
-Is this really happening?

225
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,920
Hello, I'm Chu Yan.

226
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,520
Hi!

227
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,560
I think this shot is...

228
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,760
Sorry, I'm so excited.

229
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,520
Huohuo, even though
you're no longer acting,

230
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm really happy to hear that
you're succeeding in another field.

231
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,400
You'll always be my idol.

232
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,560
Keep persevering.

233
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,680
My husband and I will always support
you and your career.

234
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Thank you.

235
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
Thank you for supporting me

236
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,280
and supporting Bojue Photography.

237
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,520
Thank you.

238
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,920
BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY

239
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
We should get back to the photo shoot.

240
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
When we're done,

241
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
I'll make sure to spread the word
on social media.

242
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,040
Thank you. I'll let you get back to it.

243
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,440
-Okay.
-Let's go.

244
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,360
-Here we go.
-Ready.

245
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,920
-Let's continue.
-All ready.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,840
Okay.

247
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,320
There you go!
That's the smile we're looking for.

248
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,119
Good!

249
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
-<i>Hello, Chu Yan?</i>
-Now for a different angle.

250
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,200
<i>Do you want to stay in or go out tomorrow?</i>

251
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,359
A little closer. Good.

252
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,000
-Don't worry. I'll pick you up tomorrow.
-Good. Beautiful.

253
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,920
<i>Is something big happening today?</i>

254
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,839
<i>Boss is all smiles!</i>

255
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
<i>Does this mean
we don't need to work overtime?</i>

256
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
<i>What does it mean?</i>

257
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,640
<i>Please wait patiently.</i>

258
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,480
<i>Don't hold back on us!</i>

259
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,320
<i>Drop some hints! Curiosity killed the cat!</i>

260
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,040
<i>I have a feeling
it's a once-in-a-lifetime happy occasion!</i>

261
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
<i>Could it be...</i>

262
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,000
Wen Li, go buy some books

263
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,680
about pregnancy
and diet and nutrition for pregnant women.

264
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
-Okay.
-One more thing.

265
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,040
Aren't there any classes
for expectant fathers?

266
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,720
-Sign me up for them.
-Okay.

267
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Most importantly,

268
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
how are wedding preparations coming along?

269
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
I was just about to report on that.

270
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
These are a few proposals that
the wedding planner came up with.

271
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,800
Do you think Xia Lin will like them?

272
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm sure she will.

273
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,120
Good.

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
Boss, there's something
I want to discuss with you.

275
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Go ahead.

276
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,600
Well, I want to go to...

277
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,920
Hello?

278
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,080
Mr. Liu?

279
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,800
It has been a long time.

280
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
Yes, I just finished a project.

281
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,400
An adaptation?

282
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Okay!

283
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,000
Send me the synopsis first.

284
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay, bye.

285
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
Let's see.

286
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,520
<i>"My Personal Sweetheart"</i>?

287
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,440
So it's a billionaire romance novel.

288
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,320
I asked for Linlin.

289
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,760
You don't have to take it so seriously.

290
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
Feifei, I am serious about you.

291
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,160
I am seriously considering our future.

292
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,320
I want...

293
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,120
I...

294
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,080
I'm so sleepy.

295
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,240
I need to go to bed.

296
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,960
Feifei!

297
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,800
Feifei!

298
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,600
<i>Feifei, I'm leaving.</i>

299
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,920
<i>Feifei,</i>

300
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,280
<i>I prepared some meals
and left them in the freezer.</i>

301
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,480
<i>Stop ordering takeout all the time.</i>

302
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,840
<i>Will she be annoyed by that?</i>

303
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,680
<i>MY PERSONAL SWEETHEART</i> SYNOPSIS

304
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,880
Isn't this

305
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,960
the story about Linlin and Mr. Ling?

306
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,360
There's also a stony-faced assistant
and a best friend.

307
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,480
Is somebody spying on us?

308
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,680
Did Linlin write
a billionaire romance novel?

309
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,440
No way.

310
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
She wouldn't.

311
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,120
Did Mr. Ling write a romance novel?

312
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Hello, Mr. Liu?

313
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,680
<i>Hello, Jia Fei.
Have you finished reading it yet?</i>

314
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,520
I just finished reading the synopsis.

315
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,480
<i>-I see.</i>
-I was just about to call you.

316
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,320
Who's the author of this story?

317
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,560
<i>The author?</i>

318
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,960
<i>I don't know the author's real name</i>

319
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,440
<i>but the pen name is Beloved.</i>

320
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,920
<i>We met when we bought the rights.</i>

321
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,320
<i>He was a very clean-cut gentleman.</i>

322
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,280
<i>I didn't expect someone like him
to write in this genre.</i>

323
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
<i>He also requested
that you write the adaptation.</i>

324
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Liu.

325
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,920
<i>-No problem.</i>
-I'll call you back later.

326
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,920
<i>Okay.</i>

327
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,600
<i>Feifei, there's something
I have to go take care of.</i>

328
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
<i>Take care of yourself while I'm not here.</i>

329
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,640
What?

330
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,880
<i>Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.</i>

331
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
Turned off?

332
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,960
<i>Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.</i>

333
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,280
Why is his phone off?

334
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,720
Hello, Linlin?

335
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,800
Do you know where Wen Li went?

336
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,800
Wen Li?

337
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,160
Hold on.

338
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,320
Let me ask Ling Yizhou.

339
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,720
Feifei wants to know where Wen Li went.

340
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
Wen Li resigned.

341
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,840
-Resigned?
<i>-Resigned?</i>

342
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,680
He said he's going to Iceland.

343
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,720
Iceland?

344
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,760
Iceland.

345
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,520
Iceland.

346
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,400
Iceland.

347
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
"Mr. Wen thought to himself that

348
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,560
he must give Feifei a unique gift.

349
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,880
So he left for faraway Iceland."

350
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,560
Iceland.

351
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
I'm going to Iceland.

352
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,720
Wen Li, even if you run
to the ends of the earth,

353
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,760
I'll still chase you down.

354
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,160
One, two, three, four... Five figures?

355
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,120
FLIGHT FROM GANGDONG
TO KEFLAVÍK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

356
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,800
It costs 64,572 yuan?

357
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,920
It's fine.

358
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,280
Hello.

359
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,040
I need a ticket
for a flight leaving for Iceland today.

360
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
Ten o'clock?

361
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,720
Okay.

362
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
First-class? All right.

363
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,160
I'll send you my information right away.

364
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Okay.

365
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
Who are you messaging?

366
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,880
Your smile is so radiant.

367
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,680
When did you two get here?

368
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,480
-A while ago.
-Sit down.

369
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,560
The menu...

370
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,960
Here's the menu.

371
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,520
Ling Yizhou, I heard

372
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,400
Chu Yan has a girlfriend now.

373
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,240
She's a super cute girly girl.

374
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,440
Really? A girly-girl?

375
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Hey, Chu Yan.

376
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,160
I remember the type of girl
you used to like...

377
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,440
All right, cut it out.

378
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,240
So what are we here for?

379
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,360
Aren't you two getting married?

380
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,680
I have a wedding present for you.

381
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,840
Present?

382
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,400
Don't tell me it's this dinner.

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
You?

384
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,880
I have your wedding photos covered.

385
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,320
You're a shrewd businessman.

386
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
It's both a wedding gift
and publicity for yourself.

387
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,800
Publicity is secondary.

388
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,880
Your wedding photos are the main point.

389
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,120
Three days and two nights.

390
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,440
Wherever you want to go.

391
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,080
I guarantee an all-inclusive service.

392
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,240
Moreover, you'll get the photos
the very next day. How's that?

393
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Is that true?

394
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,440
You can get everything done in three days?

395
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,640
Of course.

396
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,080
That's what makes Bojue Photography
a cut above the rest.

397
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,800
We give our customers the perfect gift.

398
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,360
I'll get to wear
my custom-made Alex Wang wedding dress.

399
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,120
You better make me look beautiful.

400
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,160
You hear that?

401
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,440
I'll leave everything to you.

402
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
No problem.

403
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,480
You just have to tell me
the time and place.

404
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,000
Thank you so much.

405
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,400
You're doing us a big favor.

406
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,480
Yizhou, you'll have to practice
your facial expressions.

407
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,200
Don't freeze in front of the camera.

408
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
Ling Yizhou, you'll need to practice.

409
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,560
I'm very picky.

410
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,880
Come on. Give me a smile.

411
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,760
Will this do?

412
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,640
Yes, all right.

413
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,640
There's something I've been curious about.

414
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,600
Why were the two of you
on such bad terms before?

415
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,480
You can ask him.

416
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
It's all because of a cake two years ago.

417
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,760
He bought a cake
on his birthday two years ago.

418
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,120
I had just gotten off work
and was starving.

419
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,640
So I ate a tiny piece.

420
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
He was furious.

421
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,080
Isn't he stingy?

422
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,480
I had a bad temper back then.

423
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,400
The angrier I got, the hungrier I got.

424
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,000
So I pounced on his cake
and ate the whole thing.

425
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,760
Well?

426
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,760
Chu Yan, you should know

427
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,240
you were lucky that
the cake cutter was made of plastic.

428
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,200
If it were anything else...

429
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,080
What?

430
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,640
Shrimp tempura is good.
It'll be even better if it's extra crispy.

431
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,000
It was all because of
a birthday cake two years ago?

432
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,680
The geoduck is delicious too.
How about sashimi?

433
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
You can call me Mr. Yun.

434
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,960
I'll be your photographer today.

435
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,960
-Everything is in your hands.
-Don't worry.

436
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,760
-Look down bashfully.
-Like this.

437
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,720
You got it.

438
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,960
Good.

439
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,080
Yes, that's it.

440
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,800
MUZHOU

441
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,680
<i>We just got off the plane.
We're on our way.</i>

442
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,640
You took so long going after Wen Li.

443
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,840
<i>We took a trip around Europe
while we were there.</i>

444
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,120
-Did you guys have fun?
<i>-Of course!</i>

445
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,520
<i>Let me tell you,
you have to check out Iceland sometime.</i>

446
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,120
Right.

447
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,120
A few days ago, Ling Yizhou told me

448
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,480
he thinks Wen Li
is taking too much time off

449
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,600
and is considering firing him.

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,720
<i>Mrs. Ling, we're coming as fast as we can!</i>

451
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,560
<i>Please find it in your generous heart</i>

452
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
<i>to put in some good words for us.</i>

453
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,160
That'll depend on my mood.

454
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,880
Hello?

455
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,080
How's your mood now?

456
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,200
Feifei?

457
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,520
-You're finally back! I missed you!
-I missed you too!

458
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,200
Let me see.

459
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Gorgeous.

460
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
I'm talking about the dress.

461
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,040
Is this because there's a bun in the oven?

462
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,960
Of course not. We got married first.

463
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,400
I see.

464
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,320
Seeing you like this...

465
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,640
I don't want to give you away to Mr. Ling.

466
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,880
It feels like a pig
that I raised for ten years

467
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,440
is being stolen from me.

468
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,200
I want to keep you!

469
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,080
Did you just call me a pig?

470
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,800
-Meanie.
-I'll miss you.

471
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Feifei? It's been a long time.

472
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,040
Mengmeng!

473
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,280
Tell me all about
how you melted Chu Yan's cold heart.

474
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,600
-I actually...
-Feifei.

475
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,400
It's almost time.
You better go and get changed.

476
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,320
-You'll be late. Hurry.
-It doesn't take much time.

477
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,040
-Give me the gossip!
-You'll run out of time.

478
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,080
Hurry up!

479
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,680
-Thank you.
-No problem.

480
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,480
You're so pretty.

481
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,840
Do I need to wear anything
beneath this dress?

482
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,680
-No!
-No!

483
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,040
MUZHOU

484
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,240
Chu Yan, can you stop gazing at the sky
and look at me?

485
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,880
Is my boutonniere straight?
What about this?

486
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,600
-Take a look for me.
-Sorry.

487
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Did you even check the forecast
when you chose a wedding date?

488
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,920
Do you have any sincerity?

489
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,080
Don't give me that.

490
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,240
I'm getting married today

491
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,600
even if it's storming, hailing,
or raining knives from the sky.

492
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,960
Boss, I'm sorry for being late.

493
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,320
Why are you late? Where were you?

494
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,960
I just returned from Iceland.

495
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,440
You've been gone for a long time.

496
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,400
What the heck?
You're not even buttoned up properly.

497
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,880
Is this how you show up at my wedding?

498
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,640
Why did Mr. Ling choose this date?
Didn't he check the forecast?

499
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
It's going to start raining soon.
Does he have any sincerity?

500
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,520
Even if it's storming, hailing,
or raining knives,

501
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,880
I'm still getting married today!

502
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm not used to wearing a tux.

503
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,840
-Yizhou.
-What?

504
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,280
Mumu.

505
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,560
I have to make myself clear first.

506
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,920
-Even though the weather is terrible, I--
-Stop!

507
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,320
I have to say something first.

508
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,480
Even if it's storming, hailing,
or raining knives,

509
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm still getting married today!

510
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,080
-Here's to a happy partnership!
-Here's to a happy partnership!

511
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,480
Mumu, thank you for coming into my life

512
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,680
and bringing me unprecedented joy.

513
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,240
My world is complete with you.

514
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,080
Do you want to be in my world
and be my wife until death do us part?

515
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,080
I do.

516
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,080
Your turn now.

517
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,480
Ling Yizhou,
I used to have only one dream.

518
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,760
But then you suddenly crashed
into my world.

519
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,400
I never thought about who I would
want to spend the rest of my life with.

520
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Do you want to explore forever with me?

521
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,639
I do!

522
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,400
Where are the rings?

523
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Rings.

524
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
-Rings!
-Don't you have them?

525
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,320
-Hurry up.
-I don't have them.

526
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,760
They are not with me.

527
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,320
Where are they?

528
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,239
Find them.

529
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,199
Pidan!

530
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,679
Look!

531
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,360
-So cute!
-Adorable!

532
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,080
Feifei, catch!

533
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
-We're ready! Over here!
-Over here.

534
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,840
-Over here!
-One, two, three!

535
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,520
Feifei, when will you marry Wen Li?

536
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,960
-Good question!
-How could that happen?

537
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,560
He stole the bouquet!

538
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,640
Are you drunk?

539
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,320
Should we leave?

540
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,280
No, I haven't been drinking.

541
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,760
I wanted to ask you something.

542
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
You said before
that you have a fear of men.

543
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,280
Were you lying to me?

544
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,280
No, it's true!

545
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,480
I swear!

546
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,560
A man came into contact with you.

547
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,720
You didn't seem to have a reaction.

548
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,000
What is it?

549
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,680
Did you really lie to me?

550
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,920
No.

551
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,200
Chu Yan, do you know?

552
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,960
Ever since I met you,

553
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,120
my fear of men has slowly lessened.

554
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,240
I seem to be able
to interact normally with men now.

555
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,840
The doctor said I won't need
regular psychological therapy anymore.

556
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,000
That's great.

557
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,040
Are you unhappy?

558
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,560
No, why would I be?

559
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,880
You can interact with others
like a normal person.

560
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,680
I'm happy for you.

561
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,200
Really.

562
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
But...

563
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
You'll always be the most special one.

564
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,680
Of course.

565
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,800
This looks great!

566
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,720
It's nice!

567
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,440
What do you think? Pretty good, right?

568
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,280
I had it specially made for you.

569
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,440
Thank you, Chu Yan.

570
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,480
I love it.

571
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
Now I want another photo shoot next year.

572
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,440
We'll take our son for it next year.

573
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,720
Okay.

574
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,800
Me too!

575
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I want to take photos too.

576
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,560
Let's go for a photo shoot in a few days.

577
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,000
Don't butt in.

578
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,840
I want to take photos with Linlin.

579
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,160
We'll bring Ruan Meng too
and we'll have a photoshoot among friends.

580
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,720
-Okay!
-No problem.

581
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,440
You can have a photo shoot
with whomever you want

582
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,080
and wherever you want.

583
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Yes!

584
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,400
Great!

585
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,320
In that case,
I'm going to plan a no-men vacation.

586
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,840
What do you say, ladies?

587
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

588
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,360
Chu Yan, your business is booming.

589
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,080
Are you going to launch it into space?

590
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,240
If you can take me there,

591
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,360
I'll take photos from space.

592
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,440
FIVE YEARS LATER

I am extremely honored
to receive this award.

613
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,360
There are many people I want to thank,

but the one I want to thank the most

615
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,440
is the most special person in my life.

616
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,800
In my most helpless,
uncertain, and darkest times,

617
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,840
he pulled me out

618
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,080
and gave me a spacious and liberating sky.

619
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,400
I became the star

620
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,560
that shines the brightest for him.

621
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,320
Thank you.

622
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,960

Ling Yizhou.

626
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,720
Mumu.

627
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,040
You're amazing.

628
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,560
I heard everything you said.

629
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,200
You were wrong about one thing.

630
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
I was the one who was saved.

631
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,920
We saved each other.

632
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,920
Dad! Mom!

633
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,320
-Nainai!
-Nainai!

634
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,880
Ling Yizhou,
I'm sleeping with Nainai tonight.

635
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,240
No, don't give all your attention
to our child and ignore me.

636
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,560
He takes up all my energy.

637
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,920
I'll give you attention later.

638
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,320
No. Nainai is a big boy now.

639
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,360
He can sleep on his own. Don't worry.

640
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,800
He's a man now.

641
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,000
Dad?

642
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,840
Dad?

643
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,440
Can I sleep with you and Mom tonight?

644
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,840
-Sure.
-No.

645
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,280
Nainai, you're a man now.

646
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,840
Men sleep alone.

647
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,200
But...

648
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,120
But you sleep with Mom.

649
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,920
Aren't you a man?

650
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,080
I...

651
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,720
I'm a man with a wife.

652
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,160
What are you saying?

653
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,400
Mom, if you're my wife,
then will you sleep with me?

654
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,560
Nainai, you'll have to get your own wife.

655
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,120
Dad, you're so stingy.

656
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,560
Who did you call stingy?

657
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,600
-Who did you call stingy, Nainai?
-You, Dad!

658
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,040
-Don't you run! Who did you call stingy?
-You are!

659
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,640
You are, Dad!

660
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,760
What's wrong, Mumu?

661
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,800
Ling Yizhou?

662
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,360
The two of us meeting
and falling in love was predestined.

663
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,040
We'll cross paths
no matter which world we're in.

664
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,200
I know.

665
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,560
Where's our son?

666
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,480
I don't know.

667
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,600
Ling Yizhou, you must have
kicked him off the bed in your sleep!

668
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,320
-It couldn't have been me!
-Search for him!

669
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,520
-Nainai!
-Nainai!

670
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,000
-Where are you, Nainai?
-Come out!

671
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,680
-Nainai!
-Ling Yizhou, this is all your fault!

672
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,360
I'll search downstairs.
You look over there.

673
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,160
-You won't hear the end of this.
-Nainai!

674
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,520
-Nainai!
-Where are you, Nainai?

675
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,080
-Did you find him?
-No.

676
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,120
He's not here either.

677
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,520
-Nainai!
-Nainai!

678
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,320
-Nainai, where are you?
-Come out!

679
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,640
-Nainai!
-Nainai!

680
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,520
<i>Mr. Ling, what rank do you think
you occupy in Xia Lin's heart?</i>

681
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,040
First.

682
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,040
<i>-Is that true?</i>
-Yes.

683
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,720
Third.

684
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,640
Nainai is first. Who's second?

685
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,760
Pidan.

686
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,840
<i>The next question is also for Mr. Ling.</i>

687
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,000
<i>What do you think
about Xia Lin's kissing scenes?</i>

688
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,480
In regards to this question,

689
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,040
I feel like I've always had
an open mind about it.

690
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,280
I respect all her decisions
and that's how it's always been.

691
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,720
Then why wouldn't you let me accept
that drama that had kissing scenes?

692
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,160
What's the next question? Moving on.

693
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,320
<i>This is the last question.</i>

694
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,000
<i>Do you have a message
for the fans who support you?</i>

695
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,160
Sure.

696
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,440
Thank you for following Mumu

697
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,040
and thank you for liking the both of us.

698
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,240
And I believe every person

699
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,120
will be able to find their perfect love.

700
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,200
