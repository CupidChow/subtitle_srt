1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Ms. Jiang.

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,880
Mr. Ling, aren't you going
to wait for Xia Lin?

3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,760
Didn't I warn you about the contract?

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,880
I don't understand what you're saying.

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,520
I didn't show it to anybody.

6
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
This is my last warning.

7
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Mumu is where I draw the line.

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,480
Tread carefully.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,920
I think you're right about one thing.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm beginning to believe in astrology.

11
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
I don't think we're a good fit.

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,200
Sorry!

13
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,720
Ms. Jiang, what do you think about this?

14
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,440
I think it's okay.

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,680
It's a safe option.

16
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
It looks great.

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,400
Really?

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,600
Not that one. Change it.

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Ling Yizhou, what are you doing here?

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Great! You can give me your opinion too.

21
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Which one do you think looks the best?

22
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
Ling Yizhou, you've rejected
all the dresses I tried on.

23
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,480
Do you just think
I look terrible in everything?

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,400
I don't care. I think this one is fine.

25
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm picking this dress.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
Are you sure you want this one?

27
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm sure.

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,080
Ling Yizhou, this is the only dress
that can cover the bite mark.

29
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,920
But isn't it too plain?

30
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,520
No.

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,360
Black will always be a classic
on the red carpet.

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,720
The material of this dress
can show off your slim waist.

33
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,560
The tailoring is perfect.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,600
You clearly have your motives.

35
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
I do.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,840
I want everyone to know

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,920
we're married.

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,320
We haven't discussed the wedding yet.

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,080
Let's not make it public yet.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't worry about it.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
You're not running away from this.

42
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,480
The whole world will know

43
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
you are my bride.

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Let me see.

45
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
Are you serious?

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,079
I'm not that short or fat!

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,279
Can't you take a good photo

48
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
-now that we're finally on a date?
-Well...

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,560
This is how you look.

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
-Say that again.
-Sorry!

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
-You're short and fat!
-Sorry!

52
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,160
-I dare you to say it again.
-Sorry!

53
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
Jeez.

54
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

55
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
No, I'm fine.

56
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,000
-Are you sure?
-Hey! What are you doing?

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240
-Stay away from her.
-Well...

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm so sorry.

59
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,760
We accidentally ran into each other.

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,720
I just wanted to help her up. That's all.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,120
I didn't mean anything by it.

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,960
I accidentally ran into him.

63
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
It's okay as long as she's fine.

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you okay?

66
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
You seem shocked.

67
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,760
I'm fine now.

68
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
All right.

69
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,600
So what are you doing here?

70
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,160
You still remember me?

71
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
Of course.

72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Our first meeting was so unusual.

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,200
Are you a tourist?

74
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Yes, I'm traveling.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
What about you?

76
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm taking some photos.

77
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
Right. I want to thank you for your help.

78
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Why don't I treat you to a meal?

79
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
That's okay. It was nothing.

80
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
-Goddess!
-I love you!

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
-Xia Lin, look here!
-You're so beautiful!

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,560
-You're gorgeous!
-Xia Lin!

83
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,280
Xia Lin, you're stunning!

84
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,280
Xia Lin!

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
-Xia Lin!
-Please look this way!

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,040
Goddess, look here!

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
-I love you!
-Look!

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
-I love you, Xia Lin!
-Look here!

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,680
-Thank you.
-Okay, thank you.

90
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
Xia Lin, you're a beauty!

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,080
I love you!

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,840
Mr. Ling, does your appearance
on the red carpet

93
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,800
hint at major upcoming projects
from Lingshi Group?

94
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
No, I'm just Mumu's date.

95
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,480
When do you plan to have your wedding?

96
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,120
-About that--
-We're letting things progress naturally.

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
We want to enjoy the present.

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Mr. Ling, do you have an explanation
for Lingshi Group shielding a murderer?

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,760
-What?
-You hired a scapegoat.

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,920
Have you forgotten?

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,680
The victim's name is Yao Liang
and he is Xia Lin's old acquaintance.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
Xia Lin, did you know about this?

103
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,800
Everyone.

104
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,920
I hope you can refrain
from asking about false rumors

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,440
or Lingshi Group will pursue legal action.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,600
Let's go.

107
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,960
-Mr. Ling!
-Please explain, Mr. Ling!

108
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Sorry, the time for questions is over.

109
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,160
-Please maintain order. Thank you.
-Why didn't he explain?

110
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,040
-Why?
-Right.

111
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Mumu, don't listen to their nonsense.

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,080
What is this about?

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
Why would the reporters ask
about shielding a murderer?

114
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,480
I'm not sure either.

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,120
Someone is probably trying
to smear Lingshi Group's reputation.

116
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,520
Wen Li.

117
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,640
Suppress all news reports.

118
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,560
Don't let these false rumors spread.

119
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,480
Investigate the incident
they are talking about.

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
Focus on our competitors.

121
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,280
Boss, I don't think we can suppress it.

122
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,960
It's all over the Internet now.
They're also saying that Ms. Xia--

123
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,680
GOLD-DIGGER XIA LIN CHEATED
ON FORMER LOVER FOR WEALTHY LING YIZHOU

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,520
I've never dated Yao Liang.

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
We were only high school friends.

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,280
I only found out about his car accident
at my high school reunion.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Someone must be intentionally linking
these two incidents together.

128
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
They are obviously targeting us.

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
Who could it be?

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't worry about it.

131
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,800
I'll protect you.

132
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Ling Yizhou.

133
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,000
Why don't we visit Yao Liang?

134
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,920
I want to ask his mom.

135
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,200
Maybe we'll find out what happened.

136
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,799
GANGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

137
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,000
Who are you?

138
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Hello, ma'am.

139
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
I was Yao Liang's classmate.

140
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,760
My name is Xia Lin.

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,080
So you're the tramp
who left my son for money.

142
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Ma'am, you're mistaken.

143
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
Yao Liang and I never dated.

144
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Of course, you wouldn't admit to it.

145
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,680
Compared to the murderer, Ling Yizhou,
an old lover is nothing to you.

146
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,200
You're not welcome here. Leave!

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
-Leave!
-Ma'am!

148
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
-Don't do this.
-Leave!

149
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,600
-Calm down, ma'am.
-Let me explain!

150
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,000
-Leave!
-Ma'am, calm down.

151
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
Ma'am!

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,640
Ma'am, we came
to figure out the truth of the situation.

153
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
Then we can help you fix the problem.

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,800
We feel great sympathy
for you and your son's situation.

155
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,400
But you shouldn't wrongly accuse
an innocent person.

156
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,960
Who are you?

157
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,120
I am Ling Yizhou.

158
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,960
You're the murderer, Ling Yizhou?

159
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,400
The nerve you have to come here!

160
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
What did my son ever do to you?

161
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,960
Yao Liang is a good child.

162
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,560
He had a bright future ahead of him!

163
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,840
You've ruined it all!

164
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
He's ruined!

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,280
Get out of here!

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
-Leave now!
-Ma'am!

167
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
-Ma'am, there must be a misunderstanding!
-Go!

168
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,160
-Leave!
-Ma'am, calm down!

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,720
Leave!

170
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,680
-What a scene.
-Don't take this to heart.

171
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Right.

172
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,560
Let's go home.
I'll have Wen Li investigate this.

173
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,880
-There they are!
-They are here!

174
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,160
-They're coming.
-They are out!

175
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,960
Mr. Ling, rumors online say
you're the culprit.

176
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,640
Did you come to the hospital out of guilt?

177
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,880
How much did you spend
to silence the Yao family?

178
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,520
Xia Lin, someone said you threw away
your morals to marry the rich.

179
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,680
-What do you say to that?
-As reporters, don't you know

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,520
you can be held liable for spreading
unverified and misleading information?

181
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
-Mr. Ling, please comment!
-That's right!

182
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,880
-Mr. Ling, tell us what you think!
-Yes!

183
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,840
-Excuse me, make way.
-Please comment!

184
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
-Excuse me.
-Don't leave!

185
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,560
-Don't leave!
-Please comment!

186
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,320
So?

187
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
How is the sweet taste of revenge?

188
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,640
This is just the beginning.

189
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,400
He should pay the consequences
for his actions.

190
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,720
You had best be careful.

191
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,320
After all, Ling Yizhou won't be easy
to take down.

192
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
I know what I'm doing.

193
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
<i>Excuse me, make way.</i>

194
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
<i>Excuse me.</i>

195
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
What's wrong, Mumu?

196
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,040
Ling Yizhou.

197
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,560
It wasn't you, right?

198
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
I can promise you.

199
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,640
I never ran over anyone.

200
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,680
Nor have I ever done anything illegal.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
That's right.

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
You weren't even there.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,720
How could it have been you?

204
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,840
And I know you.

205
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,440
You're not that kind of person.

206
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,760
What do you plan on doing now?

207
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,800
It's all over the Internet.

208
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,640
The current situation
is unfavorable for you.

209
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,760
Ling Yizhou?

210
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
I already have Wen Li on it.

211
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,840
We'll find out soon.

212
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,960
All right, I have to go now.

213
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,360
I need to go to the office.

214
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,280
My driver can give you a ride.

215
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,720
Ling Yizhou.

216
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
Everything will get better.

217
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,160
I will be right here with you.

218
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,920
Thank you, Mumu.

219
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm going to go now.

220
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,560
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, Yizhou.</i>

221
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
<i>What's going on?</i>

222
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,440
It's nothing.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,240
I have Wen Li looking into it.

224
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
<i>Don't worry, I can handle it.</i>

225
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Tell me if you need help.

226
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,680
I know some people who can help
in the entertainment circle.

227
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,240
All right, thank you.

228
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,960
What are friends for?

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,720
Okay, bye.

230
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,320
Come in.

231
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
Come in.

232
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,360
Chu Yan!

233
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,120
-Don't come any closer!
-It's me.

234
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
-Stay away.
-Don't you remember me?

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Stay away!

236
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,160
-Don't come near me!
-I just wanted to thank you.

237
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,840
-Chu Yan!
-No!

238
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,960
Don't run.

239
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,280
These flowers are for you.

240
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,720
Chu Yan!

241
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Chu Yan!

242
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,640
Stay where you are!

243
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,240
I don't have any special intention.

244
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,760
I just wanted to give you these flowers.

245
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,360
Put down your weapon.

246
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,640
I don't have any weapons.

247
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
Those flowers.

248
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,240
Don't you like these flowers?

249
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,120
I arranged and wrapped these myself
and they're all freshly picked.

250
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,680
-Look, the flowers--
-Zhao!

251
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,200
Excuse me, miss.

252
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm really sorry.

253
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,160
What are you doing?

254
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,400
Hey.

255
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,560
My flowers! Wait!

256
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,280
Hi, everybody.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Come with me.

258
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,560
Excuse me.

259
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,120
Are you allergic to flowers?

260
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
You're asthmatic?

261
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose.

262
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
I didn't know.

263
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
It's okay.

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,040
Just don't give me any flowers again.

265
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

266
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,480
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me last time.

267
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
It's okay.

268
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,040
You didn't know.

269
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
Zhao.

270
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,920
Call the cleaning lady in.

271
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,280
No need.

272
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I got it.

273
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,480
I think I should get the cleaning lady.

274
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
No, I made this mess.

275
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,800
I should clean it up.

276
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
I'll apologize with my actions.

277
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,680
But you don't seem to know how to do it.

278
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,640
Chu Yan, don't judge a book by its cover.

279
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,880
Revise Route A.

280
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,280
The scenic spots
are too far from each other.

281
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
We can't just cater to personal interests.

282
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,040
Then there's Route B.

283
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,320
It's a popular tourist spot,

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,160
but the costs are too high.

285
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,560
We need to lower the price.

286
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,080
Next is Route C.

287
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,640
This route is a bit off the beaten path.

288
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,840
We would need to spend more time
on marketing.

289
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,600
All three plans need to be fine-tuned
before being included in our brochure.

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,360
Is your company in the tourism business?

291
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
You could say that.

292
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,120
It's travel plus photography.

293
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
But why must a choice be made
between Routes A, B, and C?

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm not interested in any of those.

295
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Why can't I go to the places I want
and let you handle the arrangements?

296
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,120
It's because current products of this kind

297
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
all have fixed routes.

298
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,960
If we cater only
to the customer's preferences,

299
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,760
the costs would be far higher.

300
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
But...

301
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
Come closer.

302
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,119
Get down here.

303
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,680
It's easier to talk this way.

304
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,839
Listen, I'm the customer
and I'm the one paying.

305
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,040
Shouldn't I get to pick the route I want?

306
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,680
Miss.

307
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,520
That would depend on
how much you're willing to spend.

308
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
Our company's aim

309
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,839
is for the customer to receive
the best service at the least cost

310
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,360
while making wonderful memories
on vacation.

311
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,440
Okay, I need to clean the floor now.

312
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,120
Move it.

313
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,360
Is it true that you never
dated the victim?

314
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,240
We were only classmates.

315
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,440
I never saw him again after graduation.

316
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,680
Although...

317
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
<i>These memories have been so vivid lately.</i>

318
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
<i>It's a sign that</i>

319
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,120
<i>I should tell you
what I was never able to tell you before.</i>

320
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,320
<i>I...</i>

321
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
<i>I like you.</i>

322
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,960
<i>I'm sorry if this comes as a shock.</i>

323
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,360
<i>Is there any chance</i>

324
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,600
<i>you would accept me as your boyfriend?</i>

325
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,280
Although what?

326
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,600
Nothing.

327
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Anyway, I don't have anything
to do with him.

328
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,840
Good.

329
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,960
As your manager,

330
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,680
my best advice is

331
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,800
to keep a distance from Ling Yizhou
or divorce him.

332
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,440
You're not the one at fault.

333
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,240
You don't need to bear any responsibility.

334
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,760
Ms. Jiang, I know you have
my best interests in mind.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,160
But I trust Ling Yizhou.

336
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,640
He needs me right now,
so I can't leave him.

337
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,200
Besides, our relationship
can't be defined by a piece of paper.

338
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,360
Yes, I know you're attached to him.

339
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,880
But you mustn't
let your emotions control you.

340
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,680
He could harbor a criminal.

341
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
Perhaps he's the one who did it.

342
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800
He can't be trusted.

343
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,640
The investigation is still ongoing.

344
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,920
I believe the truth will be revealed
and his name will be cleared.

345
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
Please trust my judgment.

346
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,840
There's nothing I can do
if you won't listen to me.

347
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,440
But if this ends up affecting your career,

348
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,840
I hope you won't have regrets.

349
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,960
I know.

350
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,280
I've made my decision.

351
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,480
I am mentally prepared.

352
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,760
All right.

353
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,960
Go and see Yuyuan
about tomorrow's press conference.

354
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,920
Okay, I'll find her now.

355
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Thank you.

356
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,480
I better not disturb you.

357
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,120
I'll leave now.

358
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,440
Okay.

359
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,960
I came to talk to you about something.

360
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,240
What is it?

361
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
What would we have to talk about?

362
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,840
Have you considered
what I asked you last time?

363
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,120
Can we be friends?

364
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
What are you laughing for?

365
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,400
I laughed

366
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,640
because people don't become friends
by asking.

367
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,800
It just happens naturally.

368
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,760
Okay, I get it.

369
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,040
Two years ago,
there was a Lingshi Group employee

370
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
who hit someone
while driving under the influence.

371
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,920
The offender was a driver
for Lingshi Group.

372
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,200
According to him,

373
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,680
there was nobody else in the car

374
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
at the time of the accident.

375
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,920
However, his family later received
an enormous sum of money.

376
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,480
When we later questioned his family,

377
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,560
his family continued to insist
that the driver was the offender.

378
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Keep an eye on the family.

379
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,120
They will slip up.

380
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,480
This incident wasn't reported at the time

381
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,160
because the company
was gearing up to go public.

382
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,520
One of the board members,
Mr. Jin, suppressed it,

383
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,400
fearing it would affect
Lingshi Group's image.

384
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,640
Absurd! His disregard for human life
does no good for Lingshi Group's image.

385
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Keep digging.

386
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,040
See what else he has done in the past.

387
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
Yes, Boss.

388
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,320
THE 25TH COAST INTERNATIONAL
TELEVISION FESTIVAL

389
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,560
-Get a good shot, okay?
-Do you see her yet?

390
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,680
-Not yet.
-There!

391
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,160
-There she is.
-Hurry.

392
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,840
-Stand in position.
-Get ready.

393
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,400
-Be ready.
-What's going on?

394
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,360
Get ready.

395
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,920
Hold on to this.

396
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,240
Xia Lin, what are your thoughts
on Ling Yizhou covering up a hit-and-run?

397
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,840
Xia Lin, as the victim's ex,
do you have a part in this cover-up?

398
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,360
Xia Lin, what is the truth?

399
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,520
-Please comment!
-Aren't you ashamed of what you've done?

400
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,440
Xia Lin, please answer
the question directly.

401
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,120
The truth is that
Yao Liang and I were only classmates.

402
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,080
We never dated
and he is not my ex-boyfriend.

403
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,560
Ling Yizhou didn't run over anyone
nor did he hire a scapegoat.

404
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,840
He shouldn't be condemned
for something he didn't do.

405
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,840
I believe everyone can understand
how it feels to be wrongly accused.

406
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,960
So I ask everyone

407
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,560
to stop publishing
sensational and false stories

408
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,120
to gain the public's attention.

409
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,480
We are currently investigating
this matter.

410
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,600
The truth will be revealed to everyone.

411
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,240
You're just spouting bullshit!

412
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,320
You're shameless!

413
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,080
-What's going on?
-Record this.

414
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,800
-Out of the way! I'll teach her a lesson!
-Mumu!

415
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,240
-What are you doing?
-Are you okay?

416
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,800
-Don't hold me back!
-I'm fine.

417
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,320
-Ling Yizhou, about the murder...
-What is the truth?

418
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,680
Thank goodness it was only water

419
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,360
or it would've turned out
much differently.

420
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,720
Are you okay?

421
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm fine, Mumu.

422
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
Why are you here?

423
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,040
I knew the reporters would pounce on you
at an event like this.

424
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,680
I didn't expect you to be attacked though.

425
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,280
I'm sorry for failing at protecting you.

426
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,960
I'm fine. Look, I'm perfectly okay.

427
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,440
Either way,
the next time you have an event,

428
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm sending more security
to ensure your safety.

429
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,840
Your apartment's address has been leaked.

430
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
It's not safe.

431
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,960
I'm serious. Move in with me.

432
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,560
Okay, I'll pack my things
and move in tomorrow.

433
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,080
Good, I'll pick you up tomorrow.

434
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,800
Boss, the rioter has been detained.

435
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
Look into his background.

436
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,240
Yes, Boss.

437
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,560
Let's go now.

438
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,960
BYSTANDER DOUSES XIA LIN WITH WATER

443

<i>Continue to condemn
Xia Lin and Ling Yizhou's actions.</i>

<i>Use the dirt on Xia Lin that I gave you.</i>

445
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,840
<i>Make it count this time.</i>

446
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,640
What's your price?

447
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,320
Exactly 100,000 yuan.

448
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,920
The money will be in your account tonight.

449

Remember to keep your mouth shut.

POPULAR FEMALE ARTIST: XIA LIN

461
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,720
Feifei.

462
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,640
It's late. Go to sleep.

463
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,680
An insult to Linlin is an insult to me.

464
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,720
I'll be damned
if I don't go down fighting.

465
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,080
I'm afraid you'll just rile them up more.

466
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
You know what?

467
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,240
There is a spiral of silence theory
in communication studies.

468
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,920
When people see the opinion
they favor being accepted,

469
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,600
they will be more confident in expressing
and spreading this opinion.

470
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
In other words,

471
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
it's the same as
blindly following the crowd.

472
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,320
On the other hand,
if your views aren't widely-accepted,

473
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,480
then you'll keep silent even if there are
people who agree with your views.

474
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,440
That will make the opposing view
seems stronger.

475
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,600
And oftentimes, these reinforced views
are controlled by the media.

476
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,680
So you don't want the forums
to only have one voice.

477
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,480
Smart.

478
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,160
Many people have been brainwashed
by public opinion.

479
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,240
That's why no matter
how outrageous the rumors are,

480
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,800
people will believe it.

481
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,520
If nobody speaks up,

482
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,920
the rumors are bound to come true.

483
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,080
Okay, I'll help you.

484
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
What?

485
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
What is this ridiculous meet-up?

486
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,800
"Xia Lin anti-fans offline meet-up"?

487
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
I told you.

488
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
It's an organized rumor mill.

489
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,160
What kind of group is this?

490
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
It's Linlin's group of anti-fans.

491
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,680
I finally gained access to it.

492
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm going to gather evidence
of their slander.

493
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
This won't do.

494
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
I have to go.

495
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,360
I might be able to collect
important evidence.

496
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,480
I'll come along.

497
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,840
What for?

498
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,840
I won't say a thing.

499
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll only listen in
and record the entire event.

500
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,360
Nobody will notice me.

501
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,480
Boss.

502
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,480
According to the investigation,

503
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,120
that person is Ms. Xia's anti-fan.

504
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,480
He has been criticizing Ms. Xia
ever since her debut.

505
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,760
Anti-fan?

506
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,240
There must be more to the phone case gift.

507
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,400
Investigate the bugging device again.

508
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,000
This time, focus on
the people around Mumu.

509
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,720
Okay. One more thing.

510
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,840
There's new information
regarding Yao Liang's accident.

511
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,560
The scapegoat for the driver
has a brother who is a gambling addict.

512
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,080
This might have a direct connection

513
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,120
to that unexplained sum of money
we discovered.

514
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,080
Good.

515
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,040
Keep an eye on him
and his account 24 hours a day.

516
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,680
Notify the police immediately
if the evidence is found.

517
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,760
-Let the police handle it.
-Yes, Boss.

518
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,760
Based on our latest research,

519
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,520
customers are very satisfied
with the quality,

520
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,000
the shots, and the style of our photos.

521
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,680
However, some people have brought up
that we have very few routes and options.

522
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,240
We will gain more customers
if we can solve this problem.

523
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,120
Yes.

524
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,080
Vacation photo shoots
focus on travel and photography.

525
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,840
If we can balance both,
customers will have a better experience.

526
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,440
Customers should get to choose
their destinations

527
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,280
and we should be able to provide
a customized plan and service.

528
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That could be our biggest selling point

529
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,160
that sets us apart
from similar services in the market.

530
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
Mr. Chu is right.

531
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,560
Our current advantage isn't enough.

532
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,600
We also need to state our vision

533
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,160
in order to succeed in the market

534
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,760
and convince the board of directors.

535
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes.

536
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,600
That's how our brand will be seen.

537
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,720
Our slogan will need to make
an impression on the board.

538
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
How about "Vacation captured my way"?

539
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,560
It's concise
but doesn't seem specific enough.

540
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,840
How about "Roam the world"?

541
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,000
"Record your scenery"?

542
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,480
That covers everything.

543
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,400
But it doesn't seem right.

544
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
But why must a choice be made
between Routes A, B, and C?

545
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm not interested in any of those.

546
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,600
Why can't I go to the places I want
and let you handle the arrangements?

547
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,800
<i>It's because current products of this sort</i>

548
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,320
<i>all have fixed routes.</i>

549
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,600
<i>If we cater only
to the customer's preferences,</i>

550
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,480
<i>the costs would be far higher.</i>

551
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,160
Listen, I'm the customer
and I'm the one paying.

552
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,360
Shouldn't I get to pick the route I want?

553
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,800
<i>Our company's aim</i>

554
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
<i>is for the customer to receive
the best service at the least cost</i>

555
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,040
<i>while making wonderful memories
on vacation.</i>

556
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
None of these works.

557
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,160
Go where I want...

558
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,560
to go.

559
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,760
Listen up.

560
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,120
Our new slogan can be

561
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,240
"A photo shoot where you want it."

562
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,520
-"A photo shoot where you want it."
-"A photo shoot where you want it."

563
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
-That's good.
-It fits well.

564
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,840
It's simple, easy to remember,
and highlights our selling point.

565
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,040
Brand innovation.

566
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,320
We can take this
to the board of directors now.

567
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,480
Yes.

568
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,120
This is great.

569
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,200
We are Bojue Photography.

570
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,720
A photo shoot where you want it.

571
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,400
Sorry for being late.

572
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,480
Take a seat. We began a while ago.

573
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,480
Okay.

574
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
-Someone like Xia Lin...
-Are you a Xia Lin...

575
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,400
who can't tell right from wrong

576
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,080
-shouldn't be a celebrity.
-Exactly.

577
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,560
-People must be blind.
-Why are you here?

578
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,800
-How could anybody be so shameless?
-To back you up.

579
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,400
-I can't stand her.
-Right.

580
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,880
What are you two discussing over there?

581
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
-Share with us.
-This is what I think.

582
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
-She's so fake.
-I have a question.

583
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,440
What do you all hate about Xia Lin?

584
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,640
Her laugh is so fake
and her acting is terrible

585
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,320
even though she calls herself
a solid actress.

586
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,520
But she has won an award.

587
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
-Who knows if she bought those awards?
-Right.

588
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,560
And she's a serious gold-digger.

589
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,080
-She has been with many wealthy men.
-But hasn't that been cleared up?

590
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,920
She's also in a normal relationship
with Ling Yizhou.

591
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,240
-Who really knows?
-That's right.

592
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,120
-It's an act.
-Ling Yizhou isn't a good guy either.

593
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
He's an unscrupulous businessman.

594
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,640
They are a shameless couple.

595
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,000
Exactly. Ling Yizhou even hit someone
while drunk driving.

596
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,880
Yet, he acts holier-than-thou.

597
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,600
He didn't do it.

598
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,160
-How do you know?
-That's right.

599
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,240
He must have wanted to steal Xia Lin
so he ran over her ex-boyfriend.

600
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,000
-Xia Lin is nothing good either.
-Right.

601
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,480
People died because of her.

602
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,760
This hasn't been confirmed yet.

603
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,080
Please don't spread rumors.

604
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,080
What do you mean?

605
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,960
-Why do you keep challenging our points?
-Who is he?

606
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,680
-Are you actually a Xia Lin anti-fan?
-Right.

607
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Listen up.

608
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,040
I can't stand you Internet trolls
who swarm like locusts,

609
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,880
spreading rumors and fanning the flames

610
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,200
while hiding behind your keyboard.

611
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,280
Are you blind or just stupid?

612
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,920
If you believe any rumor,
why won't you listen to their statements?

613
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,760
Do you think
you have the moral high ground

614
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,560
so you can just attack others
any way you want?

615
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,920
When she laughs, you say it's fake.

616
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,640
When she doesn't laugh,
you say she's rude.

617
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,000
Why don't you just cut off your own nose
to spite your face?

618
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,160
Who are you?

619
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
She's my girlfriend.

620
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,560
-And who are you?
-He's my boyfriend.

621
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,960
Nobody asked!

622
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,080
I know.

623
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,560
Xia Lin must have sent them
to stir up trouble.

624
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,639
You get to spread rumors,
but we can't fight back?

625
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Who's spreading rumors?

626
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,440
-When did you hear me spread rumors?
-Do you want to see the playback?

627
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,040
-That's...
-He's crazy.

628
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,000
It's not my fault.

629
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,000
I only said those things because it's fun.

630
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,239
Fun?

631
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,840
I don't find it fun at all.

632
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,440
You're enjoying yourselves,

633
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,639
but others are getting hurt

634
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,400
because of your jokes.

635
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,120
Even if it's freedom of speech,

636
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,679
you need to be responsible
for your words and actions.

637
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,880
Enough. Let's go.

638
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,280
-That guy must be crazy.
-Exactly.

639
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,320
-What's their deal?
-How is this any of their business?

640
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,400
Feifei, did you just say
that I'm your boyfriend?

641
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,560
Didn't you say that I'm your girlfriend?

642
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,560
Is there a problem?

643
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,480
No!

644
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,200
The weather is so nice today.

645
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
Right?

646
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,160
Don't be mad anymore, all right?

647
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,880
Ma'am, this is Mr. Ling's room.

648
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,400
Okay, thank you, Ms. Huang.

649
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,440
I can unpack on my own.
You can get back to work.

650
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,360
All right, I'll prepare dinner.

651
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,360
Call me if you need anything.

652
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,000
Okay, thank you.

653
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,040
That person was Ling Yizhou.

654
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,800
XIA LIN'S PROFILE

655
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,360
XIA LIN'S PERFORMANCE ITINERARY

656
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,160
Mumu, I'm back...

657
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,680
Ling Yizhou.

658
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,360
You were at the bar that day.

659
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,120
I remember this mask.

660
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,720
You were that person.

661
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,160
Yes.

662
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,880
It was me.

663
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,960
What's with all this information?

664
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,560
Why would you have this?

665
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,040
Did you know me from a long time ago?

666
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
I did know you.

667
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,680
I met you a long time ago.

668
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,320
Today is

669
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,040
the 779th day

670
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,360
since I met you.

671
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
It was two years ago on June 8.

672
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
That day was my birthday.

673
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,680
I never celebrate my birthday,

674
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,080
but that day,

675
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,360
I had a sudden whim

676
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,120
to buy a cake for myself.

677
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
It was then

678
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,320
when I first met you.

679
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,800
Credit card?

680
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,120
I'm sorry, sir.

681
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,440
Our credit card machine is down.
We can't take cards.

682
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,800
Then...

683
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,360
Okay, never mind.

684
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,280
I guess I don't need a cake
to celebrate my birthday.

685
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,160
Sorry about that. Thank you.

686
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
Sir, wait!

687
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,560
Use my loyalty card.

688
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,120
I'm in the loyalty program.

689
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,440
We get a buy one, get one free deal
for cakes on our birthday.

690
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,360
Yes.

691
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,760
It just happens to be my birthday.
Two cakes, please.

692
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,160
Okay, please wait a moment.

693
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,600
-You don't have to.
-It's okay. I can't eat it all anyway.

694
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,840
You can have one.

695
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,680
Are you saying

696
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,400
you met me two years ago

697
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,040
on the day my life changed?

698
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,160
-Hello?
<i>-Hello, Linlin.</i>

699
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,280
<i>Do you have free time right now?</i>

700
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,120
<i>Come for an audition for a role
at Tianyi Media.</i>

701
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,640
<i>-I'm talking with the producer right now.</i>
-Really?

702
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm in the area. I'll come by right away.

703
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,680
Happy birthday!

704
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Thank...

705
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,560
Thank you.

706
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,640
<i>I know.</i>

707
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,960
<i>I was just a complete stranger
to you at the time.</i>

708
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,800
<i>I'm not surprised
that you don't remember me.</i>

709
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,120
But your spontaneous deed

710
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,760
left me with lasting warmth.

711
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Was it just because of a cake?

712
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,800
If that cake

713
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
made me fall in love with you
at first sight,

714
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
then our meeting at the bar
half a year later

715
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,480
made me believe

716
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,200
that it was fate.

717
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,040
<i>I got to see you again.</i>

718
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,040
Thank you.

719
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,000
<i>At the time,</i>

720
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,480
<i>my dad was severely ill.</i>

721
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,320
<i>That was also my first time
going to a bar.</i>

722
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,240
Hello, sir. Our bar's masquerade theme
night starts at 9 p.m. today.

723
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,520
We prepared these masks
for customers who didn't come with one.

724
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,960
Have a good time.

725
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,680
Feifei!

726
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Feifei!

727
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,280
Feifei?

728
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,360
Feifei!

729
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,360
<i>The moment I saw your eyes,
I knew it was you.</i>

730
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,040
<i>I couldn't believe that I could still...</i>

731
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,800
<i>I could still once again meet the woman</i>

732
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,280
<i>I fell in love with at first sight.</i>

733
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,760
Miss, are you all right?

734
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,640
Thank you.

735
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,480
Sir, I'm fine now.

736
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,360
Can you put me down now?

737
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,120
Masquerade countdown!

738
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,720
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

739
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,680
<i>I was excited yet afraid
that you would take off my mask.</i>

740
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,040
<i>Because I hadn't decided</i>

741
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,480
<i>how I should face you.</i>

742
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,360
<i>Should I smile?</i>

743
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,360
<i>Or stay silent?</i>

744
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,360
<i>I didn't know.</i>

745
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,960
<i>That's why I got cold feet.</i>

746
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,400
<i>Later on, you became more famous.</i>

747
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,360
<i>You began to show up
around me all the time.</i>

748
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,760
<i>Whenever I felt exhausted,</i>

749
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,920
<i>I just had to see you</i>

750
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,600
<i>and I would feel energized.</i>

751
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,760
<i>I watched</i>

752
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,880
<i>as you used your own strength</i>

753
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,240
<i>to reach your dreams step by step.</i>

754
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,280
<i>I watched your smile grow more confident.</i>

755
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,720
<i>I was so happy for you.</i>

756
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,120
<i>I originally didn't want to attend</i>

757
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,480
<i>that charity gala.</i>

758
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,640
<i>But I saw your name on the guest list.</i>

759
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,320
Boss, are you going to tonight's gala?

760
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
"Chu Yan, Xia Lin."

761
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,920
Okay, tell them I'll be going.

762
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,760
Okay.

763
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,560
<i>I changed my mind.</i>

764
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,640
<i>I just wanted to see you.</i>

765
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,120
<i>I never imagined</i>

766
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,360
<i>that it would lead to a scandal.</i>

767
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Mumu.

768
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,840
I was watching you that day.

769
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I saw that

770
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,280
you were harassed

771
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,880
and I couldn't stop myself
from stepping in.

772
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,200
Instead, I made a fool of myself.

773
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,800
So when the scandal broke out,

774
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,160
you knew I would come to you.

775
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,120
Then you announced the engagement
at the press conference.

776
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,120
Yes.

777
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,880
But I did all that

778
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,880
because I love you.

779
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,160
So your love for me
makes it okay to hurt an innocent person?

780
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,160
Mumu, do you also think
I'm involved in Yao Liang's accident?

781
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,880
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

782
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,920
It came up so suddenly.

783
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,440
Someone is deliberately linking
these two matters together.

784
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,920
I wanted to wait until everything
was resolved before telling you.

785
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,320
I was afraid you would misunderstand.

786
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,600
You've kept too many things from me.

787
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,680
I can trust you unconditionally,

788
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,320
but you've lied to me again and again.

789
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,920
My trust can be destroyed.

790
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,000
I really don't know
if I can still trust you!

791
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,200
Mumu, I'm not that kind of person.

792
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,080
Is that how you see me?

793
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,760
<i>You hired a scapegoat.</i>

794
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,000
<i>Have you forgotten?</i>

795
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,680
The victim's name is Yao Liang
and he is Xia Lin's old acquaintance.

796
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,200
You're the murderer, Ling Yizhou?

797
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,400
The nerve you have to come here!

798
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,200
Mr. Ling, rumors online say
you're the culprit.

799
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,640
Did you come to the hospital out of guilt?

800
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,560
<i>How much did you spend
to silence the Yao family?</i>

801
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,880
Mumu.

802
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Answer me.

803
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,320
I don't know.

804
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,480
I don't want to think about this.

805
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,840
I have a lot on my mind right now.

806
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,760
I need some time alone.

807
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,920
Mumu!

808
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,720
Mr. Ling, the dresses
that you said didn't suit Ms. Xia

809
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,320
have been sent back
to their brand companies.

810
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,480
I didn't say they didn't suit her.

811
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,840
I just wanted her
to try on each one for me.

812
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,840
I'll take all of them.

813
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,840
Okay.

814
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,160
I want this one too.

815
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,080
I want...

816
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,480
-Let's talk after we finish playing.
-I...

817
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,120
You...

818
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,200
You...

819
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
You...

820
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,040
-You...
-Enough.

821
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,400
A photo?

822
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,040
Linlin.

823
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,480
Wait, you guys!

824
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,160
You can't team up on me like this.

825
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,040
I'm sure you'll do a good job as our spy.

826
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,320
