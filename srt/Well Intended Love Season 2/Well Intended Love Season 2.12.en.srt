1
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
I want...

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,200
-Let's talk after we finish playing.
-I...

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,920
You...

4
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,960
You...

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,600
You...

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,960
-You...
-Enough.

7
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,120
A photo?

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
Linlin.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,320
Wait, you guys!

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,000
You can't team up on me like this.

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm sure you'll do a good job as our spy.

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
-All done.
-Let's have a look.

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
-How was it, sir?
-Come.

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
It was great.

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Play the tape.

16
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
-Slow down.
-Okay.

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,680
Sit here.

18
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
This part especially.

19
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,360
Slow down.

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,760
This is so beautiful.

21
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,040
All right. That's a wrap.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay. Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
-Yes.
-I'll get going.

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,120
-Okay.
-Goodbye, sir.

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,960
Xia Lin, are you okay?

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
-Go and take a rest.
-Okay.

27
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,480
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, sir.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
-I'm fine. Don't worry.
-Really?

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,120
-You can get back to work. See you.
-Prop that up.

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,600
-Come on. Careful.
-It's a wrap.

31
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,240
-Xia Lin, does it hurt?
-I'm fine.

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
I just bumped into that thing.

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
-It's not serious.
-Careful.

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
Let's sit down.

36
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay. Let's sit down.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,880
-Linlin.
-Ms. Jiang.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
What's wrong?

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,800
I just bumped into something.
It's fine. Don't worry.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,760
How did you get hurt during filming?

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
It's fine. It's just a bruise.

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,840
Yuyuan, ask the driver
to bring the car around.

43
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Okay.

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Linlin, I went home and thought about it.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,920
I didn't handle it very well.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,760
I should apologize to you.

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Ms. Jiang,
I know you have things to consider.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,640
How have you been?

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,880
How are things with Ling Yizhou?

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
Ling Yizhou...

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,040
He's taking the breakup very seriously.

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Linlin, you're an actress that has dreams.

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,800
You want to produce more good work
relying on your own talent.

54
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
As for relationships...

55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,640
Just let things be.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Ms. Jiang, don't worry.

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,920
I won't let it affect my work.

58
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,760
I know what I want.

59
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm sure you know what to do.

60
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,040
Have Yuyuan go
to the hospital with you later.

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm meeting the director,
so I won't be able to go with you.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
-Okay.
-I'll walk you to the car.

63
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm fine, Ms. Jiang. See?

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,240
-Are you sure?
-I just bumped into something.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,640
GANGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Xia Lin.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
I'm glad you're fine.

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
We'll be able to shoot as scheduled.

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,200
Come on.

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Yuyuan, you can go home now.

71
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm waiting for a friend.

72
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Is it Mr. Ling?

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,240
Stop that.

74
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
My friend is getting a checkup here too.

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,280
You can go and tell Ms. Jiang I'm fine.

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
-Tell her not to worry.
-But we--

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,160
Just go. I'm fine.

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
-Go on.
-All right.

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,080
Ma'am.

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
-I...
-What?

81
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,280
Why are you back?

82
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,200
I...

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,400
ma'am, are you sure

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
that you don't need to do more checkups?

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,440
I might need a CT scan or something.

86
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,400
My heart kind of hurts too.

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
Could I get an ECG?

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
I feel kind of dizzy.

89
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Could I have a concussion?

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,760
Miss, this is the orthopedics clinic.

91
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
If you want to do all that,
you'll need to go somewhere else.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,840
Also, your leg looks fine to me.

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,160
I thought you were
a general practitioner...

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,120
Okay then.

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,360
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're welcome.

96
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
You'll be fine.

97
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
Ma'am.

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
Then...

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,080
The psychiatry...

100
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
<i>I've been so busy with work lately.</i>

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,440
<i>But I'm doing well.</i>

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,960
<i>A sprained ankle can't stop me.</i>

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,040
ONLY FOR LING YIZHOU

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,800
GANGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

105
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,120
Hi, are you Ms. Xia Lin?

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,680
It's you.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,720
We're from Lingshi Group's
medical service.

108
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,280
We specialize in orthopedics.

109
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,840
We heard that you sprained your ankle.

110
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,960
We're here to help you.

111
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Help her onto the wheelchair.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Careful.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Slow down.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Be careful.

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,360
Careful. Don't bump it.

117
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
Ling Yizhou.

118
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
I finally caught you.

119
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Only you would be able

120
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
to send so many doctors.

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,520
Very well.

122
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,440
I guess I'll have to take this seriously.

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Don't blame me for being extreme.

124
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,440
Ladies, I'll have good news soon.

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,960
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

126
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,880
<i>Xia Lin doesn't like this character,</i>

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,680
<i>so she won't be considering it.</i>

128
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
Okay. Let's work together next time.

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,920
Thank you.

130
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Bye.

131
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,360
POPULAR FEMALE ARTIST: XIA LIN

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Sir.

133
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,920
Your wife is here.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mumu, why are you here?

135
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
Dear, we're married.

136
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
Of course we should live together.

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
I thought you said
you wanted some time apart.

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
I've had enough of it.

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,680
Look, I sprained my ankle.

140
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,040
It's so inconvenient living by myself.

141
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,640
Okay, I'll go upstairs to my room.

142
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
You can continue working.

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,520
Sorry, I got up too fast and stumbled.

144
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,800
You can get off now.

145
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Is this your room?

146
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
What do you think?

147
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
I prepared this room just for you.

148
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
I don't want to be apart.

149
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
I want to stay in the same room.

150
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,480
You hurt your foot.

151
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,240
You might get in my way.

152
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
But I'm too scared to sleep alone.

153
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
I thought you've always slept alone.

154
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,160
It's different now.

155
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,280
It's so hard for me to get stuff.

156
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,640
You're hurt. Just stay in your room.

157
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Don't move around.

158
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,400
My injury needs some air.

159
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
If you need anything,

160
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
ask for Ms. Huang.

161
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,200
I've successfully
infiltrated his living quarters.

162
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Even though it's not his room,

163
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,240
I can wait for my chance.

164
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,200
Sir.

165
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
-Ms. Huang.
-Yes?

166
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,680
Get Xia Lin the luggage
she left here last time.

167
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,600
Make sure she has everything.
If not, get it for her.

168
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
-Yes, sir.
-Also, keep an eye on her.

169
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Don't let her walk around.

170
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,760
Yes, sir.

171
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
<i>Mrs. Ling just sprained her ankle.</i>

172
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
<i>It's not serious.</i>

173
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Mrs. Ling, why are you downstairs?

174
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
I was going to bring your food upstairs.

175
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I can just eat down here.

176
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,600
You're hurt.

177
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,080
You should get some rest.

178
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
I feel fine.

179
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,680
Don't worry.

180
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,880
Good.

181
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,920
Ms. Huang,
these are all my favorite dishes.

182
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Did you cook them just for me?

183
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
I did. It's Mr. Ling's order.

184
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,440
Where is he?

185
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,240
He's working in the study.

186
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
He said we should eat without him.

187
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
I'll get back to work.

188
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,640
I know you're busy,
but you should have some fruit.

189
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
Dear.

190
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,440
I told you to let Ms. Huang do all this.

191
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,320
Ms. Huang is very busy.

192
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,880
I can help with small chores.

193
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay then.

194
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Aren't you going to have some?

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,240
I'll have some later.

196
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,920
Okay.

197
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,160
I'll leave it here then.

198
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,000
Anything else?

199
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,760
You've been working so much.

200
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,320
Your shoulders are probably sore.

201
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Let me give you a massage.

202
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
No need, Mumu.

203
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,760
It's fine.

204
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,720
Everyone loves my massages.

205
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,200
Let me give you one.

206
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
Like this...

207
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
Mumu.

208
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,520
I have a video conference in a bit.

209
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
-Video conference?
-Yes.

210
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,720
Okay.

211
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Then...

212
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
I'll get going.

213
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,760
Don't forget your fruit.

214
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,040
See you.

215
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,360
I set down the fruit
and hung around for a bit.

216
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know what I should do.

217
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240
Now that I think of it,

218
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,480
I didn't even talk to him that much.

219
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,600
Why are you at his house
doing chores for him?

220
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Are you trying to get Ms. Huang's job?

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,320
<i>I just wanted to remind him that I exist.</i>

222
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,240
Who else knows

223
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
that you're at his house?

224
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
I came from the hospital.
Nobody else knows.

225
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>From my many years of experience,</i>

226
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>the Internet discussions
have died down a bit.</i>

227
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,600
I'd advise you to not let anyone else
know that you've moved to his house.

228
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,440
Especially your manager.

229
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,080
If she finds out,
she'll be the first to object.

230
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,800
Nobody else knows. Only you.

231
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,120
Even if I wanted to,

232
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,600
I'd only tell people
after I get Ling Yizhou back.

233
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,280
By yourself?

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
I've already finished my screenplays.

235
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,360
<i>Let me, your lousy adviser,
give you some advice.</i>

236
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,560
What advice do you have?

237
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,640
<i>Since you're already in his house,</i>

238
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
you should use this to your advantage.

239
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,800
Last time, when you were packing,

240
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,400
I snuck a secret weapon

241
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,880
into your suitcase.

242
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,440
A secret weapon?

243
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,320
<i>Go and take a look.</i>

244
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,480
Okay, wait a second.

245
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,320
"ABC herbal cotton sanitary pads"?

246
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
<i>That's right.</i>

247
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,520
<i>You need to prepare for a long battle.</i>

248
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,640
<i>The ABC herbal cotton sanitary pads</i>

249
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,640
<i>have herbal substances
good for your health.</i>

250
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>You need good health
to find a way into Mr. Ling's heart.</i>

251
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Is that how you got Wen Li?

252
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,000
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

253
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>Of course that's not all.</i>

254
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,080
<i>I prepared a comprehensive battle plan.</i>

255
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,560
What is it?

256
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,080
It's so late. What are you doing?

257
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,640
Drinking before bed
can help you sleep, my dear.

258
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,200
Are we really just having wine?

259
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,320
Didn't the doctor tell you
that you shouldn't have alcohol?

260
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,800
But I...

261
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,800
I need to sleep. You should go now.

262
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,120
It's still early.

263
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm not tired yet.

264
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,920
I injured my ankle
so I can't walk on my own.

265
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,960
Fine.

266
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,280
You sleep here.

267
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,800
I'll be in the guest room.

268
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,480
Ling Yizhou.

269
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,120
This is cold violence.

270
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,880
How can you treat a weak woman like this?

271
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm a good sleeper.

272
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,880
I won't disturb you.

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,319
I know what you mean now.

274
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,240
Ling Yizhou! What are you doing?

275
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,400
Wait.

276
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't sleep without drinking some wine.

277
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,640
What do you want now?

278
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
Tell me a story.

279
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
You can leave once I fall asleep.

280
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,560
Okay. I'll have Ms. Huang do it.

281
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,080
Ms. Huang is in bed already.

282
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,480
I want some milk.

283
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
I'll get some for you.

284
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
Okay.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,320
I'll wait for you.

286
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,040
I haven't put on my medicine yet.

287
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,560
Where is it?

288
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Right here.

289
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Can you do it for me?

290
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,880
If I do it myself,

291
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,920
I'll have to wash my hands
downstairs later.

292
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,720
-Is it this side?
-Yes.

293
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Anything else?

294
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,920
Thank you, Dear. Good night.

295
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
<i>So?</i>

296
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,040
<i>Did the secret weapon work?</i>

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
<i>Not at all.</i>

298
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,160
<i>But I'm sure that</i>

299
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,840
<i>Ling Yizhou still cares about me.</i>

300
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,760
<i>Then you have to keep going at him.</i>

301
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,240
<i>He needs to realize</i>

302
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,560
<i>that he can't forget you.</i>

303
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,800
Of course.

304
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,880
Good morning.

305
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Good morning.

306
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,280
Are you free tonight?

307
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
I found a nice restaurant.
Let's go together.

308
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,480
There's a banquet at the company tonight.

309
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,080
See you later.

310
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,360
You didn't have breakfast.

311
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,920
It's fine. Wen Li will buy me some.

312
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
I don't think this is the doctor
I saw last time.

313
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,720
It's just a checkup. It's fine.

314
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,920
I think it's better
to go to the same doctor.

315
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,040
I know that doctor better too.

316
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,360
Okay then.

317
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,800
I'll ask at the front desk.

318
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
Wait here.

319
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,800
Okay.

320
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,920
You're recovering well.

321
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,240
Keep using the medicine
I gave you last time.

322
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,800
You won't need to come back.

323
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,560
That's great.

324
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,560
I'm glad you're okay.

325
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,800
<i>Feifei, my injury is getting better.</i>

326
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
<i>Does this mean Chu Yan
won't care about me as much?</i>

327
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,680
<i>It depends on</i>

328
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,520
<i>whether he has developed
feelings for you recently.</i>

329
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,320
<i>If you're not sure,</i>

330
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,360
<i>you have to keep finding ways
to stay in his life.</i>

331
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,200
<i>You should also find out
if you have any competitors.</i>

332
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,680
This is your medicine...

333
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,240
What's wrong?

334
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Are you worried about your injury?

335
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
No.

336
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,040
I just saw a really sad news article.

337
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,080
By the way, have you been going

338
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,040
to blind dates lately?

339
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,560
No.

340
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
I've been too busy.

341
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,280
And I don't enjoy it.

342
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,680
Take care of yourself.

343
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,160
You too.

344
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,400
Okay.

345
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,160
Feifei, what should I do?

346
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
He's acting indifferent towards me,

347
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,680
but he still cares about me.

348
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
Whenever I ask him
to do something with me,

349
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,320
he always uses work as an excuse.

350
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,920
He probably feels very conflicted as well.

351
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,640
He really loves you,

352
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,120
so he can't totally ignore you.

353
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
But on the other hand,
you hurt his feelings,

354
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,080
so he needs time to recover.

355
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
Tell me.

356
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,280
What if he spends so much time recovering

357
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,480
that he discovers he no longer loves me?

358
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,280
I think...

359
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
That might be possible.

360
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
Stop talking!

361
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,560
Now you're afraid?

362
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,240
You know that Mr. Ling really loves you.

363
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,080
We've all witnessed it.

364
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,760
I think that he wouldn't give up on you.

365
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,400
The problem is...

366
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,280
you.

367
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,640
You entered this relationship
treating it like a role in a show.

368
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,880
Now, you should ask yourself
if you really understand him.

369
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,360
I think that

370
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,440
you can consider

371
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,120
buying a gift for him as an apology.

372
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,920
By the way, do you know what he likes?

373
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,240
He likes...

374
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,240
I knew it.

375
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,680
Come on.

376
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,720
I mean he doesn't seem
especially interested in anything.

377
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,280
Do you know what Wen Li likes then?

378
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,760
He...

379
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,720
See? We're just the same.

380
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Wen Li must have been influenced
by Ling Yizhou.

381
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,200
What do men like?

382
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
Women.

383
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,920
Superficial. That's too superficial.

384
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,560
Men...

385
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
What men like...

386
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,720
Only men would know.

387
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
Feifei, Mrs. Ling,

388
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
apart from what I just told you,

389
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,800
can I help you with anything else?

390
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
Wen Li,

391
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,760
you've worked for Ling Yizhou for so long.

392
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,920
Do you know what he likes the most?

393
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
Boss likes you the most.

394
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,120
I know that.

395
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,240
I mean other than me.

396
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,960
What does he like or care about the most?

397
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
Never mind.

398
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,600
I knew I couldn't count on you.

399
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't worry.

400
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,920
I won't put you on the spot.

401
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,760
I'll think of a way myself.

402
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
Goodbye, Mrs. Ling.

403
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,800
Wen Li.

404
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,040
What do you like?

405
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,600
Feifei,

406
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
are you giving me a gift?

407
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,680
Shouldn't the answer to that

408
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,360
be me?

409
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,200
BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY

410
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,080
Isn't she that crazy fan from last time?

411
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,080
She seems more normal now.

412
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,960
She's here for Mr. Chu again.

413
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Could she have succeeded?

414
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,080
A fan made her idol fall in love with her?

415
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,440
That only happens in movies.

416
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,120
What are you so worried about?

417
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
Mr. Chu would never fall
for a crazy girl like that.

418
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
Are you jealous?

419
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,200
If they want to date,
you won't be able to stop them.

420
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Hey.

421
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,000
You really know your way around here now.

422
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,560
Don't worry.

423
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,080
You can continue working.

424
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,440
I won't bother you.

425
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,800
Tell me.

426
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,320
What do you want?

427
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,240
Could you be here...

428
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
to clean up for me?

429
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
You know what?

430
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Ling Yizhou and Xia Lin are breaking up.

431
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,840
It's all over the Internet.

432
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
It's fake.

433
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,120
Didn't they clarify things?

434
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,240
Her account was hacked.

435
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,840
Aren't you friends with them?

436
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,080
I just came to ask you.

437
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,920
What is their relationship now?

438
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,760
I haven't contacted them lately.

439
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm not sure.

440
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,960
You won't be able to get anything
out of me.

441
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,480
I was just asking.

442
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,640
Is this something important to him?

443
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,880
This is Yizhou
when he was eight years old.

444
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,160
The robot he's holding
was a gift from his mom.

445
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,320
He really liked it.

446
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,280
That's why he wanted a photo with it.

447
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,560
Where did you get this photo?

448
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,360
I found it in his room.

449
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,160
I don't know what it means to him.

450
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
That's why I came and asked you.

451
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,920
I guess it means he never lets go of it.

452
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,520
Yizhou's parents

453
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,720
got divorced when he was very young.

454
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,200
Weren't they in a good relationship?

455
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
How should I put it?

456
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,520
They once loved each other.
That's why they got married.

457
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,960
It was only after that

458
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,360
when they found out they didn't get along.

459
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
They thought that having a child

460
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,480
would improve their relationship.

461
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,520
But it turned out that

462
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,000
his dad's temper got even worse.

463
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
He was getting more and more impatient
towards his wife.

464
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Yizhou's mom couldn't take it

465
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,760
and left him to be with a man she loved.

466
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,120
When he found out his mom had left,

467
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,720
Yizhou, who used to be happy all the time,

468
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,200
never smiled again.

469
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,360
I was so worried about him.

470
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
But what could I do?

471
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
I couldn't replace his mom.

472
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Grandma.

473
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,200
Actually,

474
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,560
I did something
that hurt his feelings lately.

475
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,760
I want to let him know that
I love him very much and I'm sorry.

476
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,040
But I don't know

477
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
if we can go back
to what we were like before.

478
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,520
Mumu,

479
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,840
I know that you young people
have different opinions.

480
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,280
Sometimes when you argue,
you say things you don't mean.

481
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,800
But that's all right.

482
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,520
If you get into an argument,

483
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,400
just sit down and talk about it.

484
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,840
Don't ruin your relationship
by being impulsive.

485
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,640
Yizhou might have been affected
by his parents' divorce.

486
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,680
He keeps everything to himself.

487
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,960
But he's actually a kind
and affectionate person.

488
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,920
If he thinks you're the right person,

489
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,480
he will love you with all his heart.

490
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,680
I understand, Grandma.

491
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,120
Don't worry.

492
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
I'll do my best to make him happy.

493
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,480
No.

494
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,080
Both of you have to be happy.

495
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,920
Wait a minute.

496
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
All right, guys.

497
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
The project is done.

498
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,160
You can go home and rest now.

499
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,600
-Yes.
-Yes.

500
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,880
-We're done!
-Yes.

501
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,920
-Thank you, Mr. Chu.
-We can go back early!

502
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,880
We're done!

503
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,120
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

504
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
-See you.
-Okay.

505
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
So early today.

506
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,880
Is everyone going home?

507
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,840
Yes.

508
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,680
I just let them go home first.
I'll stay here for a bit.

509
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,160
You said you've been busy with work.

510
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,160
Do you always work this late?

511
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,240
I have no choice.

512
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,400
Bojue Photography is just starting out.

513
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,640
As the boss, I can't slack off.

514
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,640
I see.

515
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,400
What's wrong? Are you okay?

516
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,240
Chu Yan, here.

517
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,240
How is it? Do you feel better?

518
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
We should go to the hospital.

519
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm fine.

520
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,080
I feel better now.

521
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,400
By the way,

522
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
why would you have an inhaler?

523
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,120
One of my family members has asthma too.

524
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,080
That's why I always have one on me.

525
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,000
You're so thoughtful.

526
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Don't worry.

527
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,720
I think the circuit has tripped.

528
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,160
The electricity will be back on.

529
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,920
I'm not afraid.

530
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,760
I just need to go to the restroom.

531
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,840
I'll take you there.

532
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,200
Okay.

533
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,680
Why is nobody here?

534
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,720
Didn't I tell them to go home?

535
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,600
Did you hear something?

536
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,480
It's the air-conditioning.

537
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,200
Why would the air-conditioning work
when the power is out?

538
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,280
Are there pets in your office?

539
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,280
No.

540
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,840
Who is it?

541
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
You?

542
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
Mr. Chu.

543
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,840
Who turned off all the lights?

544
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,840
It's a blackout.

545
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,320
Why is nobody here?

546
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,679
It's late now.

547
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
I let everyone go home.

548
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,280
What are you doing here?

549
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Chu.

550
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,280
I was feeling tired,

551
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,000
so I took a little nap.

552
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,000
I thought it was a ghost.

553
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,639
It was just you sleeping here.

554
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,159
Well...

555
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,960
I'll get going then.

556
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,719
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

557
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,400
Do you still need to go?

558
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,360
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

559
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,720
I can go by myself.

560
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,560
<i>Are you still busy?</i>

561
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,560
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

562
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,640
<i>Is he just busy?</i>

563
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,880
<i>Or is he ignoring me?</i>

564
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
From what I've found out,

565
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Jiang Yushi is Yao Liang's sister.

566
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,480
They each took
one of their parents' surnames

567
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,480
and they are not registered
under the same household.

568
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,000
I believe

569
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,480
that she left that household

570
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
so that we wouldn't find out.

571
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,640
She has been planning this.

572
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,640
One more thing.

573
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,760
Do you remember those photos
they took at the charity event

574
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
of you and Mrs. Ling?

575
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,400
She bought those photos from paparazzi
and sent them to that account.

576
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,760
I also suspect that
she's the one who planted

577
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,040
the bug in the phone case.

578
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,240
She probably has to do
with those rumors of you being the culprit

579
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,800
in that car accident too.

580
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,640
But we have no direct evidence
that points to her.

581
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,560
Boss,

582
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,320
what should we do now?

583
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,680
Keep things quiet.

584
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
She wouldn't be able
to do all this herself.

585
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,960
Someone must be helping or supporting her.

586
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,960
Before we find that person,
we're still in danger.

587
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,080
What about Mrs. Ling?

588
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,400
Let me handle it.

589
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay.

590
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,880
Linlin, sorry about coming over so late.

591
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,200
I saw on the news that
something has happened to Yizhou lately.

592
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,680
So I wanted to come and check on him.

593
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,760
Thank you, Mrs. Nan.

594
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,800
But Yizhou isn't here right now.

595
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,280
Maybe you can come tomorrow.

596
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,240
He must be busy with work.

597
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,760
Linlin, if possible,

598
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,360
could I wait for him inside?

599
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm sorry, Mrs. Nan.

600
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,360
I don't want to make Ling Yizhou mad.

601
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,120
Actually,

602
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,920
I'm getting on a plane tomorrow.

603
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,240
I just wanted to see him before I left.

604
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,880
Don't get me wrong.

605
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,400
I'm not here for any other reason.

606
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,840
I just thought that as his mom,

607
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,960
I should come to see my son.

608
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,600
I understand that in Yizhou's mind,

609
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,080
I no longer have the right
to care about him.

610
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,800
But you care about him more than anyone.

611
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
You probably understand how I feel.

612
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,920
Okay, come in then.

613
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,480
I wanted to ask you something too.

614
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Mrs. Nan,

615
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,280
do you remember this photo?

616
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,080
This was Yizhou when he was young.

617
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,440
How cute.

618
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Do you know what he's holding?

619
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,760
Mrs. Nan,

620
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
do you really believe what you just said?

621
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,840
I don't know what you think,

622
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,120
but you can't even remember
his most precious memory of you.

623
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,680
How else can you prove your love?

624
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,360
Don't you think that's unfair?

625
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
Linlin.

626
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,320
You're...

627
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,040
-Why are you here?
-Yizhou, you're home.

628
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,880
Mrs. Nan came to see you.

629
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,600
Didn't I make myself clear?

630
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
I don't want to see you, Mrs. Nan.

631
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,080
Yizhou, don't be mad.

632
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm not here for business.

633
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,120
I just heard
that something happened to you.

634
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,680
So I thought I'd come and check on you.

635
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
Thank you so much then.

636
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,400
Thank you. But that's in the past now.

637
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,840
You don't need to check on me.

638
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,760
Yizhou, I'm still your mom.

639
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,120
I care about you.

640
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
I trust you.

641
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,880
You care about me?

642
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,360
You trust me?

643
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,440
I'm telling you that since you left,

644
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,480
I've become used
to taking care of things myself.

645
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,760
-Yizhou, I--
-Enough, Mrs. Nan.

646
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
-I--
-Stop talking.

647
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm telling you one last time.

648
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,560
Stay out of my life.

649
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,160
Ling Yizhou.

650
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,600
Should I have sent your mom away sooner?

651
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,840
After all, I knew
you didn't want to see her.

652
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,640
It's not your fault.

653
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,480
It's my own problem.

654
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,120
It's better to talk things out

655
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
than to keep them to yourself.

656
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,280
All this time,

657
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,000
people around me think

658
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,680
that my family gave me
the best environment possible.

659
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,280
As a result,

660
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,600
it's as if I don't have the right
to be mad or unsatisfied about anything.

661
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,680
Every time I show my vulnerability,

662
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,440
people think I don't have
the right to do so.

663
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,440
Actually,

664
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,240
what happened today

665
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
might not be a bad thing.

666
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,160
Letting out your pain and suffering,

667
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,040
even just a little bit,

668
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,480
is better than keeping them
inside all this time.

669
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,960
You can choose to forget your past,

670
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,160
but your past won't forget you.

671
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,120
It'll still affect your future.

672
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,400
Rather than doing that,

673
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,560
maybe you should take the first step

674
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,840
and start reconciling with yourself.

675
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,520
Reconcile with myself?

676
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,240
Mumu,

677
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
thank you for always being by my side.

678
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,160
It's my duty.

679
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,440
I can do better though.

680
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,760
If I was more considerate,

681
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,360
I wouldn't doubt you

682
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,000
about the Yao Liang incident.

683
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,720
That day,
everything just happened so fast.

684
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,720
I acted too impulsively.

685
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,960
I really regret it.

686
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,000
No matter what,

687
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,080
I shouldn't have doubted you.

688
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,080
I shouldn't let you
face all this on your own.

689
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,080
I promise

690
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,560
that it won't happen again.

691
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,640
Ling Yizhou.

692
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,320
I'm sorry.

693
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,320
I've been thinking about it too.

694
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,840
I shouldn't have hidden
some things from you.

695
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
My way of expressing love is wrong.

696
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,080
I thought that I could protect you
by not telling you things.

697
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,960
I thought that my decisions
were for your own good.

698
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,480
You always think about things
from my perspective.

699
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,640
But I...

700
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,240
I always

701
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,760
neglect your feelings.

702
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm the one who should apologize.

703
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,040
Mumu.

704
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,200
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,120
Then...

706
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,920
Can we still be together?

707
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,920
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

708
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,720
I said,

709
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,040
let's make up.

710
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Silly girl.

711
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,720
We've always been together.

712
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,440
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY WITH WORK LATELY.
BUT I'M DOING WELL.

713
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,640
A SPRAINED ANKLE CAN'T STOP ME.

714
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,800
Wen Li!

715
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,920
LINGSHI GROUP

716
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,240
What is it, Boss?

717
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,680
Get me an orthopedist.

718
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,960
An orthopedist?

719
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,760
Who needs an orthopedist?

720
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,720
Mumu.

721
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,760
-Is Mrs. Ling hurt?
-Didn't you see her post?

722
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,040
Boss, I don't see it here.

723
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,800
How is that possible?

724
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,480
Should I still get the medical team?

725
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,160
Of course.

726
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,960
Go do that.

727
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,840
Get a team of experts.

728
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,040
Yes, Boss.

729
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,440
The best doctors.

730
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Yes, Boss.

731
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,440
Read it and give it back to me.

732
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,720
I can't stay for long.

733
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,800
<i>You're...</i>

734
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,720
The supervisor just asked for you.
I'll take care of that.

735
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,080
Okay. Here you go.

736
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,400
Fill it with confetti.

737
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,520
He's always asking for me.

738
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
I'm so busy.

739
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,280
