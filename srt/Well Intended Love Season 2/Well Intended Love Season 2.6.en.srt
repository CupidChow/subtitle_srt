1
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
<i>I do good deeds all the time.</i>

2
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,400
How could I be pregnant?

3
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,840
It should be...

4
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,960
Could it be...

5
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,440
Let me reward you then.

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
HOW SWEET ARE MUZHOU?

7
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,880
I DON'T GET RICH PEOPLE

8
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,200
That's steamy.

9
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
I've seen everything now.

10
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,440
-Goodness, look.
-Look at this.

11
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
Look at this picture.

12
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,360
-Do you have anything to treat contusions?
-Look.

13
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
To your left.

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,640
-This will do.
-Look at this photo.

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,080
-Let me see.
-I'll have this.

16
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,200
-It's her.
-Yes.

17
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,920
Miss, you paid too much!

18
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,720
-It's her. Look.
-You're right.

19
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,480
ZHONGTAI PHARMACY

20
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
It's all your fault.

21
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm the subject of gossip everywhere I go.

22
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,200
I even spent 100 yuan.

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
You have to compensate me

24
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,840
for the harm done to my mental health,
my reputation, and so on.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
Pay for everything.

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm talking to you.

27
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,120
Are you listening?

28
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,440
I only slapped you once.

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,400
In my short time in there,

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
your face had swollen to that much?

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,520
Spit it out.

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,880
The candy has expired. Don't eat it.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,320
Who told you to eat it?

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,080
It's so hot and stifling today.

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,280
The cold air will escape.

36
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,040
What are you doing?
Don't shut the window! It's so stuffy!

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,640
-Let go!
-Listen to me.

38
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,560
You sprayed my eye!
Can you hand me a tissue?

39
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,080
-I'll suffocate! Let go!
-Can you give me a tissue?

40
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,600
-I can't open my eyes!
-Let go!

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
-Get it yourself!
-Does it look like I can see?

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
-You sprayed my eye!
-Did you film it?

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,960
So...

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,720
You can't really

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,680
blame me for what happened today.

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,240
Who's blaming you?

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Then again,

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
thank you for saving me today

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,040
and getting rid of the paparazzi.

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
Mumu, I'm just glad you're fine.

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840
So then,

52
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,520
were you forced by circumstance
to come back and save me?

53
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,920
So...

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,720
Did you go to the exhibition with Chu Yan?

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,160
Yes. I went with Chu Yan.

56
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,120
What's the matter?

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
I'll forgive you this time.

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,880
You're not allowed to go
with anybody else next time.

59
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,480
Got it?

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,280
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

61
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,120
<i>Xia Lin, you big pervert!</i>

62
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,240
Who's calling?

63
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,480
Hello, Jia Fei.

64
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Feifei!

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,560
Feifei, what's wrong?

66
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,840
What's the matter?

67
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,720
I won the lottery.

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,960
Lottery? What lottery?

69
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
You're pregnant?

70
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,360
Whose is it?

71
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,800
Who do you think?

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,680
Wen Li?

73
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,520
Why did you have to say his name?

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,560
I don't know what to do!

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,440
-I seriously don't know!
-Feifei.

76
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
-I'm doomed!
-Feifei.

77
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,320
<i>This is driving me crazy!</i>

78
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
XIA LIN AND MR. LING MADE OUT
AT A MALL FOR 20 MINUTES

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,760
Chu Yan, here's your Americano.

80
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,960
Throw it away.

81
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,200
Boss, the car is ready.

82
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,400
We can leave at any time.

83
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
What about Cheng Li?

84
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
Mr. Cheng flies back to Gangdong
tomorrow night.

85
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay.

86
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,000
Pick him up at the airport.

87
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,920
-I'll meet him at the office.
-Okay.

88
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,520
By the way, I've looked into the people
who were following Ms. Xia yesterday.

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
They must have been sent by Mr. Jin.

90
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,240
SUNDAY

91
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,680
Why did you come in to see me?

92
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
I have to remind you.

93
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
According to company regulations,

94
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
while you are on suspension,

95
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
you are not allowed
to have any private contact

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,280
with any shareholders.

97
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,440
Dozens of employees saw me come in.

98
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,080
This isn't a private meeting.

99
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
Mr. Jin, I'm sure
I don't need to remind you.

100
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Lingshi Group is still my company.

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,000
I have the utmost respect and appreciation

102
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,560
for all employees, high and low,
who contribute to this company

103
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
but you are not one of them.

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Ling Yizhou.

105
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,200
What do you mean by this?

106
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
You can come at me.

107
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,400
But if you touch my fiancée,

108
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
do you think I'll just sit around
and do nothing?

109
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,080
If other board members were to find out
about your shenanigans,

110
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
what consequences might you face?

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,159
As a representative of this company,

112
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,600
I was merely protecting Ms. Xia.

113
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,400
Don't underestimate me.

114
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Tell me.

115
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
What do you want?

116
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
I don't care how you do it.

117
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,720
Lift my suspension immediately

118
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
and call a shareholder's meeting
in three days.

119
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,960
Feifei, don't be nervous.

120
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm right here with you.

121
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
Relax.

122
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm going to the restroom.

123
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,800
Didn't you just go?

124
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,760
Feifei!

125
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,840
Hello, Wen Li?

126
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,040
Hello, Ms. Xia?

127
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
It's going to be okay, Feifei.
Don't be nervous.

128
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
-Okay.
-It's okay.

129
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,360
Why are you here?

130
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,280
Since Mr. Wen is here,
I'll let you two talk.

131
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll go first, Feifei. Take your time.

132
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,600
I'll get going.

133
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Come with me.

134
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,680
Come.

135
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
Let me go!

136
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
If I miss my turn,
I'll have to wait all over again.

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
You're not pregnant.

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,240
Do you have X-ray vision?

139
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
To tell you the truth, that night...

140
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Come.

141
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Lie down.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,480
Let me write.

143
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Stand up.

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,920
Be careful.

145
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,280
So that means...

146
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,680
nothing happened

147
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,320
between the two of us?

148
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,240
If you want that to change,

149
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
I wouldn't mind.

150
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,160
Then why didn't you tell me
from the start?

151
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,760
Why did I need to take responsibility?

152
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,800
I...

153
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,200
-I didn't think--
-Mr. Wen.

154
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,880
You are so dishonest.

155
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
Did you think
you could play me for a fool?

156
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,640
No, that wasn't my intention.

157
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,120
Did you know I haven't had
a good night's sleep because of this?

158
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,840
I even had a writer's block.

159
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,200
Who will compensate me for that?

160
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,640
I will.

161
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,240
How?

162
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,440
In order to make up
for your past few days of unease,

163
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,000
I can take charge of your marriage.

164
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
You...

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,560
Feifei.

166
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,880
It's my fault that you've been so anxious.

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
But as I said before,

168
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560
since we've started this thing between us,
we should take it seriously.

169
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,000
I hope you will reconsider
the relationship we have.

170
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
Give me some time to think, okay?

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
There has been too much going on.

172
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
I need time to process it.

173
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,400
Okay.

174
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,520
How much time do you need?

175
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,240
Half a year?

176
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,200
That's too long.

177
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
How about a little shorter?

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
-Three months.
-Two months.

179
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,680
-One month!
-Deal.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,960
But...

181
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,280
How could the pregnancy test be wrong?

182
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,400
Pregnancy test?

183
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
When did you buy your pregnancy test?

184
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I remember it now.

185
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,960
I was writing a pregnancy plotline
five years ago

186
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
and I bought one for research.

187
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Miss, pregnancy tests
have a shelf life of two to three years.

188
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,720
I see.

189
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,880
It turns out that all this time

190
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,640
I've been a fool.

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,680
I didn't understand my feelings

192
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,240
and that cost me
so many chances to be with you.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,320
Can you forgive me?

194
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,920
This time...

195
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,640
This time, I will do all I can
to cherish you

196
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,040
and tell you I love you.

197
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Good take!

198
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,760
-Xia Lin.
-Thank you.

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,160
Be careful.

200
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,840
Your emotions were so on point

201
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,640
that I became immersed in the scene.

202
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,360
It's not too late to become my student.

203
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Is it because
you have experienced it all before?

204
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,200
That's why you're able to express
the right emotion?

205
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,640
If I told you
that I've experienced it before,

206
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
would you believe me?

207
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
It's always women
who get heartbroken over you.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Your heart never gets shattered.

209
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
Who says?

210
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,760
-Xia Lin, I--
-Xia Lin!

211
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,760
Your fans sent you presents.

212
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,960
Okay.

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
What were you saying?

214
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,680
I was saying that you're an idiot.

215
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,720
All right, I have to go.

216
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,360
-Bye.
-Okay.

217
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,240
-Let's move on to the next scene.
-Okay.

218
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,680
I'm the real idiot.

219
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,600
-Let me see.
-Place the setup here.

220
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Right here. By the lake.

221
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,200
Here?

222
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,760
<i>How was your examination?</i>

223
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,280
<i>Traitor!</i>

224
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
<i>How could you tell Wen Li?</i>

225
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
<i>The doctor said I'm not pregnant.</i>

226
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,840
<i>The pregnancy test has expired.</i>

227
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,320
These are gifts from your fans.

228
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,360
What's inside?

229
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,320
Here.

230
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,720
"Muzhou"?

231
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,800
MUZHOU

232
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,120
What's this?

233
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,840
These are such cute phone cases

234
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,000
with me and Ling Yizhou on them.

235
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,080
These are so cute.

236
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,160
<i>I have a cute phone case for you.</i>

237
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,760
Xia Lin, good work today.

238
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,840
The director invited us all
to dinner later.

239
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,480
-Sure.
-Okay, see you later.

240
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,720
-See you later.
-See you later.

241
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,240
Cute phone cases.

242
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,400
MUZHOU

243
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,599
<i>Are you done with work? I'll pick you up.</i>

244
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,560
<i>Not today.</i>

245
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>The crew is having dinner together.</i>

246
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,120
Chu Yan and Xia Lin, good work.

247
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
-Thanks for all your hard work.
-Good work.

248
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,200
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Come on.

249
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,480
-Good job.
-Good job.

250
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,400
Let's all start eating.

251
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,200
-Okay.
-We've been working hard for months.

252
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
Dig in.

253
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Ma'am, we don't deserve the credit.

254
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,680
We couldn't have done it without you.

255
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,920
Save the flattery.

256
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I was mainly directing
my comment at Xia Lin.

257
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,640
Xia Lin, your acting is amazing.

258
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm sure you'll succeed.

259
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,120
I must make a toast for you.

260
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,520
Thank you for your guidance and support.

261
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
-I will continue to do my best.
-I admire your commitment.

262
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Cheers.

263
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
-Amazing.
-Good.

264
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,680
-She sure can drink.
-Don't drink so much.

265
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,400
-Eat something to soak up the alcohol.
-Dig in.

266
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Hello, everybody.
Sorry for dropping by uninvited.

267
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
-Mr. Ling?
-No, please stay seated.

268
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,040
-Mr. Ling!
-Sit down.

269
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,960
-Mr. Ling!
-Sit.

270
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
-Don't be so formal.
-Sit.

271
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Sit.

272
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,600
I just came by to visit the crew

273
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
and Mumu.

274
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
By the way, I brought a gift.

275
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Gift?

276
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,840
-How generous, Mr. Ling!
-Red wine!

277
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
-It's not much.
-Awesome!

278
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,160
I also have to thank everybody
for looking after Mumu.

279
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,080
Why are you here?

280
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,400
You even made such a big show

281
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
-by bringing gifts.
-This is great.

282
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
Are you the only one
who gets to give gifts?

283
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,680
-Can't I give you one?
-Look at how sweet they are.

284
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,040
By the way,
Mumu said she had a gift for me.

285
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
-They are so sweet.
-Mumu, where's the gift?

286
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,880
-Look.
-This is for you.

287
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
-Is that a phone case?
-It is.

288
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,320
-Couples cases.
-Matching.

289
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,200
-It's a pair.
-Yes.

290
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,720
-That's so sweet.
-Absolutely.

291
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,560
-"Muzhou"?
-Look.

292
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,320
My gosh!

293
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,840
-Too sweet.
-That's so cute!

294
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,720
If you all don't mind,
I'm going to take Mumu with me.

295
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,000
-Let's go.
-Yizhou.

296
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,880
-How about a drink first?
-Sure.

297
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,800
He can't drink. He has to drive.

298
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,840
I can have my driver drive him.

299
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
<i>He was injured. He shouldn't be drinking.</i>

300
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
I'll drink for him.

301
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,760
This is delicious.

302
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,720
Right?

303
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Are you all right?

304
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,640
-I'm fine.
-I envy them.

305
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,760
-All right.
-Let's all raise our glasses.

306
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,720
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

307
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,040
-Drink up!
-Cheers!

308
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,040
Bottoms up!

309
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,600
-It's finally a wrap.
-Yes.

310
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
-We're finally done filming.
-Right.

311
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,280
<i>Be careful.</i>

312
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
-I'm not drunk.
-I know.

313
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,920
-I'm good at drinking. Let go.
-I know you are.

314
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,800
Careful.

315
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,800
I'm not drunk.

316
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Let's sit over there.

317
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,480
-Let go of me.
-Sit down.

318
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Let go...

319
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,440
Mumu?

320
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,080
Move in with me.

321
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,240
Why should I

322
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,240
move in with you?

323
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,800
I want to protect you at all times.

324
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
Protect me?

325
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,560
Mr. Ling?

326
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,640
Are you...

327
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,640
going to kiss me?

328
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,080
We have an engagement contract.

329
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,800
You can't break the terms.

330
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,960
And Jia Fei

331
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,760
got pregnant with Wen Li's baby.

332
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,480
I mean, almost.

333
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,880
So,

334
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,600
we can't become too close.

335
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,520
Got it?

336
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,720
Well...

337
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,160
If you don't want to go home tonight,

338
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,840
you can sleep in my room.

339
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
I'll sleep...

340
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,320
I'll sleep in the guest room.

341
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,160
The guest room.

342
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,320
-I'll sleep...
-Mumu.

343
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,640
The guest room.

344
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,760
<i>Mumu, are you up yet?</i>

345
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
Mumu?

346
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,600
Move in with me.

347
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,960
Are you going to kiss me?

348
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,400
We can't become too close.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,960
This is bad.

350
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,800
What have I done?

351
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,200
<i>I'm up.</i>

352
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
<i>Have you thought about
what I asked you yesterday?</i>

353
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,680
<i>Yesterday?</i>

354
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,200
What?

355
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,400
Mr. Ling asked you to live with him?

356
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
I've been a bit slow on the uptake lately.

357
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,680
Give me a minute.

358
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,520
As a screenwriter,
I'm obligated to tell you

359
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,920
what is bound to happen
after you move in with him.

360
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
What?

361
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,560
After you move in together,

362
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,760
both of you will reveal your true selves

363
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,920
and see a side of the other person

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,360
that you wouldn't normally see.

365
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
At the same time,

366
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,320
you'll gain a deeper understanding
of each other.

367
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,120
Finally, from a certain birthmark
or distinguishing feature,

368
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,680
you'll realize that

369
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
you two are actually long-lost siblings!

370
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,920
My goodness.

371
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,000
Can you be more helpful?

372
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,160
Well, after you two move in together,

373
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,240
you'll be spending time
with each other day and night.

374
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,000
First, on a material level.

375
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,520
You'll learn more
about each other's preferences.

376
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
Next, on a mental level.

377
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,880
You'll know each other better.

378
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,560
In the process of doing so,
you understand yourself even better.

379
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
-I see.
-Lastly

380
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
and most importantly

381
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,040
is the physical level.

382
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
By living together,
you'll be at each other's side

383
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,960
find perfect harmony,
feel the sparks of passion

384
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,560
-and enjoy carnal intimacy!
-Stop!

385
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,240
Can you stop making it sound so sensual?

386
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,160
The viewers like it.

387
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Let's get back on topic.

388
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,280
Why are you rejecting Mr. Ling?

389
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,960
He's handsome, comes from a good family
and devoted to you.

390
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,120
Isn't he the perfect husband?

391
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,560
Why are you rejecting him?

392
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
The perfect husband?

393
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,840
And...

394
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,360
You should spice up your lingerie.

395
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,240
What's up?

396
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,160
The contract has been signed.
There are no issues.

397
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,760
The first meeting you're holding
is scheduled for 2 p.m. tomorrow.

398
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Due to work conflicts, two board members
will join via video conference.

399
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
Okay, I understand.

400
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,840
One more thing.

401
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,840
Don't let the board know
about the contract with Risheng yet.

402
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Yes, Boss.

403
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,040
One more thing.

404
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,400
I heard...

405
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,200
something happened
between you and Ms. Jia.

406
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,040
You know about that, Boss?

407
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
It's okay.

408
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Remember, safety first.

409
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,360
Use protection.

410
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,800
Okay.

411
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,400
<i>The first meeting you're holding
is scheduled for 2 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

412
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,440
<i>Due to work conflicts, two board members
will join via video conference.</i>

413
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
<i>Okay, I understand.</i>

414
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
<i>One more thing.</i>

415
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,280
<i>Don't let the board know
about the contract with Risheng yet.</i>

416
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Mr. Fu, don't tell me
it's a coincidence that you're here too.

417
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,120
I came to see you, Ms. Jiang.

418
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,360
Why is an attorney
acting like a paparazzo?

419
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,760
Are you following me?

420
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,000
You're funny, Ms. Jiang.

421
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,080
This document is likely
very important to you.

422
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
Take a look.

423
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
INVESTIGATION REVEALS

424
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,680
LOCAL THUGS INVOLVED IN A HIT-AND-RUN

425
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,000
A CAR ACCIDENT OCCURRED

426
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
IN BINYI DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF GANGDONG

427
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
I'm sure you didn't just show me this

428
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,480
to tell me the truth about what happened.

429
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,760
You're a very smart lady.

430
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,200
What do you want me to do?

431
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,920
I hope you'll help me deliver this gift.

432
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,560
NING LAN

433
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,440
SURVIVING SON, FU WEINING,
LAID TO REST ON JULY 5, 2017

434
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,080
Hello?

435
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,920
<i>Weining?</i>

436
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,160
<i>Your mom passed away peacefully,</i>

437
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,120
<i>but she kept talking about you.</i>

438
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,960
<i>Weining, come home.</i>

439
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,960
<i>Pay your last respects.</i>

440
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,160
<i>Mom.</i>

441
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
<i>The kitchen was so hot
on the day you passed away.</i>

442
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,280
<i> I miss you.</i>

443
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,160
<i>I've accomplished everything
that I promised you.</i>

444
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,320
<i>It's a few years later
than I had planned though.</i>

445
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,680
<i>I wish you were here.</i>

446
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,480
<i>Mom, I'm leaving now.</i>

447
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,320
<i>I'll bring good news
the next time I visit.</i>

448
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,080
Let's see how he'll explain this time.

449
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,280
-Hello, everybody.
-There he is.

450
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,360
I called this meeting today
for two reasons.

451
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,280
The first reason is to put an end
to what happened a while ago.

452
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,920
-What's going on?
-What you are about to receive

453
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,760
is an investigation report on complaints

454
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,400
of my alleged misconduct.

455
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,400
The second document

456
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,880
is a contract with a foreign entity
for additional investment.

457
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,000
An internal audit confirmed that I did not
engage in any illicit competition.

458
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,960
Someone else
will report the details in a bit.

459
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,160
I have begun to gather evidence

460
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,240
for a legal case against the person
who accused and maligned me.

461
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
In that case,

462
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,400
can you explain

463
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,680
why you signed
an acquisition agreement with Risheng

464
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,440
without first getting a vote
by the Board of Directors?

465
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,520
-Exactly.
-This is a serious decision.

466
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't board members have a right to know?

467
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
-Yes.
-Agreed.

468
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,520
If I hadn't been tipped off,

469
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,600
I would have been kept in the dark
like the rest of you.

470
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,600
-Is that true?
-This isn't right.

471
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,400
While the Internal Audit Department

472
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,680
has been investigating
Mr. Ling's misconduct,

473
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,040
someone discovered

474
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,880
that Mr. Ling had already signed

475
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,520
an agreement to acquire Risheng Retail.

476
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,000
-What?
-There's more.

477
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,080
This deal exceeds ten billion yuan!

478
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,960
-Ten billion?
-That's an enormous sum!

479
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Mr. Ling's arbitrary decision

480
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,560
not only violates company policy,

481
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,480
but will also cause monumental losses

482
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,280
for us and the company!

483
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,200
-You're right.
-Mr. Ling.

484
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,400
How do you explain this?

485
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,960
I gathered all of you here today
to hear your opinions.

486
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,040
You already made your decision
and signed the contract.

487
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,840
Now you're asking for our opinions?

488
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,680
-That's right.
-Isn't it too late?

489
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,800
It has already been done.

490
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,920
Please do not worry.

491
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,840
The acquisition of Risheng Retail
was always part of our annual plan.

492
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,880
That's still not a reason for you
to sign the contract on your own!

493
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,520
Mr. Jin, where did you receive the intel
that the deal has been closed?

494
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,400
You shouldn't have done it
if you didn't want anyone to know.

495
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,960
It won't be difficult to prove it.

496
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,840
All contracts have to pass through
our Legal Department.

497
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,480
-That's right.
-Call in someone from Legal.

498
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,440
-We'll know then.
-Right.

499
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,880
-That won't be necessary.
-Yes.

500
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,120
I came prepared.

501
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,000
Flip to page five of the document
in front of you.

502
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,840
What you're seeing

503
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,040
is the motion for a cash acquisition

504
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,160
for 78 percent of Risheng's shares.

505
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,800
Mr. Jin's claim that
the deal has been closed

506
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,840
is merely hearsay.

507
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,760
I believe you are all aware

508
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,040
that we have strong competition
this time around.

509
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,000
That is why I began negotiations
with the target company in advance.

510
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,720
They have confidence
in Lingshi Group's integration capability

511
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,720
and have provided a nice valuation.

512
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,920
We just need a board vote

513
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,360
to complete the acquisition.

514
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,480
The process does not violate any policies.

515
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,880
Is that clear, Mr. Jin?

516
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,440
This...

517
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
This can't be.

518
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
I told you it was nothing.

519
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,080
Mr. Ling wouldn't act
against the interests of the company.

520
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,120
-Yes.
-Thank you for your trust in me.

521
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,320
I also hope that you will all continue

522
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,800
to support and believe in
Lingshi Group's development.

523
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
If anybody wishes
to strike out on their own,

524
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,120
I will not force them to stay.

525
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,400
Right, Mr. Jin?

526
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,600
All right,

527
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,920
today's meeting is adjourned.

528
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,280
We will conduct a vote next time.

529
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,800
How do you explain this?

530
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,400
Didn't you tell me that
the source of intel could be trusted?

531
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,639
It is.

532
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,400
However, you were the one to verify
the contents of this contract.

533
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
You were too impatient.

534
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,480
Ling Yizhou is very cunning.

535
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm impatient?

536
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,159
If I'm not,
how can I take down Ling Yizhou?

537
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,480
Our collaboration ends here.

538
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,320
Mr. Jin!

539
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm warning you.

540
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,400
Don't think about trying anything
behind my back.

541
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,480
I have dirt on you.

542
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,720
It's so hot.

543
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,320
An iced drink sounds nice.

544
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,960
LINGSHI GROUP

545
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,400
Boss, here's your coffee.

546
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,640
MUZHOU

547
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,080
You don't want coffee today?
I'll get tea for you.

548
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,360
Come back here.

549
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,640
"Muzhou"?

550
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,960
Boss, when did you get a new phone case?

551
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
Mumu gave it to me.

552
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,920
Ms. Xia has great taste.

553
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
Obviously.

554
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,080
Don't you think the two figures here
look like me and Mumu?

555
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,360
Let me see.

556
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,120
I think they do.

557
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,880
Was this drawn by hand?

558
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,400
It's nicely done.

559
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,120
Look, it fits my phone.

560
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,880
There are only two.
One for Mumu, one for me.

561
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Are you trying to take it?

562
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,800
You can keep it.

563
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
You won't give me a raise either.

564
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,520
The artist is quite talented.

565
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,680
It's nicely done.

566
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,880
Very talented.

567
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,760
Wen Li, how is the sales performance
for our department stores this quarter?

568
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,880
Promotions attracted many customers
who aren't members.

569
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,320
When do you think we should begin
promoting sales for the next quarter?

570
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,800
I arranged next season's sales
to begin on the 16th of next month.

571
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Boss, Mr. Jin has tendered
his resignation.

572
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,840
A wise course of action.

573
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,280
Get rid of this.

574
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,600
Okay.

575
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,000
Without the help of this bug
in the phone case,

576
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,320
we would've needed
several different contingency plans.

577
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,520
This won't be as simple as we think.

578
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,680
That's why we have another priority
at the moment.

579
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Yes, Boss.

580
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,280
<i>Let's get back on topic.</i>

581
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,080
<i>Why are you rejecting Mr. Ling?</i>

582
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,920
He's handsome, comes from a good family
and devoted to you.

583
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,680
Isn't he the perfect husband?

584
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,320
Why are you rejecting him?

585
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,080
What's the matter?

586
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,040
I'll forgive you this time.

587
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,520
You're not allowed to go
with anybody else next time.

588
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Got it?

589
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,640
The perfect husband?

590
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,880
How perfect is he?

591
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,840
I will not

592
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,520
be swayed by Ling Yizhou's charms.

593
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,720
Coming.

594
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,840
-What are you doing here?
-I'm picking you up.

595
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,920
Didn't you agree to move in with me?

596
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
When did I say that?

597
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,520
After what we've done,

598
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,480
aren't you going to take responsibility?

599
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,880
There are so many who would do that.

600
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Why do you need me?

601
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,120
You're different.

602
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,000
No way. We were photographed last time.

603
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,400
What if I get photographed again
moving in with you?

604
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,960
You don't have to worry about that.

605
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
You and Boss are engaged.

606
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,000
Even if you're photographed,
Muzhou fans will lap it up.

607
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,360
So your argument is moot.

608
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,280
I have a lot of things.

609
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,760
Moving back and forth will be a hassle.

610
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,360
Besides, you live so far from my office.

611
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,080
This is a valid argument, isn't it?

612
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
Yes.

613
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,560
You're right, Mumu.

614
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,040
All right, I understand.

615
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,920
You...

616
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,920
I didn't say you could come in!
What are you doing?

617
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,880
You're really going to stay here?

618
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
-You...
-Since it's inconvenient for you to move,

619
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,520
I'll move here.

620
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,640
This saves you the trouble of packing.

621
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,280
You won't have to adjust
to a new environment

622
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,760
and this place is close to your office.

623
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,080
You...

624
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,800
You had it all planned out.

625
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,040
You're right, Mumu.

626
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I do have plans for you.

627
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,680
It'll be inconvenient
for you to live here.

628
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,400
Are you worried about me?

629
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,800
-Any examples?
-Your lifestyle habits.

630
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,480
You don't need to worry about that.

631
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,000
Boss can adapt easily.

632
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,320
This place is far from your office.

633
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,680
Don't worry about that either.

634
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,680
I will be driving him to work every day.

635
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,760
Pidan lives here. Isn't he afraid of dogs?

636
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,760
That's--

637
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,120
I know.

638
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,040
Pidan and I are great friends now.

639
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,360
Right, Pidan?

640
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,040
You traitor.

641
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,760
Boss, since you're moving in today,

642
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,360
should we invite Ms. Jia
for a housewarming party?

643
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,360
What do you think, Mumu?

644
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,360
Get out!

645
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Let's begin the meeting.

646
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,280
I can't believe it.

647
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,960
What's wrong?

648
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,000
Where's the steering wheel?

649
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,520
Have you seen my steering wheel?

650
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,240
Where's your steering wheel?

651
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,560
I need to drive home.

652
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,000
I need the steering wheel to do that.

653
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,720
-Where's my steering wheel?
-The wheel is right in front of you.

654
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,160
Just reach out.

655
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,640
Do you see it? It's right in front of you.

656
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,360
-Yes, right there.
-Here it is.
