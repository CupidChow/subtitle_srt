1
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,800
Black will always be a classic
on the red carpet.

2
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,960
The material of this dress
can show off your slim waist.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,040
The tailoring is perfect.

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,800
You clearly have your motives.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
I do.

6
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,120
I want everyone to know

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
we're married.

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
Who are you?

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,560
Hello, ma'am.

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,960
I was Yao Liang's classmate.

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
My name is Xia Lin.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,320
So you're the tramp
who left my son for money.

13
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
Hello, Ms. Jiang?

14
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
What did you call me for?

15
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>It's nothing.</i>

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,360
There have been so many negative comments
on your social media page.

17
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
Do you want to disable
the comments for a while?

18
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't bother.

19
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,520
We can't shut them up
even if we disable the comments.

20
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,960
<i>All right. You shouldn't go online
for the time being.</i>

21
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
There are a bunch of trolls online.

22
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want them to affect your mood.

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
I know.

24
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,040
I won't be going online.

25
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,320
I'll try not to be bothered by it.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,280
<i>Good.</i>

27
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,560
How are you and Ling Yizhou?

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,680
<i>What does he plan on doing?</i>

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,640
I realized

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,600
there are a lot of things I don't know,

31
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,320
so I'm really confused right now.

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,640
I want some time alone.

33
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,240
Okay, take a few days to rest up

34
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,040
and recalibrate your mind.

35
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll cover for you at work

36
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,520
<i>and I'll handle everything else.</i>

37
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,520
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Jiang.

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
MUZHOU

39
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,640
<i>But I did all that</i>

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
because I love you.

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,320
So your love for me
makes it okay to hurt an innocent person?

42
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,080
Mumu, do you also think
I'm involved in Yao Liang's accident?

43
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,480
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,680
It came up so suddenly.

45
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,360
Someone is deliberately linking
these two matters together.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,279
<i>I wanted to wait until everything
was resolved before telling you.</i>

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,680
<i>I was afraid you would misunderstand.</i>

48
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,120
Ling Yizhou.

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
Can I still trust you?

50
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
WRITE A POST

51
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,760
UPLOAD POST

52
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,840
-Hello?
<i>-Boss, have you gone to bed yet?</i>

53
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
Not yet. What is it?

54
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
<i>I just received news that</i>

55
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
<i>Ms. Xia posted on Weibo
that you two broke up.</i>

56
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,880
What did you say?

57
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,800
<i>Do you and Ms. Xia have
specific intentions behind this?</i>

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,120
<i>The PR team asks
if we need to make a reply right away.</i>

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,280
I have a lot on my mind right now.

60
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
I need some time alone.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
Mumu!

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
No.

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't reply.

64
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
<i>Okay.</i>

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,960
We have broken up after growing apart
due to our hectic work schedules.

66
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
We hope you will all give us some privacy.
Thank you for your concern.

67
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,320
Sir, do you need anything to eat?

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,400
All right. Get some rest soon.

69
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,600
BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY

70
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,720
A PHOTO SHOOT WHERE YOU WANT IT

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,760
Any feedback is welcome.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,440
We were in the tourism business
in the past,

73
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,680
but we couldn't compete
with bigger brands in the market.

74
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Your combination of travel and photography

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
can only be considered
an innovation in delivery.

76
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
Can you guarantee
it can be competitive in the market?

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Photo shoot tours
place more emphasis on photography.

78
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
Furthermore,

79
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,280
travel is now a necessary commodity
among the younger generation.

80
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,720
On the whole, they travel
at least once or twice a year.

81
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Most young people

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,320
travel for leisure and adventure.

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,200
These are worth capturing on film.

84
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,680
Compared with
all the usual indoor photo shoots,

85
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
shooting while having fun
offers more freedom and personalization.

86
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,960
This is more in line with
young people's view on photography.

87
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,800
Take photos while having fun.

88
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,840
But we have no experience in photography.

89
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,920
Moreover, these two industries
have very small markets.

90
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,280
As far as I know, to this day,

91
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,280
nobody has been able to become
a nationwide brand.

92
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,880
That also happens to be
the advantage of vacation photo shoots.

93
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
The flexibility of photo shoot tours

94
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,000
can fill in this gap

95
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,000
and go on to spread
across the entire country.

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Moreover,

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,400
there will also be a demand
for high quality in smaller cities.

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,360
The flexibility of vacation photo shoots

99
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,800
can allow surrounding small cities
to enjoy superior service as well.

100
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
That is a good idea.

101
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,000
But you also mentioned

102
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,040
that everything is done online.

103
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,920
Wouldn't that be too risky?

104
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,400
After all, the majority of consumers

105
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,480
prefer something
that they can see in person.

106
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,840
Nearly all traditional industries

107
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,640
are looking for ways to integrate
the Internet into their business.

108
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,679
Moreover, our main consumer group
will be young people.

109
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,120
Everything from making inquiries
to ordering is done online.

110
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,840
This not only decreases costs
for both parties,

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,480
but it is also the preferred method
for young people.

112
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,160
E-commerce only covers ordering.

113
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
What's crucial will be offline operations.

114
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,360
What makes you stand out in this aspect?

115
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,640
You're right.

116
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,280
We will still need
brick-and-mortar stores.

117
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,160
We can locate these stores
in smaller tourist cities.

118
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,120
We will see a lot of foot traffic

119
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,880
and the cost of rent
will also be a bargain.

120
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
Now on to quality.

121
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,880
I have many resources and connections
in the entertainment industry.

122
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
First-rate photographers

123
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,920
and top makeup artists and stylists

124
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
will give customers
an outstanding experience.

125
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,840
In addition,

126
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,240
I'm planning on hiring
a celebrity spokesperson

127
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
to boost our credibility.

128
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
Don't we already have you?

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
Well...

130
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,240
We can think about it
once this proposal is approved.

131
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,960
All right. I have no more questions.

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,080
Mr. Chu is a promising young man
with a bright future.

133
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,600
Very well.

134
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
Bojue Photography

135
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,320
is officially launched.

136
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,080
Hey, Yizhou. Congratulate me.

137
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,560
The board approved my proposal.

138
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,400
Congratulations.

139
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
<i>Are you free this afternoon?</i>

140
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,640
<i>I want to talk to you about something.</i>

141
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,520
Sure, let's meet at the usual place.

142
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
By the way, you and Xia Lin...

143
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,160
There are some misunderstandings
between us.

144
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,560
It's complicated.

145
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,520
I can't explain.

146
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
I don't know how I can help.

147
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,480
But if there's a misunderstanding,
it needs to be addressed.

148
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,720
<i>Neither you or Xia Lin
are impulsive people.</i>

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
<i>The number you dialed is turned off.</i>

150
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
XIA LIN

151
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,160
We have broken up after growing apart
due to our hectic work schedules.

152
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
We hope you will all give us some privacy.
Thank you for your concern.

153
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,320
MUZHOU

154
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
MUZHOU

155
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,480
<i>Am I heavy?</i>

156
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Far too heavy!

157
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
Because at this very moment,

158
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm carrying my whole world.

159
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,200
Yizhou?

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,720
Yizhou?

161
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,920
Are you ready, Grandma?

162
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,040
Let's go home.

163
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Are you okay?

164
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,240
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

165
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
<i>Yes.</i>

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,960
Grandma, have a seat.

167
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,240
I'll get some water for you.

168
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,400
Okay.

169
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
Yizhou?

170
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
Why didn't Mumu come today?

171
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Grandma.

172
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
Mumu is busy filming

173
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,360
and said she'll visit you
when she has time.

174
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,000
Yizhou.

175
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,160
I've been through it all before.

176
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm guessing the two of you had a fight.

177
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,600
No.

178
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,960
Of course,

179
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,080
for two people who are in love,

180
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,640
fighting can sometimes
bring them closer together.

181
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,480
However, in moments of anger,

182
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,440
it's easy to say hurtful things.

183
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,160
So, love and marriage
must be carefully managed.

184
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,840
I understand, Grandma.

185
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
<i>You've kept too many things from me.</i>

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,840
<i>I can trust you unconditionally</i>

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,360
but you've lied to me again and again.

188
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,240
My trust can be destroyed.

189
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,200
I really don't know
if I can still trust you!

190
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,080
<i>What if she no longer trusts me?</i>

191
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,160
Xia Lin?

192
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,320
Linlin?

193
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,120
Why haven't you answered my calls?

194
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,040
I've been so worried.

195
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,640
I turned off my phone.

196
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,560
I want some peace and quiet.

197
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,200
Sorry to make you worry.

198
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,400
It's okay if you need some time alone,

199
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,520
but why did you break up with Mr. Ling?

200
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Are you serious about that?

201
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,240
We haven't broken up yet.

202
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,760
I just

203
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,400
need some time to myself.

204
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,640
Is that what your post on Weibo meant?

205
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,400
Weibo?

206
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,000
You seem to be doing well.

207
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,360
If you have time, pay off your debts.

208
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,360
Okay.

209
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,840
I could've won it all back last time
but lost my winning streak in the end.

210
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,320
Can you give me two more days?

211
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,800
No more than that.

212
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
It's so hot here.

213
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
We don't want to keep coming back here.

214
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm so sorry.

215
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
Thank you for making the trip.

216
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,920
I'll definitely pay you in two days.

217
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,880
If you don't pay then,

218
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,240
we'll get rid of you and your collateral!

219
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,680
You better watch it.

220
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,120
SCAPEGOAT, IMPORTANT RECORDING

221
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,160
I'll have to squeeze more money
out of this.

222
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,040
Am I interpreting it incorrectly?

223
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,839
You wrote that you two broke up.

224
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,680
I didn't post this.

225
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,240
You didn't?

226
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,680
Was your account hacked?

227
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,960
There's one other possibility.

228
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,240
What do you want?

229
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,080
It's me. I came here a few months ago.

230
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,080
Your boss, Mr. Jin,
personally welcomed me.

231
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,640
-Move it.
-So it's you?

232
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,320
Are you after more money?

233
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,760
Mr. Jin gave orders that

234
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
if you show up again,

235
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
we are to break your legs.

236
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,400
From a security guard like you? Move!

237
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,000
The person you're looking for isn't here.

238
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,040
-Leave!
-You...

239
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,960
Leave already.

240
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Fine, I'll go.

241
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
Hello, Ms. Jiang?

242
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,280
Did you upload that post?

243
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Yes, it was me.

244
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,280
But it was a team decision.

245
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
How could you decide for me?

246
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,720
This is a personal matter
between me and Ling Yizhou.

247
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,920
<i>Xia Lin, I know you won't be able
to harden your heart to break up with him.</i>

248
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,800
<i>From what I know about you,</i>

249
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,920
you and Ling Yizhou
must be having problems.

250
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,680
But you won't accept it
so you're still clinging on.

251
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,040
This is detrimental
to you and your career.

252
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
It would be better
to cut things off quickly.

253
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
My personal life and work are separate.

254
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,280
I respect your advice at work,

255
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
but I make my own decisions
in my personal life.

256
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Xia Lin, you're not alone.

257
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,760
Do you know how much the team behind you
has been impacted

258
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
because of the news about Ling Yizhou?

259
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,200
I apologize to have caused the team
so much trouble.

260
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,960
I will do my best at work
but this is non-negotiable.

261
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,840
I won't allow this to happen.

262
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
You cannot meddle in my personal life
with such disregard for boundaries.

263
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,600
I apologize.

264
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Sorry, Xia Lin.

265
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
I did not consider your feelings,

266
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,480
but I hope you can understand

267
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,680
<i>that I did all this for your future.</i>

268
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,960
I'll delete the account, okay?

269
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,760
I'll do it right away
and handle the fallout.

270
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
What are you going to do?

271
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
I'll have to announce
that your account was hacked

272
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,320
and you were asleep at the time.

273
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,760
So you weren't aware of this.

274
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,920
Okay.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Don't do something like this again.

276
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,640
Your team crossed the line.

277
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,160
How could they post this
without your approval?

278
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
The comments are saying that

279
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,880
you're distancing yourself
from Ling Yizhou as soon as things go bad.

280
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,400
I didn't expect it either.

281
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,680
I woke up

282
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,040
to find that we've broken up.

283
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,160
That's right.

284
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,160
Since you're not ready to break up,

285
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,720
shouldn't you explain it to Mr. Ling?

286
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,680
Boss.

287
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,000
-Hand it over to our legal team.
-Okay.

288
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,560
Let's go.

289
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,920
He turned his phone off.

290
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
Forget it.

291
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
There's a statement online.

292
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,520
He'll probably see it.

293
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,920
The situation is complicated enough.

294
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
There's no way to explain it.

295
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
I think that

296
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,480
since Mr. Ling already admitted
that he had a crush on you,

297
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,680
then he has nothing more to hide.

298
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Besides,

299
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
you and Yao Liang
weren't in a relationship.

300
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,880
Mr. Ling wouldn't have been crazy enough
to commit murder.

301
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,840
He's very self-disciplined.

302
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,760
He would never drink and drive.

303
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,920
I don't think he's a suspect.

304
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
I did a lot of thinking last night.

305
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,760
I came to understand one thing.

306
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,960
What I can be certain of
is that Ling Yizhou didn't do this.

307
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,320
I just can't figure out
why he deceived me.

308
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,560
After finding the data on me and the mask,

309
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,560
I realized that

310
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,360
we met a long time ago

311
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,440
and he had fallen for me back then.

312
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,640
It just so happens
that Yao Liang was also at the bar.

313
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,200
There has been too much on my mind lately.

314
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,800
I didn't know how to react.

315
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,520
I just wanted some time alone.

316
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,080
I didn't plan on breaking up with him.

317
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
I told you my idol is innocent.

318
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,280
It's Mr. Jin's doing.

319
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,720
Xia Lin must be beating herself up

320
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,080
<i>for breaking up with him over this.</i>

321
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,520
<i>-Wasn't her account hacked?
-You believe that?</i>

322
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,880
<i>She must have deleted it
because of all the hateful comments.</i>

323
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,880
LINGSHI GROUP'S ATTORNEYS
POST AUDIO RECORDING

324
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,760
PROVING LING YIZHOU DID NOT
INVOLVED IN CAR ACCIDENT

325
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
So it seems

326
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,840
Mr. Ling had nothing to do
with Yao Liang's car accident.

327
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,080
What a terrible injustice.

328
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,720
He probably wanted to find evidence
and fix the problem on his own.

329
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,360
It must be a terrible feeling
to be suspected by his loved one.

330
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
EVIDENCE HAS BEEN REVEALED

331
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,480
IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES
UNTIL SOMEONE GETS HURT

332
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
Is that how you see me?

333
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,560
Mumu.

334
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,880
Answer me.

335
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,600
<i>Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.</i>

336
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,480
Jia Fei, let's go and see him.

337
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,400
Ms. Xia!

338
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,960
Our boss really isn't here.

339
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Where is he?

340
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
I'm not sure.

341
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,280
He just left.

342
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
All right, thank you.

343
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
-Thank you.
-You can leave now.

344
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll ask Wen Li.

345
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,760
Feifei, Ms. Xia, why are you two here?

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,520
I want to ask you something.

347
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,760
Don't be scared.

348
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,280
Come on.

349
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,560
Go. Hurry.

350
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320
Hurry up!

351
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,360
Ling Yizhou!

352
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm not the one

353
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
who uploaded the breakup post.

354
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,840
I don't have such intentions.

355
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,080
It doesn't matter
if you were the one who posted it.

356
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,560
What matters is that you said
you wanted time apart.

357
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,840
So let's give each other some space.

358
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,280
No.

359
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,120
There was too much to process at the time.

360
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,360
I didn't know that we met much earlier.

361
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
I felt as if I was kept in the dark
about so many things.

362
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,400
I didn't know how to react.

363
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,320
I came to apologize.

364
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,720
I shouldn't have questioned
your character.

365
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Okay, I understand.

366
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
Ling Yizhou!

367
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,680
Stupid!

368
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,840
Idiot.

369
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,320
Sorry, I'm not talking about you.

370
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,840
Miss, can you help me take a photo?

371
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,320
Just one. Thank you.

372
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Okay.

373
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,960
Turn around.

374
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Can you turn around?

375
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,440
What are you doing here?

376
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
My friend is helping me take a picture.

377
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,120
What a coincidence.

378
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,520
Are you here for business?

379
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,120
Why don't we go to eat after you're done?

380
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,760
I don't know how long
my meeting will last.

381
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,320
Sorry. Maybe next time.

382
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,920
Do you like Chu Yan?

383
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,640
Feifei, I think Ling Yizhou
is really angry this time.

384
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,600
What should I do?

385
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
So what?

386
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,680
-Just win him back.
-How?

387
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,360
He's ignoring me.

388
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,640
You two are in the same boat.

389
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,720
By the way,

390
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,480
my name is Ruan Meng,
but you can call me Xiaoyou.

391
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
-Ruan Meng?
-Xiaoyou?

392
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,920
-I see.
-I see.

393
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,600
You're pursuing Chu Yan?

394
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,480
Not really.

395
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,680
I just want to see him all the time.

396
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,680
Look at you two.

397
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
Don't call yourselves modern women.

398
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,800
The female characters in my script
are more admirable.

399
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,560
If you're so amazing, give us some ideas.

400
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I've written so many love stories.

401
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,760
This is a piece of cake.

402
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,760
The three of us will form an alliance

403
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,720
called the Alliance in Pursuit of Love.

404
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,520
-Alliance in Pursuit of Love?
-Alliance in Pursuit of Love?

405
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,680
Yes, and as your trusted adviser,

406
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,600
I guarantee you'll reach your goals
in no time at all.

407
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,760
If you want true love,

408
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,080
you'll have to go step by step.

409
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,960
The first step
is to know the enemy in order to win.

410
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,960
Do you think you know the person you like?

411
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,720
You don't know him at all.

412
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,760
Or you might only know
a little bit about him.

413
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
At this point,

414
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,040
we need a spy.

415
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
King Bomb!

416
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,600
I won again!

417
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,160
I'm so sorry.

418
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,360
Tape the paper on yourselves.

419
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Feifei, how come you asked me to come over
to play cards?

420
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,320
I know!

421
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,560
You must think I work too hard, don't you?

422
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,080
You wanted me to come out
and have some fun, right?

423
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,280
-I must be right.
-Wen Li.

424
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,520
I have something important to tell you.

425
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,280
What could be
more important than the game?

426
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,840
Let's talk after we're done.

427
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,120
Mr. Wen?

428
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,520
Do you know
what Ling Yizhou has been doing lately?

429
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,160
I follow a code of professional ethics.

430
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,680
You can't even tell me?

431
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,960
I am loyal only to my boss.

432
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,200
Wait!

433
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Hello, my name is Ruan Meng.

434
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,320
Hi.

435
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,400
So...

436
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
I want to ask...

437
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I want...

438
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,560
-Let's talk after we finish playing.
-I...

439
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,240
You...

440
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
You...

441
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
You...

442
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,040
-You...
-Enough.

443
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Get down.

444
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
You're embarrassing.

445
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,280
You two are idiots.

446
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,880
Wen Li.

447
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,240
Who did you say you're loyal to?

448
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,560
Aren't you missing someone?

449
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
I am loyal to my boss at work,

450
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,960
but in love,

451
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,440
I am loyal to you.

452
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,400
Do you know what is most important
between lovers?

453
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,200
It's trust!

454
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,960
I have a lot of trust in you.

455
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,600
You should have trust in me too, right?

456
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,200
Yes.

457
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,480
Wen Li, make a peace sign.

458
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,760
A photo?

459
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Linlin.

460
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,880
Wait, you guys!

461
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,280
You can't team up on me like this.

462
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,160
I'm sure you'll do a good job as our spy.

463
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,760
You'll supply us with reliable intel.

464
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,840
Boss doesn't seem hurt on the surface

465
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,080
but he is just using work
to distract himself.

466
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,880
I've noticed that
he has been absent-minded during meetings.

467
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
This is a good sign.

468
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,920
It means that
Ling Yizhou still cares about you.

469
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,080
Chances of success are high
if you act now to win him back.

470
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,280
What about Chu Yan?

471
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,240
Tell me about Chu Yan.

472
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,000
I haven't had much contact
with Chu Yan lately.

473
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,640
It's okay.

474
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,640
He's easier to figure out
than Ling Yizhou.

475
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,360
I'll find out more for you.

476
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,360
Okay!

477
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,320
After doing our homework,
comes the second step.

478
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
Create a chance encounter.

479
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,480
That sounds cliché, but it works

480
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,960
because every person believes in fate.

481
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,760
Extra credit points
if you manage to get body contact.

482
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,000
Body contact...

483
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,200
I'm an expert
at creating chance encounters.

484
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,320
Look.

485
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,200
Chu Yan and I don't have
any social connections,

486
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,840
so I have to rely on chance encounters.

487
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,360
Even if I don't get to see him,
I'll create chances to bump into him.

488
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,000
Your awareness and proactive approach
are excellent.

489
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,760
What about you, Linlin?

490
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,800
I have a thick skin for this,

491
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,840
but there's nothing I can do
if he doesn't want to see me.

492
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,600
So what?

493
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,440
Don't we have someone on the inside?

494
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,120
I...

495
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,320
Can I make a tiny request?

496
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
-Go ahead.
-Go ahead.

497
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Can we pretend that I was never here?

498
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,600
We didn't see you today.

499
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,760
I'll delete it.

500
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Bye!

501
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
As if!

502
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
What is wrong with you?

503
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,240
Were you playing me for a fool?

504
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,560
You fell for Ling Yizhou's trap again.

505
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,120
The recording is now public.

506
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,280
Are you telling me it's fake?

507
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,240
Can't evidence be fabricated?

508
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,440
And is Lingshi Group not related at all
to the car accident?

509
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,440
He pushed all the blame onto Mr. Jin
because Mr. Jin is no match for him.

510
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,920
Isn't it obvious?

511
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
You're right.

512
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,280
Ling Yizhou would certainly come up
with a way to escape blame.

513
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,320
No matter how you slice it,

514
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,280
they ruined Yao Liang's life.

515
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,520
That's right.

516
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,080
Ling Yizhou has hurt a lot of people.

517
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Aren't you hot?

518
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,680
Lower the temperature.

519
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,320
BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY

520
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,120
I think the overall result is pretty good.

521
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,280
What do you think?

522
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,600
The background is how I want it

523
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,320
but these outfits don't seem
to match me or the scenery.

524
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,960
Can we try on other outfits?

525
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,680
Miss, these were the outfits
you chose during your fitting.

526
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,840
But I'm not satisfied with the photos.

527
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,120
Besides, the look would be different
out here compared to in a room.

528
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,000
Miss, we confirmed these outfits
in advance.

529
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,080
I'm afraid you can't request
more outfits now.

530
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,600
What do you mean by that?
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?

531
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,239
I'm sorry for being late!

532
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,560
There was traffic.

533
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,159
I am one of the stylists.

534
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,199
I was supposed to be
in charge of styling the bride.

535
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,800
Why don't I help you with a new look?

536
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,520
Let's go.

537
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,800
All right.

538
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,000
This is a traditional dress.

539
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,560
It fits in nicely with the local scenery.

540
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,040
-We're in an ancient town.
-It's not bad.

541
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,239
This costume looks luxurious and grand.

542
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,159
You can try this one too.

543
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,520
It's a bit simpler,

544
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,920
but it'll showcase your figure.

545
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
-It's okay.
-Not bad.

546
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,040
-The scenery is beautiful.
-Mr. Chu.

547
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Ms. Ruan, thank you so much.

548
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
We're very pleased
with today's photo session.

549
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Mr. Chu, you chose an excellent stylist.

550
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm glad you're satisfied.

551
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,600
Bojue Photography's goal

552
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,640
is for customers to be left
with lasting memories

553
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
while traveling and taking photos.

554
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Honey, I think we could
consider other styles

555
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,280
and have a few more photo sessions
with Bojue Photography.

556
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,640
That would be wonderful.

557
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,560
-Liu?
-Coming.

558
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,840
They are interested in more photo shoots.

559
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,840
You can discuss the details with them.

560
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,520
Okay. Sir, please come this way.

561
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,280
-Watch your step.
-We'll be going first.

562
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,520
You were a big help today.

563
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,200
I had no idea how to handle her.

564
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,120
It's nothing.
Women understand other women.

565
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,000
You could hire a few more female stylists

566
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,320
for a more diverse range
of opinions and perspectives.

567
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,800
That's something to consider.

568
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,040
-Let's go.
-Okay.

569
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,840
What's the matter?
Did you sprain your ankle?

570
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm fine.

571
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,200
Come, I'll help you find a seat.

572
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Feifei?

573
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,280
Is Linlin inside?

574
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,880
Is she here?

575
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
I didn't see her.

576
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,240
Smart.

577
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,680
Take a few photos for me.

578
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,160
Okay.

579
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,840
What should I do?

580
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
Ling Yizhou,

581
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,880
based on the storyline,
shouldn't you give me CPR?

582
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,040
Is that so?

583
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
I can do it for you now.

584
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,680
I really did choke on the water!
It wasn't an act!

585
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,280
Ling Yizhou!

586
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,040
Sit here and rest for a bit.

587
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm fine.

588
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,400
I'll just rest at home.

589
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,160
By the way, what were you doing here?

590
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,800
Last time,
you said you were traveling here.

591
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,800
What about this time?

592
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm here for work.

593
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,480
Last time, I discovered
how beautiful the scenery is.

594
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,680
I can take photos here
of my model wearing my clothes.

595
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Your clothes?

596
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,600
Yes, I design my own clothes.

597
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,480
People kept asking me
where I bought my clothes,

598
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,520
so I went ahead
and created my own indie brand.

599
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,800
It's gaining a lot of attention.

600
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm even getting stressed about it.

601
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,240
Right.

602
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,920
When you go out dressed like this
and people look at you differently,

603
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,440
don't you get mad?

604
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm used to it already.

605
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,960
After all, I'm not wearing these clothes
for other people.

606
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,600
If you like something,

607
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,520
you should have the courage to accept
its downsides as well.

608
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,000
I want to spread the happiness
that I get from my dresses

609
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,880
to others who also love them.

610
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,600
I hope that people
who didn't understand before

611
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,320
can learn to admire
different kinds of beauty.

612
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,400
After all, there are already
so many restrictions in life.

613
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
Why can't we wear what we want?

614
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,760
For example,
look at what I'm wearing today.

615
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,640
I knew it.
You need to treat your foot right away.

616
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,280
Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

617
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,600
Go slowly.

618
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,640
No broken bones.

619
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,360
However, it'll take time
for the swelling to go down.

620
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,960
Avoid strenuous exercise during this time.

621
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,440
Apply medication twice a day.

622
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,320
Okay.

623
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,600
Ruan Meng, wait here.

624
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,280
I'll bring the car over.

625
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Okay.

626
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,320
<i>Ladies, step two was successful.</i>

627
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,760
What are you giggling at?

628
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,120
Do you think Chu Yan has fallen for me?

629
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,680
He asked me twice about my foot.

630
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,120
He even said
he'll bring me dinner tonight.

631
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,040
Do you think I should get changed?

632
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,080
What should I wear?

633
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,360
You're a lousy adviser.

634
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,080
We used the same trick,
so why are the results so different?

635
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,200
Chu Yan is being so gentle with her

636
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,960
while Ling Yizhou is still treating me
with biting sarcasm.

637
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,840
I finally understand the saying,

638
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,880
"You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make it drink."

639
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,080
Right, Xia Lin?

640
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,520
Ruan Meng, I must commend you.

641
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,400
You're a self-taught genius.

642
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,160
Not at all.

643
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
The third step I'll teach you today

644
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,520
is making him feel
a sense of responsibility toward you.

645
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,480
The rose tamed the little prince.

646
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,280
Though there are millions of other roses
in the world,

647
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,440
you must become the only one
he cares about.

648
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
Needing his care when you're injured
is the best example.

649
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,360
Get it, Ms. Xia Lin?

650
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,920
Ling Yizhou, I'll be the one
doing the chasing this time.

651
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,360
Wen Li, how many bosses do you have?

652
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,440
You're my only boss.
I am loyal only to you.

653
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,080
Really?

654
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,560
I'm sorry, Boss.

655
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,800
I promise it won't happen again.

656
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,200
I wasn't blaming you.

657
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,800
It's so late. What are you doing?

658
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Drinking before bed
can help you sleep, honey.

659
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,040
Did you hear something?

660
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,720
It's the air-conditioning.

661
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,520
Why would the air-conditioning work
when the power is out?

662
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,720
-Are there pets in your office?
-No.

663
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,120
