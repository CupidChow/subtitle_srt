1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,400
Let go of me. Just tell him you like him.

2
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Come here!

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,160
<i>He's mine.
You can't steal him from me, you bitch.</i>

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,880
<i>I'll teach you not to mess with me!</i>

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Help!

6
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
-Xia Lin's acting is amazing.
-Help!

7
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,440
-If Zhen Baohui didn't tell me about it,
-Help!

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
I would think this is real.

9
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,120
<i>-You can scream all you want.
-Help!</i>

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
<i>-I already cleared the area.
-Help!</i>

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,600
<i>It's just you and me here.</i>

12
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
<i>Help!</i>

13
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
Help!

14
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,960
Help!

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,600
What's going on with you two?

16
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Why did you run away once you saw Wen Li?

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,880
<i>Probably because of what happened
at the fencing hall.</i>

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
<i>You know what?</i>

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,720
<i>He ran after me for two kilometers.</i>

20
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,640
<i>I'm traumatized now.</i>

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,240
You're exaggerating.

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,880
Does Wen Li like you?

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,640
What's going on between you guys?

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,320
<i>There's nothing going on between us
for now.</i>

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
For now?

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,640
He asked me if we could date.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,680
But I haven't replied yet.

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,080
He confessed his love?

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Then why are you avoiding him?

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,320
<i>What else can I do?</i>

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
You're not the type
that runs away from problems.

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I just don't know yet.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Do you have feelings for him?

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
I just think...

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
It's too soon.

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,120
<i>Too soon?</i>

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,480
When did you first meet him?

38
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,240
So that's why it was awkward
the first time you guys met.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Did you know each other before that?

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,560
What else are you hiding from me?

41
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,560
<i>What could I be hiding?</i>

42
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
<i>All the people I know
from Lingshi Group are through you.</i>

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>Furthermore, I'm worried
he's just saying it for fun.</i>

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,560
<i>He's not serious about it.</i>

45
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,520
<i>This won't do.</i>

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll have to talk to him in a few days.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,920
I don't want to worry about this anymore.

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,000
I have so much work to do.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,760
Maybe you'll change your mind by then.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,800
I think Wen Li is a reliable guy.

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,240
Come on.

52
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,560
Stop teasing me.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
<i>I'm so tired, Linlin.</i>

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
I can't keep my eyes open anymore.

55
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,200
I need to go to bed now.

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,920
Good night.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,079
Okay. Get some rest.

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,560
<i>I'll give you a ride tomorrow morning.</i>

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,840
<i>No need for that.</i>

60
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,000
<i>You promised me today.</i>

61
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,600
<i>It's a deal.</i>

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
<i>I'm going to bed now.</i>

63
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,520
<i>Good night.</i>

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
<i>I'm going to bed too.</i>

65
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
<i>Good night.</i>

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
It's fine. We just got here.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,760
Ms. Xia, Boss was worried
you didn't take breakfast.

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,760
He prepared Baiyinian
meal replacement powder for you.

70
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,280
BAIYINIAN

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Thank you.

72
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,560
Get in.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
<i>Boss.</i>

74
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,080
Your flight to the UK will be
at five in the afternoon.

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Got it.

76
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,000
You're going to the UK?

77
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,560
How long? For what?

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,960
I need to deal with something.

79
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
I'll be back soon.

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,680
Take care of yourself while I'm not here.

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,360
You can call me at any time.

82
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,120
I'll be fine. Just get your work done.

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't worry about me.

84
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,520
<i>We're...</i>

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,080
<i>-Nothing going on for now.</i>
-For now?

86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,960
By the way, I came down late
because I was cleaning up after Feifei.

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,080
She always leaves things at my place
when she comes over.

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,720
Now, I have to deliver them to her.

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
I wonder when will
she change her bad habits.

90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
The shooting probably won't be done
until late at night.

91
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,680
You can ask Wen Li
to deliver her things to her.

92
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,480
Mr. Wen, would you have the time?

93
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Yes, of course.

94
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,880
Will Ms. Jia be at home today?

95
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,640
She will.
She has been writing stuff at home.

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,680
She hasn't gone out
or cooked for herself at all.

97
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,840
She has been living off food deliveries.

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
She insisted on me delivering her things.

99
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,920
I asked her to come and get them,

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,720
but she said
that would disrupt her workflow.

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,280
I understand.

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,080
Also, we were planning
to go to Bali next month,

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,720
but we can't go now.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Feifei loves the sea.

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,080
She said that she wants to have
a beach wedding in the future.

106
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
She's probably really sad
that our travel plans fell through.

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
Mumu.

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,080
Where do you want to get married?

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,320
I haven't thought about it yet.

110
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,400
You must be busy with work all the time.

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,920
By the way, Mr. Wen,
when was your last holiday?

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,600
My last holiday was five years ago.

113
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,000
Wen Li.

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,040
Mr. Ling has been working nonstop.

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,280
How could I take time off?

116
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,200
No matter how busy you are,

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,720
it's important to have
work-life balance, right?

118
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Yes. That's right.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,520
Mumu, you're always right.

120
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
But we'll talk about holidays later.

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Wen Li,

122
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm free this afternoon.

123
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
You can take some time off.

124
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,360
Thank you, Boss.

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,120
We're adding a game to the second part.

126
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,600
Chu Yan can team up with Xia Lin.

127
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,040
We've arranged it already.

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,080
No problem.

129
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,400
Ms. Jiang.

130
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,720
Chu Yan, you're early today.

131
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,760
Yes.

132
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,280
Where's Xia Lin?

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,440
She's stuck in traffic.
She'll be here soon.

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,600
Okay. I'll wait inside.

135
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,640
Okay.

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Have a look. Here is the detailed agenda.

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Okay.

138
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,920
Xia Lin is downstairs already.

139
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
ENGAGEMENT CONTRACT

140
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,600
Ms. Jiang, what is this
engagement contract for?

141
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,840
Mumu.

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,720
You only cared about
whether Wen Li gets time off.

143
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,159
What about me?

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,799
You're the boss.

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,400
You can have time off whenever you want.

146
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,680
Do you think I'm the kind of boss
that exploits his employees

147
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,640
and enjoys his own life?

148
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,840
Of course not.

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,840
I know you're a responsible

150
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,800
and kind boss
that cares about your employees.

151
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
I was just trying
to help Jia Fei and Wen Li.

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
How did I do?

153
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,240
You did all right.

154
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
Okay. Go to work now.

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,680
I'm going to use the restroom
before I start work.

156
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
See you.

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,400
GREEN ROOM

158
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm glad you're here.

159
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,960
I need to talk to you.

160
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Yizhou.

161
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,160
How could you do so many
terrible things behind my back?

162
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,280
Come clean with me.

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,680
Friends should trust each other.

165
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,800
I have nothing to say.

166
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,960
Fine.

167
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,240
I'll be straightforward then.

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,960
I think you're obsessed with business.

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,560
How could you sign
a contract for something

170
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,760
as important as an engagement?

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,520
Did Ms. Jiang tell you about it?

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,960
That's not the point.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,320
Chu Yan.

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,640
This is very important to Xia Lin.

175
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,080
I need to know how you found out.

176
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,040
Also,

177
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,400
is there anyone else know
about this apart from you?

178
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,360
I just came in here
and saw the contract on the table.

179
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
Ms. Jiang came in to take it away.

180
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,800
I don't think anyone else saw it.

181
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,720
Hello, Wen Li.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Tell Jiang Yushi that

183
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,960
if anyone else that shouldn't know
finds out about this,

184
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,360
she'll be in big trouble.

185
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Yizhou, what do you mean by that?

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,640
You shouldn't know about this.

187
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,800
You know too much already.

188
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,120
Why did you and Xia Lin sign
a contract like this?

189
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
Because of the circumstances.

190
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,080
Who even signs an engagement contract
in modern times?

191
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,960
Do you think this is a soap opera?

192
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,280
It's good that I found out.

193
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
Why?

194
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,760
Because it means that

195
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
when Xia Lin got engaged to you,

196
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,640
she didn't like you.

197
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,920
How do you know

198
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,560
that she doesn't like me now
or won't in the future?

199
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,040
Time and my heart will prove everything.

200
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,320
Chu Yan, Xia Lin and I are engaged.

201
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,760
I hope you won't do anything
that might hurt her.

202
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,320
Especially her career.

203
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,960
Why would I hurt her?

204
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,200
I've always protected her.

205
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
I've never stopped.

206
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,720
Yizhou, don't forget.

207
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,440
-In showbiz--
-I know.

208
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,800
In showbiz, your talent and seniority

209
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,560
make you more capable
of protecting Xia Lin than I am, right?

210
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,040
I know that.

211
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,920
Chu Yan, we're starting now.

212
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,520
Why are you still here?

213
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
I'll wait for you on set.

214
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,960
What's up with Chu Yan?

215
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,720
You know,

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,880
I thought I was used to traveling
for work.

217
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,440
But when you're in my arms,

218
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,160
I don't want to do anything.

219
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,640
I just want to keep holding you.

220
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,640
-Ling Yizhou, stop it.
-Mumu.

221
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,560
Maybe...

222
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,920
We should finish what we started
yesterday at your apartment.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,640
Ling Yizhou, you can't do this.

224
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,080
Xia Lin, it's time.

225
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
I'm coming.

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,240
I need to work now.

227
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
Have a safe flight.

228
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,920
Bye.

229
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Jia Fei?

230
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
Jia Fei.

231
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,960
Jia Fei.

232
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,040
Stop it.

233
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Well...

234
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Coming.

235
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,040
Thank you.

236
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,240
Hey, your restaurant
is so environment-friendly.

237
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,360
I have to use my hands?

238
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,120
Thank you.

239
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,440
Wait.

240
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
Why are you at my house?

241
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,040
Your door wasn't locked,
so I let myself in.

242
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,280
-I didn't lock my door?
-Yes.

243
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
That's normal.

244
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
By the way, when I was cleaning your room,
I noticed you're out of shampoo.

245
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
So I ordered more from Adolph for you.

246
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,680
-You...
-They have a promotion recently,

247
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
so I bought a couple for you.

248
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,760
How did you know I like them?

249
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,720
I heard that it's very popular lately.

250
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,880
It has a unique smell.

251
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,960
Not bad.

252
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,560
You're pretty smart.

253
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,200
Thank you.

254
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,280
You should eat.

255
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,000
Dig in.

256
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,359
It's pretty delicious.

257
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,800
Have some more.

258
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
What's wrong?

259
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,080
What is it? Feifei?

260
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,880
Feifei? Are you all right?

261
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,240
What's going on?

262
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,040
Why did I suddenly feel sick?

263
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,520
Feifei, are you all right?

264
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm fine.

265
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,080
I just ate too fast.

266
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,960
-I'll be out in a bit.
-Okay.

267
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
I'll get you some water.

268
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,520
My period has been late for half a month.

269
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,560
Could I be...

270
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,840
Feifei, are you all right?

271
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,920
Do you not like the food?

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,400
What's wrong?

273
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,840
You need to eat even when you're busy.

274
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,320
Wen Li.

275
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,080
One of my characters
is accidentally pregnant.

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,640
If you were her, what would you do?

277
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,680
An unexpected pregnancy?

278
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,080
I think that...

279
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,880
She should tell the father.

280
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,320
This concerns both people.

281
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
When my sister was pregnant,
she had morning sickness all the time.

282
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,960
She couldn't sleep well.

283
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,080
She had to go to the hospital
for a lot of tests.

284
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,320
Being pregnant is hard work.

285
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,520
You're so compassionate.

286
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Actually,

287
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,120
once I learned about it,

288
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,640
I realized how hard it was to be a woman.

289
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,400
But I also think that having a cute baby

290
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,080
must be a wonderful thing.

291
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,960
If it were a girl,

292
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,440
I could buy her a lot of pretty dresses.

293
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,400
Her room would be painted pink.

294
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,600
If it were a boy,

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,040
his room would be painted...

296
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
Baby blue.

297
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,520
If I had a wife and children,

298
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I'd love them so much.

299
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
I would never let them

300
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,400
live the life I had when I was young.

301
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,440
But we don't know each other that well...

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
What did you say?

303
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,000
I said my characters
don't know each other that well.

304
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
Even if they got married,

305
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,320
they wouldn't be happy.

306
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,560
That might be true.

307
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
I'll make you some soup.

308
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,320
<i>Mumu, I just boarded my flight.</i>

309
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,280
<i>Take care of yourself while I'm gone.</i>

310
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,760
<i>Call Wen Li if anything comes up.</i>

311
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,920
<i>I will.</i>

312
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,880
<i>Safe flight, Mr. Ling.</i>

313
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,520
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

314
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
<i>Because it means that</i>

315
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,560
when Xia Lin got engaged to you,

316
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,360
she didn't like you.

317
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,040
How do you know

318
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,360
that she doesn't like me now
or won't in the future?

319
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,680
Hello?

320
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,440
<i>Mr. Chu, did you get my invitation?</i>

321
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,440
Not only did you send me an invitation,
but you also called me to confirm it?

322
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,640
<i>Are you worried I won't show up?</i>

323
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm worried you'll miss
the surprise I prepared for you.

324
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,640
What surprise?

325
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,440
<i>It won't be a surprise if I tell you.</i>

326
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,960
<i>By the way, Chu Yan,</i>

327
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,920
invite some of your friends
in showbiz for me.

328
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,840
The more the merrier.

329
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,560
No problem.

330
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,520
I'll see you at the exhibition.

331
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,160
<i>Okay. See you.</i>

332
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,240
Hey, Xia Lin.

333
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,960
Are you free tomorrow?

334
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,280
Yes. What's up?

335
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,880
Do you know Zhao Ying?

336
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,360
He's that famous...

337
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,200
The famous photographer, Zhao Ying?

338
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,920
Yes. He's a friend of mine.

339
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,720
He has an exhibition tomorrow.
I want to introduce you to him.

340
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,440
It'll help your career.

341
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,200
Since the great Mr. Chu invited me,
I guess I can't refuse.

342
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,720
Think of it as returning a favor.

343
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,760
What favor?

344
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,080
I know that I only got this role
because of your recommendation.

345
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
Thank you, Chu Yan.

346
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
You and Ling Yizhou...

347
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,320
Ling Yizhou can't come.

348
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,640
He'll be in the UK.

349
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
I just wanted to...

350
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
-Chu Yan.
-Both of you...

351
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Are you ready?

352
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,960
The director is asking for you.

353
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,760
I'll be there.

354
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Xia Lin, remember to show up tomorrow.

355
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,960
Okay.

356
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,480
I need to finish up some work.

357
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,640
The driver will drop you and Yuyuan off.

358
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,200
Okay. See you.

359
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,880
Take care.

360
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,560
<i>Mr. Ling and Ms. Xia's contract
is confidential.</i>

361
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
<i>Please keep it private, Ms. Jiang.</i>

362
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,400
<i>Do not make another mistake.</i>

363
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,560
Ms. Jiang.

364
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,920
What is it?

365
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,280
Do you want to get a drink?

366
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,760
Excuse me.

367
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,800
I don't know you that well.

368
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,200
I have something interesting
about Xia Lin and Ling Yizhou.

369
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm sure you'd want to see it.

370
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,560
Let's get something to drink.

371
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,040
It's too hot here.

372
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,280
How long have you been a manager?

373
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,600
I started working
at my company a year ago.

374
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,840
I'm in charge of Xia Lin's jobs.

375
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,360
It seems like you are quite close

376
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,960
with Xia Lin.

377
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,520
We have a work relationship,

378
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,800
but it's important
to know and trust each other.

379
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,880
Are you done asking questions?

380
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,440
What did you want to show me?

381
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,040
XIA LIN'S ACTIVITIES IN NOVEMBER 2018

382
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,360
Anything else?

383
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,960
You seem to be surprised.

384
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,320
I was surprised
when I first saw this document too.

385
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,080
As I said,

386
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,440
Ling Yizhou isn't the trustworthy man
we think he is.

387
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,280
I'm only in charge of Xia Lin.

388
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,240
I don't care
about anything or anyone else.

389
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,080
You wouldn't want her to get hurt,

390
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,760
would you?

391
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,120
Thank you.

392
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,600
You're welcome.

393
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
This is a complicated matter.

394
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,560
I'm not quite sure how to deal with it.

395
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,520
So please don't tell Xia Lin.

396
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,440
I'll keep it a secret.

397
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
I have something to do. I'll go first.

398
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,920
Come on. I'll introduce you to Zhao Ying.

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,920
Sure.

400
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
What a nice photo.

401
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
Yes, it's very nice.

402
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,520
-That was a coincidence.
-Zhao Ying.

403
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
-Pardon me.
-Sure.

404
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,120
I was wondering
why I haven't seen you yet.

405
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,280
It turns out that
you were with this beautiful lady here.

406
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,960
Hello, Mr. Zhao. My name is Xia Lin.

407
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,480
Chu Yan and I are under the same company.

408
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm very glad to be here
at your exhibition.

409
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
I hope we can work together in the future.

410
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,440
So, you're Xia Lin.

411
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,920
Your popularity has been soaring.

412
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,520
You're also the fiancée
of the chairman of Lingshi Group.

413
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Also--

414
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,440
You read too much gossip.

415
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,960
Just make sure
you take care of Xia Lin in the future.

416
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,120
We'll have a look around.

417
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,720
Okay, have fun.

418
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,920
-See you later.
-Okay.

419
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,240
Mr. Zhao is so talented.

420
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,320
All his photos are filled with happiness.

421
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I'm jealous of these couples.

422
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
As long as they have each other,

423
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,520
they can create memories
no matter where they are.

424
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,920
This...

425
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,760
I took this photo of you two years ago
when we finished filming.

426
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
Zhao Ying...

427
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,160
I wondered why he asked me
for this photo a while ago.

428
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,880
He said he had a surprise for me.

429
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,760
You're actually
pretty good at photography.

430
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
That's a good photo.

431
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,640
Of course.

432
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,200
I'm the photography superstar, Chu Yan.

433
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,200
Photography superstar, Chu Yan,

434
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,640
what happened to you?

435
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,120
Why did you become an actor instead?

436
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
You can look it up online.

437
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,320
It's really nice.

438
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,440
Xia Lin.

439
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,680
I know about your engagement contract
with Ling Yizhou.

440
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,960
How would you know about that?

441
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
That's not important.

442
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,640
I'll keep it a secret.

443
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,440
I can understand.

444
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,680
I asked Yizhou about it.

445
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,040
He said
it was because of the circumstances.

446
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,920
<i>Because of the circumstances?</i>

447
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,640
So I'm sure it was the best way
at that moment.

448
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,280
But I just want to tell you
that if I had known earlier...

449
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,360
If I could be by your side
the whole time at that gala.

450
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,440
Maybe everything will be different.

451
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,400
Don't worry. I can help you.

452
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,400
Even though Yizhou seems like
an aggressive and indifferent person,

453
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
he's actually quite caring and kind.

454
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,800
He won't mistreat you.

455
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,720
Once the contract ends,

456
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,640
you can be yourself again.

457
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,080
Get a job you like.

458
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
Date someone you love.

459
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,880
Thank you for your understanding.

460
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,720
And thank you for keeping it a secret.

461
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,480
Mumu.

462
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,720
I was actually hoping
that you'd come live with me.

463
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,760
WECHAT
XIA'S BABY ZHOU

464
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>You know the situation right now.</i>

465
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,240
Even though it's about my job,

466
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,960
Fu Weining is trying
to get to me through you.

467
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,840
If you move in with me,
at least I can protect you.

468
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,480
<i>I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.</i>

469
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,680
What did he mean when he said that?

470
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,960
Mumu.

471
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,360
I'll do what you say.

472
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,280
I also hope you understand

473
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,200
that nothing you do
could cause me any burden.

474
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,600
Did he say that as partners?

475
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
Or...

476
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Never mind. Enough of that.

477
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,120
<i>I asked Yizhou about it.</i>

478
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,480
<i>He said
it was because of the circumstances.</i>

479
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,680
<i>I'm sure it was the best way
at that moment.</i>

480
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,840
That's it.

481
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,560
I was thinking too much.

482
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,520
It's just an act.

483
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,120
Don't think too much of it.

484
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,280
We're just getting what we want out of it.

485
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,200
It's just part of the deal.

486
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,480
Don't get sucked in, Xia Lin.

487
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,520
It can't be.

488
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,240
<i>I do good deeds all the time.</i>

489
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,680
How could I be pregnant?

490
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,000
It's okay if I am.

491
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,040
I have money.

492
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,720
I'll buy you clothes and shoes.

493
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,880
I just have to be prepared.

494
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,440
It will be fine.

495
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,600
It should be...

496
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,800
Could it be...

497
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,480
Linlin.

498
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,760
I can't go shopping with you today.

499
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,800
-That dress is nice.
-<i>I'm not feeling well.</i>

500
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,640
Is it serious?

501
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
Should I go to the hospital with you?

502
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,440
No need for that.

503
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,000
I'll just sleep it off.

504
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,520
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,000
-<i>I'm the one who wanted to go.</i>
-This looks nice.

506
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,360
-Who's the actress here?
-It looks elegant.

507
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,880
<i>All right. Get some rest.</i>

508
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,280
<i>Call me if you need anything.</i>

509
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,720
Have fun shopping.

510
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,760
Hurry up.

511
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,160
Go after her.

512
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Who is it?

513
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm the store employee.

514
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,320
Do the clothes fit?

515
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,960
They fit pretty well.

516
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,560
I'll pay once I get out.

517
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,280
Okay. Thank you.

518
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,040
Why are you here?

519
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,679
Aren't you in the UK?

520
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,600
I missed you, so I came back.

521
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,440
-You said you'd be back tomorrow.
-But I missed you.

522
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,760
How did you know I was here?

523
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,719
I can find out anything I want.

524
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,199
I was worried about you,

525
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,800
so I had someone protect you.

526
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
Protect me?

527
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,600
-It's more like spying on me.
-No.

528
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,920
Protect you.

529
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I know you like pink,
but you don't have to wear all pink.

530
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,400
So...

531
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,120
Has the paparazzi left yet?

532
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,120
There are four?

533
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,080
-I only saw two.
-There are four.

534
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,000
-Are they gone?
-I don't know.

535
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,960
What should I do?

536
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,160
I took care of it.

537
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,840
Really?

538
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,440
Then, let's go.

539
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,240
Why the rush? We should wait.

540
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,600
It's a fitting room.

541
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,520
-We can't be here.
-Why can't we?

542
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,400
What do you think will happen?

543
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,320
I just saved you from harm.

544
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,040
How are you going to reward me?

545
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,240
You saved me from harm?

546
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,480
I saved myself by being smart.

547
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Fine.

548
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,720
Let me reward you then.

549
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,520
-What is it?
-Ling Yizhou! Someone is coming.

550
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,760
My hand!

551
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,320
BAIYINIAN FLAGSHIP STORE

552
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,720
Boss, you remember
every detail about Ms. Xia.

553
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,200
ITEMS

554
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,080
Feifei often skips meals
when she's writing.

555
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,960
She worries about getting fat.

556
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,280
She can probably drink this too, right?

557
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,080
BAIYINIAN MEAL REPLACEMENT POWDER

558
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
GET YOUR COUPONS

559
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,320
THE COUPON HAS BEEN RECEIVED

560
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,000
Ling Yizhou.

561
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,840
What do you mean by this?

562
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,480
You can come at me.

563
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,200
But if you touch my fiancée,

564
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,200
do you think I'll just sit around
and do nothing?

565
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,960
-I'm not drunk.
-I know.

566
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,560
-I'm good at drinking. Let go.
-I know you are.

567
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,200
Careful.

568
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm not drunk.

569
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,480
Let's sit over there.

570
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,040
-Let go of me.
-Sit down.

571
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,080
Let go...

572
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
