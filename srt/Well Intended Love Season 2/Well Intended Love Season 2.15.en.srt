1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm telling you,

2
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,880
you can't be an irresponsible man.

3
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,920
-Dad.
-Dad!

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,120
I mean, Mr. Chu.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,040
Chu Yan, I like you.

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,920
Get out!

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Get out!

8
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,080
I can't believe this is my life.

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
I have my own apartment.

10
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,320
This is so surreal.

11
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,160
I feel as if I'll wake up from this dream
at any moment.

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
Go ahead and enjoy it.

13
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,200
These are the results of your hard work
over the past few years.

15
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
Stop resisting and accept reality.

16
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
You might have lost your memory,

17
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,320
but a wonderful husband like Mr. Ling
dropped right into your lap.

18
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
You should be happy.

19
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
Do you want him?

20
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,960
He's not my cup of tea.

21
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,640
He is nothing but a stranger to me.

22
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,960
The one who had feelings for him
and made memories with him

23
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,520
isn't me.

24
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,680
I just can't accept the fact

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,600
that a stranger is my husband.

26
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,080
It's okay.

27
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,920
As the doctor said,
your memory will come back to you.

28
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,480
Okay, so tell me

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,680
what I've done in the past two years.

30
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
For that,

31
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,360
we'll need the help
of the amazing Internet.

32
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,800
Watch while I tell you everything.

33
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,200
Boss, I've bought everything
that Ms. Xia will need.

34
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
-Deliver them to her.
-Okay.

35
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,920
Wait.

36
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,560
If...

37
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
Never mind, it's nothing.

38
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
-Go.
-Don't worry, Boss.

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
She won't make you wait too long.

40
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,360
-Go.
-Okay.

41
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,440
What's wrong?

42
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
Congratulations, Mr. Ling.

43
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
I have you covered
for two years' worth of ties.

44
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
We're officially married

45
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,000
and you're mine now.

46
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,480
I have to keep you tied to me.

47
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,320
<i>I just want to tell you</i>

48
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,000
<i>that I'm very happy right now.</i>

49
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
<i>Thank you, Ling Yizhou.</i>

50
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,640
<i>You fell in love with me?</i>

51
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,120
<i>That is so disgraceful!</i>

52
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,760
<i>How exciting!</i>

53
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,680
<i>I've never tried this before.
I'm a little nervous.</i>

54
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,880
<i>Come on then.</i>

55
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
<i>-Stop.
-Come on.</i>

56
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,160
Incredible acting.

57
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,320
I can't believe my acting skills
have improved so much.

58
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,360
I must've been diligently honing my skills
over the past two years.

59
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
That's not all.

60
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,880
You had such tenacity.

61
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,320
You had a minor guest appearance
as a lunatic.

62
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,200
You stuffed dog food into your mouth
before the director even called action.

63
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,800
Everybody on set thought
you really were crazy.

64
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,000
That does sound like something I would do.

65
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,480
Feifei, I...

66
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,520
I find this so magical.

67
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
I woke up to find

68
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,680
that I have an apartment
and my dreams came true.

69
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
I have jobs lined up for me.

70
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,280
I feel as if I cheated
in the game of life.

71
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
And the cherry on top

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
is the perfect husband
who couldn't love you more.

73
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,080
You're all telling me
how much he loves and dotes on me,

74
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,240
but why don't I feel anything for him?

75
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,880
Why don't you tell me how he and I met?

76
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,560
<i>Hello.</i>

77
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,680
Hello?

78
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
What?

79
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
Okay, I'll send you another copy.

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
All right.

81
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,200
Linlin, that was the office.

82
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,880
I need to go home
and send them the script.

83
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Okay.

84
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,320
By the way,

85
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,680
you and Mr. Ling were on a reality show.

86
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,840
Look online.

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Maybe you'll remember something.

88
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,680
Okay, got it.

89
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,720
Call me if you have any questions.

90
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
<i>I performed pretty well.</i>

91
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>Why wasn't I picked?</i>

92
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,400
<i>ROMANTIC DEPARTURE</i>

93
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
<i>That's a secret</i>

94
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>-between me and Mr. Ling.</i>
-I make that gesture only when I'm lying.

95
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
<i>Of course not.</i>

96
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,600
<i>My friends are your friends,</i>

97
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
<i>-Baby Zhou.</i>
-My smile is so fake.

98
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,520
When would I ever make such a sweet smile?

99
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm being so polite.

100
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
This still seems fishy.

101
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,640
Why did I marry him?

102
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,440
Never mind. Enough thinking.

103
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,600
Stop wondering about it.

104
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,880
My acting is outstanding.

105
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Mrs. Ling.

106
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,480
Who are you?

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
The master sent me to take care of you.

108
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
Master?

109
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,800
-Hello?
-Hello, Mumu.

110
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Has Ms. Huang arrived?

111
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,280
Why did you send someone to my home?

112
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
There are a lot of things
you don't remember

113
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
which could cause inconveniences for you.

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>I asked Ms. Huang to look after you.</i>

115
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
That's not necessary.

116
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,400
It's me or Ms. Huang. Take your pick.

117
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,360
<i>Maybe she could be a breakthrough.</i>

118
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,400
I'll go with Ms. Huang.

119
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,280
There you go.

120
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
Please come in.

121
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
So that's the main bedroom.

122
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,880
That's the guest room.

123
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,280
Over here is the kitchen.

124
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,640
Thank you for taking the trouble,
Ms. Huang.

125
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,880
It's no trouble. It's my job.

126
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,280
No need to thank me, Mrs. Ling.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Ms. Huang, won't Ling Yizhou
be inconvenienced

128
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,040
with you helping me here?

129
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,600
No, he has housekeepers at hand.

130
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,120
Have both of us been living together?

131
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,040
Yes, you two used to live here,

132
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,640
but later moved to his villa.

133
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
Wasn't it lonely with just the two of us?

134
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,880
No, you used to have
a pet dog named Pidan.

135
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,680
Mr. Ling used to dislike pets.

136
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,040
But because of you,

137
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
he accepted Pidan.

138
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,320
Ever since meeting you,

139
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Mr. Ling has been cheerful every day.

140
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,320
The two of you are so in love.

141
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
Okay, I understand.

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
I'll get to work then.

143
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,040
Go ahead.

144
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,840
In love?

Didn't he say we're married?

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,560
How come there was no news about it?

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,000
I even announced that we broke up?

But why did we break up?

161
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
It seems that Ling Yizhou
was embroiled in a scandal.

162
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,640
Then what about the marriage certificates?

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,240
Mumu, they are telling the truth.
We truly are married.

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,360
What if the marriage certificates
are fake?

168
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
Could it be

169
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,840
that Ling Yizhou
is hiding a terrible secret?

170
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,320
Don't worry.

171
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Everything is normal.

172
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,480
I remember what you said.

173
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I haven't said anything.

174
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,960
My daughter, now that you're pregnant

175
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,720
you should be resting.

176
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,400
Did Ling Yizhou send Ms. Huang
to spy on me?

177
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,440
That happens in novels.

178
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,520
After the wife loses her memory,

179
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,880
a man claims to be her husband
and takes control over her life.

180
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,160
Could it be

181
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,680
that I have dirt on him?

182
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,800
Did he make me lose my memory

183
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,520
and make up this marriage

184
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
to control me?

185
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Ling Yizhou.

186
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
You can't escape from me.

187
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,760
Help!

188
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,160
Help!

189
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
That's so disturbing! No way.

190
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
I need to get out of here and work.

191
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,640
Yuyuan?

192
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,880
Right.

193
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,240
Feifei said Yuyuan is now my manager.

194
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Hello, Yuyuan?

195
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,000
<i>-Hi, Xia Lin.</i>
-Do I have any jobs coming up?

196
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
<i>Xia Lin, relax.</i>

197
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,000
<i>The company has arranged time off for you.</i>

198
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,840
<i>You don't have to worry about work.</i>

199
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,400
But I really want to work.

200
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm going stir-crazy at home!

201
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>I'll notify you first thing
once jobs are scheduled.</i>

202
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,880
<i>Focus on recuperating for now.</i>

203
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
<i>There's no rush.</i>

204
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,200
All right, thank you.

205
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,840
Work isn't an option.

206
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,080
Then I'll start investigating
this marriage thing.

207
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,840
<i>Ms. Xia, Mr. Ling is
currently in a meeting.</i>

208
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,400
I'll just wait for him here then.

209
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
Would you like something to drink?

210
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,920
No, thank you.
I'll let you get back to work.

211
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760
-Tell me if you need anything.
-Sure, thank you.

212
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
Where are the marriage certificates?

213
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Where are they?

214
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,560
Mumu.

215
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
You came?

216
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,120
-Have you been waiting long?
-No, I just arrived.

217
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,000
Do you have more meetings later?

218
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,000
I do, but since you're here,
I'll stay with you.

219
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,440
You don't have to.

220
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,000
I just came to take a look around.

221
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,280
Don't worry about me.

222
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,640
Do your work. Sit down.

223
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm just looking around. Don't mind me.

224
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,200
Sit.

225
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,760
Mumu?

226
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,200
If you want, I can give you a tour

227
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,119
around Lingshi Group's headquarters
and the nearby industrial park.

228
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,040
No need. I simply came here to see you.

229
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,359
Really, just do your work.

230
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,920
Don't worry about me.

231
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,960
Seriously.

232
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,359
Do your work.

233
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,480
<i>I guess I won't be able
to get him out of here so I can search.</i>

234
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,640
<i>Time for brute force.</i>

235
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,560
Where are the marriage certificates?

236
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,680
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

237
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,960
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

238
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
Mumu, what are you doing?

239
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Ling Yizhou,

240
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,760
I have a question.

241
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,240
Aren't there two marriage certificates?

242
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,760
Yes.

243
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,160
Can I see them?

244
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,640
Of course,

245
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,080
but why do you want to see them?

246
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,800
I store such important documents
at a special location.

247
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,360
I'm just asking.

248
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm worried you'll lose them.

249
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,440
That won't happen.

250
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,840
<i>What will it take to get my hands on them?</i>

251
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,800
All right.

252
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,480
I guess I'll be leaving now.

253
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,200
You're taking off already?

254
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,920
Should I have the driver send you home?

255
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,320
Home?

256
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,560
<i>They must be at home.</i>

257
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,080
Yes, home.

258
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
Look, Ling Yizhou.

259
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,720
When I'm spending time with you,
scenes flash through my head.

260
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,160
I think you were right.

261
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,280
We should spend more time together
so I'll recover my memories more quickly.

262
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,120
That's why I should move in with you.

263
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Is that okay?

264
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,280
Certainly.

265
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
You can live wherever you want.

266
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,040
Call the car over. I'm heading downstairs.

267
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,320
Mrs. Ling.

268
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,880
You're home?

269
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm still unfamiliar with this place,

270
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,000
so I'm just looking around.

271
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,040
This is our bedroom.

272
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
Our bedroom?

273
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,200
Isn't my room downstairs?

274
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,240
Mumu, you're my wife.

275
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,720
Naturally, we sleep in the same room.

276
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,240
You can look around
and see if anything jogs your memory.

277
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,880
Right, I should take a look around.

278
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
Maybe I might remember something.

279
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,000
Mumu, look.

280
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,040
That's Pidan.

281
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,520
He's staying with Grandma right now.

282
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Do you remember him?

283
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,600
When did I take this photo?

284
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,680
This is a family photo of us and Pidan
when we were filming for a reality show.

285
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
Do you recall anything?

286
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,320
Ling Yizhou.

287
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
How come you have so many ties?

288
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Mumu, you gave me all of these.

289
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,920
No wonder a scene
just flashed through my mind.

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,320
I was choosing ties.

291
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,120
Yes, this is very important information.

292
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you know what the ties are used for?

293
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,320
Aren't ties used as fashion accessories?

294
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,520
This is how you told me

295
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,800
the meaning of these ties.

296
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,560
I need to use the restroom.

297
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
Why did I feel such strong emotion?

298
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,960
Was it a real memory?

299
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,760
No.

300
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,800
My mind must've been
filling in the blanks.

301
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
My top priority is finding
the marriage certificates

302
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,120
and verifying their authenticity.

303
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,200
Yes, that's all.

304
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,600
<i>Are you free this weekend?</i>

305
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,280
<i>Is that too polite?</i>

306
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,040
<i>Let's go to the movies this weekend.</i>

307
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,200
<i>This one seems too direct.</i>

308
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,080
<i>My friend gave me two movie tickets.</i>

309
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,040
<i>Are you busy this weekend?</i>

310
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>Do you want to go with me?</i>

311
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
<i>Sure.</i>

312
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,880
<i>I'll pick you up.</i>

313
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,720
<i>Sleep early.</i>

314
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,560
<i>You too.</i>

315
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,120
It's already ten o'clock.

316
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,720
Perfect time.

317
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,600
What's the password?

318
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,000
Wrong one.

319
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,320
Birthday.

320
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,040
June 8?

321
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,520
We share the same birthday?

322
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,200
It's still not the right one.

323
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,840
"Xia" and "contract"?

324
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,800
Could this have something to do with me?

325
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,280
Hello, Ms. Huang?

326
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,400
How is Mumu doing today?

327
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
<i>She had a healthy appetite today.</i>

328
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,480
<i>And she must love jigsaw puzzles.</i>

329
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,600
<i>She has been putting pieces together
in the study all day.</i>

330
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,520
Really?

331
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,520
All right. Call me immediately
if anything comes up.

332
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
<i>Okay.</i>

333
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,920
She loves jigsaw puzzles?

334
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,680
Mumu.

335
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,840
What's this big mess?

336
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,840
It's nothing.

337
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,120
Ms. Huang.

338
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,720
Come here and clean up my table.

339
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,960
-Okay.
-That's not necessary.

340
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,600
Just let Ms. Huang do it.

341
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,200
Mumu, I turned down
this Xiaji Paradise acquisition contract.

342
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,600
Why are you putting it back together?

343
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,040
If you like playing with puzzles,

344
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
I'll just buy some for you.

345
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,280
What's the matter, Mumu?

346
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,600
Nothing.

347
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,280
It must be in the safe.

348
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,760
But what's the password?

349
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
What's up? Did you remember something?

350
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,920
I'm feeling much better.

351
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,280
I remembered some more memories
related to you.

352
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,320
I just have a few questions.

353
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,280
Sure, you can ask me anything.

354
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,720
-What's your favorite color?
-Black.

355
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,040
-Your least favorite color?
-Green.

356
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,600
-Your favorite sport?
-Swimming.

357
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,320
Nighttime routine before bed?

358
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,880
Washing my hands.

359
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,880
What's the most significant date for you?

360
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,280
The day we got married.

361
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,640
August 1.

362
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,720
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

363
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,120
Do you have any other questions?

364
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Well...

365
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,240
I think Feifei wanted to see me.

366
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,440
I have to go.

367
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,040
I won't take up any more of your time.

368
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,960
We'll continue this when you get home.

369
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,000
Sure.

370
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
I'll be going now.

371
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,440
Have a good day, Mrs. Ling.

372
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,320
Boss, you know what she's after.

373
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,960
Why are you still letting her continue?

374
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,440
Married couples do these little things
to spice things up.

375
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,040
Someone like you who doesn't have a wife

376
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,200
wouldn't understand.

377
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,680
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

378
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,880
Ling Yizhou sure is committed to this act.

379
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,600
Even his password is so sentimental.

380
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,720
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION OFFICE

381
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,600
"Engagement Contract"?

382
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
ENGAGEMENT CONTRACT

383
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,160
PARTY A: LING YIZHOU, PARTY B: XIA LIN

384
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,120
Ling Yizhou, how do you explain this?

385
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,400
My guess was right.

386
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,600
We were just acting.

387
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,400
Why did you deceive me
with marriage certificates?

388
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,280
Did you take them to be checked?

389
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,360
The engagement is fake.

390
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,680
How can the marriage be real?

391
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,760
I don't know why I married you
in the first place,

392
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
but I'm now requesting a divorce.

393
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Request denied.

394
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,520
Ling Yizhou,
do you think you're a dictator?

395
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,400
Okay. You won't agree to a divorce?

396
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,520
Fine.

397
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,560
We'll go our separate ways now.

398
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,280
-No more attachments.
-That won't work either.

399
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,080
You might like to be in charge,
but you can't stop me.

400
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
Our relationship started with a contract.

401
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
Why are you taking it so seriously
when it's fake?

402
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,920
Mumu.

403
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,400
You were the one who dragged me
to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

404
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,400
I lost my memory.

405
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,320
You could be making that up
for all I know.

406
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,360
Then let's go with what you're saying.

407
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,600
You believe our relationship is defined
by this contract.

408
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,320
However, there are ten more months
to this contract.

409
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,320
Therefore, we must maintain
our image as a couple in public

410
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,360
before this time period is over.

411
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,120
We must fulfill this agreement.

412
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,760
Then I want to terminate this agreement.

413
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,840
You will need to pay
a breach of contract fee.

414
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,200
No problem.

415
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,480
I have the money.

416
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,080
I suggest you look again.

417
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,120
I...

418
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,280
I need to use the restroom.

419
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,800
Boss, why did you agree
to terminate the contract?

420
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,760
What if she comes up with the money?

421
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,240
The contract will eventually end.

422
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,120
But my marriage with her won't.

423
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,000
I will keep waiting for her.

424
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
She's not getting away.

425
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,280
Is this another thing couples do

426
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,960
to spice things up?

427
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,800
I won't get that much money
even if I sell myself.

428
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,280
<i>One step at a time.</i>

429
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,200
<i>Terminate the contract first</i>

430
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,120
<i>then find a way to get a divorce.</i>

431
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,320
Feifei, do you have money?

432
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,560
It's an emergency.

433
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,920
Sure, I have money.

434
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,480
<i>Really? I knew I could count on you.</i>

435
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,520
I know you wouldn't ask me
unless it was an emergency.

436
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,280
How much do you need?

437
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,120
Thirty...

438
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,960
<i>Thirty yuan only?</i>

439
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,159
Million.

440
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
That much?

441
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,960
Were you kidnapped
or are you trying to get into character?

442
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,719
Never mind.

443
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Forget I said anything.

444
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,159
I have to go.

445
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,840
What am I going to do?

446
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Hello, Yuyuan?

447
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,960
Do I have any jobs coming up?

448
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,520
Xia Lin, don't be impatient.
You have to get well first.

449
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,720
Talks are ongoing to get you jobs.

450
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,360
I'm in urgent need of money.
I can't wait any longer!

451
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,280
<i>Xia Lin,
given your current health condition,</i>

452
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,520
<i>diving back into work
would be irresponsible of you.</i>

453
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Even if you do have a job lined up,
you wouldn't be paid immediately.

454
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,120
If you need money, I can lend you some.

455
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
Never mind.

456
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,440
I guess that's all.

457
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,200
Have you made your decision?

458
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,640
On what?

459
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,800
I only came by to see you.

460
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,120
Look at that. It's time for afternoon tea.

461
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,280
I have plans.

462
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
I'll see you later.

463
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
Bye.

464
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,440
All right, I've made my decision.

465
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,440
She will be our spokesperson.

466
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,560
BOJUE PHOTOGRAPHY MEETING AGENDA

467
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,080
Am I late?

468
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,920
Look at what she's wearing.

469
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,960
-It's so peculiar.
-Yes.

470
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,240
Have you been waiting long?

471
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,880
No, not at all.

472
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,080
Our company put up an advertisement here.

473
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,440
I'm checking out the results.

474
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,160
The movie doesn't start until 8 p.m.

475
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,760
Why don't we walk around first?

476
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Will you be uncomfortable with the crowd?

477
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,160
I used to avoid these places.

478
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,120
But now that you're here,
I'm no longer afraid.

479
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,640
I'll just try to avoid other people.

480
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,000
Then let's get going.

481
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,360
What do you want to eat?

482
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,840
Ice cream!

483
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,840
Sure.

484
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
-Come on!
-We're coming!

485
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,920
We're almost there!

486
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,080
Are you okay?

487
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,240
I'm fine.

488
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,360
Good. Let's go.

489
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,440
Have a seat first.

490
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Wait here. I'll buy the ice cream.

491
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Okay.

492
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,760
Sir, you forgot your movie ticket.

493
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,080
Thank you.

494
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,440
Look at what she's wearing.

495
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,040
Does she think she's a princess?

496
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Is she cosplaying?

497
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,080
It does look nice,

498
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,000
but isn't it a bit dramatic
to wear in public?

499
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,920
Why are you over here?

500
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,360
The ice cream is melting.

501
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,120
Oh my goodness. That's Chu Yan.

502
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,760
Chu Yan, who chose to retire from showbiz
at the peak of his career!

503
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,760
He's a boss now.

504
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,600
I heard he's the one who founded

505
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,560
the super popular
"A photo shoot where you want it" company.

506
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,000
Those two don't seem to match at all.

507
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,200
I know what you're talking about.
Bojue Photography, right?

508
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,200
However, I think their styles
come together surprisingly well.

509
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,480
He agreed to terminate the contract

510
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,480
on the condition that I pay full
the breach of contract fee.

511
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,520
This is all the savings I have.

512
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,800
-Is this enough?
-Feifei, this really isn't necessary.

513
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
As you know,

514
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,480
I don't have the habit of saving money

515
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,760
and I'm still waiting for the payment
for my scripts.

516
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll ask Wen Li.

517
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,120
Don't, Feifei.

518
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,120
You really don't have to.

519
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,280
I'll figure something out.

520
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,880
Just let me do it.

521
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,960
So what are you thinking of doing now?

522
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
What else can I do?

523
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,320
At worst, I'll have to put up
with these for ten months.

524
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,440
I don't get it.

525
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,120
Why do you want to leave Mr. Ling?

526
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,920
He brought up the contract
to keep you by his side.

527
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,320
During this time,

528
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,360
he has been patiently waiting
for you to recover your memories.

529
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,200
Who knows? When tomorrow comes,
you might get your memories back.

530
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,800
All of you are saying
that we're a married couple,

531
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,600
but I no longer remember
anything about him.

532
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,880
I'm filled with doubt and suspicion
about how I came to be with him.

533
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
Most importantly,

534
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,080
I don't want to be with a stranger
that I have no feelings for.

535
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,920
Even worse,

536
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,200
what if my situation never changes?

537
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,920
It's a likely possibility.

538
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,400
I think this is unfair for both of us.

539
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
I know.

540
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,960
Right now, it's hard for you to accept
the fact that you're married.

541
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,960
But you and Mr. Ling were so in love.

542
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,720
The two of you had
many life-changing experiences together.

543
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,360
I saw how deep your feelings for him were.

544
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,040
Linlin, if you break up with him now,

545
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,840
you'll regret it
once your memories come back.

546
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,920
I don't want that for you.

547
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,440
Feifei?

548
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,280
-You're back?
-I have to talk to you.

549
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,480
This is my bank account.

550
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,000
This is my household register.

551
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,960
This is my property title.

552
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,280
I also have some funds and stocks.

553
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,320
I can withdraw the money
if you need me to.

554
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,320
Hold up.

555
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,120
What's the meaning of this?

556
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,000
I think you misunderstood.

557
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,440
That's not what I meant.

558
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,520
I asked for Linlin.

559
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,760
You don't have to take it so seriously.

560
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,160
Feifei, I am serious about you.

561
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,640
I am seriously considering our future.

562
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,120
I want...

563
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,200
I...

564
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,200
I'm so sleepy.

565
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,520
I need to go to bed.

566
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,080
Feifei!

567
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,480
Feifei!

568
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,840
Feifei!

569
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,000
Feifei!

570
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
Am I rushing things?

571
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,000
Why is he being so serious?

572
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,480
The contract doesn't say
we have to keep acting while sleeping.

573
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,760
Aren't you asleep already?

574
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,960
How are you still talking?

575
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,080
I am sleeping.

576
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,200
My eyes are closed.

577
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,240
You want to terminate
the contract, don't you?

578
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
Be my guest.

579
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,480
But you have to do three things with me.

580
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
What things?

581
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,200
Your first request

582
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,640
is to ride a Ferris wheel with you?

583
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,960
No.

584
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,120
Do you like the view?

585
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,400
Yes.

586
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,040
Good.

587
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,200
Of course I like the view.

588
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,720
Ling Yizhou, do you know
that although Ferris wheels are pretty,

589
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,760
there is a tragic legend tied to them?

590
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,600
Any lovers who take
a Ferris wheel ride together

591
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,800
end up breaking up.

592
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,080
-So it's a miscalculation on your part.
-I know.

593
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,440
That's why we never went on it
when we used to come here.

594
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,320
We only watched it.

595
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,960
Watched it?

596
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,920
It's beautiful.

597
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Isn't it pretty?

598
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,360
Yes.

599
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,360
Why don't you lean in closer
to get a better look?

600
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,800
Boss, please take a look.

601
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,520
This will do.

602
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,240
Wen Li.

603
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,280
Buy a jigsaw puzzle for Xia Lin.

604
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,920
She wants a puzzle?

605
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,560
I've heard that playing jigsaw puzzles
can exercise the brain,

606
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,880
boosting memory and thought processes.

607
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,760
She must be eager to recover.

608
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,360
Buy the most challenging

609
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
and most expensive jigsaw puzzle
of the highest quality

610
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,640
that a girl would like.

611
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,200
-Got it.
-Wait.

612
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,400
Buy one with a high piece count.

613
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,720
Just a high piece count will do.

614
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,960
Got it.

615
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,000
A package for you.

616
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,920
Thank you.

617
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,040
-Here.
-Thank you.

618
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,600
"Disney <i>Frozen</i> Jigsaw Puzzle."

619
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,960
One thousand pieces?

620
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,920
Ling Yizhou.

621
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,880
You really are something else.

622
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,680
Sorry, I...

623
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,240
I really don't remember.

624
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,480
<i>Feifei, I'm leaving.</i>

625
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,920
<i>Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.</i>

626
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,760
Turned off?

627
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,040
<i>Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.</i>

628
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,040
Why is his phone off?
