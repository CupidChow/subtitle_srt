1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,080
Ling Yizhou.

2
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,960
What do you mean by this?

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,400
You can come at me.

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,320
But if you touch my fiancée,

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
do you think I'll just sit around
and do nothing?

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,960
-I'm not drunk.
-I know.

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,480
-I'm good at drinking. Let go.
-I know you are.

8
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
Careful.

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm not drunk.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Let's sit over there.

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,160
-Let go of me.
-Sit down.

12
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
Let go...

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
Well, Ling Yizhou.

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Not only did you come uninvited,

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,760
you're actually making yourself at home.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
Mumu, I already tidied everything up.

17
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Do you want to check?

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,600
No, just do as you please.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm not one to just do as I please.

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,560
Right, you aren't.

21
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,240
I'll go get a drink.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,440
Mumu?

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
I want one too.

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,760
Not only is he making himself at home,

25
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,160
but he's also ordering me around
like a servant.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
Are you kidding me?

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm supposed to make you a drink?

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,560
In your dreams.

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm so pissed off.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,320
Mumu, this is my first day living here.

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,960
This is the first cup of drink
you made for me.

32
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,320
You're mistaken. This is mine.

33
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,080
Can I have a sip?

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,480
This is for women. Why would you want it?

35
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,600
You can't fool me.

36
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
I know what it is.

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I can drink it too.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
I already drank from this cup.
You still want it?

39
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
Yes, that's exactly why I want it.

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,080
I want to know more about you.

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,360
-I want to try the same things as you.
-You want to know more?

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
You must be kidding.

43
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,800
Do you want it? Here you go!

44
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,880
Gosh! I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,560
Did you get scalded? Take off your shirt!

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
Take it off now!

48
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,240
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,920
Your skin has turned red. I'm so sorry!

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
It was an accident.

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,880
You big pervert! Put on your shirt!

54
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,959
You told me to take it off.

55
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
You just do as you're told?

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
How could I not when you ask me to?

57
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,000
So why don't you go home?

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,560
I've tolerated you for three hours.

59
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,800
You made yourself at home
and even treated me like a servant.

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,520
So what if I dirtied your shirt?

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
I can afford to buy you a new one!

62
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
Also, I'll have your things
thrown out of my house tomorrow

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,120
and you're leaving!

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,520
Leave!

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,000
Ling Yizhou. Where did you go?

66
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,240
Taking a shower.

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
Damn it!

68
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,720
<i>ANIMAL WORLD</i>

69
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
<i>Chairman Ling Yizhou of Lingshi Group
and female celebrity, Xia Lin</i>

70
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
<i>were seen making out in a dressing room.</i>

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,960
<i>Fans gave them the nickname "Muzhou"
and are soaking up these sweet moments.</i>

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>No way.</i>

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,920
<i>If this keeps up,</i>

74
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>something that can't be undone
really will happen.</i>

75
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
-Ling Yizhou, you should leave.
-I can't.

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
There are people outside.

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,800
Who?

78
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,760
When I arrived,
I noticed the paparazzi camping outside.

79
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
If you kick me out so late at night,

80
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,200
I guarantee
the headlines tomorrow will be,

81
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,000
"Muzhou has done the deed."

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
What about Wen Li?

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,840
You can tell him to get rid of them.

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
Mumu.

85
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,960
Wen Li is also human.

86
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,320
He needs sleep.

87
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,200
He needs time to pursue love.

88
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,840
Pursue love?

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
That's right.

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
Mumu.

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,440
Look.

92
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,720
Wen Li is in pursuit of true happiness.

93
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,080
Shouldn't we also...

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,040
Fine.

95
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
You win.

96
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,320
I'll give up my room.

97
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,640
I'll sleep in the guest room.

98
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Mumu?

99
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,800
Good night.

100
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,160
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,240
-I--
-Get out!

102
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,560
-Come out!
-Wait, Mumu.

103
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,200
Who let you in? Get out!

104
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,160
Wait.

105
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,320
Get out.

106
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,640
Mumu.

107
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,400
Ling Yizhou, what is this?

108
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,559
That's my toothbrush.

109
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,280
You used my cleanser.

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,159
I was about to tell you,
but you wouldn't let me finish.

111
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,920
Fine, but shame on you.

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Ling Yizhou, what happened
to my skincare products?

113
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,920
-Why are they all gone?
-They're in the cabinet below.

114
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
Listen. I use these every day.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
Don't move them!

116
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,640
Got it.

117
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,600
I've had it with him.

118
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,280
Mumu, can you hurry it up?

119
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,880
I need to shower.

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
I haven't washed my face yet.

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Gosh.

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,840
He's making me lose my mind.

123
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,680
Ling Yizhou, you just wait.

124
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,560
Mumu.

125
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
Can I ask you a question?

126
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,640
I can't hear you.

127
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
What's the passcode to your apartment?

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,080
-Six figures.
-Which six?

129
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,120
Pay me and I'll tell you.

130
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
It's 180716.

131
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
How did you know?

132
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,600
In 2018,

133
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
you starred in several works
directed by Wu Qiang

134
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
and won the Best Newcomer Award.

135
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,640
That was the first award that gained you
the most recognition since your debut.

136
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,680
As for 0716,

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
that's the date you received the award.

138
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,960
I will never forget

139
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,400
the acceptance speech you gave

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,680
as you stood on stage with the award.

141
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,440
You shone so brightly.

142
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
Everybody else paled in comparison.

143
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,720
That was an award of little importance.

144
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,440
How did you know about it?

145
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,200
Wait a minute.

146
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,240
How long have you known about me?

147
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,400
Mumu.

148
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,760
Talking while eating
can disrupt digestion.

149
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,880
Don't talk.

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm done. I'm heading out.

151
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,320
I'll just take some Baiyinian
when I'm hungry.

152
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,560
ADOLPH

153
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,440
Should we get this?

154
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,960
Let's go.

155
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
Isn't that Ling Yizhou?

156
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,920
What is he doing here?

157
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,080
I think Xia Lin lives around here.

158
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Wasn't their relationship exposed?

159
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,200
Are they living together?

160
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,960
Hurry. Take a picture and post it online.

161
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,960
Okay.

162
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
Excuse me, is this...

163
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,120
Sorry.

164
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

165
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Why won't you give up?

166
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
Because I...

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go again.

168
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,040
Sorry.

169
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,920
Five, four, three, two!

170
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,600
Why won't you give up?

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Because I love her.

172
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,280
So what if she's with Mo Ran?

173
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,840
I've liked her for so many years.

174
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,600
I've seen her happy, sad, and heartbroken.

175
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,560
I was the one at her side

176
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,560
the first time she received exam results

177
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,720
and the first time she got an interview.

178
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,920
But everything changed
after that jerk showed up!

179
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,760
Why?

180
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,240
Why him?

181
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
Chu Yan, take a break.

182
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,400
Let's all take five.

183
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,840
Your rest area is over there.

184
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,080
Chu Yan, your family called several times.

185
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
I didn't think I should answer.

186
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Hello?

187
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,640
What does the old man want?

188
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,920
<i>Chu Yan, Mr. Chu is fine.</i>

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,080
<i>He just misses you.</i>

190
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,400
<i>Who would miss him?</i>

191
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
He still sounds robust.

192
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
He seems fine.

193
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm going to hang up. I'm working.

194
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
<i>Wait, Chu Yan.</i>

195
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,520
<i>Come and visit if you have time this week.</i>

196
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
<i>Have dinner with Mr. Chu.</i>

197
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,640
Okay, I'll check my schedule.

198
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,520
LING YIZHOU MOVES IN WITH XIA LIN,
BECOMES HOMEMAKER FOR LOVE

199
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,920
LING YIZHOU SEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS
OUTSIDE XIA LIN'S HOME

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
THOUGHTFUL PURCHASES FOR XIA LIN

201
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,080
FANS GUESSING THEY'VE MOVED IN TOGETHER

202
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,440
LING YIZHOU BECOMES HOMEMAKER
FOR XIA LIN, BEST DISPLAY OF LOVE

203
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,200
Chu Yan.

204
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,200
Your family's housekeeper called
and said your dad had a heart attack

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
and was sent to the hospital.

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,320
Tell the director I need to go.

207
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Sir, how is he?

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,680
There you are, Chu Yan.

209
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,840
Mr. Chu is resting.

210
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,200
Sir, this is Mr. Chu's son.

211
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
You can speak in front of him.

212
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,080
All right.

213
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
The patient had a heart attack
caused by overwork.

214
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,480
His situation has improved
after emergency treatment,

215
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,280
but he will need to be hospitalized
to monitor his condition.

216
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,360
He must refrain from overexerting himself
during this time.

217
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
He needs proper rest.

218
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

219
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,280
Not at all.

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,680
Chu Yan.

221
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,000
The company suffered severe losses lately

222
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,680
and Mr. Chu has been working late
every day.

223
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,800
He hasn't had a good night's rest.

224
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,160
The last time I called you,

225
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,720
he was sick.

226
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,400
But he recovered after taking medication.

227
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,240
He wouldn't let me tell you.

228
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
He said he has to weather the storm
no matter how difficult it'll be.

229
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,320
He doesn't want his life's work
to go down the drain.

230
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
This isn't the first time.

231
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,960
He's being absurd.

232
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
Does he think he's still young?

233
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,160
Life's work?

234
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,600
Isn't there anything else
that could be more important?

235
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,440
Chu Yan,

236
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,400
the only thing more important to him

237
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,720
is you.

238
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
He is keeping the company afloat
for your sake.

239
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
If you no longer
want to act in the future,

240
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,040
you don't have to worry about anything

241
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,160
and live a comfortable life.

242
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,680
Spend some time with Mr. Chu.

243
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,040
I'm going to ask the doctor

244
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
if there's anything
we need to pay attention to.

245
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
You're really

246
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
an old man now.

247
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
My health is fine.

248
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
It's an old people problem.

249
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,680
You had to be resuscitated.

250
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,760
Can you stop worrying about the company?

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,520
It's my life's work.

252
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,560
It's not that easy to just let go.

253
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,040
Your company is too traditional
and outdated.

254
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm making good money from acting.

255
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,400
I can support you when you're old.

256
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,640
I have money. I don't need yours.

257
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,240
I think...

258
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,200
I've said the same thing to you before.

259
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,040
You brat.

260
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,400
Come back.

261
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
I'm old now.

262
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,360
I know you only became an actor

263
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,080
to make a statement.

264
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
You can't avoid reality forever.

265
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,840
I'm no longer as healthy as I once was.

266
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,040
The company will gradually be downsizing.

267
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,400
I don't care about maximizing profits.

268
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,200
I just hope it can survive.

269
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,760
Go do what you want to do.

270
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,680
I'm glad

271
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I was able to do what I wanted in life.

272
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,320
Even though I might end up
losing everything.

273
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
At least,

274
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
I've tried and succeeded.

275
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,240
You're my son.

276
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Don't disappoint me

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,560
by aimlessly wandering through life.

278
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,920
Xia Lin should act
in more dramas with this genre.

279
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,680
-I understand, sir.
-Got it?

280
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,960
-Promote your artists.
-Okay.

281
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,560
-Okay?
-Okay.

282
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
Here are the clothes. Good job today.

283
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,160
Of course. You too.

284
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,560
By the way, what brand is the tie
that the male lead wore today?

285
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
It looked nice.

286
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,200
Are you noticing these details
now that you two are living together?

287
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll send the store's address to you later
and you can browse directly.

288
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,560
-Okay. Thank you.
-I'm taking off now.

289
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
-Don't forget your bag.
-Thank you.

290
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,600
Ms. Jiang.

291
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,120
What's this about?

292
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,840
LING YIZHOU MOVES IN WITH XIA LIN,
BECOMES HOMEMAKER FOR LOVE

293
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,920
It happened quite unexpectedly.

294
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,560
Wait a minute.

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
<i>Ms. Xia, Boss is drunk.</i>

296
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,720
-<i>Could you please come by?</i>
-I...

297
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,840
Ms. Jiang, I have to take care
of something urgent.

298
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,840
Help me fix that.

299
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,480
I'll explain it next time.

300
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,400
-You...
-Bye!

301
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Where are you going?

302
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
I just have to leave!

303
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,680
Where is he?

304
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,840
Mr. Wen, I'm here.

305
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,720
Where are you? Why can't I see you?

306
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,760
Boss, are you okay?

307
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,600
What happened? Why is he so drunk?

308
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
The company's crisis
was handled successfully.

309
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,960
-He was in a happy mood and overindulged.
-Look!

310
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
It's a building!

311
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,160
-Yes, it's a building.
-Yes, you're right.

312
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,760
Leave him to me. Don't worry about him.

313
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,800
-That's light!
-You should head home.

314
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,840
I'll take Mr. Cheng home.

315
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,960
-Go on.
-Be careful.

316
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,320
Watch out.

317
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,280
-An airplane.
-All right. Are you okay?

318
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,160
Are you all right?

319
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm okay.

320
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
Hey! Be careful.

321
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,480
Why did you drink so much?

322
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Hey, be careful.

323
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,280
Slowly.

324
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Let me help you.

325
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
Let me help you.

326
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,720
All right.

327
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,480
Aren't we going home?

328
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,920
Yes, we're going home now.

329
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,360
What's wrong?

330
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,360
Where's the steering wheel?

331
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,960
Have you seen my steering wheel?

332
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
Where's your steering wheel?

333
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,880
I need to drive home.

334
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,160
I need the steering wheel to do that.

335
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,000
-Where's my steering wheel?
-The wheel is right in front of you.

336
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
Just reach out.

337
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,880
Do you see it? It's right in front of you.

338
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,640
-Yes, right there.
-Here it is.

339
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,160
Hold it and you can drive.

340
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,920
I know how to drive.

341
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,600
I'll be going now.

342
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,400
Drive safely.

343
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,600
Why are you outside my house?

344
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,320
Well, I...

345
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,880
Never mind. It's okay.

346
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,280
Get in.

347
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,520
I'll drive you home.

348
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Okay, I'm coming.

349
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,240
Right.

350
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll help you with that.

351
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
Okay.

352
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,600
Don't move.

353
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,120
Why did you drink so much?

354
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,600
Ling Yizhou, we're home.

355
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,240
Come on.

356
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,240
Let's go.

357
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
Why did you have to drink so much?

358
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,840
Careful.

359
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,920
Slow down.

360
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,880
<i>So it's true.</i>

361
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,240
Careful.

362
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,440
Watch out.

363
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,680
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

364
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,560
You're heavier than you look.

365
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,600
Feeling nauseous?

366
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,240
Serves you right.

367
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
Jeez,

368
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
you drank so much.

369
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
You brought this upon yourself.

370
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Turn over.

371
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,320
You're so heavy.

372
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,320
This side now.

373
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,400
This is tiring.

374
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,960
What are you doing?

375
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
What, Mumu?

376
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,120
I'm warning you.

377
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,760
Since you're drunk,

378
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm afraid I won't be able
to control myself.

379
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
I might take advantage of you.

380
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,120
That got your attention?

381
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,320
Are you sober now?

382
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,640
No.

383
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,760
Ling Yizhou, you're drunk.

384
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,240
I'll get a towel for you
so you can cool down.

385
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,680
Xia Lin.

386
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,120
You're the one to talk.

387
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,480
You're the one who needs to calm down!
What are you doing?

388
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,680
<i>Aren't you two engaged?</i>

389
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
What's done is done.

390
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,920
It's past the point of no return.

391
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,760
But, I...

392
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,680
But it's a fake engagement.

393
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,320
Aren't those just excuses?

394
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,080
Ling Yizhou?

395
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Ling Yizhou?

396
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,600
Good night.

397
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,320
<i>Boss, Mr. Chu had
a sudden heart attack last night</i>

398
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,240
<i>and was hospitalized.</i>

399
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,400
<i>He is stable now but needs to rest.</i>

400
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,600
OUTPATIENT

401
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Mr. Chu, how are you feeling?

402
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,200
Old man, I brought food for you.

403
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,320
Yizhou?

404
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,560
Why are you here?

405
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
I came to see how your dad is doing.

406
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm glad he's fine.

407
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,760
You should get going.

408
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,960
You came so early.

409
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,960
I'm sure you're needed at your company.

410
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Go back to work.

411
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,480
Mr. Chu, I'll be leaving now then.

412
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,760
I'll give my grandma an update later.

413
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,440
Don't alarm her.

414
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,280
-Tell her not to worry.
-Okay.

415
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,240
-I'll visit her after I'm discharged.
-Okay.

416
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,840
-Good.
-Take care.

417
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,520
Goodbye.

418
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,400
I'll see him out.

419
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
I heard about your dad's company.

420
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,760
Is there anything I can help with?

421
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,440
No.

422
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,360
I've decided to return to the company.

423
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
Are you going to quit acting?

424
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,840
I plan on retiring
after wrapping up my current drama.

425
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,280
You're giving up already?

426
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
That's not like you.

427
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm not giving up.

428
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,600
I just came to the realization

429
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,640
that I want to be there for my loved ones

430
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,080
when they are sick or dying.

431
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,080
Hey.

432
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,560
Don't try to comfort me.

433
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,360
My dad and I have been at odds for years.

434
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,840
It suddenly feels pointless.

435
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,320
And lately,

436
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
I realized I don't like acting very much.

437
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm going to try a different career.

438
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,760
I thought you loved acting.

439
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,000
It's all right.

440
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,200
Do you remember that when we met,

441
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,480
I was really into photography?

442
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,720
I wanted to be
a professional photographer.

443
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,400
I somehow became an actor
and discovered I had some talent.

444
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
So I continued down that path.

445
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,520
If that's the case,

446
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,720
have you considered
integrating acting and photography

447
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,200
into your company's operations?

448
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,240
Are you kidding me?

449
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,480
You already have an idea?

450
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,400
I mean...

451
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Take over the company first
and get a lay of the land.

452
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,880
See if there's any overlap.

453
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,280
Don't hesitate to ask for help.

454
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
All right, I'll give it a try.

455
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,600
We're not out of options yet.

456
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,840
Besides, my dad said

457
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,320
no matter how bad it gets,

458
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,800
we still won't be homeless.

459
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,520
Right.

460
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,680
I saw you and Xia Lin yesterday

461
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,240
outside her place.

462
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,840
Ling Yizhou.

463
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
Xia Lin is a good girl.

464
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,040
She has been giving her best
ever since she entered the industry.

465
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,640
I never confessed my feelings to her.

466
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,760
That's because I didn't know

467
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,920
whether my feelings for her

468
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
were as a friend, a lover,

469
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,440
or a colleague.

470
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Either way, all this time,

471
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,480
I've been quietly watching over her
as a friend.

472
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
She's not a flower
that needs to be sheltered.

473
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,160
Still, I have to thank you.

474
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,640
Thank you for being at her side
as a friend.

475
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't be so smug.

476
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,520
I'm warning you.

477
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,320
If you don't treat her well,

478
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,720
-I will--
-You'll what?

479
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,640
I won't give you
a snowball's chance in hell.

480
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,600
Don't think about getting between us.

481
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,200
While we're acting,

482
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,320
she and I could still be a couple.

483
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
-Really?
-Pidan could be our child.

484
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,840
<i>Mumu, I need to go out for a bit.</i>

485
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,960
<i>Let's have dinner together.</i>

486
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,639
<i>Thanks for your help last night.</i>

487
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
<i>Ling Yizhou.</i>

488
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,880
<i>Having fun living together?</i>

489
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,320
<i>It happened out of the blue.</i>

490
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,600
<i>I'm totally devastated.</i>

491
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,120
<i>Are you free today?</i>

492
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,920
<i>Come out and I'll take your mind off it.</i>

493
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,920
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

494
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,480
<i>I have something to ask you anyway.</i>

495
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,840
JIA FEI

496
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,600
IT HAS BEEN SO LONG
SINCE I'VE WORKED UP A SWEAT.

497
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,240
I'M STILL KILLING IT!

498
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,200
<i>I'm leaving work soon. Where are you?</i>

499
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
<i>Should I pick you up?</i>

500
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,600
LINGSHI GROUP

501
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,360
<i>No need. I'm out with Linlin.</i>

502
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
Queenie, make the changes
that I just mentioned.

503
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,040
Okay, Mr. Ling.

504
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,440
Boss!

505
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,160
You can go now.

506
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
LINGSHI GROUP

507
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,440
The boss said you can go now.

508
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,200
Wen Li.

509
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,560
Grab a few things from my house
and take them to Mumu's.

510
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
Okay.

511
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Why aren't you going?

512
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,240
I'll go.

513
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,960
Is something the matter?

514
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,960
Ms. Xia and Jia Fei

515
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
might not be home.

516
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,600
-I'm going.
-Where are you going?

517
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,880
To the gym!

518
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,320
Did Wen Li tell you?

519
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,080
I learned from the general public.

520
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,640
So what do you think?

521
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,400
It's already clear that
Mr. Ling likes you.

522
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,880
But...

523
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,760
-Enough buts.
-But...

524
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,920
See for yourself.

525
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,680
Look at that silly grin on his face.

526
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,000
It's confirmed that he likes you.

527
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,560
What matters now is what you think.

528
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
I...

529
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,680
I don't know.

530
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,400
Xia Lin, look.

531
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,800
Based on my experience as a screenwriter,

532
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,760
there's no running away for you.

533
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,760
What?

534
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,080
You can't escape from Mr. Ling's clutches.

535
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,800
For my script, I've recently been studying

536
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
relationships in which the woman
is older than the man.

537
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,400
My male lead is a testosterone-fueled hunk
who is clingy like a puppy.

538
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,000
This is the perfect opportunity...

539
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,760
to do some research.

540
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,440
Why do I get the feeling

541
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,600
research

542
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,120
is just an excuse?

543
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,680
<i>Don't tell me those two are going to...</i>

544
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,240
Ling Yizhou, what are you doing here?

545
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,200
Why can't I be here?

546
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,880
I mean, how did you know I'm here?

547
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,520
Wen Li said that

548
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
he's worried about Ms. Jia's safety.

549
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,320
I came along to take you home.

550
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,840
Yes, I was worried that

551
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,840
Ms. Jia and Ms. Xia would
encounter danger going home at night.

552
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,480
Why are men nowadays so narrow-minded?

553
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,960
You don't even have
a basic level of trust!

554
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Who would want to be
my personal trainer from now on?

555
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,320
I'll be the only trainer for Mumu!

556
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,640
-Why do you get to dictate that?
-Because you're my wife!

557
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,880
I don't care.

558
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,360
You guys chased away the trainers

559
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,240
and we don't have any hunks
to ogle anymore.

560
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,200
You guys need to make up for that.

561
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,000
Did you come for the eye candy?

562
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,920
Yes, I like gazing at sweaty studs
bursting with testosterone.

563
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,280
It'll even spark inspiration
for a character in my new script

564
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,520
which is especially steamy.

565
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,400
-Right, Linlin?
-Yes!

566
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,200
Look at what you two have done.

567
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,200
How can we show our faces here again?

568
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,880
-I'll come with you!
-How will you make it up to us?

569
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,760
Wen Li.

570
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,880
-Arrange it.
-Okay.

571
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
-That was fast.
-Boss.

572
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,760
It's okay for men to be fast sometimes.

573
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,280
Go!

574
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,600
-Pass the car in front of us.
-Okay!

575
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,720
GANGDONG MUNICIPAL CIVIL AFFAIRS BUREAU

576
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,680
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION OFFICE

577
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Here.

578
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,520
This is it.

579
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,480
Mumu, why are we here?

580
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,400
We have to end the engagement contract
before we can get married.

581
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,600
Since the engagement was your scheme,
then I'll help you succeed.

582
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,920
As far as I'm concerned,
marriage is a gamble.

583
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,880
Dare to take a chance?

584
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,200
Yes.

585
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,280
So long as you're not what's at stake,

586
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,160
I'll bet anything.

587
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,560
