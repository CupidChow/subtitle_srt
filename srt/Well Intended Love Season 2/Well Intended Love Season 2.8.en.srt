1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,280
What's wrong?

2
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,280
Where's the steering wheel?

3
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
Have you seen my steering wheel?

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
Where's your steering wheel?

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,880
I need to drive home.

6
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,160
I need the steering wheel to do that.

7
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,120
-Where's my steering wheel?
-The wheel is right in front of you.

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
Just reach out.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,960
Do you see it? It's right in front of you.

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,639
-Yes, right there.
-Here it is.

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,160
Hold it and you can drive.

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
I know how to drive.

13
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,840
There are 22 of them for you to ogle at.

14
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,080
Are you satisfied?

15
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, very satisfied.

16
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
Just as I expected.

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
We were tricked yet again.

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
They promised muscular hunks,

19
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
brimming with passion and enthusiasm.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,240
This is what we get.

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,560
What is wrong with them?

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,520
-They won't even let us go to the gym.
-Exactly.

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
I can't stand overweening husbands.

24
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,440
Who's your husband?

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm talking about Mr. Ling.

26
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,800
Actually, you don't deny
being the future Mrs. Ling.

27
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,760
In fact, you even look forward to it.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,080
What about your man?

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
The one-month period is almost up.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
This isn't like you at all, Feifei.

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Look! Goal!

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
Goal!

33
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,400
Goal!

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,200
Goal!

35
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
What are they doing?

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,280
GANGDONG POLICE STATION

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,560
Sorry, guys.
It was just a misunderstanding.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
It was a total misunderstanding.

39
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,440
Did you use to train?

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Not really.

41
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,520
We could spar sometime.

42
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,520
This matter has been resolved.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
You are all free to go.

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
Boss.

46
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm hurt.

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I need Feifei to treat my injury.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,880
Come on.

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
Let's go home.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Let's go.

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
Are you okay?

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,560
I'm fine if you're fine.

53
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,320
Ling Yizhou.

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,200
There's a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

55
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Ask away.

56
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
Why me?

57
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
In Feifei's words,

58
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,440
you're handsome, come from a good family
and you're devoted.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,600
You must be what a lot of women find
to be the perfect husband.

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,280
Really?

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,400
Mumu, do you think
I am the perfect husband?

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,040
You nearly changed the subject
on me again.

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
You haven't answered me yet.

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
Okay.

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,040
So you're asking me

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,800
why I chose you instead of somebody else?

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,920
I just think that in most people's eyes,

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm not the best choice for you.

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,440
On an emotional level,

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,160
I won't cling to you like a helpless bird.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,440
On a professional level,

72
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
I'm not even remotely qualified
to join forces with you.

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Our meeting was purely by accident.

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,640
You could have refused to help me.

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,240
Yet, you chose to use
an engagement contract

76
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,120
to tighten the ties between us.

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
After that,

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,880
whether it was acting like a couple

79
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,720
or taking part in a reality show,

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
you gave your full cooperation.

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,480
You could have terminated the contract,
but you chose to continue it.

82
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,040
From a businessman's perspective,

83
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,520
I can't see any benefit
you might gain from this.

84
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
How amazing.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,240
You're gaining strong business acumen.

86
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
You're right.

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,560
But what you've seen
is just the tip of the iceberg.

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,720
Let me put it this way.

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,560
If you say that our engagement contract
was a scheme,

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,960
I wouldn't deny it.

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,720
Come on. Over here.

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Why did you take me away? What about them?

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,360
You're worried about them?

94
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,480
Boss is with Ms. Xia.

95
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,800
They will be fine.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm worried about Xia Lin.

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Worried about Ms. Xia?

98
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,000
Didn't you see
how Boss protected her today?

99
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
Do you think she would be in danger?

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,320
You should worry about me instead.

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
I'm in pain.

102
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,600
How could you be injured?

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,160
You didn't even fight.

104
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,000
I was hugging you the entire afternoon.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,640
You were just taking advantage of me.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,400
I want every day to be like today.

107
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,760
I want to protect you.

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Even if I don't get physical.

109
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,880
As for why I don't want
to terminate the contract,

110
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,680
it's because of my ultimate goal

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
which is what you're asking about.

112
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,560
What do I stand to gain
from this agreement?

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,240
The greatest value in this agreement
is making you fall for me.

114
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,640
The submerged part of the iceberg
that you don't see...

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,560
is that I like you.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
I want to be with you.

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,920
If that is your objective,

118
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,920
then don't I hold all the power?

119
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,200
Ms. Xia.

120
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,840
The duration of the contract
is explicitly defined in the agreement.

121
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,880
All right.

122
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Then I unilaterally declare
the engagement contract terminated.

123
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,360
I should warn you.

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,520
A unilateral termination is considered
a breach of contract.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,400
You will have to pay a penalty.

126
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,840
Mr. Ling, that's a miscalculation
on your part.

127
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,280
Do you dare to come with me?

128
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
I don't see why not.

129
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
Where are we going?

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
You'll see.

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,120
Feifei.

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,160
Doesn't it look like
we're in matching couples outfits?

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
In that case,

134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm wearing couples outfits just like
everybody else in the stadium.

135
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,920
I have that many love rivals?

136
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,920
You don't have any love rivals!

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,799
You're the only one.

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
Look. The weather is so nice.

139
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,640
GANGDONG MUNICIPAL CIVIL AFFAIRS BUREAU

140
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,320
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION OFFICE

141
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,160
Here.

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,480
This is it.

143
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,280
Mumu, why are we here?

144
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,360
We have to end the engagement contract
before we can get married.

145
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,520
Since the engagement was your scheme,
then I'll help you succeed.

146
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
As far as I'm concerned,
marriage is a gamble.

147
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,680
Dare to take a chance?

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,040
Yes.

149
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
So long as you're not what's at stake,

150
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,120
I'll bet anything.

151
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,720
Good.

152
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,280
Once we're married, there's no letting go.

153
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
Mr. Ling, from now on,

154
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,720
please take care of me.

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

156
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,120
The office is closed at this hour.

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
How can we get married?

158
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
Let's come back tomorrow.

159
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,280
Then we'll sit here until morning

160
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,040
and wait for the doors to open.

161
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
All right.

162
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,480
We'll sit until morning.

163
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
Okay.

164
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
I'll have someone bring
my household register book.

165
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,840
Mumu.

166
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
We need to find a place to display these.

167
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,720
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

168
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,760
Right here.

169
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,640
It's such an important document.

170
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
Isn't it careless to leave them out here?

171
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,400
How so?

172
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,480
I want this to be
the first thing that people see

173
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
when they come through that door.

174
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,760
You're mine.

175
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
I still don't think it's a good idea.

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,120
What if you change your mind
or have regrets one day?

177
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
If you hide or throw them,
I'll be on the losing end of the deal.

178
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
No way. I'm keeping them safe.

179
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
All right,

180
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,120
whatever you want.

181
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
We haven't slept all night.

182
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
Time for bed?

183
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes, we need to sleep.

184
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,280
But before that,

185
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
there's something important we have to do.

186
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,840
What is it?

187
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,200
Come. I'll show you.

188
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,640
Look.

189
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Mumu, what are these?

190
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,040
I should congratulate you
on being reinstated at work.

191
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,800
These are gifts for you. Do you like them?

192
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,040
Of course I do.

193
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,040
There are so many though.

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,160
Mumu.

195
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,200
Thanks for thinking of me
when you burn through money.

196
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Congratulations, Mr. Ling.

197
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
I have you covered
for two years' worth of ties.

198
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Do ties have a special meaning?

199
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,000
We're officially married

200
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,120
and you're mine now.

201
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,240
I have to keep you tied to me.

202
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
Two years isn't enough.

203
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
These aren't enough.

204
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,720
I want a lifetime of ties from you.

205
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
You wish.

206
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
What?

207
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,080
Wake up.

208
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,480
You've been sleeping for a long time.

209
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,840
This isn't fair.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Why do you wake up so early?

211
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,360
I can't help it.

212
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,920
You can blame me.

213
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,080
Are you Pidan?

214
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,800
Have you vented enough yet?

215
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,760
It's my turn now.

216
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,840
Wait!

217
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,520
Don't you have to go to work?

218
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,000
What work?

219
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,000
The boss needs to rest.

220
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
What's the matter?

221
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,160
Are you sure your grandma
will like this outfit?

222
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,200
It won't matter

223
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,720
as long as I like it.

224
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,920
I have a mirror.

225
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,120
You're already pretty.

226
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,560
I know.

227
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,600
Grandma.

228
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,960
Mumu, I finally got to meet you.

229
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm sorry, Grandma.

230
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,360
I should have come to visit you sooner.

231
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,960
What a nice child you are.

232
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,120
You're a good girl.

233
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,080
Grandma, Mumu brought a gift for you.

234
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,520
Mumu, don't bring gifts next time.

235
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,040
Just bring yourself.

236
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
It's only proper.

237
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,040
I don't know what you like
so I bought some tonics for you.

238
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,400
I hope you'll like them.

239
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm sure I will.

240
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,640
I'll like anything you bring.

241
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,880
Mumu.

242
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,640
Have you been working
especially hard lately?

243
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
You look a bit tired.

244
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,080
Grandma, that's not it.

245
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,440
It's my fault you're tired, isn't it?

246
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,680
Mumu,

247
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,680
women mustn't exhaust themselves

248
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,680
or they will turn haggard.

249
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,360
Women should be pampered.

250
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Leave all the work to the men.

251
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,880
Mumu, come with me to the study.

252
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,560
I'll show you Yizhou's childhood photos.

253
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,960
-I want to come too.
-Come.

254
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,400
You'll see your husband's childhood photos

255
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
and nobody else's.

256
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,880
Yizhou lived here before he went abroad.

257
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm the one who raised him

258
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,040
and I've spoiled him.

259
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,320
These are full of Yizhou's photos.

260
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,280
Look.

261
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
He was one year old.

262
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,680
Isn't he cute?

263
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,040
This one was impressive.

264
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,640
This was the first time
he won a fight at school.

265
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,080
He made me take a photo of his victory.

266
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,000
-<i>He was overbearing even as a child.</i>
-Aren't these so precious?

267
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,640
Grandma, what's this photo?

268
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,000
Yizhou tore it up.

269
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,560
He tore off his mom's photo.

270
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Is this--

271
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,960
Don't touch me.

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,120
What are you doing here?

273
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,240
Leave.

274
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,080
Yizhou, I don't have any other intentions.

275
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,720
I just came to visit you.

276
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,480
Mrs. Nan.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
Are you aware that I hate you?

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
I know.

279
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,840
So please stop pretending
to be a good mom.

280
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm not your son.

281
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
Yizhou, don't be like this.

282
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,520
I know you hate me,

283
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,600
but I've missed you all these years.

284
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,760
I wanted to see you,

285
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,200
but you know that your dad and I--

286
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,160
Please drop the act!

287
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,760
Let me guess.

288
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
Is the Nan family going bankrupt?

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,040
They can't support you?

290
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,280
Or have you found true love yet again
and going to elope?

291
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,240
Yizhou!

292
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,600
Don't speak like that to guests.

293
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,520
Okay.

294
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,320
Mother.

295
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,520
I came to visit you.

296
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,760
Mrs. Nan.

297
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,000
Look around this big house.

298
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,960
There is an abundance of flowers.

299
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,880
Your bouquet is rather gaudy.

300
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,240
It doesn't fit the decor.

301
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,440
Say what you want to say
and then you can leave.

302
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,360
Let my family enjoy dinner in peace.

303
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,360
Why are you still standing here?

304
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,080
Leave.

305
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,920
Yizhou.

306
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,640
I did come to ask for your help.

307
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Our company is in trouble.

308
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,920
I wanted to ask
if my husband can take part

309
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,480
in Lingshi Group's foreign collaborations.

310
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
I knew it.

311
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,720
Are you thinking of paving the way
for your son, Nan Jintian?

312
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,680
What do you think?

313
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,800
No, you think too much.

314
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
We just want to collaborate.

315
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
The two of them don't know
that I came to see you.

316
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,160
I really have to hand it to you.

317
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,120
Have you forgotten what you've done?

318
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,280
What right do you have
to be standing here?

319
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,560
Get out.

320
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Leave!

321
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,840
Yizhou,

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,520
didn't you say that you wanted
to look at the photos?

323
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,760
Come, let's go.

324
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,520
The door is over there.

325
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,440
Hello.

326
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,440
Hello.

327
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,640
I am Xia Lin, Ling Yizhou's fiancée.

328
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Xia Lin? I know you.

329
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
I've watched your dramas.

330
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,040
They were good.

331
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,200
I am Ling Yizhou's mom.

332
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,640
Hello.

333
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,440
I'm delighted
that you and Yizhou are together.

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Right.

335
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,080
This is my favorite.

336
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
Take it.

337
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,760
No, Mrs. Nan. This is too precious.

338
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,680
I can't accept it.

339
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,160
It's okay. Take it.

340
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Yizhou is in a bad mood today.

341
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,520
I should leave.

342
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Mrs. Nan!

343
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,760
Mrs. Nan!

344
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Mrs. Nan!

345
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,800
This is such an expensive bangle.
I cannot accept it.

346
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,080
Moreover, with the situation
as it is today,

347
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
I really cannot take it.

348
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,200
Xia Lin.

349
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,200
Can you talk to Yizhou for me?

350
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
I know he can't let go
of his resentment toward me

351
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,720
and I won't ask him to forgive me.

352
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,360
I just hope that he can understand

353
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,040
I'm not as heartless as he believes.

354
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,280
What difference does it make?

355
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
Ask yourself this.

356
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,760
All these years,

357
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,720
have you ever shown him your love?

358
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,000
In the beginning,

359
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,720
I tried calling him,

360
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,600
but his dad would either hang up

361
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
or change the number.

362
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,360
Later on,

363
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,000
I tried sending gifts.

364
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,080
They were probably thrown away.

365
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,200
Did you try reaching out to him later?

366
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,560
Even after his dad passed away,

367
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,840
you never contacted him.

368
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,440
So do you have the same opinion as Yizhou?

369
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,080
Mrs. Nan.

370
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,920
It's all in the past now.

371
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,040
Staying away isn't a bad thing.

372
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
It's just that assigning blame
after the fact is pointless.

373
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,720
Since everybody has been doing well,

374
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,040
it's best not to disrupt
the current state of things.

375
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,000
No matter what reason you might have,

376
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,040
reopening old wounds

377
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,360
would be cruel.

378
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,880
Linlin.

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,280
I hope you'll allow me to call you Linlin.

380
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,520
You're still young.

381
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,400
You don't understand
the pain that one experiences

382
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,560
when faced with a dilemma

383
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,760
and forced to choose one over the other.

384
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,920
You are free to make your choice.

385
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,400
Since you chose love over responsibility,

386
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,280
you shouldn't hold out hope
for a shred of empathy from him.

387
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
I respect Ling Yizhou's decision.

388
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,320
Nobody can force him into doing
what he doesn't want to do.

389
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,400
Thank you, Mumu.

390
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,760
For what?

391
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,440
Thank you for taking my side.

392
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,800
Of course.

393
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,800
You didn't do anything wrong.

394
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,200
You're the one who was hurt.

395
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,560
Do you think I'm too stubborn
or cold-blooded?

396
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,160
Ling Yizhou.

397
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,800
You don't need to reflect on yourself.

398
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,320
Injury inflicted by family
cuts the deepest.

399
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
If I were in your shoes,

400
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,040
I might have reacted
even more strongly than you did.

401
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,920
Reconciling with family

402
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
is both the simplest
and the most difficult thing to do.

403
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,000
Chu Yan and I are in the same boat.

404
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,360
Chu Yan is an example
of the first half of that description.

405
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,760
As for me...

406
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,920
I always thought
the latter half applied to me.

407
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,480
But none of that matters anymore.

408
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,040
Because I have you.

409
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,560
You just have to make peace with yourself.

410
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,400
Even if the most difficult half
applies to you,

411
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,480
I will fill in the simplest half for you.

412
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,480
We're almost home.

413
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,880
Chu Yan.

414
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,600
-Ms. Jiang.
-I heard the news.

415
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,560
Really?

416
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,240
I guess everybody knows that

417
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm going to take over
the family business.

418
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,680
Congratulations.

419
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,880
I guess I'll be seeing you
in the financial news.

420
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,160
Given my wisdom and intelligence,
that's for sure.

421
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,680
Please look after Xia Lin from now on.

422
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,640
She's a budding star.

423
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,560
Mr. Ling is looking out for her,

424
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
but I'm sure she will still
encounter many troubles.

425
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,880
Don't worry.

426
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll take care of her.

427
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,520
I can't believe this is the last drama
you'll be working on with Xia Lin.

428
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,320
I thought you two would end up together.

429
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
I know you like her.

430
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,600
But sometimes, it's just not meant to be.

431
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,880
Yes, even though I met Xia Lin first,

432
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
but she fell for Ling Yizhou.

433
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
Yes.

434
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,760
That's fated.

435
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,040
Even so,

436
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,240
you still have a chance
since they're not married yet.

437
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,600
I didn't expect that to come from you.

438
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,920
I can tell you that

439
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,480
my love is based on respect
for the other person.

440
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,000
Since Xia Lin has made her choice,

441
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,280
I will respect her decision.

442
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,240
I once thought I loved her.

443
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,120
But after she and Ling Yizhou
got together,

444
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,280
I realized my feelings
turned into well-wishes.

445
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,800
If the two of them are happy together...

446
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,200
I'll be happy.

447
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,760
I can rest assured then.

448
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,240
I wouldn't want Xia Lin to be caught
in a love triangle.

449
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,880
Were you testing me?

450
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,600
Well, even if you don't believe me,
you should have faith in Xia Lin.

451
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,760
She's not an unfaithful woman.

452
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,120
I wish you success in your career.

453
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
You too.

454
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,120
-Bye.
-Bye.

455
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
Yushi, where are the bandages?

456
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,520
What happened?

457
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Why were you so careless? Let me see.

458
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,560
I'm not a kid anymore.
Don't treat me like one.

459
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,160
Yushi, were you
looking through my phone again?

460
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm just concerned about you.
Who's Xia Lin?

461
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,400
None of your business!

462
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,640
Jeez.

463
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,920
TINA'S KITCHEN

464
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,080
So...

465
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
As far as I know,

466
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,040
you only have one live broadcast job left.

467
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,560
You don't have any dramas,

468
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,640
commercials, or endorsements lined up.

469
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
It won't be long

470
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,880
before everybody will forget you.

471
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,520
In less than a year,

472
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,240
everybody will have no clue
who Zhen Baohui is.

473
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,240
Just tell me
what you wanted to see me for.

474
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,800
I can help you take back
what was once yours.

475
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,800
You?

476
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,800
Aren't you Xia Lin's manager?

477
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
Ms. Zhen,

478
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,240
not everything is as it seems.

479
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,280
Xia Lin's live broadcast
is from 2:20 p.m. to 2:30 p.m.

480
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,040
You have ten minutes
to work your magic on Ling Yizhou

481
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
and then you will get back
everything that was once yours.

482
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,560
He won't stay with me for that long.

483
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,960
Just mention the agreement with Xia Lin.

484
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,520
He will be interested.

485
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Agreement?

486
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,040
What agreement?

487
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't ask so many questions.

488
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,840
Just do as I say.

489
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,000
<i>Chu Yan, has it started yet?</i>

490
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,840
I just arrived.

491
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,040
<i>Relax. It's not a big deal.</i>

492
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,800
<i>Don't put pressure on yourself.</i>

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,480
<i>If this doesn't work out,
we have other options.</i>

494
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
Do you think I haven't seen our accounts?

495
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,560
Given the current state of our company,

496
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,520
they're the only business willing
to sit down and have a talk with us.

497
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,080
<i>I know how important this deal is.</i>

498
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,640
<i>Don't worry. Get some rest.</i>

499
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
Thank you for your efforts.

500
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,000
Now you're making me nervous.

501
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,280
This is even more nerve-racking
than being onstage.

502
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,160
<i>That's because you care about the outcome.</i>

503
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,040
All right, I can't talk.

504
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,840
-I'm heading in.
<i>-Okay.</i>

505
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,160
I'm counting on you, Mr. Chu.

506
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Not at all.

507
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,960
I have to thank you
for your company's support.

508
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,360
You're a promising young man.

509
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,280
I'm optimistic
about your company's future growth.

510
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,040
I just took over
and am not familiar with the company yet.

511
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,200
I hope you won't find me annoying
if I come to you for advice.

512
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,320
Based on your performance
at the negotiating table just now,

513
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,560
you don't seem like a rookie.

514
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,400
That means my acting has improved.

515
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,000
Come over for dinner in a few days.

516
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,360
My daughter is a big fan of yours.

517
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,360
She's always watching your dramas
and paying me no attention.

518
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,240
In the past, I always asked Mr. Ling
for your autograph.

519
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,800
Now, I can come to you.

520
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,160
He never told me.

521
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
I wasn't a stuck-up star.

522
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,960
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

523
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,720
I'll definitely be visiting.

524
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,520
I'll have to thank your daughter
for her support.

525
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,360
All right, it's a deal.

526
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,840
-After you.
-Please.

527
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,840
Okay.

528
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,520
Isn't Mr. Chu that celebrity?

529
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,920
He certainly stands out from the crowd.

530
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,320
Celebrities are still human.

531
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,680
Nothing is amazing about him
except for his looks.

532
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,600
True, if it weren't
for Mr. Ling's recommendation,

533
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,640
he wouldn't even be a consideration.

534
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,600
Exactly.

535
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,160
Even if they turn out to be unreliable,
we can count on Lingshi to back them.

536
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
Mr. Chu, the boss is busy!

537
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,200
You can't come in!

538
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,440
Yizhou!

539
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,280
Did you have a hand in Puhua's contract?

540
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,920
Don't leave.

541
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,360
Do you have something to hide?

542
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,800
Chu Yan.

543
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,720
Did you come to thank me?
That's not necessary.

544
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,960
However, you seem
more critical than grateful.

545
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,760
Do you have doubts that I can make it
in the world of finance on my own?

546
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,400
I did recommend you to Puhua.

547
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,480
But they wouldn't have agreed
to collaborate with you

548
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,720
if they had no faith in you.

549
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
The problem is that
you don't believe in yourself

550
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,920
or you wouldn't have come to question me.

551
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,840
You question your own capabilities.

552
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
Get me a cup of coffee.

553
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,840
Okay.

554
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,560
I don't doubt myself.

555
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
I didn't need your recommendation.

556
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,600
Chu Yan,

557
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,920
business is like showbiz.

558
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
You need connections.

559
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,240
Very few people can succeed on their own.

560
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,360
You've been in showbiz for so long.

561
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,480
Don't tell me you don't understand that.

562
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,080
I will be very grateful
if you recommend Lingshi Group to others.

563
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,960
Okay.

564
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,880
I didn't discuss it with you in advance.

565
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,320
I'll be more mindful in the future.

566
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,600
I don't know what else to say.

567
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,199
What more do you want?

568
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,239
Are you done?

569
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
If so, you can leave now.

570
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,760
I was wrong, okay?

571
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,719
Yizhou, are you surprised?

572
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,120
Caught off guard?

573
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,199
I finally duped you.

574
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Were you acting?

575
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,600
Why? Was it a bad act?

576
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,880
As expected from the winner
of the Best Actor Award.

577
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,400
What a good act.

578
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,440
All right.

579
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,880
I came to thank you,

580
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
but you taught me a lesson instead.

581
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,040
What time do you get off today?

582
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,960
Let's go have a drink.

583
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,880
-I'm busy.
-Hey.

584
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,160
Seriously?

585
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,720
You're actually mad at me?
Don't be so petty.

586
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm picking up Mumu.

587
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,360
What happened to the bro code?

588
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,360
You're so petty.

589
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
The coffee still
hasn't been brought to me!

590
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,880
Mr. Chu, here's your coffee.

591
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,040
Thank you.

592
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,000
Hello, everyone.

593
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,400
Thanks for tuning in live today.

594
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm your host, Mi.

595
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Let's welcome our first guest.

596
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
The renowned singer, Lunlun.

597
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,960
Lunlun, why don't you
give our viewers a greeting?

598
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,120
-Hello, everyone. I'm Lunlun.
-Ms. Jiang!

599
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,120
-I'm so excited to be here.
-Why are you so late?

600
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,040
I got held up in traffic.

601
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,240
You made it on time.

602
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,640
Mr. Ling didn't come with you?

603
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,000
He's coming from work,
so he's stuck in traffic.

604
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Is it almost my turn?

605
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
There's still time.

606
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,600
Familiarize yourself with the script.

607
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,120
Yuyuan, put my bag in my dressing room.

608
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,120
Sure.

609
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,800
SOHU LIVE SCRIPT

610
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,760
Let's go.

611
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,760
ZHEN BAOHUI, XIA LIN

612
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
XIA LIN

613
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,240
ZHEN BAOHUI

614
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,520
XIA LIN

615
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
ZHEN BAOHUI

616
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,240
XIA LIN

617
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,840
Now, let's say goodbye.

618
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,040
-Bye!
-Bye!

619
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,480
-Ready?
-Yes.

620
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,400
How much time left?

621
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,040
Ten minutes. Make good use of it.

622
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
Give it to me. She's still prepping.

623
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,440
She'll be up there alone.

624
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm afraid she'll get nervous
if she sees Ling Yizhou.

625
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,720
So when he gets here,

626
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,680
take him directly
to Xia Lin's dressing room.

627
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,160
-Got it?
-Okay.

628
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,200
Go on.

629
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,400
This is Xia Lin's dressing room.

630
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,600
All right. Go take care of Mumu.

631
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,640
-I can wait by myself.
-Okay.

632
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,080
XIA LIN, ZHEN BAOHUI

633
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,640
<i>Ms. Xia, can you share with us
any secrets to love?</i>

634
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
<i>Sure.</i>

635
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,720
<i>I think that mutual trust is key.</i>

636
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,520
<i>There are many things that
a couple will have to face together.</i>

637
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,880
<i>I don't think
a relationship will last long</i>

638
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,320
<i>if a basic level of trust is missing</i>

639
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Mr. Ling?

640
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,680
It has been a long time.

641
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,360
You're in the wrong room.

642
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,560
Do you want some coffee?

643
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,440
No, thank you. Please leave.

644
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,320
Mr. Ling, don't be so cold.

645
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,760
I wanted to talk to you
about your agreement with Xia Lin.

646
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,000
You have three minutes.

647
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,960
Yuyuan, is Mr. Ling here yet?

648
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,200
He's in your dressing room.

649
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,680
Mr. Ling, don't do this!

650
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
ZHEN BAOHUI

651
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,640
Mumu.

652
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,280
What's going on?

653
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,120
He just...

654
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,880
If I hadn't used all my strength
to throw him off,

655
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,440
he would have had his way with me!

656
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
You should explain.

657
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,360
Your clothes are still on.

658
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,360
How could Ling Yizhou have
had his way with you?

659
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,640
That doesn't even seem remotely possible.

660
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,680
I was resting in my dressing room.

661
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,920
He came in and tore at my clothes!

662
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,040
-What's happening?
-What's with the fuss?

663
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,800
Why would he go into your room?

664
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,200
The name on the door
is displayed so clearly.

665
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,800
He wouldn't have entered the wrong room.

666
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,080
How would I know?

667
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,000
My name is on that door.
It's my dressing room!

668
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
I get it.

669
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,960
You're all in on this.

670
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,960
Did you set this up to frame me?

671
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,840
I'm going to expose you
and show everybody your true nature!

672
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,360
Okay, that's enough.

673
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,560
You're laying it on too thick.

674
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,920
Don't try to frame anyone
with your level of acting.

675
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,920
Haven't you ever read the comments online
critiquing your acting?

676
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,520
You only express emotion by shrieking
and stare wide-eyed for crying scenes.

677
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,880
Can't you come up with anything new?

678
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,320
-You--
-What?

679
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,920
You should take the criticism gracefully.

680
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,320
How can you accuse me of lying?

681
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,720
<i>Mr. Ling, I really admire you.</i>

682
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,760
<i>I don't need to be your only one.</i>

683
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,560
<i>I'll be content as long as
I get to see you once in a while.</i>

684
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
<i>This is Xia Lin's dressing room.
Please leave.</i>

685
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,160
I wanted to talk to you
about your agreement with Xia Lin.

686
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,760
NEW RECORDING

687
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,360
You have three minutes.

688
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,760
AUDIO RECORDING

689
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,960
Zhen Baohui, I reserve the right
to sue you for slandering my husband.

690
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,040
Please mind your actions from now on.

691
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Come on.

692
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,120
My Mumu is the best.

693
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
Of course.

694
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,400
Wait, Ling Yizhou.

695
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,400
Why didn't you show the recording
from the start

696
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,800
instead of calmly watching
as I defend you?

697
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,120
You stepped in before I could take it out.

698
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,320
I didn't get a chance.

699
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,680
How did you
get the idea to record Zhen Baohui?

700
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,840
It's a habit I have from work
to take precautions.

701
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,360
Have you ever recorded me
without my knowledge?

702
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,160
Why would I record you for no reason?

703
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,520
Have you done something behind my back?

704
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,760
I have a clear conscience.

705
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
All right, I have to go to work.

706
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,720
One more.

707
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,040
See you.

708
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,360
Bye.

709
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,400
Ling Yizhou.

710
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,720
You'll learn the consequences
if you ever screw around.

711
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,600
Ling Yizhou?

712
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
What are you doing?

713
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,240
-I'm watching business news.
-Liar.

714
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,040
You were watching my drama.

715
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,000
No.

716
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,760
Were you watching my drama
because you missed me?

717
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,680
No.

718
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,880
-I can give you a live performance.
-I...

719
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,840
Romance? Comedy?

720
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,200
-Horror?
-I really was watching...

721
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,920
-I really was watching business news.
-I don't believe you.

722
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,080
-Liar.
-Mumu.

723
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,840
Ms. Jiang.

724
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,560
Mr. Ling, aren't you going
to wait for Xia Lin?

725
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,280
Didn't I warn you about the contract?

726
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,360
I don't understand what you're saying.

727
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,240
I didn't show it to anybody.

728
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,720
This is my last warning.

729
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,720
Mumu is where I draw the line.

730
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,160
Tread carefully.

731
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,560
I think you're right about one thing.

732
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm beginning to believe in astrology.

733
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,880
I don't think we're a good fit.

734
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,240
Sorry!

735
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,200
