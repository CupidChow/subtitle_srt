1
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,440
Is this also a part of fencing etiquette?

2
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,200
Xia Lin and I

3
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,400
are already engaged.

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
-Right?
-What a match.

5
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,360
-Quickly.
-Take photos.

6
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,160
What's done is done.

8
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Mumu has been my fiancée
for some time now.

9
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
"What's done is done"?

10
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
"Already engaged"?

11
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,040
Mr. Ling, where did you get this idea?

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Is that a compliment?

13
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,880
Weren't we supposed to clarify the rumors?

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,240
Didn't I do just that?

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,080
Didn't you see how well-received that was?

16
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,320
Didn't you want to clarify
that we're not in a relationship?

17
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,560
Ms. Xia, when did I agree to say
that we're not in a relationship?

18
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
I only agreed to help you.

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,040
And my PR team will work out
the best solution. That's all.

20
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
-But--
-But?

21
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,880
You didn't make any denials
in front of the press either.

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,120
Well...

23
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,640
That's because I--

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,520
Because you followed me to the restroom?

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Mr. Ling.

26
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,040
Do you know the impact

27
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,280
an engagement will have
on a budding actress?

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
Ms. Jiang,

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
here's a question for you.

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,160
As Ms. Xia's manager,

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
you allowed your artist
to be caught in such a situation.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
You couldn't control the public backlash
and relied on us to clean up the mess.

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
So what have you done?

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
You failed to act
when the scandal first broke.

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,920
At this point,
how can you stop the negative news?

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,880
Ms. Xia, the PR team came up
with the best solution

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
that minimizes damage to our reputations.

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,880
If you and Mr. Ling are a couple,

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,680
the leaked video will merely show
two lovers flirting.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
If you two are simply dating,

41
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,360
others would claim it
as just a part of the PR tactic.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,960
But if the two of you are engaged,

43
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,120
it would be a completely different story.

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Fine.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,320
I can see your point.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,960
But we can't announce our breakup
right after we revealed we're engaged.

47
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,200
Who says we're breaking up?

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,440
What do you mean?

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,440
Don't get the wrong idea.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,400
I mean to say that

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,200
we can sign an engagement agreement
under mutually beneficial conditions.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,000
We'll act as lovers
during the agreed period

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,720
and we'll regain our freedom
once the contract expires.

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,519
Are you talking about
a contract engagement?

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
You can take it that way.

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,240
Ms. Xia, you have time to think about it.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,000
If it's unacceptable to you,
we can announce our break up tomorrow.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Well...

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,840
Let me think about it.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
You have five minutes.

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,840
Ms. Xia, the press hasn't left yet.

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,640
You still have the option to back out.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
I need to use the restroom.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
<i>This plan isn't half bad.</i>

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,400
It dispels all negative rumors at once.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,040
There are so many reporters outside.

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
If they discover the truth,
your acting career won't have a future.

68
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
It's no big deal though.

69
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,120
You'll just go back to being
an unrecognized actress.

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
That's not what I'm worried about.

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't want to lie
to my fans or the public.

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,600
It doesn't seem right.
It'll eat at my conscience.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,480
I just want to be true to myself.

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,400
I don't see the problem.

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
Don't you have suspicions
that he is that man?

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
Even if you don't do it
for your own career,

77
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
you should take your feelings
into consideration.

78
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Besides, what if he is the one for you?

79
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,280
LINGSHI GROUP

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,120
-Wen Li, prepare another press conference.
-Yes, Boss.

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Wait.

82
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,320
I want to speak with Mr. Ling in private.

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
This way, Ms. Jiang.

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Have you made your decision?

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
I agree with your proposal.

86
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
Here's to working together.

87
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,240
It may be a contract engagement,
but it will still be legally binding.

88
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,600
As a businessman, I value trust

89
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
and also benefits.

90
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,480
I hope you will strictly adhere
to the terms of the contract.

91
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,680
PARTY A: LING YIZHOU, PARTY B: XIA LIN

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,880
The first parts are fine.

93
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,080
"Maintain communication on WeChat
and exchange greetings morning and night."

94
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
That's fine.

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
But is it necessary?

96
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,640
This is to make us seem
more like a real couple.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
LING

98
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,960
Don't you need to get into character?

99
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm surprised.

100
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,400
You know quite a lot about acting.

101
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,680
"Xia's Baby Zhou"?

102
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,320
Interesting name.

103
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
What's the name you entered for me?

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,440
Ling's Mumu.

105
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,560
This will help you get into character.

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,800
How thoughtful of you.

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,640
Since I'm the other party
in this agreement,

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,280
do I also have the right
to add stipulations?

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
Of course.

110
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
I only have one condition.

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,280
Do not interfere with my work.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,280
Not a problem.

113
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
PARTY A'S SIGNATURE: LING YIZHOU,
PARTY B'S SIGNATURE: XIA LIN

114
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
Good morning.

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,120
<i>Good morning.</i>

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I guess he is
an all-or-nothing kind of guy.

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,360
<i>Send me some cute memes and emoticons.</i>

118
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
BUT I'M SO CUTE. CAN'T YOU BE NICER TO ME?

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
CUTE

120
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,880
Ling Yizhou sure has a lot of free time.

121
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
<i>I'll pick you up at 5 p.m.</i>

122
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,800
<i>Today is the first day</i>

123
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,000
<i>you will fulfill your obligations
as Mrs. Ling.</i>

124
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
<i>Everyone, please share your emoticons.
The more the better.</i>

125
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
<i>-What's going on?
-The boss is in such a good mood today.</i>

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>Does anyone know why?</i>

127
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,200
<i>Does this mean
we don't need to work overtime?</i>

128
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
<i>It's a beautiful day to go out.</i>

129
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,480
Have a seat.

130
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Not here.

131
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,680
Here.

132
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,400
Is it all right for me to sit here?

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,280
You're in Mrs. Ling's seat.

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,040
There's nothing wrong with that.

135
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,120
This restaurant business seems slow.

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,720
Why aren't there any other customers?

137
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
It seems like a poor choice.

138
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
You didn't want to be photographed, right?

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
Did you...

140
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Did you reserve the entire restaurant?

141
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
Do you want to be photographed?

142
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,240
Don't we want to be seen as a couple?

143
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Okay, we'll go somewhere crowded
for our next date.

144
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
How about a street food stall?

145
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
Are you hungry?

146
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,800
Try it and see if you like it.

147
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
It's not bad.

148
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,520
The best is yet to come.
The main course will be out soon.

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm full.

150
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,880
You ate so little.

151
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm in showbiz. I am an actress.

152
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,880
I am a beautiful actress.

153
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,200
Don't you know that actresses need to diet
to stay in shape?

154
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,440
No idea.

155
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,360
I wouldn't mind if you were fat.

156
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,880
Fat actresses
don't get any roles, Mr. Ling.

157
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,160
That's not a big deal.

158
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,760
I can support you, Mrs. Ling.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,680
Why are we watching a movie?

160
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,760
Don't you like crowded places?

161
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,480
Besides, we haven't completed
our mission of being photographed yet.

162
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,520
Men who drive fast are so hot.

163
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
-Boss.
-Wen Li, you don't need to drive today.

164
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,640
<i>Linlin, can you come to the office?</i>

165
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,880
Mumu, get in.

166
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
I need to go to the office.

167
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,800
I can drive you.

168
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,440
-Get in.
-Okay.

169
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,760
Ling Yizhou?

170
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,320
Can we go a little faster?

171
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,000
Driving slowly is safe.

172
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,880
Isn't this excessively safe?

173
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
Are you a backseat driver?

174
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Even runners are faster than us.

175
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,120
The cars behind us
keep flashing their headlights.

176
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
Can't you speed up a little?

177
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
Who cares about them?

178
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
Pull over up ahead.

179
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,480
I'll take a taxi.

180
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
No, I'll drive you.

181
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,760
Then I probably won't arrive at the office
until tomorrow morning.

182
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,080
Mumu, do you like men who drive fast?

183
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Hold tight.

184
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,600
Is this better?

185
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,920
Do you have to go so fast?

186
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,480
No talking. I need to focus.

187
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
When will you be done? I'll pick you up.

188
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
No, thank you.

189
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,080
I don't know when I'll be done here.

190
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,040
You see?

191
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Driving fast is dangerous.

192
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Right, thank you.

193
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
My purse!

194
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
Ms. Jiang, I'm here!

195
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,240
That was fast.

196
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
I thought it would take you a while.

197
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,160
What did you need to see me for?

198
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Did I get a new job?

199
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
Your engagement with Ling Yizhou
improved your public reputation.

200
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,320
Netizens are being very supportive.

201
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,160
Even <i>Kindred Spirits</i> has seen
a boost in ratings.

202
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,760
That's incredible.

203
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,880
I chose a few media outlets
and filtered their interview questions.

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,480
Take a look through them today.

205
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
The live broadcast
will be done here tomorrow.

206
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Hey.

207
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,400
Hey!

208
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,120
Did you go on a date with Ling Yizhou?

209
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Is it that obvious?

210
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,480
Take a look in the mirror, will you?

211
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Don't tell me that something is going on.

212
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,360
It's not just something. It's everything!

213
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,840
Enough joking.

214
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,080
By the way, your medical report is back.

215
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,320
There's nothing serious.
You're just a little anemic.

216
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,440
Just take note of that.

217
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank goodness.

218
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
My nightmare didn't come true.

219
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,440
Everything is looking up!

220
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,520
Looking up!

221
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,800
-Don't lose the Internet connection.
-Okay.

222
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
Linlin, let me introduce you.

223
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,960
This is today's host, Luo.

224
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,680
Luo, we're in your hands today.

225
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,800
Of course.

226
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,359
I really like Ms. Xia's new drama.

227
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,960
I look forward to working with you.

228
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,280
Okay. Now that you two have met,
take your seats.

229
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
All right, let's get ready.

230
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,560
Linlin, remember to smile.

231
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,800
We can begin now.

232
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,680
Hello, my dears. Have you missed me?

233
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
We are live on <i>The Amazing Idol</i>.

234
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
<i>It's currently 4:28 p.m.</i>

235
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,240
Our guest today is sitting
right next to me.

236
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,040
I can't hear your cheers,

237
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,440
but I like to imagine that
you're all clapping to welcome her.

238
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,960
Let's all welcome our guest, Xia Lin!

239
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,320
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

240
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Hello, Luo. I am Xia Lin.

241
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,360
I play Xia Shanshan in <i>Kindred Spirits</i>.

242
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,200
<i>Thank you for all your support
and attention lately.</i>

243
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
TALKING PIG THROWS OUT A ROTTEN EGG

244
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,400
WATCH THIS ULTIMATE SHAM

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,240
Keep going.

246
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,600
We can see that our fans are very excited.

247
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
We already have over one million viewers.

248
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
<i>Ms. Xia, did you ever imagine that
this drama would become so popular?</i>

249
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,960
<i>I never expected that</i>

250
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,520
<i>my role as Xia Shanshan would receive
so many hateful comments.</i>

251
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
But this also shows that
everyone likes my performance.

252
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,000
I also find it amusing

253
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,600
when people online are
warning off Xia Shanshan.

254
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
You're all so cute.

255
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,400
That's right.

256
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,200
Our viewers are also very enthusiastic.

257
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,080
We also have to congratulate you
on your engagement.

258
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
Congratulations!

259
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Thank you.

260
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,680
Seeing your glowing smile,

261
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,160
I would like to ask what kind of person
your other half is like.

262
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,240
He's very caring and considerate.

263
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
<i>We have very busy schedules,</i>

264
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,120
<i>but we do our best
to make time for each other.</i>

265
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,320
<i>Have you thought about
clearing out some time</i>

266
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,880
<i>to plan your wedding</i>

267
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
<i>or prepare for a honeymoon?</i>

268
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,640
<i>At present, I'm focusing on my career.</i>

269
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,080
<i>I haven't thought about the wedding yet.</i>

270
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,040
<i>You're in your prime right now.</i>

271
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
<i>Do you have any other plans?</i>

272
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,600
<i>I will work hard to show you
more of my acting talents.</i>

273
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,920
<i>I hope all of you will continue
to support me.</i>

274
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
<i>That's all for today's program.</i>

275
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,480
Until next week!

276
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
See you next time!

277
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,840
That was a success. Thank you, Luo.

278
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,520
Not at all. It was my pleasure.

279
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,560
We'll be leaving now.

280
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,160
Let's go.

281
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
That was great.

282
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,120
Did you pay people
to write supportive comments?

283
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,240
As if I would pay such dumb supporters.

284
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,000
Do you think your rival did it?

285
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,360
What kind of rival would spend
a hundred thousand on gifts

286
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
just to prank me?

287
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,720
That's foolish.

288
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,160
Your popularity has soared
because of your engagement.

289
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,560
I was contacted by a variety show,
<i>Romantic Departure</i>, a few days ago.

290
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,440
They invite you and Ling Yizhou
to join the show

291
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,960
to film your daily life as a couple.

292
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,400
I did some searching online.
The show is quite popular.

293
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,840
Going on the show
will help your reputation and image.

294
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,200
Ms. Jiang, you know Ling Yizhou and I...

295
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,560
aren't a real-life couple.

296
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,920
We don't get along.

297
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,520
We'll be exposed if we go to the show.

298
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,120
Besides, I don't want to mix
my personal life and work.

299
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,240
When did Ling Yizhou
become a part of your life?

300
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,840
You don't have any acting jobs.

301
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320
You desperately need the exposure.

302
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
This variety show
is an excellent opportunity.

303
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,560
Even if I agree to it,
Ling Yizhou wouldn't.

304
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,160
Not necessarily.

305
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,040
It was his idea to get engaged.

306
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,880
So many people are saying
it's just an act.

307
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,320
If such opinions continue to brew,

308
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,840
it would be detrimental
for him and Lingshi Group.

309
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Look at me.

310
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,920
Besides, I already accepted the offer.

311
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,080
We'll have to pay a hefty sum
if we break the contract.

312
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,080
I...

313
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,800
I can't afford it.

314
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,400
What?

315
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,080
Chu Yan, let's get going.

316
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,360
The director is getting impatient.

317
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,480
Right. Is your phone getting a signal?

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,840
No.

319
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,960
Just bear with it for another two days.

320
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,760
We'll be heading back then.

321
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,320
-All right.
-Let's go.

322
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,000
<i>-This way, please.
-Okay.</i>

323
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,040
LINGSHI GROUP

324
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
Mr. Ling is in a meeting.
He will be here shortly.

325
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,440
Okay, we'll wait here.

326
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,080
How about some coffee?

327
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,080
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

328
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,160
This is my first time
in a chairman's office.

329
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,640
It's not that impressive.

330
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,000
The ones in my scripts are more luxurious.

331
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,280
What do you know?

332
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,680
He likes to maintain a low profile.

333
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,840
Besides, there aren't that many tycoons.

334
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,560
Mrs. Ling, you adjusted to your role
quite quickly.

335
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,720
You're hitting me
while I'm down, aren't you?

336
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,480
Sorry, I was held up.

337
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,360
-Thank you for waiting.
-It's okay.

338
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,240
This is my friend, Jia Fei.

339
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Hello, Ms. Jia.

340
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,440
Be careful.

341
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,680
Ms. Jia?

342
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
Linlin,

343
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,360
I suddenly remembered
I haven't finished my work yet.

344
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,440
I need to go.

345
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,600
Take your time talking. Bye.

346
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,360
Wen Li can drive you if you're in a hurry.

347
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
No, thank you.

348
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,200
She's probably busy writing
for a new drama.

349
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,000
Wen Li, give her a ride.

350
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,200
-Sit, Mumu.
-Okay.

351
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
Ms. Jia, I'll see you down.

352
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,480
No, thank you.

353
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,720
Was it you at the fencing club?

354
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,960
It wasn't me!

355
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
Was it you at the bar?

356
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,480
Like I said, it wasn't me!

357
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,240
It wasn't?

358
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
That can't be.

359
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,480
The ring!

360
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,640
My manager accepted a variety show for me.

361
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,200
I didn't want to bother you.

362
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
But due to the unusual circumstances,

363
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,280
I hope you'll take part
in the show with me.

364
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,920
<i>ROMANTIC DEPARTURE</i> PROPOSAL

365
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
There's a reason you need to participate,

366
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,280
but I don't, right?

367
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,880
Everybody knows we're engaged now.

368
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,240
But because it happened so suddenly,
there are a lot of doubts.

369
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
It's also stated in our contract.

370
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,000
"We need to increase our exposure

371
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,600
to prove the authenticity
of our relationship."

372
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,560
This is the best way to do so.

373
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,040
One more thing.

374
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
I had a live interview recently

375
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
and there were a bunch of paid supporters

376
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,080
who submitted idiotic and fake comments.

377
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,520
That has led to even more people
having suspicions about our relationship.

378
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,200
So we desperately need this show
to deceive...

379
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,000
I mean, to suppress such suspicions.

380
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,080
I'll do it.

381
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,480
Hello, Wen Li?

382
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,240
Contact Cheng Li.

383
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
Push my meeting with him next week.

384
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,880
Yes.

385
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,320
Also, please tell him
I've reviewed his proposal and I like it.

386
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
Okay. That's all.

387
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,960
I'm sorry.

388
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,880
I won't trouble you
with this sort of thing again.

389
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,800
It won't happen again.

390
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
Why are you sorry?

391
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,840
I would never accept an unprofitable deal.

392
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,200
True to your businessman nature.

393
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
So what conditions do you have?

394
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,560
If I'm going to be on the show,

395
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,080
we can't make any mistakes
in front of the film crew.

396
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,200
I want to rehearse beforehand.

397
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
You're quite dedicated to the act.

398
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
Starting tomorrow,
come to my house for rehearsals.

399
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,200
What's this?

400
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,880
I had Wen Li write up
the story of how we met.

401
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,560
We need to get our stories straight
in case anyone asks.

402
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,960
Mr. Wen sure is skilled at everything.

403
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,840
"The event was about to start

404
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
<i>and Xia Lin was rushing to the venue.</i>

405
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,200
Since then,
the two have been inseparable."

406
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,040
This is so corny!

407
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,720
How is it compared to the real story?

408
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,320
At least the actual experience
didn't defy any laws of physics.

409
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,120
We embraced and spun in circles.

410
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,560
Were we waltzing?

411
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,000
If we were kissing like that,
we would have chipped our front teeth.

412
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,920
How should we have kissed?

413
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,840
At least like...

414
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,320
Why are we discussing this?

415
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,680
I just mean that the more we reveal,
the more likely we'll slip up.

416
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,640
We're better off saying
we met at an event.

417
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,440
You were mesmerized by my beauty,

418
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,240
fell hopelessly in love with me
at first sight

419
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,280
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

420
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,840
I had no choice but to accept you.

421
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,880
-Sure, let's go with that.
-It's just nonsense.

422
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,280
No, I think it's great.

423
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,240
Hungry?

424
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,080
Are you going to cook?

425
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,440
Don't you want to try my cooking?

426
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,160
I don't want to trouble you.

427
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,280
All right. I'll explore your place.

428
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>Romantic Departure</i> announced
their guest lineups today.

429
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,960
Who's included?

430
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,000
Niko, Wang Peng, Xia Lin, and Ling Yizhou.

431
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,280
Which Xia Lin?

432
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,800
The one you know.

433
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,680
Xia Lin got onto a reality show?

434
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,560
A reality dating show?

435
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,920
Yes. They are engaged, right?

436
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,040
They will be showing off
how sweet they are.

437
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,600
Engaged?

438
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,600
They announced it a few days ago.

439
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,800
You were away filming at the time.

440
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,120
How can they be engaged?

441
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,000
It must be fake.

442
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,480
It can't be true.

443
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,320
Hello, Chu Yan.

444
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
<i>Did you wrap up filming?</i>

445
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
What did Ling Yizhou do to you?

446
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,400
Are you and Ling Yizhou engaged?

447
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,880
You just found out?

448
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,040
I thought you already saw the news.

449
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,640
Well, I'm sorry.

450
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,920
I must be the last person on Earth
to find out.

451
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,640
What's going on
between you and Ling Yizhou?

452
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,880
You didn't know him at the charity gala.

453
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,480
I knew him.

454
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,920
I was just messing with you.

455
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,720
Really? Then why didn't you
tell me about him?

456
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
<i>We agreed to keep it a secret.</i>

457
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,360
Not even my manager knew about it.

458
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,080
Didn't you say
you wanted to focus on your career?

459
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
Why the sudden change of heart?

460
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
That's how life is.

461
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,960
It's full of surprises.

462
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,680
Mumu, come give me a hand.

463
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,040
Okay, I'm coming.

464
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,960
Are you with Ling Yizhou?

465
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,760
I'm at his house.

466
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,280
Who's on the phone?

467
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
<i>Chu Yan.</i>

468
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,080
Put him on the phone.

469
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,440
He wants to talk to you.

470
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,960
Hello?

471
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,560
Childish.

472
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,680
Did he hang up?

473
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,560
What did Chu Yan say?

474
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,760
He told me

475
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,800
your cooking is delicious.

476
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
He's lying.

477
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,080
I don't think
I'll be very helpful in the kitchen.

478
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
-I should get out--
-You can help.

479
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Can you wash these for me?

480
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
Okay.

481
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,520
He's still acting like
a three-year-old child.

482
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,640
How long have you known each other?

483
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,720
Unfortunately,
since we were three years old.

484
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,600
Ling Yizhou.

485
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,160
Have you ever watched the film <i>Zorro</i>?

486
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,920
Why?

487
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Did you attend a masquerade two years ago?

488
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,200
Did you wear a gold and silver mask

489
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
with a lipstick print on its right side?

490
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,640
Do you wish that I was there?

491
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,840
Just tell me yes or no.

492
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,400
I usually don't go to such events.

493
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,320
By the way, I have to remind you.

494
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
Even though we are
only in a contract relationship,

495
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,920
I would like for us
to be faithful to each other

496
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,600
during the contract period, my dear wife.

497
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,880
I can do it myself.

498
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,160
I can do it.

499
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,720
All done.

500
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,080
Is there anything else you need help with?

501
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,000
Wash the vegetables.

502
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,160
That's right. Wash them.

503
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
You cut your finger! You're bleeding!

504
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,280
Open your mouth! Right now!

505
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
Suck on it to disinfect it.

506
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,560
Wait here. I'll go get a bandage.

507
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,199
Goodness.

508
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,600
One, two, and three.

509
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,000
It's terrifying
how many cameras there are.

510
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,120
There's even one here.
Is getting a drink worth filming?

511
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,960
It's necessary for capturing
the desired footage for the show.

512
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,040
Following the rules for the film crew,

513
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,000
we'll hold on to your luggage
for the time being.

514
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,880
We'll be providing you
with daily essentials later.

515
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,560
Don't worry. We will cooperate with you.

516
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,680
Are we receiving a mission or something?

517
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
Isn't that how these shows usually go?

518
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,200
-A dog?
-A dog?

519
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,760
It's so cute!

520
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,400
What a cutie. What's your name?

521
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,800
This dog will be in your care
during the three days that you're here.

522
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
Really?

523
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,840
That's awesome.
Ling Yizhou, let's give it a name.

524
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,480
Take it away.

525
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,000
Go away.

526
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
And delete this footage.

527
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
I heard you love small animals.

528
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,480
If you had a chance to get a pet,
would Mr. Ling agree to it?

529
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,640
I believe he'll be okay with it.

530
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,360
Can you keep it leashed up?

531
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,600
Hold on to its leash.

532
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,880
What if it runs over here?

533
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
Look at how cute it is.

534
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,720
Have some love, will you?

535
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
What do you mean? I just...

536
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,680
Isn't there anything you're afraid of?

537
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,520
Lower your voice. You'll scare it.

538
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,880
You can keep it,

539
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,120
but you have to set
clear boundaries for it.

540
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,000
It's not allowed to step foot
into our living areas.

541
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,960
Hey.

542
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,040
I'm talking to you.
What are you looking at?

543
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,880
"Dear Mom and Dad, please give me a bath."

544
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,880
-What did you say?
-A bath.

545
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,320
Is he fighting with a dog
over the bathroom?

546
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,600
Ignore him. We'll take a bath in a bit.

547
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,000
Hello, Mr. Ling.

548
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,440
Thank you so much for coming to our show.

549
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,880
You are extremely successful in business.

550
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,720
But according to rumors,

551
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,680
you rarely accept interviews

552
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,440
much less take part in variety shows.

553
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,440
Can I ask why you chose
to take part in our show?

554
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,080
To earn money to support Mumu.

555
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,440
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

556
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,120
Let's give him some time.

557
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,320
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

558
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,200
Let's give him some time.

559
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

560
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,680
Let's give him some time.

561
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,760
Traveler's diarrhea?

562
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,400
Mumu.

563
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,160
-What?
-There's no more shampoo.

564
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,800
It's on the bottom half of the shelf.

565
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,240
I can't find it. Can you get it?

566
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
Fine, I'll get it for you.

567
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,920
A towel?

568
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,760
-It's mine.
-Whose?

569
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,440
-Mine.
-So you're...

570
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,800
Naked.

571
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
