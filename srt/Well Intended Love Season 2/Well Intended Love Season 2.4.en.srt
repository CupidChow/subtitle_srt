1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

2
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,560
Let's give him some time.

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,760
Let's give him some time.

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,800
Mr. Ling Yizhou is suffering
from traveler's diarrhea.

6
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,400
Let's give him some time.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,480
Traveler's diarrhea?

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,040
Mumu.

9
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,680
-What?
-There's no more shampoo.

10
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,080
It's on the bottom half of the shelf.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,160
I can't find it. Can you get it?

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Fine, I'll get it for you.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,280
A towel?

14
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,280
-It's mine.
-Whose?

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,000
-Mine.
-So you're...

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
Naked.

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
Mr. Fu,

18
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I heard you were college classmates
with Ling Yizhou.

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,160
That was a long time ago.

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
Why would you bring that up, Mr. Jin?

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,440
I'm always cautious

22
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,080
when choosing who I work with.

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,480
I'm worried

24
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
that you won't be able to do it

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,480
because of your friendship.

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
You must be kidding, Mr. Jin.

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,680
He was born into the Ling family
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,560
And I...

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm just an ordinary person. I'm nobody.

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
With such different backgrounds,

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
do you think we'd still be friends?

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,800
That's true.

33
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,240
He has been able
to live luxuriously off of his family.

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,880
Recently, he's even had the time
to go on a show with an actress.

35
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,600
He would never be able
to manage the company well.

36
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,960
In my opinion,

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,200
you're much more capable than him, Mr. Fu.

38
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,920
Take this

39
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
and get everything done.

40
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,520
Don't worry.

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,960
Once you're done,

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,560
I'll definitely fulfill
the promises I've made to you.

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,080
This is a serious matter.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
I only have this one chance.

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,640
It's now or nothing.

46
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Mr. Fu.

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,520
You won't let me down, will you?

48
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
I won't.

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm finally home.

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm so tired.

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Hello?

52
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,440
Xia Lin, are you home yet?

53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
<i>I just got home.</i>

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Good.

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,440
<i>Romantic Departure</i> has been receiving
good feedback since it aired.

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
<i>Your popularity has gone up.</i>

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
Really? That's great!

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,200
I'll tell you more later.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,680
Get some rest today.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay. I know, Ms. Jiang.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Who is it?

62
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
-Hello.
-Delivery for Ms. Xia Lin.

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,480
Pidan. Is it from the producers?

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,600
I don't know.

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,160
-Can you bring it in for me?
-Sure.

66
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
Thank you.

67
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,800
-Just leave it here.
-Okay. Here you go.

68
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,920
Okay. Thank you.

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,400
Pidan, this is your new home.

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Go look around.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
What is this?

72
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
<i>Did you get the dog yet?</i>

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,400
<i>I did.</i>

74
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,080
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ling.</i>

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Pidan, don't move.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Let me take a photo.

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,880
Don't move.

78
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,880
Sales of outdoor home appliances
related products

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,920
have gone up from 3 percent to 7 percent.

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,720
<i>Are you free tomorrow?</i>

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,960
<i>Let me treat you to dinner
to thank you for Pidan.</i>

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,680
<i>Sure. You can decide the time.</i>

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,440
-Is it this office?
-Yes.

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,560
Mr. Ling, let me explain.

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,640
The company received an anonymous tip
that there has been unfair competition

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,040
in international information affairs
under your supervision.

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Foreign investors
are quite unhappy about this

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,480
and have asked to investigate the matter.

89
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,280
If the accusations are true,

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,440
they are demanding
to fire the CEO immediately.

91
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,560
Or else they will pull
all their investments.

92
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,680
So...

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,280
Let me see.

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,920
"The board has decided

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
that you will be suspended

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,320
for the next 30 days

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,040
to be investigated
by the Internal Audit Department.

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,560
The matter will be handled by Fu Weining."

99
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,600
I am Fu Weining.

100
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,120
"Before the investigation is concluded,

101
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,600
you must not participate
in any decision-making procedures,

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
including..."

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,400
This is quite a long list.

104
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,200
Anyway, you must leave
this office right now.

105
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Sure.

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Wen Li, let's go.

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Why is it so hot here?

108
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,640
I didn't expect that we'd meet like this,

109
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,480
my dear classmate.

110
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Fu Weining,

111
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,240
you haven't changed at all.

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,480
Being too aggressive

113
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,560
might hurt yourself.

114
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,960
You haven't changed either.

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,920
As arrogant as ever.

116
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,560
I won't go easy on you
just because we used to be classmates.

117
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520
Why hasn't Ling Yizhou replied to me yet?

118
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,799
What does he usually do at this time?

119
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,000
What's wrong with me?

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Why am I missing him all of a sudden?

121
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

122
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,520
<i>Hello, Xia Lin.</i>

123
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,440
Our proposal for <i>I Cannot Hug You</i>
went through.

124
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,200
The director really likes you. You're in.

125
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,240
Okay. Got it.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,240
What's wrong?

127
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,880
You don't sound happy.

128
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,600
It's nothing.

129
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
I'm probably just too tired from filming.

130
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm still adjusting.

131
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,120
Don't worry. I'll start preparing.

132
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,680
Also, Ms. Jiang,

133
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
thank you for being with me

134
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
through these hard times.

135
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,240
No need to say that.
You've worked very hard.

137
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,200
They start shooting soon, so be prepared.

138
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,600
Got it.

139
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,960
Don't worry, Ms. Jiang.

140
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,280
Come on.

141
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Let's go.

142
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,800
Keep an eye on them while I'm not there.

143
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
Let me know if anything happens.

144
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
Yes, Boss.

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,320
By the way, Boss,
should we tell Ms. Xia about this?

146
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,480
Of course not.

147
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,760
-You can go now.
-All right. You get some rest too.

148
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
<i>Sorry, I just saw your message.</i>

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
<i>Did something happen today?</i>

150
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,760
<i>It's nothing.</i>

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,200
<i>I'll pick you up tomorrow.</i>

152
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
<i>Okay.</i>

153
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
<i>I have some good news to share with you.</i>

154
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,000
Good morning, Xia Lin.

156
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,680
Why are you so early today?

157
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,920
I woke up early. The traffic was smooth.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What about you?

159
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,360
How does it feel to be back on set again?

160
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,760
I feel energized and ambitious.

161
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,560
Really?

162
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,280
You haven't been acting for a while.

163
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,440
You should watch how I do it
and learn from me.

164
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
Of course.

165
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,560
I'll make sure to pay attention
to the best actor, Chu Yan.

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,200
I won't get you in trouble.

167
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,240
Good.

168
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,240
You better not embarrass me.

169
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,760
Of course not.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Both of you are like best friends.

171
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Don't get it wrong.

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,760
It's never what you see.

173
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
It's all an act.

174
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,880
So you'll grab her
and come in from the river.

175
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,960
-Okay.
-Make sure there's tension.

176
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,680
-Okay?
-Sure.

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,320
Wait.

178
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,760
We're all in this together.

179
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,640
So don't pull any petty moves on me.

180
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,600
If you really hate me,
please just keep it inside.

181
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,800
Bottle it up for two months
so that we can finish shooting.

182
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,440
Then we'll be able
to get rid of each other sooner.

183
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,840
You can live your life
and I can live mine.

184
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,200
What do you think?

185
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,680
Guys, you must make it look real, okay?

186
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,360
Xia Lin, act like you're panicking.

187
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,640
This scene is kind of dangerous,
so let's get it done the first time.

188
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,640
All right.

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,440
I understand, ma'am.

190
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
-Be safe.
-Yes, ma'am.

191
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,280
-Stand by, everyone.
-Move to the left a bit.

192
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
I wonder what spell you cast
to make Ling Yizhou propose to you.

193
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,280
Now, you even got Chu Yan
to give you a lead role.

194
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,480
You're such an ultimate sham.

195
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,480
Move the PAR lamp to the left.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,960
Slow down. To the left.

197
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,400
Let go of me. Just tell him you like him.

198
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,360
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Come here!

199
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,200
<i>He's mine.
You can't steal him from me, you bitch.</i>

200
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,960
<i>I'll teach you not to mess with me!</i>

201
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,760
Help!

202
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,120
-Xia Lin's acting is amazing.
-Help!

203
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,560
-If Zhen Baohui didn't tell me about it,
-Help!

204
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,200
I would think this is real.

205
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,240
<i>-You can scream all you want.
-Help!</i>

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
<i>-I already cleared the area.
-Help!</i>

207
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,640
<i>It's just you and me here.</i>

208
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,840
<i>Help!</i>

209
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,400
Help!

210
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Help!

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
-Save her!
-Hurry!

212
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
-Hurry up!
-Save her!

213
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
-Hurry.
-Here.

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
Hurry.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,800
-Here.
-Get her up.

216
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,080
-Careful.
-Slow down.

217
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,520
-Are you okay?
-Hurry up.

218
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,320
-Are you okay?
-Xia Lin, are you okay?

219
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,160
-Should we get a doctor?
-Xia Lin, are you okay?

220
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,600
-Have you called an ambulance?
-I'm fine, ma'am.

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,640
-Get her inside.
-Hurry up.

222
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
-Get her inside.
-Slow down.

223
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,040
-Careful.
-Here.

224
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,320
-Are you okay?
-Careful.

225
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
You know what you did.

226
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,960
Don't bring
your personal emotions into this.

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,640
If you do that again,

228
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,360
I'll have to teach you a lesson.

229
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
What are you looking at?

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,880
Get to work!

231
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
Ms. Xia just swallowed some water.

232
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,840
She isn't hurt.

233
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,200
Who's investing in this film?

234
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,800
China Entertainment is the only investor.

235
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,360
-Contact their boss for me.
-Yes, Boss.

236
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,160
By the way, the board suddenly
decided to switch suppliers

237
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
which has caused a problem
with Lingshi Technology's chip production.

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,760
It will affect our delivery dates
for the second half of the year.

239
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
This won't do.

240
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,120
Book a Monday flight ticket
to the UK for me

241
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,720
and arrange a meeting with Benjamin.

242
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,880
I'll talk to him myself.

243
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
Okay.

244
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,400
Get some rest, Boss.

245
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,560
Xia Lin.

246
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,760
What's wrong?

247
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,920
Nothing. Let's go.

248
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,560
Okay, make the arrangements.

249
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,920
<i>Yes, Boss.</i>

250
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

251
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
What's wrong?

252
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,360
Someone was following me.

253
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Probably a reporter.

254
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,800
You should be careful too.

255
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm not a movie star.
Why should I be careful?

256
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,320
If they get photos of you
having fun without me,

257
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,680
even your fiancée
won't be able to help you.

258
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,400
Then I'll have to help myself.

259
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
Get down.

260
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,240
-What's wrong?
-Paparazzi.

261
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,040
-Where?
-Get down.

262
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,040
-Are they still here?
-Yes.

263
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,680
What's wrong? Are you sick?

264
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,280
Just a slight cough.

265
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,440
It was windy on my way here.

266
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,680
-Are they gone yet?
-No.

267
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,880
Ling Yizhou, were you pranking me?

268
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,400
We are in a private room.
Who would be taking photos?

269
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,720
Me.

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,120
Let's order now. I'm hungry.

271
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,440
<i>Get me the cold medicine in the car.</i>

272
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,920
What would you like?

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Anything.

274
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
You can go now.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Drive safely.

276
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,080
Is there anything you need to tell me?

277
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,240
No.

278
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,119
I haven't filmed for so long.

279
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,319
It was very exciting today.

280
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,839
There's nothing else.

281
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,880
It's getting late. You should go now.

282
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,440
You...

283
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,960
A goodbye kiss?

284
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,280
Seriously?

285
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,720
There's no need to keep acting.

286
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,480
What?

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,359
There's paparazzi.

288
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,600
-Where?
-Over there.

289
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,600
-There.
-Where?

290
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay. You can go now.

291
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,440
Boss, I got the information.

292
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,840
They sent the stalker.

293
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
Send more people to protect Mumu.

294
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,080
Make sure they are discreet.

295
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,080
-Don't let Mumu find out.
-Okay.

296
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,600
Ms. Xia.

297
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,560
Hello, my name is Meixi.

298
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,760
-I have the supporting role of Wu Feifei.
-Come closer.

299
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,360
Wu Feifei. Nice to meet you.

300
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,680
-What about Zhen Baohui?
-Okay. Good.

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm not sure about the details.

302
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
-Careful.
-I think Baohui wasn't feeling well.

303
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,440
So she backed out.

304
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
-Come closer.
-I just got notified yesterday.

305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
-That's good.
-Okay, Ms. Xia.

306
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,760
-I'll go say hi to the others now.
-Okay.

307
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,400
Okay. I look forward to working with you.

308
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,360
Thank you.

309
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
-Mr. Chu.
-Hi.

310
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,440
Here.

311
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,640
What is it? You seem to be in a good mood.

312
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
What? Is it my turn to shoot?

313
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Not yet.

314
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
About Zhen Baohui...

315
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,720
Thank you.

316
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,280
-Zhen Baohui? Who's that?
-What's wrong?

317
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,280
I got it.

318
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
-Try it again.
-It was nothing.

319
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,280
-But be careful, okay?
-Okay.

320
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
I know. So what is she...

321
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,920
Chu Yan, get over here!

322
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,640
The director is asking for me.
I have to go.

323
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,200
-Go ahead. Don't piss her off.
-We're good.

324
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,600
-Piss her off?
-One more.

325
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,800
Just one side?

326
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,400
That's impossible.

327
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,760
That one is broken. Be careful.

328
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
He's ridiculous.

329
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,440
Ms. Jiang. Here, have a seat.

330
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,680
No need for that.

331
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,120
I asked around.

332
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,480
The investors switched out Zhen Baohui.

333
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,600
I know.

334
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
You know who did it?

335
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,680
Chu Yan, right?

336
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,480
Chu Yan?

337
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,040
I don't think so.

338
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,960
Stop thinking about that.

339
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,360
I think it's a good thing.

340
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,040
Everyone can get along now.

341
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,040
Ms. Jiang, are you leaving soon?

342
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,640
I came here to keep an eye on you.

343
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,400
You get into trouble when I'm not around.

344
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,800
What if something like yesterday
happens again?

345
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,360
It won't.

346
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,800
You're drinking this too?

347
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,160
It's quite popular now.

348
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,440
All the actresses are drinking this
Baiyinian meal replacement powder.

349
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
I heard that it's nutritious
and can help you lose weight.

350
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,680
I'll buy some later and give them
to everyone on set on your behalf.

351
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,560
That's a good idea.

352
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Okay. Keep reading your script.

353
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,600
I need to give this to the director.

354
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,720
It's her birthday today.

355
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

356
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,160
They said one of the investors
didn't like Zhen Baohui,

357
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
so they replaced her.

358
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,360
An investor
who could easily replace her...

359
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,560
Chu Yan, who do you think it is?

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,560
Since when do you like to gossip?

361
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,120
Get my car.

362
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Okay.

363
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,600
That's her.

364
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,760
Yuyuan, have the driver turn on
the air-conditioner.

365
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,680
Okay.

366
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,520
How do you feel?

367
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,160
I think it went great. What do you think?

368
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,320
-You're doing well.
-Xia Lin.

369
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Good work, guys.

370
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,880
Ms. Xia, hello.

371
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
This is...

372
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,720
You...

373
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,840
Let me introduce myself.

374
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,360
My name is Fu Weining.

375
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,040
I'm a legal consultant at Lingshi Group.

376
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm in charge of the investigation
of Ling Yizhou's misconduct.

377
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,800
Ling Yizhou's misconduct?

378
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,960
It means that

379
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,760
he has done something wrong.

380
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
Ms. Xia, would you like
to have tea together?

381
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,680
Excuse me.

382
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,640
I don't think we're that close.

383
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,320
I'm sure that you would like

384
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
to know more about Ling Yizhou,
wouldn't you?

385
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,000
It's so hot today.

386
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,040
I'll go with you.

387
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,960
Come on.

388
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>Something has happened to Xia Lin.
Get here quick.</i>

389
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,120
It's so hot.

390
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
Aren't you...

391
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,600
Aren't you hot?

392
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,160
Tell us what you want.

393
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,280
I guess Ling Yizhou hasn't told Ms. Xia
what happened yet.

394
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,800
He has been accused of accepting bribery.

395
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,440
He has been suspended for investigation.

396
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,520
That's related to his work.

397
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
I don't need to know about it.

398
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,680
I guess you don't know
Ling Yizhou very well, Ms. Xia.

399
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,720
Ling Yizhou is my future husband.

400
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,200
I think I know him better
than anyone else.

401
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,640
Ms. Xia, do you know that there are
two things you can never look at directly?

402
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
One is the sun.

403
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,280
The other is the human mind.

404
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,520
The former will hurt your eyes,

405
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,200
the latter will hurt your heart.

406
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,640
The human mind...

407
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,200
The more trustworthy
it seems to be on the surface,

408
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,040
the darker and more despicable

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,440
it is in the shadows.

410
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,120
Can you talk in a way we can understand?

411
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,560
If you want me to say it directly...

412
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,680
Ling Yizhou isn't as honest
and trustworthy as you think he is.

413
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,960
If you continue to be with him,
you might get in trouble yourself.

414
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,920
I hope Ms. Xia can cooperate
with our investigation

415
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,720
and tell us what you know.

416
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,080
I have nothing to tell you.

417
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,480
Ms. Xia, I thought I was being very clear.

418
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
This could affect your career in showbiz.

419
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,840
Make the right decision.

420
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,640
Mr. Fu, I'm Xia Lin's manager.

421
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm in charge of her career.

422
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,640
In my opinion,

423
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,400
you have no right to comment
on Xia Lin's career at all.

424
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
You're such an annoying manager.

425
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,360
Thank you. That's what everyone says.

426
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,680
This is the last time.

427
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,400
Ms. Jiang.

428
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,240
Would you like to get a drink together?

429
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,760
I'm on my period.

430
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
I can't have cold drinks.

431
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
Wen Li.

432
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,280
We'll drive Ms. Xia home first.

433
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,480
Yes, Boss.

434
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Mumu, if he comes to you again,
just tell me.

435
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,760
I'll handle him.

436
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,840
You've been suspended?

437
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,840
It's just an investigation.

438
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
It will be fine.

439
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,720
Why didn't you tell me?

440
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
It wasn't necessary.

441
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,800
"It wasn't necessary"?

442
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,400
Aren't we partners?

443
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,520
This is a serious matter.

444
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,360
What happens to you affects me too.
Why wouldn't you tell me about it?

445
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,720
Mumu, I'm their target.

446
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,720
I don't want my affairs to affect you.

447
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,520
You can just live your life normally.

448
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,440
Ling Yizhou, you think that
I can never help you in any way, right?

449
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,160
That's why you don't tell me anything.

450
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
Or do you think I don't have the right

451
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,520
to face things together with you,
the chairman of Lingshi Group?

452
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
What about you?

453
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
You didn't tell me
that you fell into the water.

454
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,840
Aren't you the same?

455
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,000
You...

456
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,760
Mr. Wen, stop the car.

457
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Stop the car.

458
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't you think he's being ridiculous?

459
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
Kind of.

460
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
But...

461
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,080
Mr. Ling was trying
to respect your wishes.

462
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,600
Jia Fei.

463
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,440
Which side are you on?

464
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,440
On the other hand,

465
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm curious why you're so mad.

466
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,960
Why wouldn't I be mad?

467
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,760
I thought you said you were just acting.

468
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,440
Why would you be mad?

469
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,440
I...

470
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,240
I'm just getting into character.

471
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,480
So you're already preparing
for the role of a fiancée.

472
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,480
Come here.

473
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,560
What?

474
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,760
Come here.

475
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,280
Look at your small face.

476
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
Your skin looks terrible.

477
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,840
Those dark circles under your eyes...

478
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,800
The wrinkles...

479
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,440
You do look like a tragic lead actress.

480
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,480
Do I really look that bad?

481
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,400
Are you still
the optimistic Xia Lin I know?

482
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,600
Come here.

483
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,000
Let me put an eye mask on you.

484
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,320
Then, I, the experienced
love story screenwriter,

485
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,400
will analyze what's going on for you.

486
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,360
You and Ling Yizhou have the same problem.

487
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,880
Whether it's a relationship in a script
or in real life,

488
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,920
you must support and help each other.

489
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,760
You've been single for so many years.

490
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,120
That's why you're used
to deal with everything yourself.

491
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,760
That's why you never tell him anything.

492
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,720
As for him,

493
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,680
he's used to being in charge.

494
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,040
He's also a male chauvinist.

495
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,920
That's why he always deals with problems
without you knowing.

496
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
He wants you to live your life happily

497
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,240
without having to worry

498
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,560
about this.

499
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,000
But it makes me feel like
he doesn't trust me.

500
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,120
See?

501
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,040
If you feel that way,
he probably feels the same.

502
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,520
Did you know that Lingshi Group invested
in this new film you're shooting now?

503
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Mr. Ling ordered them
to replace Zhen Baohui.

504
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,200
He did?

505
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,280
How do you know?

506
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,960
I heard...

507
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
The producer told me.

508
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,040
At first, there was only one investor,
China Entertainment.

509
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,760
Zhen Baohui had talked to them
about replacing you.

510
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,280
But then,
Lingshi Group invested more money

511
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,600
and beat China Entertainment.

512
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,440
I heard that Zhen Baohui
acted very unprofessionally on set.

513
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,960
Her acting was very awkward
and she had a bad attitude.

514
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,040
So they just replaced her.

515
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,000
Feifei.

516
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
Do you think I was too mean to him today?

517
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,600
I guess my analysis was quite accurate.

518
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
I need to take notes.

519
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,800
This might be useful.

520
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,360
Should I apologize?

521
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,080
Feifei.

522
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
Can you stop writing
about other people's love stories?

523
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
You should think about yourself too.

524
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,640
I know.

525
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,600
When you were on
that reality show last time,

526
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,320
didn't Inglemirepharm's give you

527
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
a set of skincare products?

528
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
Yes, it was Inglemirepharm's.

529
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,880
I'll have my assistant
give you some next time.

530
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,600
Okay.

531
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,480
What should I do?

532
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,280
That's good.
Start preparing for the next scene.

533
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,040
-Good work, guys.
-Thank you, ma'am.

534
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,600
Let's add a new scene.

535
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,880
We'll have someone
throw the ball at Xia Lin.

536
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
Chu Yan, you'll block it for her.

537
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,880
That's good.

538
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,480
Chu Yan, are you all right?

539
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,120
Are you okay?

540
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
It kind of hurts.

541
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
I think I need

542
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,040
your fan to heal my injury.

543
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,400
Sure. I'll let you borrow it
for ten minutes.

544
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
Ten minutes?

545
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Do you think I'm only worth ten minutes?

546
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
I need at least 20 minutes.

547
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,840
I think you're doing just fine.

548
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,760
Hey, let me lean on you.

549
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,400
-You're fine.
-Look at my arm.

550
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
Why are you late?

551
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,800
You haven't changed either.

552
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm not expecting a raise.

553
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,520
Fine.

554
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,760
How is she?

555
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,600
Everything is normal.

556
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,080
Give me the phone. I need to check Weibo.

557
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,360
MR. LING, LOOK AT YOUR WIFE

558
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
SWEETEST COUPLE

559
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,400
MR. LING, DO YOU GIVE THEM YOUR BLESSING?

560
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,400
I thought you said everything's normal.
What is this?

561
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,480
The crew responded
and said it's just for the show.

562
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,240
<i>I've made a decision.</i>

563
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,120
<i>I don't want anything to do with you.</i>

564
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,680
<i>Let's stop seeing each other.</i>

565
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Wen Li.

566
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,720
Get me the car. We're going there now.

567
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Boss.

568
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,200
I just had some wine with a client.

569
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm kind of...

570
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,360
I feel dizzy.

571
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,400
So you can't drive?

572
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,960
I could drive...

573
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,840
But it's against the law.

574
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
It's fine.

575
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,520
I'll drive.

576
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,160
Boss.

577
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,360
I can get you a designated driver.

578
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,280
Your salary this month...

579
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,640
In a bit,

580
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,360
Chu Yan will stand
in front of Xia Lin like this.

581
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,440
Xia Lin, you need to act shy and say...

582
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,520
"What are you doing?"

583
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,160
-Okay? Get it?
-Yes.

584
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,760
-You have to act cool, okay?
-Okay.

585
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,880
Let's try it.

586
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,960
Okay.

587
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,160
Five, four, three, two...

588
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,320
What are you doing?

589
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,040
You get it, right?

590
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,280
Ma'am,

591
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,480
it's a shame you didn't pursue acting.

592
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,520
I would if I were prettier.

593
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,520
Why would I be a director?

594
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,960
-Come on.
-Yes.

595
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,920
Ma'am, Mr. Ling is here.

596
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,520
He wants to treat everyone
to afternoon tea.

597
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Mr. Ling?

598
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,400
Hello, Ma'am.

599
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,440
-Mr. Ling, hello.
-Hello.

600
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,120
Thank you for the afternoon tea.

601
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,320
It's no problem.

602
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,440
It's hot outside.
Have some cold drinks to cool down.

603
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,640
Xia Lin has one more scene.

604
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,320
-How about you wait inside?
-It's fine. I'll watch from here.

605
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,800
Just pretend like I'm not here.

606
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,400
Stand by, everyone. Get ready!

607
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,800
Just do your job.

608
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,600
Xia Lin, keep your head up!

609
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,200
I can't see your face.

610
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,320
Sorry, ma'am. Let's try it again.

611
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,440
Again.

612
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,760
Five, four, three, two...

613
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,880
Xia Lin, what are you looking at?

614
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,920
Look at the man in front of you.

615
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,120
Again!

616
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,120
Five.

617
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,719
Four.

618
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,080
Three.

619
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,600
Two.

620
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,080
Again!

621
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,920
I'll give you one minute.
Get yourselves together.

622
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,840
Xia Lin.

623
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
What flavor was your bubble gum?

624
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,639
Strawberry.

625
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Mine was durian.

626
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,960
What will happen
if the flavors mix together?

627
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,120
Show some respect.

628
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,600
I'm an actress.

629
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,199
Really?

630
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,480
If you're an actress,

631
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,360
why were you so nervous

632
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,840
about doing a kiss scene?

633
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,080
I've never done one
with strawberry and durian, okay?

634
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
You're silly.

635
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,600
Hurry up.

636
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
Are you guys ready?

637
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

638
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,080
Get ready.

639
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,640
Five, four, three, two...

640
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,520
Good!

641
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,760
It's a wrap.

642
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,160
Thank you for the drinks, Mr. Ling.

643
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,920
-Thank you, Mr. Ling.
-Thank you, Mr. Ling.

644
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,680
You can have
some of my lemon mint green tea.

645
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,080
What? This isn't the one I usually drink.

646
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,400
That place went out of business.

647
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,960
Why do the places I like
always go out of business so soon?

648
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
It's probably your own problem.

649
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
Mumu, are you done?

650
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,760
That was the last scene.

651
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,680
-Let's go home then.
-Okay.

652
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,080
We're here.

653
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,880
Get some rest.

654
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,520
Bye then.

655
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,080
I'll wait for the elevator with you.

656
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
Okay.

657
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,160
Aren't we partners?

658
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,440
This is a serious matter.

659
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,000
What happens to you affects me too.
Why wouldn't you tell me about it?

660
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
What about you?

661
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,200
You didn't tell me
that you fell into the water.

662
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Aren't you the same?

663
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,560
You...

664
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,200
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

665
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,960
Do you want to come up?

666
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,760
Sure.

667
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,800
Mumu.

668
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,280
Isn't this apartment too big for you?

669
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,680
No. I have Pidan.

670
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,760
Pidan?

671
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,600
-Pidan.
-Pidan, you scared me.

672
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,040
I thought you weren't afraid of dogs.

673
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,600
I'm not. I just need some time
to get used to him.

674
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,760
This is your chance then.

675
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,760
Pidan wants to play with you.

676
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,720
Pidan.

677
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,040
Do you think you should be here right now?

678
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,440
Go play. Go on.

679
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,960
Good dog.

680
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Mumu.

681
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,160
I was actually hoping
that you'd come live with me.

682
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,800
What?

683
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,800
You know the situation right now.

684
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
Even though it's about my job,

685
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,360
Fu Weining is trying
to get to me through you.

686
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,120
If you move in with me,
at least I can protect you.

687
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,440
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

688
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,080
I know you're worried about me.

689
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,320
But I'm fine living by myself here.

690
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,120
Besides, it's so easy
to get in touch nowadays.

691
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,120
You don't have to worry about my safety.

692
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,080
Mumu, I hope you can think about it.

693
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,600
By the way, last time...

694
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,520
I was kind of mean to you.

695
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,520
I know it's not that you don't respect me.

696
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
We're actually quite alike.

697
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,600
We don't want to cause each other trouble.

698
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,560
So, I'll start trying to talk to you
about my problems more.

699
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
You should too.

700
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,320
So that we can be better partners.

701
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,080
Mumu.

702
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,520
I'll do what you say.

703
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,320
I also hope you understand

704
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,800
that nothing you do
could cause me any burden.

705
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,080
I like dealing with your problems for you.

706
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,360
Your presence in my life
has made it more interesting.

707
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,240
Mumu.

708
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,920
I like having you by my side.

709
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,040
I can feel your warmth in my heart.

710
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,520
Sometimes, I think you're a thief.

711
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,440
Because...

712
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,680
Everything you do

713
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,320
steals my attention.

714
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,800
Who is it?

715
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,640
I need help!

716
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,600
Get up. Hurry!

717
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,160
-Hide somewhere.
-Why should I hide?

718
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,440
Jia Fei is here. Hide!

719
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,400
So what if she's here?

720
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,720
Please, just hide.

721
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,840
No. Jia Fei will definitely go
into the room.

722
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,600
Over here. Hide. Hurry up.

723
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,960
-Everyone knows we're engaged.
-Please, just hide.

724
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,400
Hurry up. Go.

725
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Don't say anything. Please.

726
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,000
Coming.

727
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,840
What's going on?

728
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,520
Why did you change your passcode?

729
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,360
I forgot to tell you about that.

730
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,480
By the way,

731
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,800
was that your voice I just heard?

732
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,080
Yes. I was practicing my lines.

733
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
It's a new character.

734
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,640
Why would you do that?

735
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,120
Get me something to drink. I'm thirsty.

736
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,840
Okay. Wait a second.

737
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,760
Linlin.

738
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,920
-Are you out of drinks?
-I have some. I'm coming.

739
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Here.

740
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,240
Why are you here?

741
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,080
I'm here to see Pidan.

742
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,360
Didn't you say Pidan is here?

743
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,360
I thought I would come to see him.

744
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,640
He's asleep now.

745
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,160
He has a bad temper.

746
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,040
He doesn't like to be woken up.

747
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,560
By the way,

748
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,640
how's it going with you and Mr. Ling?

749
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,960
Mr. Ling and I...

750
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,560
Who would that be?

751
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,040
No!

752
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,120
No matter who it is, I'm not here.

753
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,320
Ms. Xia, is Jia Fei here?

754
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,640
She said she...

755
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,440
Jia Fei is not here.
Are you looking for her?

756
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,040
No.

757
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Mr. Ling said you're sick.

758
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,360
He had me bring you some medicine.

759
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,200
Do you need anything else?

760
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,720
No. I don't need anything at all.

761
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,360
I'm not sick. I don't need medicine.

762
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,080
Is there anything else?

763
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,840
Well,

764
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,320
it was pretty hot on the way here.

765
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
I think I have a heatstroke.

766
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,920
Could I have some water?

767
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,560
-Come in.
-Thank you.

768
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,560
-Thank you.
-Please.

769
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,600
Have a seat.

770
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,960
Who could that be?

771
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,280
Chu Yan?

772
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,560
Hi, Xia Lin.

773
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,560
Xia Lin.

774
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,960
I saw that you weren't feeling well.

775
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
-What are you doing?
-I brought you some medicine.

776
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,360
Thank you.

777
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,960
What did you mean by your message?

778
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,320
It meant what it meant.

779
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,120
Why do you mean
by "let's stop seeing each other"?

780
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Is Pidan here?

781
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Pidan is asleep.

782
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,760
He has a bad temper.

783
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,760
He doesn't like being woken up.

784
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,520
Your phone is ringing.

785
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,960
I...

786
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,400
Okay.

787
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,040
It's all your fault. What should we do?

788
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,080
Get up.

789
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,440
Aren't you going to offer me a drink?

790
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,360
I'll get you a new one.

791
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,160
Wait a moment.

792
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,640
By the way, Xia Lin.

793
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,960
In episode 17,

794
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,840
I don't know what to do
with the crying scene.

795
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Whatever you say.

796
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,600
You should do what you think.

797
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,200
Move. Out of the way.

798
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,600
I just don't know

799
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,320
if I should cry loudly or quietly.

800
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,760
I think both works.
You should do what you think.

801
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,200
So what if he sees me? We're engaged.

802
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,480
It's a contract engagement.

803
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,960
Don't do anything rash. Move.

804
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,480
-Move.
-I won't.

805
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,080
Xia Lin, what was that?

806
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,400
That was Pidan.

807
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,960
Pidan is awake.

808
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,520
Pidan is awake now.

809
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,560
Where is Pidan?

810
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
There.

811
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,280
Tell me. What's going on here?

812
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,560
-I'm here for Jia Fei.
-I'm here for Xia Lin.

813
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
He's here for water.

814
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,720
So you've been playing hide-and-seek here?

815
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,040
That's right.

816
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,800
Feifei, Wen Li, what's going on?

817
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,360
That's right, Wen Li.

818
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,760
Why didn't you tell me
that you know Ms. Jia?

819
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,360
I have a meeting to go to.

820
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,680
I'll get going now.

821
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,920
You guys have fun. Bye.

822
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,520
Boss.

823
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,840
It's late now. You must be tired.

824
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,840
You should get going.

825
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,640
It's not too late. I'm not tired.

826
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,960
-We have a lot to do.
-We'll talk next time. You should go.

827
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,440
Go.

828
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,280
Go home. It's late now.

829
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,400
Right, Yizhou.

830
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,520
I didn't drive today.

831
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,800
You should drive me.

832
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,760
Drive me home.

833
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,760
Come on. Let's go.

834
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,000
Let's go.

835
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,560
We'll get going.

836
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,720
Wen Li.

837
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,760
Was I rude to Mumu?

838
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,920
Boss.

839
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,720
- I think--
-Never mind.

840
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,400
Why would I ask you?
You don't have a girlfriend.

841
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,000
<i>I do good deeds all the time.</i>

842
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,360
How could I be pregnant?

843
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,840
It should be...

844
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,920
Could it be...

845
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,200
Let me reward you then.

846
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
