1
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,012
What's wrong?

2
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:05,926
Nothing. Just missing the days
when we copied homework in high school.

3
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,386
Copy my homework?

4
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,144
It's not that.

5
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:15,075
Our courses are not the same,
homework is not the same as well...

6
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,934
Impossible for us to do it together.

7
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,064
Yeah.

8
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,279
So cold.

9
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:27,688
You're not the Woodie anymore.

10
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,848
Not anymore.

11
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:34,862
Not cute at all.

12
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:40,316
Old rules.

13
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:41,902
Read it after writing.

14
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:54,091
When did you steal my homework
and redo it?

15
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,828
If you're not writing,
I'm going to take it back...

16
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:01,110
No way,
it's mine once you've given it to me.

17
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,030
Nan Xi.

18
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,911
Thank you.

19
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,625
Haven't we agreed?

20
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,631
Every time you say thank you...

21
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,794
You need to...

22
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,794
Do your homework.

23
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:37,568
=EPISODE 21
XIARUI, WELCOME HOME=

24
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,481
Yang Yufei is dancing with Nan Xi,
what kind of post is this?

25
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,540
I really want to look.

26
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,483
Just look for a bit.

27
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:59,046
It's fine to look just for a bit,
so just go ahead.

28
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,912
I know it's nothing, what's there to see.

29
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:03,666
But I won't lose anything if I look a bit.
So just look a bit...

30
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,265
Just look a bit...

31
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,122
Looking means not trusting, do not look.

32
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:08,317
Just look a bit.

33
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,436
Do not look.

34
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,099
Just a bit. Not allowed to look!

35
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,110
Take a look.

36
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,056
It's just looking at a picture,
why the fuss?

37
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:22,477
A rotten picture like that,
I don't have the time for it.

38
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,505
Nan Xi is in class...

39
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:27,964
Cheng Erluo is at training...

40
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,939
Shu wants to rest...

41
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,230
Left with Xia Rui who is bored.

42
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:38,117
So boring. It's so boring.

43
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:52,728
What to do?

44
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,146
Let me see.

45
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,239
Why not. I'll go check it out.

46
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:15,152
See what your coffee standards are like.

47
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,450
-Excuse me, your coffee.
-Oh, thank you.

48
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:54,852
Excuse me.

49
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:56,794
Waiter.

50
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,057
-Excuse me.
-Sure enough...

51
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,835
Nothing can deceive Xia Rui's tongue.

52
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,177
Boss Yi.

53
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,936
-Oh, my goodness, why are you here?
-What do you think?

54
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:09,646
You left there...

55
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:11,427
You didn't tell me, strike one.

56
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,425
Now you're in Binhai,
you didn't contact me.

57
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,419
-Another strike.
-Did I not contact you?

58
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,477
No.

59
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,347
How did you end up here then?

60
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,248
This is the last one.

61
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:24,443
-Let's go.
-Sure. Let's drink.

62
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,978
So Nan Xi knew about this...

63
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:38,132
The both of you hid this from me together.

64
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:42,971
That's because we know
your majesty will find your way here.

65
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:44,337
It's just that...

66
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,325
I didn't expect to wait so long.

67
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,418
Really!

68
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:50,503
Why did you come to Binhai suddenly?

69
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,103
Coach Yang...

70
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,421
-Did she come here too?
-Of course.

71
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,201
Shengnan changed her job to Binhai.

72
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,260
Whoa, Shengnan.

73
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,700
How are the both of you progressing?

74
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,746
Of course it's indescribable.

75
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,112
-So mushy!
-Don't talk about this.

76
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,294
Besides me,
there is an old acquaintance of yours.

77
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,725
-Who's that?
-Please take a look!

78
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,399
Binzi, why are you here?

79
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,330
The performance was pretty good.

80
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,383
You are well prepared from the rehearsals.

81
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:31,533
-I think so too.
-Shu!

82
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,428
Someone's here to pick you,
I'll get going first.

83
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,637
-Oh, okay.
-Bye senior.

84
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:36,494
-Goodbye.
-Bye, senior.

85
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:38,036
Why did you come?

86
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,318
When you came back yesterday...

87
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,820
Didn't I fail to pick you up?

88
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,140
Today right after training

89
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,173
I came straight to make it up to you.
Quick, let me see.

90
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,606
Is your teacher not letting you eat again?

91
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:53,521
Didn't see you in half a month's time,
you've lost weight.

92
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,106
This won't do.
I'll bring you for some nice food.

93
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,485
I'm not going.

94
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:00,250
I still have a lot of homework,
I need to go study.

95
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,589
A person cannot work well
without proper meals or being hungry.

96
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,549
This is a good saying,
"The body is the capital for revolution."

97
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,591
If there's no capital,
what kind of revolution?

98
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:12,485
Why revolution out of nowhere?

99
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:16,173
I'm just quoting old man's saying.

100
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:20,677
Books will forever be there,
they won't disappear, that can wait...

101
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:22,635
Why not think about what to eat?

102
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,333
I want to eat hot brine.

103
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,451
Hot brine? Okay!

104
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:28,816
Let's go!

105
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:31,227
Do you know...

106
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,294
I could have eaten hot brine yesterday.

107
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:35,222
But I didn't feel like it.

108
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,691
But Shu, you...

109
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,543
Do you want to eat or not?

110
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,578
I'm confused now.

111
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,972
Most important is the companion,
and not what we eat, do you understand?

112
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,315
Of course I understand.

113
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:51,323
If I go, the boss will give us extra meat.

114
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:53,721
Other people won't have this privilege.

115
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,115
Cheng Erluo.

116
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,364
Are you really clueless
or are you avoiding my question?

117
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,366
I'm not avoiding it.

118
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:02,947
Why do you say that...

119
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,989
Are we going to eat?

120
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:11,361
Very good,
everyone improved significantly today.

121
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:15,187
We will learn new
and more challenging moves tomorrow.

122
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:18,341
We will end today's class now.

123
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,016
Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

124
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,809
As your closest roommate,

125
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,607
Am I not worth getting
first-hand information?

126
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,532
Let me interview you a little.

127
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,957
How does it feel dancing with
the prettiest girl from another campus?

128
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,790
No feeling.

129
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,312
That is cool, very cool.

130
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:50,691
It seemed like you answered my question.

131
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,348
But in fact, you did not answer at all.

132
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,981
Nan Xi.

133
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,212
Do you want to join my gossip group?

134
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,165
I think you definitely have PR potential.

135
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:01,021
I'm not interested.

136
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,016
Not interested...

137
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,372
I know you're not interested.

138
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:07,805
Not interested at all towards others,
towards Yang Yufei.

139
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,752
But no matter what.

140
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:14,768
You are currently the most envied person
in Binhai University.

141
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:19,645
The whole university knows about you
dancing with Yang Yufei.

142
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:22,309
The entire university?

143
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:24,299
So that includes...

144
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,276
Business campus?

145
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:30,017
Of course.
Didn't Xia Rui tell you about this?

146
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:34,490
Are you too busy these days?
How many days have you not spoken to her?

147
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,208
You've been sitting here whole night.

148
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,404
I'm going to lock the door.

149
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,467
It's late.

150
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,947
It's better to work here
than studying in university.

151
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:15,937
What are you saying?

152
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:20,994
I am saying, working here is better
than studying in campus.

153
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:23,243
Then help here
if you are free during the day.

154
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,164
The employee you met this morning,
she is also a part-timer.

155
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,901
But she won't be coming tomorrow.

156
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,315
Left with me and Binzi,
sometimes it's really hectic.

157
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:35,554
If you join us, I guarantee
you'll be satisfied with the pay.

158
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,944
-So it's settled. I'll come tomorrow.
-Cheers.

159
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,503
-Cheers.
-I like your attitude.

160
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,528
-I'll get you a contract.
-Okay.

161
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,926
Hey.

162
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:55,575
-How is our Feifei lately?
-Who is Feifei?

163
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,170
-Yufei.
-Who is Yufei?

164
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,035
Yang Yufei.

165
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,398
Chenghua Campus Flower.
Yang Yufei, don't you remember?

166
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:11,522
I know who Yang Yufei. Who is Feifei?

167
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,686
What an intimate nickname.

168
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,058
Don't mind these tiny details.

169
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:20,254
Anyways I've been back for so long
but I haven't seen her.

170
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,339
Oh, so mushy.

171
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,657
Oh, my teeth.

172
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:28,940
Did you see her? How has she been lately?

173
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,658
I don't see her often but she's well.

174
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:36,164
Still the prettiest girl in Chenghua.

175
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:38,155
That is certain.

176
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:41,211
Our Feifei is excellent
no matter where she goes.

177
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:46,955
Hello?

178
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,240
Xia Rui, have you seen
the posts on the forum?

179
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,802
Something happened.

180
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:52,725
I saw.

181
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,163
Sure enough,
the dance class might be troublesome.

182
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:56,737
Where are you now?

183
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:59,063
The dorm gate is closing soon,
when are you coming back?

184
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:01,062
Is it closing already?

185
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,391
Boss Yi!

186
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,139
I'll come tomorrow.

187
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:10,288
-I have to leave now. Something came up.
-Wait, sign the contract.

188
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,859
Girl, sign the contract!

189
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,240
What forum?

190
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:17,429
What forum?

191
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:18,968
What contract?

192
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,336
Hello, Xiao Bailing.

193
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,375
I'm running, I'm running.
I'll reach in no time.

194
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,097
Where are you? Quick, quick, quick.

195
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:27,763
Please tell aunt I'll be right there.
Be sure not to close the gate.

196
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,817
Hello? Hello?

197
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:34,578
Why is the battery running out
at this time?

198
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:37,079
Oh, my goodness. What should I do?

199
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:39,228
Am I going to sleep on the streets?

200
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:47,876
Nan Xi?

201
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,178
Nan Xi?

202
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,903
Xia Rui,
why didn't you come in by yourself?

203
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:01,424
Your door was locked,
not sure if I should open.

204
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,884
It's late, why are you here?

205
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,977
The dorms lights are off,
I couldn't enter.

206
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,670
Can I stay here for one night?

207
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:17,113
I've been sweating running over here...

208
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,963
Can I enter and take a shower?

209
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,448
Oh, no problem. Please enter.

210
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:33,162
You know how to comb hair too?

211
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:45,424
Xia Rui.

212
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,608
Your hair...

213
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,099
I really like it.

214
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,661
Hair is all the same.

215
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:58,932
Not the same.

216
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,120
How is it not the same?

217
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,176
The scent is different.

218
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,419
I rushed out and didn't bring anything...

219
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:13,465
I used your shower gel and shampoo.

220
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,090
Then others will know once they smell.

221
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,895
That we...

222
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,043
All right. I'm almost done. Let's sleep.

223
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,473
Am I sleeping here?

224
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,215
No.

225
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,904
You'll sleep on the bed.

226
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,915
I too, will sleep on the bed?

227
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:02,320
Yes.

228
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,534
I'll sleep on the sofa.

229
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,008
Nan Xi's scent.

230
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,831
This is also Nan Xi's scent.

231
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,823
Xia Rui, are you awake?

232
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:26,814
Xia Rui.

233
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:35,574
So sleepy.

234
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,896
Oh, my God, you don't...

235
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:57,940
Are you digging the ground?

236
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,545
I have no class this morning.
Be quiet for awhile, let me sleep.

237
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,165
Wan Ling, can you please be quiet?

238
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,017
I didn't return to the dorm.

239
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:31,730
I'm at Nan Xi's house.

240
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,520
A single man and a single woman
in the same room.

241
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:53,637
How come nothing happened?

242
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,024
Am I not attractive or...

243
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,295
Papaya...

244
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,552
Boiled with milk, maybe...

245
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,249
Xia Rui, are you awake?

246
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,618
Xia Rui, I'll head off to class first.

247
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:50,604
I'm leaving.

248
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,570
You're pretending to be asleep.

249
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,805
What's wrong?

250
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:21,320
Why won't you get up when you're awake?

251
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,927
There's no class this morning,
just wanted to sleep a bit more.

252
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:27,739
-Come, let's go for breakfast.
-Sleep a bit more.

253
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:30,501
I'll sleep awhile more, you go first.

254
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:36,278
No, no.
If you don't eat with me then I will...

255
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,668
Eat breakfast! Quick, quick, quick.

256
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,620
Smells good, you prepared all these?

257
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:50,919
Yes.

258
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:55,103
So these are the culprits who woke me up.

259
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,745
Why? Don't you like it?

260
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:03,710
It looks pretty good
but I'm not sure about the taste.

261
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,032
Wait a moment.

262
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,186
Brush your teeth first.

263
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,613
I thought you wanted to crawl over
and kiss me up there?

264
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,174
So delicious.

265
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:32,326
You'll be in charge of breakfast
in the future.

266
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,431
-Okay, Nan Xi?
-Okay.

267
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,783
I will be in charge of our breakfast
in the future.

268
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,394
Eat slowly, that's all yours.

269
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,841
Aren't you going to eat?

270
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,986
I've eaten.

271
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:58,863
Don't move.

272
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,698
Next time when you eat, be more careful.

273
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,370
Hey, look, that's Nan Xi's girlfriend.

274
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:23,935
That's her?

275
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,311
-Aren't her looks too ordinary?
-Are you sure it's her?

276
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,382
Looks just like in the picture.

277
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,123
-That's her.
-In reality she doesn't look as good.

278
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:33,538
-Right?
-What does he like about her?

279
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,023
I'll go, you clean up the bar.

280
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:41,474
What's going on?

281
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:44,588
Why should I hide?
Am I not allowed to serve customers now?

282
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,694
No, but those girls
are from Binhai University.

283
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:52,326
She probably saw you and Yang Yufei,
she might be upset with you.

284
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,368
How did you know about the post?

285
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:56,703
Didn't I tell you last night.

286
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,347
Yang Yufei, the campus flower.

287
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:00,459
I just surfed through the campus forum.

288
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,216
Don't you call her your Feifei?

289
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:03,459
Not anymore.

290
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:06,927
I don't understand,
obviously she knows about you and Nan Xi.

291
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:09,956
-She still...
-I'm not jealous, why are you jealous?

292
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:12,189
I'm not jealous, okay?

293
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,571
This is a serious matter.

294
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:16,406
It's alright,
I know you're worried about me.

295
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:19,203
Thanks for being nice to me,
I'll have your back from now on.

296
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:21,111
Just two people, it's alright.

297
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,136
Sorry for the long wait.

298
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:28,293
That's quite fast.

299
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,879
We've just waited for half an hour or so.

300
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:34,279
Apologies
as there is not enough manpower today.

301
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,045
Do you make all the coffees here?

302
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,707
-Yes.
-Then are they drinkable?

303
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:40,995
Exactly.

304
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:42,689
Regarding that, you can first try.

305
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:45,109
I'll make you another one,
if you aren't satisfied.

306
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,424
This is too bitter!

307
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:50,069
There's not milk in it.

308
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:53,270
The hand brew
that you ordered does not have milk in it.

309
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,742
Of course if you need,
I can bring over some sugar cubes.

310
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,580
I don't like adding sugar.

311
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:04,106
Well, if you prefer something sweeter
or something with milk,

312
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:06,258
I can make you a cappuccino.

313
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:08,734
I don't like milky taste either.

314
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,275
Then what about flat white?

315
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,944
Or a dirty with ice?

316
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,263
Alright, we will have one of each.

317
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:18,002
Free orders, okay?

318
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:20,562
It's okay for new orders but not free,
my apologies.

319
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,302
Look at her.

320
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:28,244
What does Nan Xi like about her?

321
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:30,000
Really.

322
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:34,373
-Waiter, order please.
-Coming!

323
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,451
What do you want to drink?

324
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:47,781
One hazelnut latte, half sugar.

325
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:48,911
Unavailable.

326
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:50,523
A cappuccino then.

327
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,662
Unavailable.

328
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:53,422
There must be hot chocolate then.

329
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:54,546
Unavailable.

330
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:56,565
Then what...

331
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,515
Liu Bin?

332
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,298
Why are you here?

333
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:01,739
I'm working here.

334
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:02,970
Oh, right.

335
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,217
Our shop does not welcome those
who ruin other people's relationships.

336
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:07,889
So please leave.

337
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,692
Be an adult and speak like one.

338
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:14,125
May I know, how did I ruin
other people's relationship?

339
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,870
How do you explain this?

340
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,501
Not only you posted a picture of you
and Nan Xi,

341
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,186
there's even a poll comparing you
and Xia Rui.

342
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,221
You are part of the student council,
you should know of a top post.

343
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:34,988
How do you know
I'm part of the student council?

344
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:38,537
Most of our customers
are from your university.

345
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,496
I hear news occasionally.

346
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:44,049
That photo was a good shot.

347
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,034
I want to keep it. Not many people
can have close contact with Nan Xi.

348
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,804
You don't really have this photo, do you?

349
00:29:58,353 --> 00:30:00,202
Are you really doing it on purpose?

350
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,015
Let me tell you something.
Xia Rui and Nan Xi's relationship...

351
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:05,197
won't waver because of this photo.

352
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:06,466
I know.

353
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:08,347
You know and you're still doing this.

354
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:11,770
How come do I, Binzi,
like someone like you.

355
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,472
I'm really blind.

356
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:18,121
Are you confessing to me,
or are you scolding me?

357
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,400
Or are you confessing angrily?

358
00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:25,047
I realize you don't have a little...

359
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,128
Binzi, let's be gentlemen.

360
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:29,401
Boss Yi.

361
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:31,417
I've heard the coffee is nice here.

362
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,771
So it's your shop.

363
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:34,360
As long as all of you like it.

364
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,611
You wanted a hazelnut latte,
half sugar, is that correct?

365
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:38,704
Yes, thank you.

366
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:41,997
No! Our shop
does not have the coffee she wants.

367
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:50,718
Boss Liu, will you fire me
if I don't sell it to her?

368
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,799
No, Boss Yi.

369
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:56,212
When I first joined the shop,
didn't we agree that...

370
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,453
although we serve customers,

371
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,959
we still have the right
to choose guests, right?

372
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,569
It does make sense...

373
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:05,001
Go ahead. A hazelnut latte.

374
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:09,798
Boss Yi,
I just realized that we don't think alike.

375
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,135
Okay, I'll go.

376
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:13,647
I'll go ahead then.

377
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:18,381
I will not breathe the same air as those
who ruin other people's relationships.

378
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:20,066
Hey.

379
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,374
I'm really sorry about that.

380
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:27,212
-Our waiters are usually...
-It's okay, Boss Yi.

381
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,224
He is quite interesting.

382
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,382
Right?

383
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:33,052
Then I will apologize on his behalf.

384
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,967
You don't need to apologize for him.

385
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:35,936
I'm innocent.

386
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:39,146
I believe that one day
he will apologize to me.

387
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:42,044
By the way, Boss Yi, where is my coffee?

388
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:43,275
One moment, please.

389
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,914
You went to Yami.

390
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:50,845
Are you seriously mentioning it now?

391
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,643
You and Boss Yi hid it from me
for so long.

392
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:56,221
What would've happened
if I didn't follow the coffee map?

393
00:31:56,777 --> 00:31:58,584
Then you've met Boss Yi?

394
00:31:58,664 --> 00:31:59,652
Yes.

395
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:02,318
Did you know? Binzi also came to Binhai.

396
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,274
He got this part-time job
to be closer to Yang Yufei.

397
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:07,969
I know.

398
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,622
What's up with you?

399
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:11,927
Oh, nothing.

400
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,831
You...

401
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:16,474
Did you go to social class today?

402
00:32:16,554 --> 00:32:17,843
Yes, I did.

403
00:32:17,923 --> 00:32:20,468
So motivated.

404
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:22,461
It's the class you chose for me.

405
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,894
And then?

406
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:29,592
You recite the text I chose,
I attend the class you chose.

407
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,986
Not because of Yang Yufei?

408
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:34,607
Yang Yufei? Because of her?

409
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,797
No, no, nothing, nothing.

410
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:39,946
There are just some people
talking nonsense.

411
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:42,850
What are you talking about?

412
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,247
Okay. It's this one.

413
00:32:58,091 --> 00:32:59,379
I'll stop going to this class.

414
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:01,566
Don't! Don't stop going.

415
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,431
Don't reject it now.

416
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:04,518
The class is three points.

417
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,383
And it's rare that
you enjoy a class this much.

418
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:07,467
Just attend it, okay?

419
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:09,878
Otherwise, next semester
you'll have to re-select a course.

420
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:15,388
I'll attend the class then.

421
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,214
Are you happy?

422
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,387
Me? I, I...

423
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,121
I'm okay, really.

424
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,739
I get it.

425
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,130
Get what?

426
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,693
Nan Xi.

427
00:33:35,757 --> 00:33:39,269
Is it fun ballroom dancing?

428
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,216
Do you want to try?

429
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:45,101
Try? What do you mean?

430
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:04,286
Sorry.

431
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:07,148
I have problems remembering.

432
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:09,496
I'm not very familiar either.

433
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,641
Then let's try again.

434
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,982
Nan Xi.

435
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:25,618
It might be a little funny.

436
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,059
These two days,

437
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:31,834
I wasn't able to face you and Yang Yufei.

438
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,826
I'm not worried that
there's something between the two of you.

439
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:37,705
I'm just a little scared.

440
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:41,645
Scared that what they say is true.

441
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:45,017
-That I'm not good enough.
-Nonsense.

442
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:51,351
But what they said is not wrong.

443
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:54,644
You're the star of Binhai. I'm just...

444
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:20,917
Nan Xi. Your pillow smells really good.

445
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:23,055
Can you gift it to me?

446
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:25,568
I can hug it to sleep back home.

447
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,276
Okay.

448
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,916
I promised Boss Yi that
I'll frequently go to work at the cafe.

449
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,895
I might get locked out of the dorm often.

450
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:37,427
Can I stay here more often then?

451
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:42,265
How about you move in?

452
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,986
Move in here?

453
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:54,490
This home is also yours.

454
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,825
And this house is also half yours.

455
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:03,974
You want me to move in?

456
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:08,145
Then I have to consider first.

457
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:11,187
After that, we can talk. I'll go sleep.

458
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,738
Move in or not move in?

459
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,170
I'll only know after I've slept.

460
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,753
Xia Rui, welcome home.
