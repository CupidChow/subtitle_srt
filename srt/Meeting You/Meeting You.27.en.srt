1
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:37,795
=Meeting You=

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,244
If you want to go abroad
just to go with me, you don't have to.

3
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,854
From the start,
I never insisted to go to Italy.

4
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:47,313
Aren't we also together
when we are in China?

5
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:49,535
You don't want to go to Italy.

6
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,165
Then, tell me what are these.

7
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:53,807
What are these?

8
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,003
It's not that you do not know.

9
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,395
When I study, I buy a bunch of book...

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,586
Xia Rui.

11
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:03,875
You can never trick me.

12
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,307
I know how important it is for you to go.

13
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:09,641
So, I don't want to break our promise.

14
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:13,273
They can't just investigate us like this.

15
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,607
We can do as Professor Gu said.

16
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,035
Wait until they forget about this.

17
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,165
We can apply to an Italian
school by ourselves...

18
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:23,602
if this isn't solved, it's hard
for the school there to accept us.

19
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,762
But if it is...

20
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:53,403
This is not an adventure.

21
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,213
All this time, it's always you by my side.

22
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:01,129
Protecting me from the outside voices.

23
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,028
You.

24
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,314
Why are you saying this so suddenly?

25
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,120
It's you.

26
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:16,729
You made me believe that
it will be better when we are together.

27
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,081
I, I know.

28
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:26,211
But with this current situation,
don't go with your emotion anymore.

29
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,803
This is not going with my emotion.

30
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,634
Growing up, there are two things
that I must accomplish.

31
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:42,275
First, after the high school exam,
I didn't let you go abroad.

32
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:46,402
Because I knew,
local schools are more suitable for you.

33
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,839
It turns out that you did the right thing.

34
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:53,134
If I did not stay to attend local school,

35
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:56,045
I definitely wouldn't have the chance
to join the World Barista Competition.

36
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,994
And will never meet Weng Beituo.

37
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,752
Secondly, it's now.

38
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,201
We will go to Italy together.

39
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,210
To fulfill your dream.

40
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,319
Our dreams.

41
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:13,576
We can wait till after graduation.

42
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,872
Isn't that fine as well?

43
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:16,349
No way.

44
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,973
We did nothing wrong.

45
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,375
Why should we admit it?

46
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,548
You've said this before.

47
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,063
But, I did...

48
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:28,381
Don't be afraid.

49
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:29,548
I've decided.

50
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:31,653
Would you accompany me?

51
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,582
Okay.

52
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,043
As long as we are together.

53
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,282
We will not be afraid of anything.

54
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:10,006
=Episode 27=
(With you, how can i not be brave)

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,421
Xia Rui, Xia Rui, Xia Rui.

56
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,755
What are you doing here? Come in now.

57
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,263
Come on.

58
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,185
So, we have to face it
head on this time, right?

59
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,443
That's right.
If we want to solve this completely.

60
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:36,796
We must not back down.

61
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,914
Can't back down.

62
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:40,942
With the four of us,
there's nothing that can't be solved.

63
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,849
Isn't that right, Shu?

64
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:43,939
Right?

65
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:48,994
Xia Rui, do you have any plans? Say it!

66
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:50,601
Guide me about your plan.

67
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,356
We have two plans now.

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,095
First, we start from the magazine,
to ask about the contributor's info.

69
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,732
After getting in touch with that person,
depending on the person's reaction,

70
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:02,755
Whether to testify for us, and that
both sides don't have any connections.

71
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,200
Si Bo can also help with this.

72
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,623
Okay then. I'll go find him.

73
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,541
Also, we need to prepare
for the second plan too.

74
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:13,172
We need to prove our innocence.

75
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,880
But, how to prove?

76
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:22,685
Nan Xi's design plan,
can't disappear for no reason.

77
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,077
We need to keep looking.

78
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:25,779
Other than looking for the design plan,

79
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,746
We need to find out how to prove
the date of Nan Xi's design...

80
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,926
is earlier than the magazine's
publishing date.

81
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,062
Only this way can eliminate
the suspicion of plagiarism.

82
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:36,649
I agree. This is called,
killing two birds with one stone.

83
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,762
However, Xia Rui I have a suggestion.

84
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,071
Not sure if you want to listen.

85
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,361
Tell me quick.

86
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:45,165
Okay. We have four people now.

87
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,410
If we act together,
it will be more efficient.

88
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,341
Why don't we divide into two groups?

89
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,257
One goes to magazine firm,
one to look for evidence.

90
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,453
I agree.

91
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:54,496
I'll go with Xia Rui.

92
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,693
No, no.

93
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:56,854
That's not what I meant.

94
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,744
Nan Xi is anxious now, I can't handle it.

95
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,219
Then, I'll go on my own.
Let me contact the magazine.

96
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,745
No, no, no, what are you thinking?

97
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,803
Xia Rui, don't worry about this.

98
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:07,141
You focus on learning Italian.

99
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,498
How can I not worry about it?

100
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,161
Be good.

101
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,900
Don't distract me, okay?

102
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:16,384
This, this.

103
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:17,535
You still have an audience.

104
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:19,009
Please take note.

105
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,577
If that's the case,

106
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:24,223
you'll go find the evidence first.

107
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:26,195
The two of you go to the magazine firm
to look for people.

108
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,232
Okay. I'll go first.

109
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,294
I'll go too.

110
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:34,991
Faster, go.

111
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,613
It's okay. Don't worry.

112
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,245
No right to disclose?

113
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,038
What do you mean no right to disclose?

114
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:31,264
What about their measure?

115
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:34,132
Express their regrets in words.

116
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,548
Express regret?

117
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,802
Just by expressing regret,
they'll let the plagiarism culprit...

118
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,044
to get away by expressing regret?

119
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,154
Sorry, sorry.

120
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:46,964
Can you not express your emotion
without thinking every time?

121
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,860
Can't you look at the situation?

122
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,136
-No, not him...
-Enough.

123
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,384
I'm writing an email.

124
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,104
Telling them what happened.

125
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,384
Isn't this expressing regret?

126
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,365
Is it useful to write it?

127
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:04,894
They didn't review the originality
of the work, and still published.

128
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,363
If we were to pursue,
they are responsible too.

129
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,332
Luckily, our Shu is calm and organized.

130
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,123
I have to quickly sort this matter out.

131
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,377
Think about what's the most important.

132
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:19,884
Our content must have,
must have.. Importance...

133
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:22,331
Right, importance.

134
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:25,330
-Correct. 
-Timeline.

135
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,080
Right, right, right, timeline.

136
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:28,963
I need to make a draft first.

137
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:31,204
This time, we must bring
justice back for Nan Xi.

138
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,155
Shu.

139
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,285
What is it?

140
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:44,245
You just said, we?

141
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,047
I was anxious and said it wrongly.

142
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:52,701
Shu.

143
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,652
You've not talked to me for a long time.

144
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,901
Let's make up.

145
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,703
Did you find out? You've not watched me
play basketball for a long time.

146
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:10,804
Busy recently.

147
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:13,430
It's okay. I'm very forgiving.
I forgive you.

148
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:14,798
Thank you then.

149
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,685
But there's only one chance, for you.

150
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,334
It depends if you could grab it.

151
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,442
Next Wednesday,
I'm making my debut in the C-U-B-A.

152
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:24,045
First time in my life.

153
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,154
Weren't we looking forward to this moment?

154
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:27,774
You can't miss it.

155
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:31,914
You said I should be proud of myself.
I didn't let you down, right?

156
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,182
Congratulations to you then.

157
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,167
I assume you agree. You must go.

158
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:40,598
We'll see.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,569
What we'll see?

160
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,908
I'm asking you one week in advance.

161
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,152
If you have time for empty chat,
why don't you write instead?

162
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:52,624
I'm worried I'll not make it clear.

163
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,846
I'll help you fix it.

164
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,530
Write it.

165
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,160
See you in half an hour.

166
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,990
No, no, no, Shu.

167
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,419
You're really going
to leave me here alone?

168
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,555
This matter is about Nan Xi's future
and innocence.

169
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,350
You have to write it nicely.

170
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,706
See you in half an hour.

171
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:26,629
Come, I'll reserve for you a VIP seat
on the court.

172
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,169
Did you see it, that's Nan Xi.

173
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,354
The one who plagiarized?

174
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:48,945
I heard when he started school his ranking
was higher than senior GaoTing.

175
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,158
I feel unfair for senior Gao Ting.

176
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:52,300
That's right.

177
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:55,380
Who knows if he had cheated
during his high school exam.

178
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,389
Don't be afraid, Woodie.
I'm here.

179
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:21,234
-He Chuan.
-Here.

180
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,315
-Mo Yunchuan.
-Here.

181
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,560
-Qi Yanyu.
-Here.

182
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:31,189
Gao Ting, Gao Ting.

183
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,132
Professor, Gao Ting's preparing
to go abroad.

184
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,338
Not coming for class.

185
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:38,781
The one who should go abroad
is obviously Nan Xi.

186
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:40,570
You said Gao Ting knew it as well.

187
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,867
He's not qualified enough
for the first place,

188
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,839
and he still dare to accept the offer.

189
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,919
You can say it in the forum then.

190
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,239
The negative post which you posted,
it's not useful at all?

191
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:52,661
I've posted it.

192
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:55,361
But the thing is, the post went down
in less than half a day.

193
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:56,914
Nobody read it at all.

194
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:03,129
Panghu, do you think that,
I failed as a journalist.

195
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,381
I can't blame you.

196
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,041
They are blind selectively.

197
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,258
They only believe in what they want to.

198
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,759
But, Nan Xi...

199
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,236
Nan Xi.

200
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:19,858
Here.

201
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:25,350
Look.
The one with the fairest skin is Nan Xi.

202
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,600
Quite handsome.
Just too many bad histories.

203
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,939
The highlight in the forum,
have you guys seen it?

204
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,660
I've seen it.

205
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,859
My high school classmate's roommate
is from Chenghua Middle School.

206
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,960
It's Nan Xi's high school?

207
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:42,003
Right, right, right.

208
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,390
I've heard that.

209
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,813
It doesn't matter if you're injured
and want to escape.

210
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,633
I'll be there waiting.

211
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,660
Waiting for you to bravely walk
under the sun again.

212
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,809
With you here, how can I not be brave.

213
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:13,659
Get up.

214
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,139
How did it go? Did you get anything?

215
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,860
The path to find out the plagiarism
culprit, is completely blocked.

216
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:46,240
But we still sent them a message,
and explained the whole situation.

217
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:49,616
And proposed that we will still keep
the right to continue to sue them.

218
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm waiting for their reply now.

219
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:54,485
What about Shu?

220
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,009
Why didn't she come back with you?

221
00:15:57,986 --> 00:15:59,011
Xia Rui.

222
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,837
Don't mention about it anymore.

223
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:03,718
I've sincerely apologized to her today.

224
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,739
Also bought her favorite drink.

225
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,609
I've also invited her to watch
my C-U-B-A debut match next week.

226
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,141
But she didn't respond.

227
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,640
I really don't know what to do.

228
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,367
You just pay more attention.

229
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:15,837
Fine. Nan Xi and I will attend.

230
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:19,491
But, Xia Rui...

231
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,739
I always feel uneasy
when Shu doesn't attend.

232
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,599
A kind of bad feeling.

233
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,527
Alright, stop thinking about it.

234
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,857
Focus on your match.

235
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,303
We'll go cheer for you. Got it?

236
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,671
Cheer up. It will be fine.

237
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:39,419
Hao Tian, what are you doing?

238
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,005
You still have the mood to take picture
at this time?

239
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:45,057
You don't understand.

240
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:49,476
I'm preparing an article,
summarizing what has happened recently.

241
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,738
Including Nan Xi,
and the influence of people around Nan Xi.

242
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,044
Then for those who responded online.

243
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:56,656
To clarify one by one.

244
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,757
Aren't you going to make things
more complicated?

245
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:03,669
The truth will always be the truth,
so it will just become clearer.

246
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:05,641
Then, open the post,
let me have a look first.

247
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,169
As Nan Xi's manager,
you'll first need my consent.

248
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:16,580
Kidnapped by girlfriend again,
I'm not even curious what he's doing.

249
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:20,767
Meanwhile, let's finish reading the New
Architecture Theory book on this table.

250
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,644
The game is approaching day by day,
with my company.

251
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:26,589
Will definitely get good grades.

252
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:28,209
Nan Xi, go for it.

253
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,283
Xia Rui, look.

254
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,288
Explain this.

255
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:45,646
What's your motive with Nan Xi?

256
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,468
Wrong, wrong. Not this one.

257
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:53,181
This is my private account.

258
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:55,381
Private, private?

259
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,506
Give it back to me.

260
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,433
Wait, what do you mean?

261
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:01,488
I'm the one who sleeps with you everyday.
How can you treat me this way?

262
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:02,759
Give it to me.

263
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:04,039
Show me, stop it.

264
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,128
Stop it.

265
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,100
You guys.

266
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,769
That's too disgusting.

267
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,030
Line up properly and stand properly.

268
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:16,133
Line up here.

269
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,719
The problem is not settled yet,
but you still keep making noise here.

270
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:36,426
Nan Xi, look.

271
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,260
Professor Gu, have a look.

272
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:53,298
This is just a rough sketch
I did few months ago.

273
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:55,959
Later, for the competition,
I made some adjustments.

274
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,599
But the result should be similar.

275
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:05,301
Professor Gu, with this photo,
it proves that Nan Xi did not plagiarize.

276
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,970
This photo,
I will show it to the school admins.

277
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:16,108
The thing about plagiarism,
stop worrying about it.

278
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,668
I promise Nan Xi's study,
will not be affected by this in any way.

279
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:25,094
In addition, the school
will reorganize the award ceremony.

280
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,706
Go back and wait for the news.

281
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,214
Thank you Professor Gu.

282
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,913
Also, I think we should provide
this information to the magazine company.

283
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,855
Maybe, this could help.

284
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,571
Okay, okay.

285
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:38,985
No worries.

286
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:02,009
Professor Gu promised
to prove Nan Xi's innocence. Happy.

287
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:04,177
Good, good.

288
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:08,447
Nan Xi's amazing.

289
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:13,335
Right, next Wednesday,
C-U-B-A's first match. My debut match.

290
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,971
Everyone should come.

291
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:18,779
Nan Xi and I will come cheer for you.
Must enter finals, okay?

292
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,128
A must.

293
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,757
This match, is important
to Binhai University and me.

294
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,600
Shu, I hope you will come.

295
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:40,947
I play basketball because of you.

296
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,280
Shu.

297
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,041
I sent you a message yesterday,
Why didn't you reply to me?

298
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:13,839
I was too busy rehearsing. I forgot.

299
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:18,189
My name has changed in the group.
Did you see it?

300
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,097
I'm not lying to you.

301
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,373
The reason I play basketball
is really because of you.

302
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,399
I don't know if you still remember.

303
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:28,678
But I still remember.

304
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,381
Back then, when I was still known
as Chubby Cheng.

305
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:33,681
You encouraged me to lose weight
by playing basketball.

306
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:36,935
All these years,
I know you don't like basketball.

307
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,361
But still insisted to accompany me
with training every day.

308
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:40,580
Watched NBA with me.

309
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,839
If not because of you,
I couldn't keep up till now.

310
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:46,280
Cheng Erluo,

311
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:50,797
you played well,
because you are talented and hardworking.

312
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:52,246
It has nothing to do with me.

313
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,239
Even without me, there will be others.

314
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,304
No, that's not the same.
How can someone else be the same?

315
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:04,109
The first match of C-U-B-A.
Congratulations.

316
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,977
Then, you must come and see it.

317
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:13,672
Cheng Erluo.

318
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,819
One thing you said was right.
I don't like basketball.

319
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,540
I'll keep the ticket for you,
you must come and watch.

320
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:42,227
Don't think about it, Shu.

321
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:44,623
You're just not used to it.

322
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Time to let go.

323
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,165
Hello.

324
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,700
Shu, where are you?

325
00:22:52,218 --> 00:22:54,122
Cheng Erluo is injured.

326
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,927
Come to the hospital.

327
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:48,521
Wow, they are amazing!

328
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:51,669
They can jump so high,
unlike me, I'm too stupid.

329
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:55,538
Only I can call you stupid. You're not
allowed to call yourself stupid.

330
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:59,401
Chubby Cheng, you're just a little chubby,
just try to lose weight.

331
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,890
When you grow taller,
you will be better than them.

332
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,230
Can I play basketball?

333
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:05,600
Of course.

334
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:07,527
Do you really think so?

335
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,287
Okay, I'll work hard to lose weight.

336
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,809
Okay, I'll supervise you.

337
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:14,097
Pinky promise. Do not break your promise.

338
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,176
Shu.

339
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:56,979
Why are you here?

340
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,713
I thought I was just dreaming.

341
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:01,879
I didn't expect you to come.

342
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:03,569
Lie down first.

343
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:12,893
Does it hurt?

344
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:15,523
Do you know?

345
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:18,447
I really wanted to win today.

346
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:23,786
Even if you're not there,
I want to win it for you.

347
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:26,355
I want to tell you,

348
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:29,149
the one you used to like,

349
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,683
is worthy.

350
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,595
But I didn't expect
to prove it to you this way.

351
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:44,578
I deserve this.

352
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,608
It's not your fault.

353
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,068
You are already very good,
really, it's not your fault.

354
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:54,194
But the me in the past,

355
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:56,868
everything was wrong.

356
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:01,846
I was too stupid.

357
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,288
Never realized your importance to me.

358
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:13,477
I always wanted you to know,
our ten years is real.

359
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:16,718
The Chubby Cheng by your side is not fake.

360
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:19,369
Our previous feeling are not fake.

361
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,960
I want to dance with you again.

362
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:29,893
Beauty and the Beast's dance.

363
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,658
To eat with you at the doorway again,

364
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,047
braised meat and ice-cream.

365
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:41,104
I want to see your encouraging smile
at the basketball court.

366
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,078
These wishes...

367
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,186
can they still come true?

368
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:57,146
Promise me, don't get hurt anymore, okay?

369
00:26:58,902 --> 00:26:59,995
Got it.

370
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,335
Who left the fruit basket here?

371
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:32,999
Sorry, wrong room.

372
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,130
Sorry, sorry.

373
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:35,224
Xia Rui.

374
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,047
Separated already.

375
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:42,936
This Dongren University, bastard.

376
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,983
Not able to keep up,
and started playing dirty.

377
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:47,680
Xia Rui. Who gave this?

378
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,285
I don't know. There's a box, have a look.

379
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,936
This should be from Si Bo.

380
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:05,207
It seems he wants you two to be together.

381
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,108
Lucky you.

382
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,752
If you bully Shu again, you will get it.

383
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:12,268
Not too hard.

384
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:18,198
Really. Acting lovey dovey in front of me.

385
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,849
Little Shu, I still want a piece of cake.

386
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:37,070
Can you order it for me?

387
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:39,019
Order it yourself.

388
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:43,380
My leg is broken.

389
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:47,072
Please help me, or can I eat this one?

390
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:51,613
Feed me.

391
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,886
Okay. Open your mouth.

392
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,296
Open your mouth.

393
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:02,591
Eat it yourself. Your leg's broken,
not your hand.

394
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,971
Shu's so fierce.

395
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,220
I'm so scared. But I really like it.

396
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,938
-Cheng Erluo, you really...
-No, no.

397
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:15,448
Disgusting.

398
00:29:22,657 --> 00:29:24,727
What're they doing? Both of them.

399
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:34,519
Yifei, thank you so much
for teaching me Italian.

400
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:39,976
It's nothing.

401
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:43,169
Speaking of which, are you not
going to go abroad?

402
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,005
Can Nan Xi agree?

403
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,559
He will definitely not agree at this time.

404
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:51,081
But, it's been a long time
since the competition.

405
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,608
We'll wait for him to complete
his graduation project,

406
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,610
and see if there's any school
interested in him.

407
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,638
That's too long. Too volatile.
We'll see later.

408
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,216
Sure thing.

409
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,667
And I think this time, staying
in the country to learn about coffee,

410
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,313
gaining some experience, is not bad.

411
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:08,629
But I still think, you can learn
your Italian first, gain more skills.

412
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:12,676
Even if you don't study abroad,
it's useful for traveling as well, right?

413
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,908
No, during this time,
I was tortured by this competition.

414
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:17,056
I really want to throw up.

415
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,140
I have to rest. It's time,
I need to go home and cook.

416
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,229
I'm leaving. Bye bye.

417
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,381
Bye bye.

418
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:33,427
Go home and cook.
I want to go home and cook.

419
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,809
Is this what our Xia Rui would say?

420
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,907
All these years,
there have been many unexpected things.

421
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,870
It's an email from the magazine company.

422
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,669
They received Nan Xi's sketch photo
taken 3 months ago,

423
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:52,611
and decided to send us the email
of the anonymous contributor.

424
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:55,280
They said, if he really plagiarized
the manuscript,

425
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,184
they're willing
to formally apologize to us.

426
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:01,479
Xia Rui, Xia Rui, Xia Rui.

427
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:02,906
Xia Rui has left.

428
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:04,536
Here, eat.

429
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,579
-You disgusting man.
-This is called macho.

430
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,419
Quickly send the email address
to Nan Xi and Xia Rui.

431
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:16,890
QQ mailbox? I'll try to add him as friend.

432
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,893
Rejected my friend request? Smart.

433
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:32,309
But it looks like a girl's profile photo.

434
00:31:32,706 --> 00:31:34,249
Let me try.

435
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:38,201
Girl?

436
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:40,276
Then that's easy.

437
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,199
There are not many girls
in their school anyway.

438
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,920
This time, the scope is reduced by a lot.
Send the email to Hao Tian and Panghu.

439
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:49,393
Let them investigate.

440
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:51,649
Okay, okay, thanks.

441
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:54,244
Profile photo is a girl.

442
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,607
Might not be a girl.

443
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:58,063
Cheng Hao's profile photo is a kitten.

444
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:00,707
That's true.

445
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:03,452
Who is this?

446
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,322
Who it is right now,

447
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:14,324
is no longer important.

448
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:16,264
Why is it not important?

449
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,201
Let me tell you, I must find that person.

450
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:20,075
If I found him, I'll blast his head.

451
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:22,207
Put down the knife.

452
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:28,200
I've said many times, don't hold a knife.

453
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:31,575
Don't you remember? It's very dangerous.

454
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,771
I hate it.

455
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:36,001
Using your charm again.

456
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,990
What? Not satisfied?

457
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:44,696
How can I not be satisfied?

458
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,750
The phone is ringing.

459
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,621
Pick up.

460
00:33:00,642 --> 00:33:05,515
Nan Xi, my grade one junior
is responsible for the award ceremony.

461
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,574
We found the owner of the email address.

462
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:13,387
Found, found it?
