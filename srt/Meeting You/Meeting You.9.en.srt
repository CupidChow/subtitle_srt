[Meeting You]

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,550
Students

3
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,250
During this sports meet,

4
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,550
our class has united and achieved gratifying results

5
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,350
As your head teacher,

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,050
I feel extremely proud

7
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,150
However, the end of the sports meet

8
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,050
means that there's only one big thing left for you to do this semester

9
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,650
Study

10
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,350
Meet your end-of-term exam head-on!

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,150
Your mission in this semester is

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,050
to finish studying all of the contents of all three Grades of high school

13
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,950
This way, when you become Grade Three students,

14
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,750
you can tackle all sorts of problems and review everything thoroughly

15
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,550
Students, time is tight and the mission is heavy

16
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,450
No way

17
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,350
Enough, enough, enough! Why are you howling again?

18
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,050
I'm telling you

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,350
If you want to fail your exam next year

20
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,750
and repeat another round as my student, I don't have any objections

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,250
Well

22
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,550
I have! I have objections!

23
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,750
If you do, shout out our slogan!

24
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,350
If it's not painful and tiring,

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,450
high school is meaningless

26
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,550
Louder! If it's not painful and tiring,

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,450
high school is meaningless

28
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,950
A life without hard work is a life wasted!

29
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,550
[Episode 9]
[Just because I want to be with you]

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,940
[Bird Tea Coffee]

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,550
Dear Shu, I just said it casually

32
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,650
but look how seriously you took it

33
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,450
Since you said that, let's not do any review

34
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,050
Don't be jealous when you see Nan Xi and Xia Rui

35
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,550
Don't! They have already betrayed the revolution

36
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,050
The two of us can't disband!

37
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,150
Then do you want to review or not?

38
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,150
What I value most is not whether we study or not. Rather, it's revolutionary friendship

39
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,950
Why are you still unable to get this point?

40
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,750
You just love to randomly throw yourself into the fun

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,950
Of course not

42
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,350
You are my most, most, most important revolutionary partner

43
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,150
Dear Shu, why is your face as red as a monkey's butt?

44
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,850
Are you feeling hot?

45
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,850
Do you want me to get you a bottle of iced vitamin water?

46
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,550
- No need
- If you don't like drinking beverages

47
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,850
Boss Yi also has iced spring water

48
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,250
I already said it wasn't needed. Hurry and do your homework

49
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,250
Okay then

50
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,150
If you're hot, you can fan yourself

51
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,350
Cheng Erluo, you really are...

52
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,750
- Let's compete
- Then let's do it. What will we compete on?

53
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,050
Recite the poems from "Preface to Poems on the Prince of Teng's Pavilion" and see who can recite it faster

54
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,550
- You know very well that I can't recite it—
- Ready, go!

55
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,750
"This is the old county Yuzhang and new town of Hongdu It faces the stars Yi and Zheng and its land connects Heng and Lu It borders three rivers and five lakes—"

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,950
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

57
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,450
- I admit defeat. I'll admit defeat, okay?
- That was what I was anticipating you saying

58
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,550
- Then I want...
- Vanilla or lemon flavor

59
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,350
It would be better if both were included

60
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,950
Chubby Cheng truly understands me. Go ahead

61
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,650
Wait

62
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,050
You are my most, most, most reliable revolutionary comrade

63
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,650
Why are you smiling?

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,250
Nothing

65
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,350
You were fine just now. Why are you suddenly angry?

66
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,350
Do you want to try my chocolate flavor?

67
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,950
It tastes great

68
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,250
My shop's new rule is that food from other places cannot be brought inside!

69
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,750
We aren't going to bring it inside. The window—

70
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,150
H-hold it for me. Hold it for me

71
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,250
I wiped it super clean

72
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,750
Dear Shu, how come your face got red again?

73
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,350
Cheng Erluo, seriously...

74
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,650
Grade Two's second semester's final exam starts now

75
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,550
How was it?

76
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,950
Not bad, Rui

77
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,550
Enough, enough! Don't compare answers. The exam is over

78
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,750
However, it must be said that

79
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,550
our Godly Nan Xi is truly amazing

80
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,450
He predicted Chinese composition, English composition, and the Physics final question perfectly!

81
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,850
- Yes.
- Dear Shu and I really rubbed off the benefits from Rui

82
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,950
I'm telling you, you got it easy this time. Next time, you have to pay Nan Xi

83
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,150
However, I think this time's exam paper was definitely harder than it was in the past

84
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,550
Especially English

85
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,150
It's okay. If it's hard, it will be hard for everyone

86
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,650
I think

87
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,350
my being ranked 200th this time

88
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,650
shouldn't be a problem

89
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,750
- How about you, Rui?
- Me?

90
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,150
I guessed all of the questions toward the end

91
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,450
However, I finished writing my composition and left no blanks

92
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,950
I've finished testing anyway. Why think so much on it?

93
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,750
Rui, did you fill in your math exam completely?

94
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,350
No, no, no

95
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,150
I didn't write a single one of the essay questions. They're all blank

96
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,550
If you ask me to write one seriously, I wouldn't know the answer

97
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,350
However, I followed the tips Nan Xi gave me to write it

98
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,350
First, I wrote a solution, which is two points,

99
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,950
and then I drew three dots, for one point

100
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,150
Then, I wrote the required conditions

101
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,650
and you just work along the process as you see it

102
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,150
Afterwords, you add three more dots and write the results

103
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,350
Once the teacher sees how complete the paper is,

104
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,050
and how great the attitude and handwriting are,

105
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,150
don't the points fall into your hands?

106
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,050
Nice. Nice. Nice

107
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,950
Godly Nan Xi

108
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,150
when will you get me a one-on-one class like that?

109
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,150
You won't

110
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,350
You rejected me again

111
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,150
I think Rui will have a big improvement this time

112
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,150
My requests aren't high Just 400 points is enough

113
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,350
The process of improvement has to be steady

114
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,950
If steps are too big, it's easy to fall

115
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,350
Alright! Alright!

116
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,150
I will say something before you go

117
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,550
Tomorrow,

118
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,150
your summer vacation will officially begin

119
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,550
Enough, enough, enough

120
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,950
However, do you know what it means for you

121
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,750
once this summer ends?

122
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,750
What?

123
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,950
It means the school begins again

124
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,550
You will officially become Grade Three students

125
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,250
Grade Three students

126
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,950
here at our Chenghua High School

127
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,850
are highly protected

128
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,850
The school cafeteria has Grade Three window seats

129
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,250
Ribs, braised pork, and sauced beef are all yours to eat

130
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,750
I love Chenghua!

131
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,550
Look at how silly you are

132
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,350
Is the meaning of life

133
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,050
all about that bite to eat?

134
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,150
It depends on what we're eating in that bite!

135
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,550
Another piece of good news is that this time's final exams

136
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,350
were very difficult

137
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,350
Don't feel discouraged! We just wanted to prepare everyone this time

138
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,150
It's also to wrap up your entire

139
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,750
learning career in Grade Two

140
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,150
Due to the high difficulty, we anticipated that your results

141
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,750
might not be ideal

142
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,250
Thus, we've decided to let you finish the summer vacation first,

143
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,750
and announce your grades after you return

144
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,950
Don't be too happy too soon!

145
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,350
Consider that after the next year, you'll all go your separate ways

146
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,150
You've been together for three years and have a deep bond

147
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,350
There will definitely be lots of things you are unable to let go of

148
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,950
so the school is painstakingly eliminating many obstacles

149
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,150
to give you more time to interact with each other

150
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,150
What does this mean?

151
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,950
Today is June 20th

152
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,350
On July 4th, arrive at school on time

153
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,150
Attend class on time

154
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,450
Two weeks?

155
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,350
Why is this not summer vacation?

156
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,150
If summer vacations with homework aren't vacations, what are they?

157
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,250
Okay, stop being noisy! You should feel lucky

158
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,750
If I were the principal

159
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,350
I wouldn't even give you a two-week holiday

160
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,950
Pack your things and get ready for school to end

161
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,950
Go home early

162
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,950
Are you free tomorrow? I want—

163
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,350
What are you two going to do?

164
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,750
Surely you two don't want to be alone together again behind our backs?

165
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,850
I just knew it! Where else could Rui invite people?

166
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,750
She doesn't have any creativity

167
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,850
Can't we just go and tell them that we want to join them?

168
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,350
Why do we have to stalk them?

169
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,350
Dear Shu, how come at such a key moment, you've become muddle-headed?

170
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,950
Rui goes into "everyone is her brother" mode whenever there's a crowd

171
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,550
We can only see what she's truly like when she's alone with someone else

172
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,550
Your student is out there. Won't you go out and take a look?

173
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,350
Do you think I have nothing to do with my time?

174
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,350
It's already vacation. Why would I continue caring about those rowdy children?

175
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,450
Let them play for a few more days

176
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,450
Why is Rui still not here yet?

177
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,550
It tastes so good

178
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,950
Mom, buy me a coffee machine plz

179
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,550
I just knew it. Accompanying me to eat breakfast so early in the morning must've meant bad news

180
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,550
Are you saying that my sister is a weasel?

181
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,750
Then, you are a baby weasel

182
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,350
It's fine if you want a coffee machine

183
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,750
If you get 500 points in the final exam, I'll buy it for you

184
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,550
No, Madam Shao, I can understand that you're a business woman

185
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,350
but is this the right attitude to have a business discussion?

186
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,150
500? Can't you give me room to bargain?

187
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,750
Give a number

188
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,550
- 430
- Okay

189
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,350
430. I agree. Deal

190
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,150
You're insane! I didn't even finish saying the number. I meant 350

191
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,150
It's final

192
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,550
You reduced it from 500 to 430

193
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,550
You cut 14% just by opening your mouth once

194
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,550
A discount of 14% is good enough

195
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,850
My goodness. Terrible

196
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,550
You don't have to buy it. I'm going back to Grandma's house

197
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,950
You can't. Your brother is taking art classes, and he has been getting homework lately

198
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,350
I have things to attend to and need to go out today

199
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,550
I won't be at home. Stay at home and watch him

200
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,950
- I don't want to!
- I don't want to!

201
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,350
He's already so old. Does he still need to be watched?

202
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,550
Besides, don't you know your own son? Would I be able to watch him well?

203
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,250
You overestimated me too much

204
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,250
For your grades, I'll offer you 6% more. A 20% discount

205
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,950
- 400
- Deal

206
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,750
You made the deal so quickly?

207
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,550
Did you ask for my opinion as the person involved?

208
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,750
No need

209
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,550
- Hello?
- Nan Xi, save me!

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,550
Hurry and go!

211
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,150
Those bratty kids left messages again?

212
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,550
This is the essence of life. There's nowhere to run

213
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,950
Here

214
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,750
Xia Rui posted these herself in the past

215
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,550
Then, those children thought it was pretty interesting

216
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,550
so they added more and more

217
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,550
There really is no place to escape

218
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,350
Nan Xi, you've finally come. I—

219
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,150
Who is here? Who is here?

220
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,950
They hugged, Dear Shu!

221
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,050
You don't have to—

222
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,950
Let go of my sister!

223
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,850
Okay, okay, okay

224
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,950
You are Nan Xi?

225
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,150
You have the temperament I like

226
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,050
You look gentle

227
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,350
What do you like about my sister?

228
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,950
For god sake, hurry and sit down!

229
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,950
Eat fruit. Be good, okay?

230
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,550
Here. You eat, too

231
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,150
If we have to bring this child with us, we won't be able to go anywhere. What do we do?

232
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,550
- You have a plan?
- No

233
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,850
I have a plan

234
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,950
Don't act like I don't know what your plan is

235
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,450
Your plan is to be good and draw at home

236
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,150
You will only have a happy life is my 20% is secured

237
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,750
Otherwise... Do you understand?

238
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,150
A gentleman doesn't take advantage of people in perilous situations

239
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,850
It's threatening

240
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,950
What do you mean?

241
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,350
It means you're bluffing in order to intimidate him

242
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,750
You're saying that I'm bluffing?

243
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,550
Brother Nan Xi, you're so right

244
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,050
Get up!

245
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,350
Go and draw now

246
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,950
Draw obediently. I'm watching you draw

247
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,950
I can't find inspiration, so I can't draw

248
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,150
Inspiration ran out the door and left again, right?

249
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,350
- Sister
- Don't call me Sister. Just say whatever you're gonna say

250
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,150
Sister, Good Sister, do you know what day it is today?

251
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,550
I don't know

252
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,350
The opening of the Anime Convention

253
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,350
Take me there to open my eyes and find the inspiration I lost

254
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,050
It's summer vacation, my precious baby

255
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,250
When you get to the Anime Convention, it's hard to say if you'll be looking at the anime, or the people

256
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,550
Don't go. Draw at home

257
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,150
I can't find inspiration, so I can't draw

258
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,650
If you can't finish your mission, you will need to get 430 points

259
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,550
If you can't get 430 points, you won't be able to get a coffee machine

260
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,150
Do you know who is deciding your fate right now?

261
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,550
You dare to threaten me now?

262
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,550
- Intimidation tactics!
- You little punk

263
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,550
Brother Nan Xi, am I correct?

264
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,450
Pretty much. It's correct enough

265
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,050
- So you mean that I have room to improve?
- Of course you do

266
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,750
How about we hike up the mountain?

267
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,550
Hike up the mountains?

268
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,950
Find inspiration in the mountains

269
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,750
How did you find such a place?

270
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,250
As a local,

271
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,650
I've only heard Dear Shu talk about it, but have never been here

272
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,150
It's because there are lots of rare timber here, and they're all great

273
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,550
Is that so?

274
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,150
Can you slow down?

275
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,550
What a summer vacation!

276
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,450
I followed an elderly tourist group to go hiking?

277
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,150
If this news gets out, I'll get mocked so badly

278
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,450
Who are you calling an elderly person?

279
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,350
Old sister, since we have the same mom

280
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,950
I'll call you "Sister"

281
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,050
However, if we calculate based on age,

282
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,250
I need to call you, "Auntie"

283
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,150
After a few days of not disciplining you, you start to get bratty?

284
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,450
Do women really explode once age is mentioned?

285
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,750
- So scary! So scary!
- Don't move!

286
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,250
Slow down. Are you okay?

287
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,750
I am okay

288
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,350
Men become so boring after they grow up

289
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,750
Looks like that's true

290
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,260
No wonder my sister calls you "Little Wood." You truly are a piece of wood

291
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,160
Not even your appearance can save you

292
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,240
That's just the way he is. Ignore him. Let's go

293
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,040
Hurry, hurry, hurry, Dear Shu!

294
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,320
My Godly Nan is indeed extraordinary

295
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,180
He's even able to arrange a date here

296
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,720
I'm actually kind of tired

297
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,540
-Dear Shu, how are you? Are you okay?
- I'm fine

298
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,710
It's so hot, but we don't have water or food

299
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,520
How about we go back?

300
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,820
I'm fine

301
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,380
Since we're already here, I want to go somewhere

302
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,320
Where?

303
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,880
Do you need to take more?

304
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,360
You can't even fit it all in your bag. Let's collect more next time

305
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,120
It's alright

306
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,210
I have heard of collecting antiques,

307
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,480
collecting watches, and collecting athletic shoes,

308
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,380
but I never heard of collecting wood!

309
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,080
Don't continue stuffing them. I'll help you grab them. Look how full your bag is!

310
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,390
I'm fine. You have to be careful

311
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,140
This is very dangerous

312
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,740
Oh my God

313
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Let's leave quickly!

314
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,080
Sister, you've grown up. You've learned to care for others

315
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,140
However, I still hope it's Nan Xi's appearance that you've fallen for

316
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
I'm telling you, once I get back, I'll tell Madam Shao

317
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,760
you should never be allowed to watch any dramas ever again, not even one

318
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,400
Keep up

319
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,160
Still walking?

320
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,860
I am your brother

321
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,800
Can't you care about me for a moment?

322
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,590
- Hurry and come
- I'm so tired

323
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,640
Finally here

324
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,720
- Go, go, go
- Okay

325
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,560
Little Haozi, come! Come, come!

326
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,740
Come here

327
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,880
One, two, three. Is it pretty?

328
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,400
Pretty

329
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Isn't it beautiful? You've never seen scenery like this, have you?

330
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,080
You can only see such views when you're with your Brother Nan Xi

331
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,020
Sister, give me my sketchbook

332
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,420
Okay I'll get it

333
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,660
- You can draw now
- Okay

334
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,160
I'll rest for a while

335
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,160
Hello?

336
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Hello, Xia Rui

337
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,760
Cheng Erluo and I are in a square-shaped pavilion

338
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,240
We got lost when we followed you

339
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,540
Hello?

340
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,320
Hello, can you hear me, Xia Rui?

341
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,030
Hello?

342
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,790
What happened? Did something happen?

343
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,640
I don't know either. Wait a moment

344
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,800
Hello, the phone you called is currently in a call. Please call back later

345
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,940
What happened?

346
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,220
Just now, Yishu called me and said they got lost

347
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,760
After they followed us, they got lost

348
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,600
- It's just
- Got lost?

349
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,440
Followed us?

350
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,500
Then, they were stalking us

351
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,020
I don't know what they were doing either

352
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,600
Is the sun setting soon?

353
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,940
They're down the mountain. We'd better go search

354
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,460
- Haozi. Young Haozi
- What?

355
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,250
Go, go, go Get up!

356
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,820
Where are we going?

357
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,220
- Hurry, hurry, hurry
- I'm begging you! Before doing anything, can't you ask for my opinion first?

358
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,700
Don't forget that the main character of the day is me!

359
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,810
I know, I know

360
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,400
Did they say there was anything nearby?

361
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,300
Nearby... let me think

362
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,540
She said something about a square-shaped pavilion

363
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,670
A square-shaped pavilion?

364
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes

365
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,610
- I know
- You know?

366
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,820
Go, go, go, go! Hurry!

367
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,480
You slow down, slow down

368
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,320
Where shall we look for them?

369
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,180
Never mind. Let's guess randomly. Go

370
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,140
Xia Rui, wait a minute

371
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,450
[Holly Tree: Shade-loving
500-1000 meteres above sea level]
[Camphor Tree: Sun-loving
Enjoys light and warmth, but is sensitive to coldness]

372
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,620
This way

373
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,200
Didn't I say to go left?

374
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,200
He is a strange piece of wood

375
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,660
My goodness. Dear Shu!

376
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,540
- We didn't go the wrong way!
- Rui!

377
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,300
- Rui!
- You're finally here

378
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,600
Rui, Rui

379
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,170
You scared me to death. Are you okay?

380
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,080
- Enough, enough. It's okay now
- Rui!

381
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,940
I'm a living human! Don't you care about my feelings?

382
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,550
What's with you?

383
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,550
If it weren't for this pavilion, I never would've been able to find you two!

384
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,300
- I was so anxious!
- It's all my fault. I let him come

385
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,500
Blame me, blame me

386
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,880
You grown people are so strange. What's so nice about a stupid pavilion?

387
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,080
I will act as Snow White

388
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,300
Xiao Mei, you are Cinderella

389
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,160
Okay

390
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,290
- Qiuqiu, you are Princess Ariel
- Okay

391
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,190
Shushu, you are Princess Belle

392
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,300
Okay!

393
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,810
Let's have a dance celebration together!

394
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,060
If you're all princesses, what will I be?

395
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,070
You will be our coachman

396
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,060
I don't want to be your coachman

397
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,160
I want to be a prince

398
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,420
What kind of prince is as fat as you?

399
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,520
Exactly, exactly!

400
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,540
How about you play with me and be my prince?

401
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,340
Then it's settled. You are my princess

402
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,480
Even after we grow up, you will be my princess forever

403
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,940
What? My Sister Yishu was betrothed at childhood just like that?

404
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,860
Those don't mean anything. Children babble thoughtlessly, understand?

405
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,500
What?

406
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,960
I didn't even get a chance to scold you. What's wrong with you?

407
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,200
You stalked me?

408
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,640
Were you lacking a beat in a few days?

409
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,980
Rui, you're too unreasonable! You don't own the mountain

410
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,290
Only you can go on a date with a man here, but Dear Shu and I can't go traveling?

411
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,490
If you two aren't having an impure relationship, why are you afraid of me?

412
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,460
So you also think that there is something impure between my sister and Nan Xi?

413
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,540
Hey, Young Haozi

414
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,020
Rui, how did you and Nan Xi find this place?

415
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,010
Cheng Erluo and I spent a lot of time running around, but it felt like we were circling the same place and couldn't get out

416
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,240
It's like Nan Xi can speak to the timber here. It's amazing

417
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,580
He brought us here

418
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,420
The two of them didn't have a normal relationship during high school

419
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,620
Are you done gossiping?

420
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,060
The day is going to go dark soon. Watch out for the ghosts

421
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,960
Th-then we should go home quick

422
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,320
Hurry, hurry

423
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,500
There are ghosts!

424
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,780
Hello, Dear Shu? Have you gotten home?

425
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,980
That's good then

426
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,500
Help me warn Cheng Erluo not to joke about me and Nan Xi anymore

427
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,480
We're all brothers. If this continues, wouldn't it be so awkward?

428
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,640
Okay, then rest earlier. Bye

429
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,460
This little fatty

430
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,680
Let me

431
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,880
It's fine. I can carry him

432
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,400
Let me do it

433
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,160
Are you okay?

434
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,900
- I am fine
- Let me take the bag

435
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,140
He is very heavy

436
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,980
It's okay

437
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,820
Let me know if you are tired

438
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,400
I am not

439
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,560
Thank you, Nan Xi for spending all day with us

440
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,080
You must be tired. Put him down quickly

441
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,000
Young Haozi

442
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
Come here

443
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,640
Xia Rui, thank you for today

444
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,100
Why thank me? Don't forget! We are brothers

445
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,520
Here you go

446
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,590
Then I'll go inside

447
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,880
- Bye
- Bye

448
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,480
Go

449
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,040
Bye

450
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,340
Oh my goodness

451
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,840
You two acting in your idol drama can really give people so much anxiety

452
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,310
As one born after 2000, I truly don't understand the world of you 90's children

453
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,800
What a waste of pretending to sleep

454
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,720
Good brothers? It makes people laugh so hard their teeth fall out

455
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
Pretended to sleep?

456
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,380
You pretended to sleep?

457
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,280
You want to die, Young Haozi?

458
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,800
Stop! Stop!

459
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,000
You've got to think it through before you punish me

460
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,040
Don't forget

461
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,680
I have evidence of your crime of puppy love

462
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,560
What evidence of puppy love?

463
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm telling you, you brat. What kind of things go on in your brain? What puppy love?

464
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,460
Your Brother Nan Xi and I are friends. Good friends, okay?

465
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,770
Show this drawing to anyone

466
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,740
Anyway, I didn't do anything worthy of guilt, so I don't fear any consequences

467
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,440
- Really?
- Yes

468
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,820
Mom!

469
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,660
Enough, my good brother

470
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,700
This is not good

471
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,060
Let me give you a massage

472
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,470
Dear Shu, why did you come so late today?

473
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,690
Why else, if not because of you?

474
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,310
- Me?
- In order to copy down the review summaries for you,

475
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,120
I went to bed at 3 AM last night

476
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,380
Look at the dark circles under my eyes. I've almost got them puffed up into panda eyes

477
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,160
Gosh!

478
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,280
No way

479
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,440
The holiday has just begun

480
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,670
My summer life! My sunshine! My sweet 17!

481
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,300
Impressive, Young Luoluo

482
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,550
Now, you can even use English to express emotion, right?

483
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,860
Then let's use this opportunity to review English, okay?

484
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,040
No

485
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,020
I surrender to you completely! I'll bow down to you

486
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,860
Dear Shu

487
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,680
I am really confused

488
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,020
What's wrong?

489
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,080
Look, look, look

490
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,990
This review summary, such a clear handwriting

491
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,090
Such level of detail and organization

492
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,660
And

493
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,180
Such an adorable Dear Shu
