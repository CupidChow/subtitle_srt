=Meeting You=

2
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,896
I'm exhausted. My gosh.

3
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,220
Ancestor, I beg of you.

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,800
-Don't drink anymore.
-Why?

5
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,476
Stop drinking! Stop! Stop!

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,796
No, no, no.

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,200
-Hurry, hurry.
-I tell you what.

8
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:59,547
I found out alcohol is actually really
good. I'm drinking it for the first time.

9
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,816
-Drink it later, alright?
-No.

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,496
I'll buy you a new bottle.
Come, come, come.

11
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,796
Let's go to the couch.

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,876
Come.
I'll get you a new one.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,816
Okay, okay, okay.

14
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,176
Okay, let's go.

15
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,140
You lie to me.

16
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,525
No, no, no.

17
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,609
Then let's sit on the sofa
and drink, okay?

18
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,325
Okay, I'll let you drink.
I'll let you drink.

19
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:18,685
We'll sit down and drink.

20
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,449
Good, good, good.

21
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,665
The stairs.
Walk the stairs.

22
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,005
Stairs.
Walk down the stairs.

23
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:26,325
One, two, go.

24
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:27,525
Oh my goodness.

25
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,769
Okay.

26
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,085
Alright, let's not drink first.
Okay?

27
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:38,529
No way. Just drink.

28
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,485
Then let's not drink it now.

29
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,903
I'll buy you one in a bit, okay?
I'll buy you one that tastes better.

30
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:48,089
No. Xia Rui bought this for me.
No one can snatch it.

31
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:50,985
Tell me.

32
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:54,629
Why can't anyone snatch
the stuff Xia Rui bought for you?

33
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,449
Because Xia Rui is mine.

34
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:13,289
No one is allowed to snatch her.
No one can steal it away too.

35
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,625
Good boy.

36
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,285
Xia Rui told me that
she likes good babies who don't drink.

37
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,285
If you want to give
this bottle to Xia Rui.

38
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,145
-Xia Rui will be very happy.
-Who said this?

39
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,289
You don't understand Xia Rui.

40
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:27,545
You're not Xia Rui.

41
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,469
Who said I am not Xia Rui!

42
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,789
Take a closer look
at whether am I Xia Rui!

43
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,809
Why are you so fierce?

44
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,007
You're not Xia Rui.

45
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,309
Xia Rui just told me
that she wants to play a game with you.

46
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,245
Finish listening before you drink.

47
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:05,629
Do you want to play?

48
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,689
Xia Rui said that?

49
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,065
She said to play a game.

50
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:13,533
We count one, two, three and down.

51
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:16,877
Whoever sleeps the longest
and perseveres for...

52
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:23,645
-Why don't you play?
-I am playing.

53
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:26,929
-I haven't finish the rules.
-Three, two, one.

54
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,109
I'm going to sleep now.

55
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:35,689
I'm going to win.

56
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,229
Why do I feel a little dizzy?

57
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,385
No talking allowed.

58
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,409
You'll lose if you speak too.

59
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:12,309
Nan Xi.

60
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,889
Nan Xi.

61
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,449
Xia Rui.

62
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,305
We will definitely.

63
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,849
Be together forever and ever.

64
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:41,728
We will always be together.

65
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:54,369
=Episode 26=
(Our Promise Cannot Be Broken)

66
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,129
Woke up?

67
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:14,202
Yes.

68
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:25,209
Does your head still hurt?

69
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,202
Yes.

70
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:28,769
Come, take a sip.

71
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,029
Take a sip, be good.

72
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,929
Take another sip.

73
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,185
Take another sip.

74
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,969
I won't pour you water anymore.

75
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,429
Not for you.

76
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:48,949
Last sip.

77
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,205
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

78
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,529
Drink, drink, drink.

79
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:56,565
That doesn't count.

80
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,471
You didn't drink it.

81
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,889
Drink a little bit more.
A little bit more.

82
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:02,996
Okay, okay, okay.

83
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:09,985
-Headache?
-Yes.

84
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,985
Will you still drink in the future?

85
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,545
-Yes.
-What?

86
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:14,462
No.

87
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,102
Yes.

88
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:19,109
Disobedient.

89
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:24,565
Nan Xi.

90
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,965
The design competition is complete.

91
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,465
We have also tried our best.

92
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,888
Then wait for the results
of the competition, okay?

93
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:33,864
And as for me.

94
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,705
I will start working hard.

95
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,570
Definitely won't drag you down.

96
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,129
When did you ever drag me down?

97
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:43,145
And I also have to study Italian hard.

98
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,389
Try my best to take tests.

99
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,309
Work hard to go to Italy with you.

100
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,709
I even made up a slogan.

101
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:54,749
What?

102
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,145
I'll try hard.

103
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,425
I'll succeed.

104
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:00,924
I'm going to Italy.

105
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,405
What kind of slogan is this?

106
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,965
Nice. Chant it with me.

107
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,985
I'll try hard. I'll succeed.
I'm going to Italy.

108
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:07,945
No, it's too silly.

109
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,945
Stand up, stand up. Stand up and chant.

110
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,525
-I'll try hard. I'll success.
-That's too stupid.

111
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,485
No, it's not stupid.

112
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,765
Chant it together with me.

113
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,145
Ready, go.

114
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,309
I'll try hard. I'll succeed.
I'm going to Italy.

115
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,049
Be careful.

116
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,065
I'll try hard. I'll succeed.
I'm going to Italy.

117
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:29,505
I'll try hard. I'll succeed.
I'm going to Italy.

118
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,185
Grinder... Grinder...

119
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,085
A cup of coffee... A cup of coffee...

120
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,205
If you would like
to drink this cup of coffee in my hand.

121
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,169
Come to Yami.

122
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:40,749
Xia Rui.

123
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,005
You always appear on my live broadcast.

124
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,230
My popularity dropped.

125
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,745
What happened?
Am I so unpresentable?

126
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,125
Who made your coffee?

127
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,765
No. You did it. But.

128
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,765
You're the one doing the content.

129
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:57,285
And I am the salesman, right?

130
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,465
That's a different matter.

131
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,229
It's still a set, really.

132
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,865
Yufei. You are here.

133
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,545
What do you want to drink?
I'll do it for you.

134
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,845
I came to bring Binzi some materials.
Just on the way.

135
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,009
Didn't I say I'll pick it up myself?

136
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,065
You even came all the way.

137
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,205
University entrance examination tuition?

138
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,739
Binzi. You want to take
the university entrance examination?

139
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,025
Great!
That's great, that's great.

140
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,065
No, no.
I'm just considering about it.

141
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,345
Xia Rui, keep this a secret for me.

142
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,625
Or else everyone
will have high expectations on me later.

143
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,025
And if I don't pass it,
or ruin the examination, then it is over.

144
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,965
-No way.
-It's okay.

145
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:31,185
You take care of the tuition now.
I can also help you.

146
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,249
We definitely can.

147
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,805
There's a situation with you two.

148
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,505
No situation.
Let's learn Italian, good.

149
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,545
Xia Rui.
You're learning Italian?

150
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,462
Yes.

151
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,265
Binzi, make me a cup of coffee please.

152
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,225
Okay.

153
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:46,974
During the coffee competition,

154
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:50,225
Xia Rui was hand-picked
by an Italian master.

155
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:53,305
As long as she can master Italian, she
will be able to study there for a year.

156
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:54,425
Really?

157
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,342
Congratulations.

158
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,365
It's not confirmed
whether or not I am going.

159
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:59,585
I applied for an Italian language class.

160
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,825
But the intensity of the class
is too high.

161
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:03,869
You can take my help.

162
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,105
I learned Italian during my second degree.

163
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,845
If you are free,
I can spare an hour or two daily.

164
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,705
We can converse in Italian.

165
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,225
That should be able to help you.

166
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,825
Are you sure Yufei?

167
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,749
I'm not a very smart student.

168
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,825
Rest assured.
I'm a very patient teacher.

169
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:24,765
Okay.
Then, I will pay you fees for the lesson.

170
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,705
Why not make me a VIP card?

171
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:27,769
Apply for a card?

172
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,405
Of course, of course.
Of course you can.

173
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,405
You can even apply for a VVVIP card.

174
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:33,465
All under my bill.

175
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,969
That's the promise then.

176
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,302
Xia Rui.

177
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:38,829
This is the first time you call me Yufei.

178
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:44,665
I want to apologize to you.

179
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,665
Because there were too many
misunderstandings before.

180
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:48,665
And you helped me
delete the posts previously.

181
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,954
I haven't even thanked you for that.

182
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,845
You even promised
to teach me Italian this time.

183
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,585
No big deal.

184
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,045
To be honest,
when I was in high school.

185
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,065
I was envious of you.

186
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,149
And I was very curious about you.

187
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,705
You envied me?

188
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:03,065
No matter when,
you're always so free and at ease.

189
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,345
And there's always a group
of close friends around.

190
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,445
They even called you boss.

191
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,529
Does that feel good?

192
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,585
P-P-Pretty cool.

193
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:15,565
How about you?

194
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:16,925
You've been called the prettiest girl.

195
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,345
Does it feel good too?

196
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,345
I've never had such experience.

197
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,429
Nice to meet you.

198
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:25,225
Xia Rui.
I am also glad to know you.

199
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,925
I happen to be free today.

200
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,269
Why don't we start learning now?

201
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:30,749
Learn Italian?

202
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:32,871
Feels good.

203
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,102
It means, feels good.

204
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,265
Next sentence.

205
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,089
What are you doing?

206
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,345
What are you doing?

207
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,485
Correct.
It means, what are you doing.

208
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,949
Combine it all and read it again.

209
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:44,945
What are they doing?

210
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,525
It doesn't seem as difficult.

211
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:47,529
What about this?

212
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,229
Wow, wow. wow.

213
00:12:58,469 --> 00:12:59,505
It's rising.

214
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:00,669
Getting lots of votes.

215
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:03,725
Such a big gap with the second place.

216
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,285
Nan Xi's first place.

217
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,285
Should be confirmed.

218
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,465
After winter holidays.

219
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,985
we have to get ready
to attend the awards ceremony.

220
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,085
What do you mean us?

221
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,105
Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

222
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:14,065
Okay, okay, okay.

223
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:15,802
Our Nan Xi. Alright?

224
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,969
That's right.

225
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,845
After the New Year is another new year.

226
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,389
Then you're not going back with us today?

227
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,585
Mom showed compassion.

228
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,765
She drove.
To pick us up and drive back.

229
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,889
Nan Xi's with me.

230
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:37,109
I have a surprise.

231
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,129
-I have discussed with Jing.
-Discussed with Sister Jing.

232
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,225
-Celebrate this year's New Year together?
-Celebrate this year's New Year together?

233
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,245
There's a situation.

234
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,585
Sister Jing is so familiar now.

235
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,005
From this copy and paste trace text.

236
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,605
They should be together.

237
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:03,885
Xia Rui.
When do you plan to give us good news?

238
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,885
What good news?

239
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,649
Take care of your own business first.

240
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,445
Happy New Year.

241
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:14,885
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

242
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:16,885
How are you only arriving now?

243
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:17,825
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:20,165
The first pot of dumpling
 will stick if they aren't being cooked.

245
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,265
If it isn't for you who watched TV,
would these dumplings get stuck?

246
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:28,505
If you don't speak
people can still treat you as a mute.

247
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,485
Hurry hurry hurry, go.
Cook the dumplings, hurry.

248
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,645
Chen Hao.

249
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:32,705
All the guests are here.

250
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,849
Don't kid around anymore.

251
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,571
Happy New Year aunt.

252
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,009
Happy New Year Nan Xi.

253
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:42,105
Double-sided face.

254
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:44,685
Hey hey hey. Don't talk nonsense
if you don't understand idioms.

255
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,685
How can you say
that your sister is double-faced?

256
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:47,985
That is...

257
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,865
At most it is a well behaved person
in front of people.

258
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:52,949
Oh... That's hypocrisy.

259
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,243
You brat.

260
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,405
-Mom.
-Welcome, welcome.

261
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,965
Welcome, Nan Xi.

262
00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,225
-Welcome.
-Hi aunt.

263
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:00,605
Your house is so lively.

264
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:01,905
Thank you for your invitation.

265
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:03,685
Why are you so polite?

266
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,445
Our Xia Rui.
Needs to be taken care by Nan Xi.

267
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:07,413
No, no, no.

268
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,885
It's Xia Rui who's helping me
take care of Nan Xi.

269
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:10,805
I know all these.

270
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,785
Hey, hey, hey.
I say, these two beauties.

271
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:14,245
You two should be almost done.

272
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,585
Our children are both sensible.

273
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,683
-Taking care of each other, okay?
-Yes, yes, yes.

274
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:21,478
If there's nothing else, help.
Finish wrapping these dumplings.

275
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:22,559
The kids are already hungry.

276
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:23,863
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Sure, sure, sure.

277
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,977
-I'll go and wash my hands.
-I'll bring you, I'll bring you.

278
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,525
Women's friendship.

279
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,525
Is just so erratic.

280
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,765
Two months ago.

281
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,945
I heard mom was drunk.

282
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,545
She called President Ren and said.

283
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,725
I asked you to go abroad initially.

284
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,385
You insist on not going.

285
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:43,245
And now in the end,
Nan Xi's hooked you on his little finger.

286
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:44,569
And you want to go to Italy.

287
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:47,885
This is really what my mother said?

288
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:48,985
Not only that.

289
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:53,485
She also said, I raised my daughter
and she wasted it for eighteen years.

290
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,345
Suddenly just leaving with others.
How is she willing to?

291
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:00,045
Why do I feel that these words
don't come from mom?

292
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:02,045
It's almost like...

293
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,425
Do you know how to make dumplings?

294
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,565
Never tried.

295
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:05,985
I'll teach you.

296
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,469
You want to teach
with your level of making dumplings?

297
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:09,625
Come, come, come.

298
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:10,542
Prepare.

299
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,069
Happy New Year!

300
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,529
Come, start, start.

301
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:22,885
Nan Xi.

302
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,545
This red packet is from grandpa.

303
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,165
Uncle, you're too generous.

304
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:28,249
-It's okay.
-You're welcome.

305
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:29,309
Hey, grandpa?

306
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,225
Where's mine?

307
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,525
Grandpa, you're biased.

308
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:35,065
Why are you messing around here?

309
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,645
You already exploit so much.

310
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,625
Don't cause trouble.

311
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,525
Grandpa, we haven't finished eating yet.

312
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,445
And also we haven't done
kowtow to you yet.

313
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:42,825
Grandpa is happy today.

314
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,425
Nan Xi, accept the red packet.

315
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,025
I will then feel at ease.

316
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,869
It'll be more delicious when I eat.

317
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,545
Grandpa is pretending to be demented.

318
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:52,905
He's actually recognizing
his grandson-in-law.

319
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:55,065
Don't bust me out.

320
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,025
Okay, okay.
Since grandpa gave it, just take it.

321
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:59,685
-Thanks grandpa.
-Thanks Grandpa. Happy New Year.

322
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,489
We will be a family from now on.

323
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:04,345
Xia Rui.

324
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,429
Aunt also prepared a gift for you.

325
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:08,505
Not anything valuable.

326
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,165
Just a set of handmade coffee pots.

327
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:11,365
I don't know if you'll like it.

328
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,785
I like it.

329
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,069
Of course I'll like it.

330
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,785
Thank you aunt.

331
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,905
You guys are giving things here and there.

332
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:19,765
The dumplings are all cold.
Dishes are all cooked.

333
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,825
Quickly eat.

334
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,245
Come, come, come.

335
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,849
Take more.

336
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:28,009
Chen Hao, here's a bowl of soup.

337
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:45,649
Xia Rui.

338
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,189
Aunt.

339
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,945
I would like to talk to you.

340
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,862
Sure.

341
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,342
Xia Rui.

342
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,309
I really would like to thank you.

343
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,425
Nan Xi came back this time.

344
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,425
Smiling a lot more than before.

345
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,509
It's all your credit.

346
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,665
Don't say that aunt.

347
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,409
I'm also very happy
to be able to meet Nan Xi.

348
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,909
I used to be worried...

349
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:15,429
about the two of you.

350
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:16,529
But now...

351
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,609
I want to hand Nan Xi over to you.

352
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,489
I used to treat Nan Xi...

353
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,149
I never asked Nan Xi
what he needed.

354
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,349
I also wasn't close to him
nor understood him.

355
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:42,569
It's you who made me
know Nan Xi all over again.

356
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,949
Aunt, don't say that.
It's too serious.

357
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,309
I can't be with him forever.

358
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,609
I can't be there by his side
to take care of him all the time.

359
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:57,685
But I can tell,
Nan Xi is sincere towards you.

360
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,029
You're also sincere towards him
and his feelings.

361
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,249
So having you by his side,
I am really relieved.

362
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,345
Aunt, you can really be rest assured.
Nan Xi is by my side.

363
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,669
I won't let anyone bully him.
I will take care of him.

364
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:21,965
Viewers in front of the TV and here live.

365
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,965
Are you all ready?

366
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,345
Ready!

367
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,229
Let's countdown together.

368
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:34,725
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

369
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,289
Five, four, three, two, one.

370
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,189
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

371
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:46,505
Grandpa, Happy New Year.

372
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,422
Good, good, good.

373
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,469
Thank you grandpa.

374
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,605
Grandma, Happy New Year.

375
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,605
You came for a red packet.

376
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,585
-Thanks grandma.
-This kid...

377
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,225
Aunt, Happy New Year.

378
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,425
Happy New Year.
Give aunt a kiss.

379
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:00,685
Such a good boy.

380
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,065
-Here.
-Thank you.

381
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,065
Hurry hurry, come to daddy.

382
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:05,565
Daddy's waiting for you.

383
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:06,705
Happy New Year.

384
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,789
Happy New Year Nan Xi.

385
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,449
I like you.

386
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,049
I like you too.

387
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,229
Let me see.

388
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,405
Why not wear this tomorrow.

389
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,465
Okay.

390
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,225
You must look handsome on stage.

391
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,485
Remember not to be nervous.

392
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,485
I will be supporting you from below stage.

393
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,889
Don't worry.

394
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,769
Then what should I wear?

395
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:32,329
Nice.

396
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,389
Let me have a look at this set.

397
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:43,449
-How about this?
-It looks good like this too.

398
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,905
I've removed your lens filter.

399
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,189
Have a look again.

400
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,549
You'll look good no matter how you dress.

401
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:06,182
Xia Rui.

402
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,062
Look.

403
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,009
You really look good.

404
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,969
Sweet talks.

405
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,389
Look at this.

406
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:23,722
Hold this.

407
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:25,989
Let me see.

408
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:32,709
I'll wear this tomorrow.

409
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,589
There are so many people here.

410
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:17,345
God Nan, if you feel nervous later.

411
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,108
Then just pretend the audience is me.

412
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:20,825
If you see me,
then you won't be nervous anymore.

413
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:21,742
As if it's me.

414
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,249
If you really can't,

415
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:26,005
I'll help you go on stage
to receive the award.

416
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:28,005
Looking at you makes me nervous.

417
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:29,685
Hey, hey. Stop shaking. Stop shaking.

418
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,385
You're shaking so much
it makes me shake too.

419
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,145
It's alright.
We are all below the stage.

420
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,145
It'll be okay if you just look
at the two of us.

421
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:36,785
Take a deep breath with me.

422
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,109
Breathe out.

423
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,349
Breathe in.

424
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:43,889
Breathe out.

425
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:46,649
Breathe in.

426
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:50,565
Hey, Xia Rui. You're talking
as if Nan Xi is giving birth.

427
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:51,909
This won't work, this won't work.

428
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:53,965
Hey, you have to remember.

429
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,509
You have to thank everyone
in the acceptance speech later.

430
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:57,762
Professor Gu.

431
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:58,885
Sponsors.

432
00:23:58,969 --> 00:23:59,885
And the... the...

433
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,825
Alright. I know.

434
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:02,885
Do it again, do it again.

435
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:04,249
Breathe out.

436
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:06,969
Breathe in.

437
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,229
-Breathe out.
-Dear guests, hello.

438
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:11,605
A great thank you,

439
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:14,145
for attending the awards ceremony...

440
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,949
for the Student Creative
Design Competition.

441
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:20,249
Here, on behalf of the organizer,

442
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:23,309
thank you all for coming today.

443
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:37,005
My apologies everyone.

444
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,769
Please wait for a moment.

445
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:46,951
Why, what's wrong?

446
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,549
Professor Gu, what's wrong?

447
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:50,642
Nan Xi.

448
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:54,129
Some designers are suing you
for infringement.

449
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,029
Your entry quota has been canceled.

450
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:00,345
Your ranking and bonus
will also be canceled.

451
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,345
What do you mean, Professor Gu?

452
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,625
What's the reason?

453
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,625
Professor Gu, this is impossible.

454
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:06,965
How could I infringe?

455
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,185
What does it mean?

456
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,485
How can Nan Xi plagiarize?

457
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:10,545
W-W-Who said that?

458
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:11,869
Is there evidence?

459
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:17,425
This... This is impossible.

460
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,165
How can Nan Xi plagiarize, Professor Gu?

461
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,485
You know it. They must be
mistaken. It must be a mistake.

462
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:22,505
It happened suddenly.

463
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,089
Don't you worry much too.

464
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,385
Let's sit down and talk about it
once the awards ceremony is over.

465
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:29,046
We can't wait for the award ceremony
to be over.

466
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:30,645
The first place originally belonged
to Nan Xi.

467
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,105
How can it be awarded to others?

468
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:33,785
Someone is obviously framing him.

469
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,625
Nan Xi shouldn't be bearing the crime.

470
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:37,525
The organizing committee
decided to announce...

471
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,909
that Nan Xi will be quitting
the competition later.

472
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:41,276
Professor Gu.

473
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:43,145
Please leave the backstage.
Do not disturb the order.

474
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:46,025
No, no.
How can you just simply do this?

475
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:46,985
Go back first, Xia Rui.

476
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:48,369
Do you have evidence?

477
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,045
No way.
You took out a magazine just like that.

478
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,842
-No way, really.
-Nan Xi.

479
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:54,629
Go back first.

480
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,469
Things will definitely be clarified.

481
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,485
-What are you guys doing?
-Enough Xia Rui.

482
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,553
-Let's go, they're all staffs.
-I will reason out with them.

483
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,825
Why are you guys pulling me away?

484
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,565
All of them are staff.
How are you going to reason out with them?

485
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:19,649
Okay, okay.

486
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:21,429
That's right.

487
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:22,665
They're all staff.

488
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,289
How can I reason with them?

489
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,789
I should go to the organizer
or Professor Gu.

490
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:29,709
Xia Rui, stop causing trouble.

491
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,269
Okay. I'll go talk to him.

492
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,265
Nan Xi... Nan Xi.
It's all a misunderstanding.

493
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:45,485
I will make them investigate clearly
and clear your name.

494
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:46,417
And this first place.

495
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:48,785
This kind of award that's both real
and sham, we don't want it!

496
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:49,709
Let's not want it.

497
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,289
But Nan Xi can only do the exchange
abroad if he gets the first place.

498
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,445
But relying on Nan Xi's own capabilities,
there's no problem going abroad.

499
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,125
So we will not part
of this broken competition!

500
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,085
We will not take part.

501
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,865
But plagiarism is not a small crime.

502
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,505
Once this matter is proven,

503
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,965
it may not only affect Nan Xi's studies
but also his future career.

504
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,885
Nan Xi did not plagiarize!

505
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,242
Cheng Erluo. Don't be impulsive.

506
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:17,369
Of course we know
that Nan Xi did not plagiarize.

507
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,725
But the key is how are we going
to prove it...

508
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,725
that this table
is Nan Xi's original craft work.

509
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,725
To make the school
and the people outside believe.

510
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,309
Make the people outside believe...

511
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:29,882
Design diagram.

512
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,709
Why?
What are you looking for, Nan Xi?

513
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,522
Come, come.

514
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:47,465
I knew everyone will be here.
Is there any help needed?

515
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,449
Design diagram.

516
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,365
Design diagram of the water flowing table.

517
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,989
Let's find it together.

518
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:07,749
How is it?

519
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,949
The design diagram is missing.

520
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,145
Missing?

521
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:14,825
What to do then?

522
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,507
Hurry, have a look guys!

523
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,225
Nan Xi is on the campus forum again.

524
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:22,149
Someone broke the news.
Nan Xi's award is canceled due to...

525
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,545
Plagiarism.

526
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:25,285
This.. You won't believe this, will you?

527
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,285
I'm Hao Tian. Not stupid.

528
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:29,845
I watched Nan Xi
make the water flowing table.

529
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:31,405
It's pointless saying this.

530
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:33,325
Face the truth.
We have to grab the time we have.

531
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,633
Once the matter of plagiarism
is deeply rooted in others' minds.

532
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:39,225
Even if we show evidence in the future,
no one will believe it.

533
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,365
There's only one person
who can help us now.

534
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:43,282
Who?

535
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:48,542
Professor Gu.

536
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,265
Professor Gu. Look, the design
diagram was being stolen at this time.

537
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:53,905
There must be something fishy.

538
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:55,489
You have to trust Nan Xi.

539
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:58,449
Of course I believe you.

540
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,229
For the past few years,
I've seen Nan Xi's growth.

541
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,589
But this doesn't matter.

542
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:06,065
The main thing is evidence.

543
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:07,765
Evidence.

544
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:10,325
What if I find the design diagram?

545
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:11,325
Or.

546
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,485
Or if Nan Xi redraws another one?

547
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:16,349
They will definitely think of
the ideas you thought of too.

548
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:20,245
Even if Nan Xi brings out a copy
of genuine design diagram.

549
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,445
It can't prove that Nan Xi
did not plagiarize too.

550
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,945
Because this design diagram
could be from years ago.

551
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,825
Or it could be done yesterday.

552
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,989
So they will definitely insist
that you plagiarized.

553
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,909
What's the origin of this magazine?

554
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,985
How can they design a table
that is exactly the same?

555
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:40,902
This.

556
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,385
This "Ge Wu" magazine.
has always had a column.

557
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:45,469
Soliciting design works from readers.

558
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,385
The person who made
this water flowing table...

559
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,805
should be a private independent designer.

560
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:52,465
If we were to find him
and ask him directly?

561
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,809
But the contributor
did not identify himself.

562
00:29:57,349 --> 00:30:00,145
This means no matter what method is used.
There will be no way to find out.

563
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,229
Who is doing all these little tricks
behind our backs?

564
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,382
Actually,

565
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,765
it doesn't matter who it is.

566
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:06,682
Look.

567
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,689
This magazine was published a week ago.

568
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:12,965
Plus the time to print.

569
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,605
If we can prove that,

570
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:19,725
Nan Xi's idea of the water flowing table
was from two months ago.

571
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:22,449
Then it can help Nan Xi clear him name.

572
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,665
How do we prove this?

573
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:29,205
Didn't you say that the time
of the drawing cannot be verified?

574
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:32,389
Yes. It is really hard to verify.

575
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:36,205
But fortunately,
plagiarism cannot be verified either.

576
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,945
Besides, it's the work of arts.

577
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:38,965
Learning from each other.

578
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:39,882
Cross references.

579
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,069
It's inevitable
that there are similar imaginations.

580
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:44,785
Professor Gu.
What do you mean by what you just said?

581
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:47,845
Does it mean that Nan Xi
has to draw as per other's work?

582
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,905
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

583
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:51,029
What I mean is.

584
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:54,129
I will face the school with this problem.

585
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,129
Keep the matter low first.

586
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,045
Not letting the institution get involved.

587
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:00,305
Once the department conducts
an investigation,

588
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:03,225
and if the results of plagiarism
are found to be true,

589
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:06,425
Nan Xi will be expelled and also sued.

590
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:07,469
Expelled?

591
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,389
And even sued?

592
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:15,149
Let them investigate.

593
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:23,845
What do you mean by
"not afraid of being sued", Nan Xi?

594
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,745
We have no evidence
to our advantage in hand right now.

595
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:30,265
If the school doesn't believe in us,
either being expelled or sued,

596
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,049
it's the end of your future.

597
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:34,809
I don't mind.

598
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:36,945
I did not plagiarize.

599
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,749
Of course we know.

600
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,241
Then tell me.

601
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:44,605
Your willingness to be investigated
is to prove your innocence.

602
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:46,689
Or is it because
you still want to go abroad with me?

603
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:53,545
If it is because
you want to go abroad with me,

604
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:54,945
then there is no need at all.

605
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,012
I never thought that I must go
to Italy right from the start.

606
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,272
Aren't we still together
if we're in China?

607
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:02,429
You don't want to go to Italy?

608
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:04,009
Then tell me.

609
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:06,229
These, what are these?

610
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,936
It's not like you don't know.

611
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,162
I like to buy a bunch
of books every time I study.

612
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:14,167
Xia Rui.

613
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:17,145
You can't fool me.

614
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,305
I know how important it is for you
to go to Italy.

615
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:22,249
So.
I do not want to break our promise.

616
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,062
Even so, we can't just let them
simply investigate us.

617
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,521
We can do what Professor Gu said.

618
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,964
Wait for this matter to pass.
Then apply to study in Italy ourselves.

619
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,325
I know.
If this matter doesn't subside.

620
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:36,425
It's hard for the school there
to accept our application.

621
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:37,815
But if time...
