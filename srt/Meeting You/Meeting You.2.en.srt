1
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,890
What a bore!

2
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,490
Why is it always him?

3
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,140
He's a trouble maker for me

4
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,165
He came out of nowhere

5
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,090
I'm really pissed off

6
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,765
Rock Paper Scissors

7
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:56,465
Rock Paper Scissors

8
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,715
Rock Paper Scissors

9
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:00,340
Rock Paper Scissors

10
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,065
Rock Paper Scissors

11
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,340
All right, all right, I lost

12
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,665
This is my gift to you

13
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:05,940
Did you like it or not?

14
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,015
I like it

15
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,390
Okay, okay, I'll take you to something delicious

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,915
It's the baby whale singing

17
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,615
I heard it

18
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:23,190
Did you hear that? That's nice

19
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,340
Rui, are you okay?

20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,265
Xia Rui, I'm sorry

21
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:39,015
I was supposed to

22
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,615
clean the pool with you after school

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,540
But the drama club suddenly changed the rehearsal time

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,865
I can't take time off

25
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,215
I'm preparing for the basketball game

26
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,390
Rui, you know that

27
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,240
When I went to the natatorium after this practice,

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,540
there was nobody there at all

29
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,340
It's still wet by the side of the pool

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,290
I wonder if something has happened

31
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,690
I found that

32
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,740
our friendship between us

33
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,790
is fritters that come out of the pot in the morning

34
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,465
It smells good

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,815
but breaks with a crunch

36
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:10,640
You two are not better

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,565
than the transfer student

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,740
Did Nan Xi help you?

39
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:17,190
Something happened?

40
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:18,190
Rui,

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,940
are you interested in him?

42
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,440
In this morning,

43
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:23,665
the best girl in Chenghua School

44
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:25,165
are hugging

45
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,340
You shut up just because your mouth was pinched off by him

46
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,940
So it's said that between two people,

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,315
one must conquest

48
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:38,965
and the other must be conquered

49
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:44,615
Are you the fan of Na Ying

50
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,390
From tomorrow on,

51
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,115
I won't speak with him

52
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:58,490
otherwise I spell my name backwards

53
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,790
Oh my God

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,990
The guy is keeps showing up in my mind

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,940
How can Du Fu be blasphemed?

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,415
They grabbed my Little Whale

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,265
so I fought with them

58
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,390
Does it hurt?

59
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:44,015
A bit

60
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:44,615
By the way,

61
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,915
did you ever get stitched?

62
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:47,115
I got five stitches today

63
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,490
and the doctor said I might leave a scar

64
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:50,815
A scar?

65
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,040
Is there a scar

66
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:54,115
on Xia Rui's forehead?

67
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,915
What should I do?

68
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,665
Of course, someone has to do cleaning

69
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,090
Who's the student on duty?

70
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:40,565
It's a simple question

71
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:41,815
and teacher has explained it

72
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,690
I can't believe that you can't work out this problem

73
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,815
Nan Xi

74
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:00,765
Morning

75
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:03,640
I've washed, dried and ironed

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,865
your clothes

77
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:05,815
Here you are

78
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:06,840
Thanks.

79
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,190
You're welcome

80
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,365
Why are you so polite today?

81
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,415
Xia Rui

82
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,590
Could I...

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,890
Could I have a look at your...

84
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:33,840
Rui

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,740
You're being mind-absent early in morning

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,740
Rui

87
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:52,840
Nan Xi,

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,865
Xia Rui

89
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:54,940
has a cold hand and

90
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,215
a warm heart

91
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:56,865
So

92
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,290
if her words offended you,

93
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,565
don't take it to heart

94
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:01,040
We're just less than 5 meters apart

95
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,115
So if you say mean things about me,

96
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:03,665
please respect my ears,

97
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,265
Cheng Erluo

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,040
Oh, come on. Give me a break

99
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,215
Dear Shu, I wanna go to the toilet

100
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,365
Go ahead

101
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,265
I got your back

102
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,040
Something goes wrong

103
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,915
with them

104
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,465
Have no idea

105
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,115
Xia Rui

106
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,615
Nan Xi

107
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,065
Oh, come on, for god's sake

108
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:50,340
Sorry

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,590
Sorry to scare you

110
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,965
It's alright

111
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:54,365
It's ladies' room

112
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:54,740
and the men's room is...

113
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,615
I'm coming for you

114
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,840
For what?

115
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,815
Could I...

116
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,190
No way

117
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,015
Could I have a look at... Save it

118
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,115
Your forehead

119
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,065
Could I have a look at your forehead?

120
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:07,515
No repeating. I can hear it

121
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:08,740
Don't follow me. Thanks

122
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,540
Hell with the member of Mensa

123
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,340
He must use money for it

124
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,765
So weird of him

125
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,415
Stand up!

126
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:20,265
Hello, Sir

127
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:22,315
Hello, everyone

128
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,590
Sit down please

129
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,465
I have one thing to declare

130
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,190
Nan Xi will be the English subject representative

131
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,765
of our class in this semester

132
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,690
Sir, what about Lin Xiaoxiao?

133
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:38,490
He's

134
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,390
a phony

135
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,365
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,415
You'll face much more study pressure in Grade Eleven

137
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,140
So the jobs can be assigned to others

138
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,240
to lessen your pressure

139
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
OK

140
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:48,040
Nan Xi

141
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,640
Come up and hand out these exam papers

142
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,365
Nan Xi

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,790
Your mother has told me the reason

144
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,265
why you dropped out from the Experiment High School 1

145
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,790
Well,

146
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:01,940
the English subject representative thing...

147
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,490
It'll be a trouble for me

148
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,015
I can't handle it

149
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:09,040
How about I giving you an assistant?

150
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,740
Nan Xi

151
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,415
You're so good at English

152
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,665
It's a pity if

153
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:15,140
you are not the English subject representative

154
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:16,340
Furthermore,

155
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,565
it's a good chance for you

156
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:19,240
get to know other classmates

157
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,140
Try it again

158
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,315
If you feel unhappy,

159
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:24,240
you can come to me at any time

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,390
Then you can quit it

161
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:29,590
I can take it

162
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,040
but

163
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:34,865
I have one condition

164
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,740
Han Tianyang

165
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,740
Wu Hanming

166
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,390
Zhao Yishu

167
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,815
Zhao Na

168
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,740
The process goes so slow, Sir

169
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:03,890
Wu Hanming,

170
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,065
you're unsatisfied with this

171
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,890
OK, how about

172
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,590
speaking out your score out loud?

173
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:12,840
Shut up

174
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,915
Zhang Tianyu

175
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:18,715
Wen Ke

176
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:22,490
Cheng Erluo

177
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:29,765
Xia Rui

178
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:40,540
Xia Rui

179
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:41,690
Wait

180
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,315
Come here

181
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,315
Stand here for a while

182
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:46,090
Quickly

183
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,390
We got a new rule in a new term

184
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,815
I announced that

185
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,715
Nan Xi is the English subject representative of our class just now

186
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,490
Well, now listen

187
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:00,890
Xia Rui

188
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,690
Xia Rui will be the vice English subject representative of our class

189
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,465
Vice English subject representative?

190
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,815
Be quiet

191
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,715
I hope Nan Xi and Xia Rui

192
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
can work together with tacit agreement

193
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,265
Come on. Give them a big hand

194
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,490
You two can go back to your seats

195
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,290
Mr. Hu, it's out of the blue

196
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,040
Why didn't you notice me in advance?

197
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:28,890
Xia Rui

198
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,465
Last semester,

199
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,540
you criticized the school

200
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,515
for leaving posts of class cadre

201
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:36,340
reserved for those with good grades

202
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,865
and blowing

203
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,840
the confidence of those with bad grades

204
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,915
Now I appoint you the English subject representative

205
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:42,490
Why are you...

206
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,840
Why are you still unsatisfied?

207
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,790
Come on, give me a break

208
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:48,915
Xia Rui will be responsible for

209
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,815
collecting and distributing English assignments

210
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,940
Thanks for your cooperation

211
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,515
Xia Rui

212
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,290
I also hope that you can set a good example for them,

213
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,615
taking the lead to finish English works on time

214
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,690
Alright, alright, go back

215
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,190
I just embarrassed myself

216
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,465
Come on, no more time to be wasted

217
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,165
Take your exam paper

218
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:07,090
Let's go over it

219
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,215
Where is this handsome boy from?

220
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,465
Oh my god,

221
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,515
is he walking towards me?

222
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:12,315
Look. His hands

223
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:14,490
are so fine and slim

224
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,140
Coming towards me!

225
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,090
Oh gosh. My heart speeds up

226
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,865
He tossed my fringe up

227
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,265
My fringe?

228
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:37,715
Xia Rui

229
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:38,465
Shut up

230
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,065
No way

231
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:42,765
Don't follow me

232
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:50,540
Little Bells

233
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:53,790
I finally found you

234
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,065
Rui

235
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:00,790
You and Nan Xi

236
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,140
may be doomed to

237
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,340
be against each other

238
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:04,765
Feudalistic superstition is not OK

239
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,190
Oh my god,

240
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:11,090
he's really horrible

241
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:12,865
In so many years,

242
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,915
you've never been afraid of anyone in my eyes

243
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,115
Switch a topic

244
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,390
Let's celebrate

245
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,515
Xia Rui's promotion

246
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,990
It must be a scheme

247
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,640
If he pawed at me again,

248
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I will take her apart

249
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,390
Do you smell a rat?

250
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:37,940
What?

251
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:41,240
Before, in our school,

252
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,365
Rui never cared about anyone else, except us

253
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,240
Now, once that transfer student came here,

254
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,315
Rui frequently mentions him

255
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:49,290
I've long found that,

256
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,115
but I just don't want to break it

257
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,565
If others pissed her off,

258
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,115
Rui would have beat him violently

259
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:54,965
Why is

260
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,665
he on her mind all the time?

261
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,415
Don't break it?

262
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:04,515
You don't have that IQ

263
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:06,290
Look

264
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,765
A curve wrecker transferred to our class,

265
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:08,990
so she looks

266
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,365
down on our IQ

267
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,140
Never mind, Luoluo

268
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,940
Rui looks down on you

269
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,615
I think highly of you

270
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,565
Don't be frustrated

271
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:15,065
Dear Shu, so nice of you

272
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,665
You're beautiful and soft

273
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:18,990
That's enough

274
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,090
You're

275
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,490
being so gross

276
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,440
Is that transfer student called Nan Xi?

277
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:25,865
Mr. Yi

278
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:27,215
You keep being in this small shop,

279
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,440
but you know everything

280
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:29,815
Come on

281
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:30,740
Look around

282
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,890
Is it a small shop?

283
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,965
He's right. It's a small shop

284
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,115
I never thought that the owner of the shop looks cool,

285
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,165
but the coffee shop

286
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:38,965
is an information center

287
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,590
I just got some fragmented information

288
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,840
I won't go with you today

289
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,115
cuz Madam Shao called me to be home for dinner suddenly

290
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,390
So suddenly?

291
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,515
Sounds ominous

292
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,515
I'll break with you if you continue to sing a duet

293
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:52,665
Alright. I gotta go

294
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,315
I gotta go home for dinner

295
00:15:53,315 --> 00:15:54,165
Bye

296
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,290
Bye

297
00:15:59,290 --> 00:15:59,890
Bye

298
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,390
See you, Mr. Yi

299
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,765
Bye

300
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,315
Rui

301
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,065
We still have some time before the coffee shop is closed

302
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:08,515
I'd like to teach you how to make coffee

303
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:09,565
OK

304
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,865
What's the difference between solarization and washing?

305
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,890
They're different way of dealing with

306
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,315
those fruits

307
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:27,790
Simply speaking,

308
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,090
as for solarization, fruits should be flattened

309
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,765
and then they will under the sun for 2 to 3 weeks

310
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,940
While washing is much more complex

311
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,515
Peels of fruits can be removed through fermentation

312
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,015
After that, continuous water rubbing will

313
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,665
remove the impurities inside

314
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,040
That's to say,

315
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,665
more impurities will retained after solarization

316
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:47,315
But the flavor will be richer

317
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,415
Coffee by washing

318
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,340
will much more mellow

319
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,690
Yes,

320
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,740
fair enough

321
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,565
You're good

322
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,040
Well, are you planning to take me as your student?

323
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,315
Kneel down

324
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:03,840
Kneel down

325
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,365
Come on

326
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:08,340
I indeed have many questions

327
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:09,540
Well

328
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,190
This is my QQ number

329
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,590
Welcome!

330
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,040
You're really everywhere

331
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,215
You know each other?

332
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,540
He's my classmate

333
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,290
You're Nan Xi?

334
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,040
Ouch!

335
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,540
Awesome

336
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,615
I thought maybe you're too old

337
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:31,690
to know everything

338
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,615
Come on

339
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,465
Madam Shao

340
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:42,890
Hello

341
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,465
OK

342
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,215
Hope to see you tomorrow

343
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:50,665
I don't think so

344
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:55,090
I'm off now

345
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,840
Wanna have something to drink?

346
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,515
He's indeed kinda weird

347
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:49,815
Nan Xi

348
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:52,365
You must be here for a while

349
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,890
Aunt Lin has to work overtime

350
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,890
Let's go find her

351
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,840
in the vicinity of his company

352
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,165
Let's go

353
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,890
Bastard

354
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:08,940
What are you doing?

355
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
We haven't seen each other for a month

356
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,190
I missed you

357
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,040
Me too

358
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:14,415
Come down

359
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:15,815
Come on

360
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,665
Today,

361
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:19,965
I'm just home for a meal and then I'll go

362
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,890
Are you ready for the upcoming storms?

363
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,040
What?

364
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,315
Whatever?

365
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:26,890
Go

366
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,340
There will be not only storms and shower,

367
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,440
but also lightening and thundering

368
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:32,765
And after that,

369
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:34,065
no rainbow

370
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,015
but lightening

371
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,015
What's going on?

372
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,590
Wait and see

373
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,640
Ruirui is home

374
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:42,565
Come here and have a seat

375
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:43,740
Hello, Mr. Hu

376
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,565
Come here

377
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,090
After one-day work at school,

378
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,590
Mr. Hu visit our home. He really works hard

379
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,740
I'm flattered

380
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,290
Home visit is my duty

381
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,040
But this time, my arrival is kinda surprising

382
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,540
Maybe disturb you

383
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,840
Don't mention that

384
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,590
By the way,

385
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,090
Mr. Hu said he

386
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,665
let Ruirui be the

387
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,765
vice English subject representative in the class

388
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,840
to encourage Ruirui

389
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,440
Vice representative?

390
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,765
Wow, for the first time Ruirui becomes a class cadre

391
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,890
Xia Rui is easygoing and she can

392
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,890
easily be friends with classmates

393
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,190
It's her advantage

394
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,140
So,

395
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,115
the post

396
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,290
suits her best

397
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,265
She is a smart girl

398
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:20,565
Yes, smart girl

399
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:21,690
But she's also naughty

400
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,965
Haohao, time for dinner

401
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:24,890
Stop drinking beverage

402
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,590
Yeah

403
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,765
Listen to Uncle Chen

404
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:29,115
Come on, stop drinking that

405
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,940
Nan Xi likes to chat with Aunt Lin

406
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,515
You're being so polite

407
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,465
Nan Xi is a smart and cute boy

408
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:38,965
I benefit a lot

409
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,065
every time I chat with him

410
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,040
Nan Xi

411
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,115
Wait for me for a while in the car

412
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:49,090
Mom has something to speak with Aunt Lin

413
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,940
See you, Aunt Lin

414
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:03,690
To be frank,

415
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,940
how do you think of him?

416
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:07,090
He's in a good moon

417
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,890
But it seems that

418
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:10,915
he has something in his mind

419
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,840
You'd better call his head teacher

420
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,590
and ask him whether

421
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,465
he came across something

422
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:16,640
or someone

423
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:18,940
But I'm sure about one thing

424
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:21,015
That is going to study at Chenghua School

425
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,915
is acceptable for him

426
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:25,490
Thanks for your efforts

427
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,890
over the past half one month

428
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:28,665
I'm a psychiatrist

429
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:29,640
but

430
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,290
Nan Xi isn't a mental patient

431
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,465
It's good to see that

432
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,465
Nan Xi is willing to chat with me

433
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,640
But what I can do is limited

434
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,240
The root cause of Socialphobia Nan Xi said

435
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,090
lies in your

436
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,940
lack of company at his childhood

437
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,240
and your over protection when he grows up

438
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:49,640
Speaking of the incident of this time happening in No.1 Experimental High School,

439
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,790
it was

440
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,790
just a little conflict between kids

441
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,040
Nan Xi didn't have to drop out

442
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,940
But it's also a good choice

443
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,865
to study at Chenghua School

444
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,790
Nan Xi just likes

445
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,740
staying in his

446
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,440
own cozy zone

447
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
He wanna break it,

448
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,440
but he doesn't know how to do it

449
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,265
So let's give him more time

450
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,465
Thanks for your patient help

451
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,715
Otherwise,

452
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:14,465
I really don't know how to

453
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:16,040
go through this tough time

454
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,190
Bastard

455
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,340
Help

456
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:20,890
Stand up

457
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,515
Shut up

458
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,765
Why didn't you notice me in advance since you

459
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:25,090
knew that my teacher came to have a home visit?

460
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,140
You're my biological younger brother

461
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,340
Come on, you're so ungrateful

462
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,415
There is no such thing as a free lunch

463
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,515
Lunch! Lunch!

464
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,740
Sis,

465
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,215
it's 5:30 p.m.

466
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:37,340
Dinner time

467
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,990
Alright, stand up first

468
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,865
Women are tigers

469
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,340
We have two tigers in our family

470
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:45,340
I'm living a really hard life

471
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,715
I'm teaching you how to be

472
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,340
a responsible adult

473
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,315
A hard life? Bullshit

474
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:50,265
Alright

475
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,940
I have a new intelligence

476
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,440
You let me go and it's free for you

477
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Tell me about it!

478
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:58,365
Madam Shao is planning to send you to study abroad

479
00:22:58,365 --> 00:22:59,765
Mr. Chen also agree with that idea

480
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:00,740
They both think

481
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,765
you can't be admitted to a domestic university

482
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:05,140
with your poor grades

483
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,265
I agree it

484
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:07,390
What?

485
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,840
If I lie to you, I'm a puppy

486
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,465
And no girl will like me

487
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:15,740
Mr. Hu is really

488
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,565
a good teacher

489
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:19,490
He's really dedicated to

490
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,015
imparting knowledge and cultivating students

491
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,840
Don't be so naive

492
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:24,265
You just saw him for the first time,

493
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:26,415
but you labelled him a good person

494
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:27,165
Do you know what

495
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,315
I went through at school?

496
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:31,090
Don't be silly

497
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,215
By the way,

498
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:33,690
I've asked Mr. Hu

499
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,190
to inquire about the English tutorial class thing

500
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,115
If he can find a reliable one,

501
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,540
I'll sign you up

502
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,390
You're really

503
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,165
bad at English

504
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,340
You didn't discuss it with me

505
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,565
and then you just decided it personally?

506
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:45,365
No need to discuss

507
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:46,865
Pass me one tissue

508
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:48,815
You're an English subject representative now

509
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:50,140
with such poor English grades

510
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,265
Shame on you

511
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,165
Well, how about my studying abroad thing?

512
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,340
I still don't need to know that?

513
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,165
You often at the bottom of the class

514
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,390
If you don't go abroad,

515
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,190
can you pass the College Entrance Examination?

516
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,340
How can I explain it to your father?

517
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:06,340
Going abroad

518
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,440
is your

519
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,665
only way out

520
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,340
Madam Shao

521
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:16,440
In your eyes, I like to live with my grand parents

522
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,140
because their house is near to my school

523
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:19,065
You're wrong

524
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,890
I just wanna escape from your bossing and pushing

525
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,915
I'm full. I can go home by taxi

526
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,215
Bye bye

527
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,515
Don't run after her

528
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:37,065
X

529
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:41,465
YZ should be short for Yi Ze

530
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:46,115
What does XYZ mean?

531
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,465
Pass

532
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:03,665
Mr. Yi

533
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:05,190
Can you recommend any

534
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,190
books related to coffee to me?

535
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,465
Those with few words

536
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,090
My Coffee Life Proposal

537
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,590
Got ya

538
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,590
You're not familiar with

539
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,265
the boy named Nan Xi, are you?

540
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,915
He told me that you've known each other for a long time

541
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,565
So many people mentioned him today

542
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,415
He came out of nowhere

543
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,040
What?

544
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,890
What the hell?

545
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,865
Oh, come on

546
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,715
Why do people often mention him?

547
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,315
Nothing special

548
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,565
I think he's a nice boy

549
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:07,640
Maybe you can

550
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,390
be best friends

551
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:13,740
Not really

552
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,215
Tell Madam Shao

553
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:39,140
No way

554
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,190
I won't attend a tutorial class

555
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,490
I definitely won't go abroad

556
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,865
According Madam Shao,

557
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:45,865
you are bad at grades

558
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,290
and you violate your mother's arrangement

559
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,990
Who do you think you are?

560
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,940
Tell Madam Shao

561
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,190
If she calls me to

562
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,065
fight with me,

563
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:53,990
well, I'm gonna hang up

564
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,415
According Madam Shao,

565
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,215
I'll leave you alone

566
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,115
Just show me something

567
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:03,065
If you can't deal with your study,

568
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:05,065
you're not qualified to make a deal with me

569
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,215
Tell Madam Shao,

570
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:08,915
don't look down on me

571
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:10,165
I'll be amazing

572
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:11,515
if I study hard

573
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,340
Stop bragging

574
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,640
Just show me something

575
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,615
Well,

576
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,640
can you pass the English exam in the following monthly examination?

577
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,790
Oh come on, 90

578
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,890
is just a piece of cake

579
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,390
Alright, if you can pass your English exam,

580
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,290
you're the boss on the after-school class thing

581
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,015
Deal

582
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:39,840
Within 2 weeks?

583
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,090
Why did I make that deal with her?

584
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,440
I was out of my mind

585
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,790
Dear Shu, is she a person or a ghost?

586
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:04,215
It's so surprising

587
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,165
She's being so strange

588
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,590
Rui

589
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:14,865
Rui

590
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:15,915
Play it cool

591
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:17,490
You're not deserved to follow me

592
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,465
Shame on you

593
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,415
Rui

594
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:21,965
You're 40 minutes earlier than before

595
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,015
Are you feeling OK now?

596
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,490
We're so worried about you

597
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,440
From today on,

598
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,665
I'm gonna study English hard

599
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:29,540
What?

600
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,390
Tell me about it

601
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,190
Did your mom say something to you?

602
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you know who is waiting for me at their home?

603
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,340
Mr. Hu

604
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,115
It's said that they're assigned Home Visit job

605
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:40,165
Maybe few days later,

606
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,340
it's your turn

607
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,815
I'm OK

608
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:44,940
cuz my father...

609
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,915
my father is on his business trip

610
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,065
Maybe your father has got

611
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:49,165
a phone call from Mr. Hu

612
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:51,490
So Home Visit can also go through phone calls

613
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:54,140
Then I gotta switch off my phone

614
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,265
And then?

615
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:56,040
And then?

616
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,765
He introduced a tutor

617
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,590
to Madam Shao

618
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,965
I can't accept that

619
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:01,415
And I accidentally

620
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,090
talked big

621
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,515
How big?

622
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:06,290
I have to get 90 in the monthly exam,

623
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,965
or I have to attend after-school class

624
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,865
Oh come on

625
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,640
Since you became the vice subject representative,

626
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,915
you're really confident

627
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:13,915
Don't be sarcastic

628
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:15,015
You're the vice subject representative

629
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:17,165
If I remember it correctly,

630
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:20,590
you got 61 in last exam

631
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,215
75. I got 75

632
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:23,490
I made some progress

633
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,290
It was half as difficult

634
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,290
as it was before

635
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:30,065
So say something auspicious

636
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm gonna study

637
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,240
Be quiet

638
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,965
Nan Xi

639
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,215
I've known that you spoke for me to lessen my punishment

640
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,965
in front of Mr. Hu

641
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:45,690
Though you got me involved in,

642
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,965
business is business

643
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:47,690
Thanks.

644
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,940
She said she wouldn't

645
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,215
be friendly to Nan Xi yesterday

646
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:53,440
But she is expressing thanks to him today

647
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:55,815
The plot twists and turns all of sudden

648
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:14,540
Here you are

649
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:52,215
We should eat more

650
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:54,165
I'm so hungry

651
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,565
Sorry

652
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:16,965
We planned to avoid the peak time

653
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:18,515
and have lunch at later time

654
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:19,515
Oh no,

655
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:21,240
your clothes are ruined

656
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,140
It's alright

657
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,740
It doesn't matter

658
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,840
Come on, your clothes are ruined like this

659
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,015
Don't move

660
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,840
Wait for me for a moment

661
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,115
Wow, awesome

662
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,515
Take it and put it on

663
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:58,015
Come on, put it on

664
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,715
I'll walk you to the washroom

665
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:00,440
Go

666
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,515
Come on, come on

667
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,940
There is a breaking news

668
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:15,115
Rui, come on, wake up

669
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:16,890
Wake up!

670
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:18,190
Come on!

671
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,240
Guess what did I see just now

672
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,615
Give me a break! Go ahead

673
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:24,040
I saw Nan Xi's flirting

674
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:27,165
with Yang Yufei

675
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,340
Yang Yufei is the top student of Chenghua School

676
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,640
She has a high taste

677
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,815
Nan Xi is like a wood

678
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:33,665
with few words

679
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,090
How could he flirt with the girl from other class?

680
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:36,290
No way

681
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,415
I saw it

682
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,640
There were some sparks of love between them

683
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,640
I was so touched that I even wanted to have puppy love

684
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,665
Dear Shu

685
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:06,015
Here you are

686
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:06,915
Take it and put it on

687
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,915
Surprise!

688
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,565
I am a good actor!

689
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:16,165
He flirted with a girl with a piece of clothing

690
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:16,990
I never imagined that

691
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,515
he was a pick-up artist

692
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,365
A piece of clothing?

693
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,515
It seems that he ever flirted with others

694
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,340
It's Rui

695
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,940
Eat your braised pork

696
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,790
Dear Shu,

697
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,665
will you be moved

698
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,865
for that?

699
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,665
The braised pork tastes so good,

700
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:39,290
but you don't have to keep eating them

701
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,190
Xia Rui

702
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,590
Read this short passage

703
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,140
What's going on?

704
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,865
Xia Rui

705
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,915
What are you doing?

706
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,790
Read this short passage

707
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,165
Quickly

708
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,440
Well famous foreign a...

709
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,165
A...

710
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:21,390
Come on

711
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:22,640
Architects

712
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:23,915
Architects

713
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,215
Xia Rui

714
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,840
You have a vocabulary equal to

715
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,290
that of a junior high student

716
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,740
You don't worried about that?

717
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,865
After school,

718
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:32,190
you gotta put down your cell phone

719
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,990
and read more English words

720
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,215
Read more and recite more

721
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:40,640
That's all for today

722
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,815
See you, sir

723
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,065
Oh my god, the class is finally over

724
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,790
Listen

725
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,565
I must have reading disorder

726
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,115
If there are

727
00:34:59,115 --> 00:35:00,665
too many words of them,

728
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,515
they will come together in my eyes

729
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:03,815
Do you know what I mean?

730
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,090
You're just deceiving yourself

731
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,665
and finding yourself strange excuses

732
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:10,065
You're not with presbyopia

733
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,565
How can these words come together?

734
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:13,390
Fair enough. Rui,

735
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,590
each time we go out for meals,

736
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,065
you can always read through the menu rapidly

737
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:17,190
In a flash,

738
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,865
dishes are served for us

739
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:21,015
You got the point this time, Luoluo

740
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
What?

741
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:23,390
Think it over

742
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,565
In the menu,

743
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,490
they are line by line

744
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,515
They are short

745
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:28,340
and clear

746
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,690
So I can read it quickly

747
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:31,890
Also, there are some pictures

748
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,165
Look at this

749
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,890
It's so long

750
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,865
It's not pleased to my eyes

751
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,590
I was convinced by her

752
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:40,290
I know you're saying bullshit,

753
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,065
but I can't retort you

754
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:43,315
That's it

755
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:33,240
Little Bells

756
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,490
You can't remember me, can you?
