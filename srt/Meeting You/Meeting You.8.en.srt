1
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,260
Next, I have two more things to announce

2
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,340
First,

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,130
the rumors about Nan Xi have already been stopped

4
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,540
These rumors came to an end. I hope everyone will stop discussing it

5
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,460
If you have anything else in the future, you can come to me at any time

6
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,420
Mr. Hu, my Mr. Hu! I support you!

7
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,730
Mr. Hu has a beautiful appearance with a good heart, and a human face with a bestial heart

8
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,430
Who just said I had a bestial heart?

9
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,020
You don't respect me

10
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,490
The second thing

11
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,390
Have you all filled the registration form for the sports meeting?

12
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,220
Look at you, look at you. When I sent the form, you were all incredibly excited

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,240
When it came time to fill them out, where did you all go?

14
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,770
All you know how to do all day is gossiping

15
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,630
Do you want to be paparazzi in the future?

16
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,840
Hurry up! The deadline is the end of school today

17
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,560
If you don't fill it in, you'll have no chance

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,910
Nan Xi

19
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,350
what event do you plan on applying for for this sports meeting?

20
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,930
I...

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,010
I lost it

22
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,870
Throwing what? Shot put?
("Lost" also means "throw")

23
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,630
Javelin?

24
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,760
What? You lost the registration form?

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,170
Yes

26
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,120
Then doesn't that mean you can't participate in anything?

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,930
It's very strict this year

28
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,840
They even put the student IDs on each registration forms, so everyone only gets one!

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,530
It's so they will have more people returning forms than distributing them

30
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,470
They glorify it by saying it's more convenient this way to help teachers count heads

31
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,930
but the truth is that this is all work done by students

32
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,140
I really don't understand. Isn't it better to count people by event?

33
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,080
The root of the problem is those idiots in Class 8. They can't even fill a basic form without getting confused!

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,320
Last year, they re-applied too many times for multiple sports. Tell me, do they have brain issues?

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,040
If you want my opinion, I think you should be my adviser

36
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,340
I'll follow everything you say. Our two swords connected will be invincible

37
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,660
Xia Rui

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,700
Forget her. Rui applies to the same two events every year, shotput and sprint

39
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,800
Can you shut up? Why do you have even more lines than I do? Why are you saying so much? If you get to say everything, what do I get to say?

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,130
Exactly. Just shut up, Cheng Erkang

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,640
Dear Shu, you can give me nicknames, but they can't be this ugly!

42
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,490
- Hello, Teacher
- Hi. Go back home early

43

[Chenghua High School Sports Meeting]
[Class Nine, Grade Two: Summary of Sign-ups]

44

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,470
[Chenghua Sports Meeting]
[21st annual]

48
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,010
Next, l will read a speech by Meng Shiran's s from Class One, grade two

49
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,110
"To athletes

50
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,670
Your perseverance on the track field,

51
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,400
as you run round and round embodies your amazing willpower and spirit

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,680
Let sweat drench your back and fatigue crawl all over your body

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,760
As you face this long journey, you never shrank back

54
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,800
Not for applause, not for purposeful conquering

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,390
Only the sweat of hard work can become the steps of pursuit"

56
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,740
I compiled these together. A few of the best ones are placed near the top. The one by Nan Xi is at the very top

57
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,820
- Then I will hand it over to Yang Yufei to take a look
- Okay

58
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,710
Nan Xi?

59
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,990
Every year, this sports meeting

60
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,160
is just a competition between each grade's science and arts classes

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,910
To put it even more frankly, it's a competition between our Class Nine and their Class Fifteen. You don't need to focus on the rest of the classes

62
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,640
Yes, yes, yes. She's so right

63
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,350
I got it

64
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,200
My goodness! Another fail!

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,740
We're doomed. This time, we won't be able to get the two points for high jump either

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,660
- No matter what happens, we can't let Class Fifteen get these two points
- Nan Xi

67
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,160
if we don't have the two points from the high jump, what's our probability of winning?

68
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,860
High jump is not our strong suit. Let me take a look

69
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,160
Two points is okay. Another speech can bring us back up

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,990
I'll pass it to them

71
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,450
Now, let's invite the female students in Year 2 who are participating in the shotput event to come on the east side of the field to prepare

72
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,430
You got this! You got this!

73
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,310
Rui, Rui, I'll help you loosen up!

74
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,020
Lightly! Lightly!

75
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,720
Relaxing your shoulders and neck is extremely important!

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,590
Don't! Lightly! Lightly! Lightly!

77
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,100
Rui, l think you're loosened up enough, aren't you?

78
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,420
If I loosen you up even more, Nan Xi will think I'm smashing you into bits!

79
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,900
- Smashing her into bits?
- How could I dare to?

80
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,700
- You just said it, though
- I was wrong, sorry

81
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,660
You have a strong desire to survive

82
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,060
You were the only leader in the past and I could pass your tests just by taking minimal care for you

83
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,980
Now we have another Master Nan. Life is difficult

84
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,110
- Do you have any complaints?
- I wouldn't dare to, I wouldn't dare to

85
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,480
Our Chenghua's most handsome man is so pitiful

86
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,260
If others heard about this, they wouldn't even believe it!

87
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,480
Am l, Cheng Erluo, the kind of person who cares what other people think?

88
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,820
No No No

89
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,790
Let's go, Xia Rui

90
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,940
Xia Rui, I'm going with you

91
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,950
I'm going too, I'm going too!

92
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,320
Why are you two going? It's all girls there. It's awkward

93
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,330
Just stay here. Class Nine needs you

94
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,030
Be the good adviser and write your analysis. Wait for my triumphant return

95
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,930
You got this!

96
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,660
Nan Xi has earned a lot of points for our class this time

97
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,530
We use our power and he just shows his face

98
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,630
Go

99
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,910
You got this! You got this!

100
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,860
Our class is neck and neck with Class Fifteen

101
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,220
- Really?
- Yes

102
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,970
Now, our class is not just representing our class

103
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,350
We are the hope of all science classes

104
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,250
There is hope for us

105
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,780
What's the plan?

106
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,840
The 4x100m relay race is worth five points

107
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,080
4x100m is our class's Olympic gold medal event. We've never lost

108
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
- Cheng Erluo!
- Present!

109
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,540
- Wu Hanming!
- Present!

110
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,600
- Yan Ziming!
- Present!

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,040
- Lin Xiaoxiao!
- Not present

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
- Where is he?
- He went to the podium to submit speeches

113
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,230
- Yang Yufei, these two are by Nan Xi
- Thank you

114
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,220
Next, l will read the speech by Nan Xi from Class Nine, Year Two

115
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,860
The broadcast is one point, so it is also very important

116
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,620
But Yang Yufei is only going to read yours

117
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,920
Maybe we should beg her to take someone else's in our class?

118
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,280
Quiet! Don't talk nonsense

119
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,460
Right. We need to win gloriously!

120
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,420
You sit here and analyze. We're going to take the 4x100m!

121
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,690
I'm telling you, you must be prepared, when Lin Xiaoxiao comes back

122
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,080
The 4x100m is our class's trump card. We can't lose!

123
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,120
- Do you have confidence?
- We do!
- Do you have confidence?
- We do!

124
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,110
Get ready!

125
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,500
You got this, classmates!

126
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,580
Wu Hanming, Rui's shotput is starting. Lend me your binoculars

127
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,290
They're over there. Take them yourself

128
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,200
Why didn't Rui let you go cheer her on?

129
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,080
Do you even need to guess why? It must be, because she finds him too noisy

130
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,570
It's because Rui fears that if I went,

131
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,390
the girls would all get distracted from looking at me and lose their competitive spirit

132
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,700
Wow

133
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,850
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. That was really good. You're fine

134
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,990
Class Nine is usually always showing off

135
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,880
Do you really have to warm up like this just for one throw?

136
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,740
Exactly. If it were me, I would have given up long ago

137
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,290
Why do you have so much to say? I'll show you the amazingness of Class Nine's Rui!

138
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,470
Wow! Wow!

139
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,500
Rui, Rui, good job!

140
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,820
What's wrong? What's wrong?

141
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Don't touch me!

142
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,630
8.3 m

143
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,290
Nan Xi! Nan Xi! Quickly, come here, Nan Xi!

144
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,470
Look at Rui!

145
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,090
She...

146
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,210
Rui, Rui

147
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,270
Xia Rui

148
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,430
Where didi you hurt?

149
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,770
- Is it your leg?
- I I am not injured

150
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,490
Tell me where it hurts

151
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,170
When l threw the shot put,

152
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,440
I might have used too much strength and sprained my waist a little

153
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,760
Look! My waist is fine and my hands are fine, and my legs

154
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,750
Ok. Don't move

155
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,010
Don't move

156
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,460
I got it, I got it

157
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,540
I brought an apple for you to eat

158
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,350
It's yummy!

159
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,250
You eat it, too

160
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,610
Wait a moment!

161
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,170
We need to make a toast

162
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,330
Three, two, one. Cheers!

163
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,330
Why did you think to come see me?

164
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,470
Your hat button got loose. I'll help you fix it

165
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,750
You can't treat people like air

166
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,900
Something happened! Something happened!

167
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,380
Nan Xi, you're going to run last in the 4x100m relay race

168
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,550
What?

169
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,310
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

170
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,570
Coach Yang! Can we take a look at the 4x100m registration forms of our class?

171
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,970
- Which class?
- Class Nine. Class Nine. Class Nine

172
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,270
Nan Xi. Let's check Nan Xi

173
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,090
Isn't this Nan Xi's registration form? 4x100m

174
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,620
That's not right. He lost his registration form

175
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,700
Right, Nan Xi?

176
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,890
I know now. Nan Xi's registration form wasn't lost. Someone stole it

177
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,300
What does this mean?

178
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,380
You mean someone stole his sign-up sheet and wrote his name to harm him?

179
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,690
It's not just to harm him. It's to harm our whole class

180
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,780
They want us to lose the relay race

181
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,940
Teacher, I'm here to get my number card

182
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,980
Which class?

183
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,220
Class Fifteen

184
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,890
Li Da, was it you who caused this mess?

185
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,220
Don't throw your dirty problems onto me

186
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,290
You say I did it, but do you have evidence?

187
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,330
- Who else could've done it if not you?
- Enough. Don't waste time with him

188
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,900
Exactly. Why don't you make good use of time and start practicing? Don't let us win too easily

189
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,410
- What do you mean by that?
- Enough!

190
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,460
Take your number card and hurry to the competition. Go, go, go

191
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,770
Miss Yang, is there really no other way?

192
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,890
Exactly, Miss Yang, our class got first place last year

193
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,220
We can't change our lineup

194
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,130
Miss Yang

195
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,670
I also want to help you

196
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,210
But last year, there was a class who brought PE school students here to run for them

197
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,780
so the school is making sure that the person written on the forms and the participants must be the same

198
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,820
If not, the team will be disqualified

199
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,630
Miss Yang, please, I beg you

200
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,580
- Miss Yang, please
- Is there another way?

201
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,460
I can't break the rules for you

202
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,940
Is there really no solution?

203
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,350
- Does it have to be Nan Xi?
- I can try

204
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,420
Nan Xi, the game is important

205
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,370
but there are way too many people on the track field, and I fear that you—

206
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,990
Trust me. I want to try

207
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,130
Isn't the last runner of our class relay always you? Why has it changed to Nan Xi now?

208
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,620
Yes, why?

209
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,660
I don't know either. Cheng Erluo is fighting for it right now

210
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,930
- Fighting for what?
- We're losing first place

211
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,010
Zhao Yishu!

212
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,790
What did Coach Yang say?

213
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,590
Miss Yang said that we can't switch runners

214
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,330
- That's terrible
- Then won't we lose for sure?

215
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,440
Then the first place is gone. We're just giving it away so easily

216
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,140
Enough! All of you, stop being so long-faced

217
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,940
Has the competition even started? Our class hasn't lost yet

218
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,240
Have some confidence, okay?

219
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,890
Yes. The competition hasn't started yet. The winner is still unclear

220
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,210
Yes We cannot give up!

221
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,400
Yes, Cheng Erluo is currently taking Nan Xi for speed training

222
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,870
Also, we can get points if our energy is high. We still have hope

223
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes. We won't give up until the end of the game

224
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,770
Let's shout our mantra!

225
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,810
Class Nine, Class Nine is extraordinary

226
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,300
Nan Xi, let me give you a brief explanation first

227
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,400
When you take the stick, you must stretch your arm to the back

228
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,260
and wait for this stick to reach your hand

229
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,140
Then you look at his steps and run forward with him

230
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,010
No matter what, do not lose the stick in the process

231
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,350
Don't worry. I will try my best to run fast and buy you time

232
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,510
Nan Xi, we can give up if it's too uncomfortable for you

233
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,530
It's fine. You want to win, and I want to win, too

234
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,600
Look at you, you're sweating, but you're still saying it's okay

235
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,990
I'm really scared. It's a special situation

236
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,810
Believe in me. I have to at least try

237
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,970
Okay, I believe in you

238
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,680
When you get on the track, don't be afraid. Look at me and ignore everyone else

239
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,870
No matter how others see you, don't pay attention to them. Just look at me

240
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,590
I will be waiting for you at the end

241
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,250
Do you hear me?

242
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,190
I'm not afraid, when you're here

243
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,870
Class Nine, Class Nine is extraordinary. Class Nine, Class Nine is the number one

244
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,660
Fight on!

245
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,210
Ready! Go!

246
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,800
With a gunshot, the game has started

247
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,650
The leader is Cheng Erluo from Class Nine!

248
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:40,410
Followed close behind by the athletes from Class 15 and Class 11

249
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,720
You got this! You got this!

250
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,690
Oh No! Class Nine dropped its stick!

251
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,430
Oh no! What do I do?

252
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,190
Nan Xi, look at me! I'm here!

253
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,670
Nan Xi, good job!

254
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,690
I saw you, at the end

255
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,970
I'm here

256
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,290
We won! We won!

257
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,990
What do you mean? You really stole Nan Xi's registration form?

258
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,810
Say something! You dare to do it, but not admit it?

259
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,390
What right do you have to criticize me?

260
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,110
Didn't you spread the story about Nan Xi first?

261
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,960
What's more, you can't even run faster

262
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,140
than a weak man. What right do you have to criticize me?

263
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,610
Come at me then

264
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,290
Yes, I did want to win, but you were cheating

265
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,210
Do you forget that you're on the basketball team?

266
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,870
Fortunately we did not win. If we got the gold medal using this method

267
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,930
I, Li Da, wouldn't be able to hold my head high ever again!

268
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,410
If you don't want to be unable to raise your head high again, go and apologize

269
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,940
C-coach, I made a mistake

270
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,340
Your class's 4x100m score is disqualified

271
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,530
Yang Li, I will calculate your team punishment separately from that

272
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,320
Moreover, you should say your apology to Nan Xi rather than to me

273
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,390
- Do you hear me?
- I got it

274
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,330
Although I did not do this, I need to apologize

275
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,440
That's it?

276
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,930
Stop talking

277
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,710
I am the one who stole your registration form

278
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,650
I'll take responsibility myself

279
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,710
I'm sorry

280
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,700
I was originally going to check the office CCTV to see who did it

281
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,850
but since Yang Li has already admitted it

282
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,270
I think we can follow the punishment Coach Yang deems fit

283
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,060
Small punishment, big impact, okay?

284
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,840
Now let's invite the head teacher of Class Nine, Mr. Hu Yue

285
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,990
to receive the first prize on behalf of the grade!

286
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,980
[Chenghua High School Sports Meeting]
[21st Annual]

287
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,330
Good job!

288
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,280
Hello everyone, I am the dean of Year Two. In brackets, intern

289
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,010
But at the same time, I am also the Head Teacher of Class Nine, Year Two, Hu Yue

290
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,320
It is an honor to be able to win first prize

291
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,170
with my Dear students at this year's sports meeting

292
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,840
This is the result of the joint efforts of all the students in our class

293
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,980
I also express thanks to all the competitors on the field

294
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,780
and the students who cheered, shouted, and encouraged them

295
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,050
You share this honor and are practitioners of sportsmanship

296
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,970
I am proud of you

297
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,700
Please allow me to put aside my identity as the dean

298
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,690
I want to represent all of our Class Nine

299
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,750
in thanking the student, who brought us the biggest surprise and honor today

300
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,750
Nan Xi!

301
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,610
Thank you for your energetic sprint in the final stage of the 4x100m relay

302
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,670
Your spirit, your persistence, and your explosive power

303
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,200
have brought us all unlimited surprises

304
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,610
This is exactly the reason, why our Chenghua High School holds this annual sports meeting

305
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,670
I wish every one of you at this school to be bright, healthy, and growth-seeking

306
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,870
I sincerely feel proud of everyone, who challenged themselves on the field

307
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,610
and broke through your limitations. Thank you

308
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,110
Nan Xi?

309
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,950
Let me do it

310
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,170
[Twenty First Annual Sports Meeting:  First Place]

311
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,350
Thank you, Little Wood

312
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,020
Why are you thanking me?

313
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,030
Because we were only able to get first place because of you

314
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,930
I was so worried at first, but now we've gotten through it painlessly

315
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,470
I suppose more people will like you later

316
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,550
For me?

317
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,130
Yes

318
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,010
Wow! I have never had a gold medal around my neck before

319
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,850
I am going to gloat about it after I get home

320
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,510
Xia Rui

321
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,690
thank you

322
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,570
Thank you for being willing to be my destination

323
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,240
[President Ren, I have good news for you]

324
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,190
[Today Nan Xi joined the 4x100m relay at the school's sports meeting]

325
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,220
[and even won the good ranking of first place for our class!]

326
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,890
[Look at the photos I sent you. He smiled very happily. It's great]

327
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,900
Don't gloat in such a silly way, Mr. Hu

328
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,630
Nan Xi underwent such a huge change

329
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,690
your internship position as dean will become a permanent position soon

330
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,970
Don't say that! Please don't say that

331
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,440
But truly, I really didn't expect that Nan Xi has such athletic talent

332
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,020
How is it? Didn't I dig up a good seedling for your team again? You have to thank me

333
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,810
His explosive power is great. He is great for sprinting

334
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,550
but playing basketball is different from running

335
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,640
In basketball, the players are in very close contact

336
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,160
and I'm afraid Nan Xi won't be able to tolerate it

337
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,310
True. Nan Xi is too skinny

338
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,300
Congratulations to both of you. This is the newly-arrived bean. Try it

339
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,980
I have been drinking coffee all day. It's so bitter

340
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,570
- This is different. This—
- Do you have any drinks?

341
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,850
Yes. Wait a moment

342
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,500
Nongfu Spring Water, a bit sweet

343
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,220
Boss Yi, I wanted a drink, and you're giving me water. Are you kidding me?

344
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,140
T-this is pretty sweet, too

345
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,890
Forget it, forget it. Staying with you two old men is so boring. I'm leaving

346
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,460
- Liu Bin, help Boss Yi well
- Okay

347
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,470
Miss Yang!

348
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,460
What did I do wrong this time?

349
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,890
Why don't you say what you did wrong?

350
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,540
No wonder you're going to die alone

351
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,170
She wanted a drink. Why'd you give her a bottle of mineral water?

352
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,850
She's an athlete. Drinking beverages is bad for her health. I did it out of care!

353
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,380
You still don't get it

354
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,350
What she wants is a boyfriend, who cares about her and spoils her

355
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,580
not a Daddy, who disciplines her on everything, okay?

356
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,210
Since you are so capable, where is my Sister-in-Law?

357
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,480
And "Daddy"?

358
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
Although I don't have a wife right now, as soon as I do,

359
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,340
she'll be your Eldest Sister-in-Law. I'm three months older than you!

360
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,890
- You better remember that
- Okay

361
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,890
- Bring me a croissant
- Eat poop

362
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,950
Yi, you're getting more and more stingy

363
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,250
Liu Bin

364
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,770
- Y-you
- Sir, I'm busy

365
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,370
You did this quite sentimentally, Yi

366
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,070
"If possible, please always remember to think about my care"

367
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,510
[Hu Yue is the great demon king! Make the demon retreat away!]

368
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,680
Yi, who wrote this?

369
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,370
Boss Yi, four cups of coffee. Boss Yi, goodbye

370
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,970
Xia Rui!

371
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,770
Mr. Hu, I've given you my greetings! Take a rest

372
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,770
Stop!

373
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,850
It's not like I'm the devil. Is there a need to be so scared? Come here, come here

374
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,770
I have a favor to ask

375
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,450
I'm here. What's up?

376
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,310
I am getting a bit old and my eyes are a bit blurry

377
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:10,950
Come on. Can you help me to see, what is written on this sticky note?

378
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,470
Uh

379
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,980
[The time that you are my most fatal - Tom]

380
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,910
This one
[We let go of our individuality, morals, and freedom only because we cannot let go of a single person]

381
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,290
I see "We let go of our individuality, morals",

382
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,930
Do you also have bad eyes?

383
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,090
Wow, W-who wrote this? Which class are they from?

384
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,670
That's so disrespectful! How terrible!

385
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,390
You also find it terrible, don't you?

386
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,880
But I think the handwriting on it looks like it was written by someone in our class

387
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,170
Check it for me and guess who it is?

388
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,730
Really?

389
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:03,230
Don't you think it looks like it was written by student Xia Rui?

390
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,510
Well

391
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,210
I can't open it. You guys just keep talking

392
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,920
D-do you remember? It was right here that day

393
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,050
- We played that game
- Did we?

394
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,180
- We played truth or dare!
- Yes, yes, yes

395
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,380
I-I lost that day

396
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,910
Didn't you teach us to be credible people? I...

397
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,440
It was a punishment. I had no way out, right, Yi?

398
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,320
Yes. I think this did happen once. What day was it again?

399
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,190
It was that day... You were even the one who gave me the idea

400
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,610
Hu, we were deskmates for so many years. Do you believe her?

401
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,140
I don't believe either of you

402
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,580
What? Deskmates?

403
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,290
Yes. I got a low score on my university entrance exam

404
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,030
What do you mean by that?

405
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,780
Luckily, I didn't get a nice university entrance score. Otherwise,

406
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,290
how could I meet such an outstandingly good friend like Hu Yue?

407
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:08,340
Mr. Hu, look how great we are. We miss you even on our own time

408
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,750
What a moving teacher-student relationship

409
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,290
Well, then I have to thank you? You really regarded this as a wishing board

410
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,790
Where do you want me to retreat to?

411
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,300
To-t-to your office, of course

412
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,770
We are too noisy. You have to take a rest. Take a rest

413
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:31,010
Don't quibble. I won't hold it against you since you cheered for classmate Nan Xi today

414
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,340
Nan Xi, you need to continue to help Xia Rui with her homework to improve her grades

415
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,880
I still have to continue? Nan Xi has already tortured me miserably enough

416
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,050
- Don't
- Look at you. Nan Xi hasn't looked down on you for being both stupid and disobedient yet

417
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,340
Look at your face of reluctance

418
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,450
I'm telling you, you can celebrate well today,

419
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,410
but after the celebration, you must go home earlier

420
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:57,910
Don't disturb Boss Yi's beauty sleep. Boss Yi has creases on his face already!

421
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,090
This is called charm. What do you know?

422
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,760
I have information for you

423
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,860
She's going on a trip for three days. Seize the opportunity for yourself

424
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,650
Okay. Okay. Okay

425
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,650
- Croissants for a week
- Enough!

426
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,670
Okay

427
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,050
I won't disturb you anymore. Get home early

428
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,010
Goodbye, Sir

429
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,930
She?

430
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:23,740
It's her. It's her. It's really her Our friend, Boss Xia

431
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,470
Yes, yes, yes

432
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,110
What did Mr. Hu mean?

433
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,780
Improving grades? Making up lessons?

434
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,670
You two have secrets?

435
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,690
There are so many secrets between us. Do you have a complaint?

436
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,270
You two got together and bullied me again!

437
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,690
- No, we didn't
- No

438
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,590
Then bring me to the tutoring, too

439
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,000
- No
- No

440
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,290
You don't have to give such a direct refusal! I'm so sad

441
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,210
It's fine, it's fine. I'll be your tutor

442
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,170
It's still our Dear Shu who is the best. If she wasn't here, I would be tormented by you two so badly

443
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,390
This is a snack from Boss Yi

444
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,290
Don't look at me like this, okay? I just came here to work

445
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:14,010
The truth is, h-he's not that bad, and I have accepted him as my little brother

446
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,120
What? When did you accept another little brother? I don't approve

447
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,500
- It's okay
- Wait. Who is your little brother?

448
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,670
I heard you were hit by a shot put. Did it turn you into a fool?

449
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,280
You're the fool. We got our order, and you can go now

450
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,830
Treating my kindness like nothing

451
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,260
I promised Xia Rui that you will no longer be my rival in love

452
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,930
Moreover, I, Liu Bin, always keep my word, so I won't bother you again

453
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,930
Also, l don't accept just anyone, only people stronger than me

454
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,330
You were so cool on the field today

455
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,610
So great

456
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,730
Hey. You people—

457
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,330
Xia Rui, aren't you a bit too much?

458
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,360
This is my map around the world

459
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,810
If you post things like this, do you expect me to go to your school and post things?

460
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,090
Now you have no way of tearing it

461
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,410
[I hope Old Yi's business booms so he can travel the world soon]

462
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,760
Why did I meet you?

463
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,660
I'm such a wonderful girl!

464
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,470
Go celebrate

465
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,480
Come on, come on. Let's celebrate

466
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,410
To the sports meeting, to Nan Xi. Cheers!

467
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,010
Old Xia

468
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,220
Are you a cat? How did you come in without making a sound? You scared me!

469
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,490
What are you doing here? It's midnight

470
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,250
It's cool here

471
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,850
Cool?

472
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,740
- Let me see. Why has it made you cry?
- Go away. Go

473
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,550
I have to go tell Grandma

474
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,380
Wait a minute. You came back so late. What did you do?

475
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,390
I just finished the sports meeting, so I celebrated with my classmates

476
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,130
You won a gold medal? Give it here and let me see!

477
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,510
Take a look together with grandma tomorrow

478
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,730
Then I have to tell your mother about those comics under your bed

479
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,910
You're my grandpa. Have some morals, okay?

480
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,570
Come on. Let me see

481
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,170
I really can't deal with you

482
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,390
It's priceless

483
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,590
Men's 4x100m relay?

484
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,820
- Old lady—
- Shh

485
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,180
Grandma is asleep, don't disturb her sleep!

486
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,820
I snatched this from Chubby Cheng

487
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:23,100
Who'd believe that? If it were Chubby Cheng's medal, you wouldn't be so unwilling to show me

488
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,140
Your thinking is wrong

489
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,300
Y-you can't think like that. If you do, I'll have to tell grandma,

490
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,890
- that you watch too many idol dramas
- Don't! Don't

491
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,330
Your grandma doesn't like watching idol dramas. Let her sleep

492
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,770
I suppose I fell to your hands today

493
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,850
Go Hurry and sleep, you hear me? You still need to go to school tomorrow

494
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,570
Little fox has to find time to fix you, old fox

495
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,010
This is the last episode for today, okay?

496
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,730
Last episode. Okay Here

497
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,340
- Go to sleep after watching
- Okay

498
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,950
Go. Go. Go

499
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,830
[Did you get home?]

500
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,450
[Yes. I'm back]

501
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,310
[I will cherish the gift you gave me]

502
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,100
[It's getting late, go to bed quickly]

503
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,410
Turn off the computer

504
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,950
What's this?
[English Recitations 1-5]

505
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,620
[Read and recite well. I'll check on Monday]

506
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,710
Oh my goodness. So many?

507
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,210
There is reward for completion

508
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,350
I, Rui, actually accept this?

509
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,520
[Nan Xi, please be kind]

510
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,820
You said I am your destination. I think it's more like you want to end me

511
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:53,310
Xia Rui, promise me. Always be my destination
