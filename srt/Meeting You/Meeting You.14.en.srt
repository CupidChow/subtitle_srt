=Meeting You=

2
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,200
Nan Xi!

3
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,894
How about it?
You must have waited for long time.

4
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:44,194
No.

5
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:45,494
How was your examination room?

6
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:47,294
Was the lighting okay?

7
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,294
The temperature, humidity,
and the environment?

8
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,894
-The atmosphere...
-Are you looking for a house now?

9
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:54,294
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:55,694
I am worried.

11
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:57,794
Don't worry. Everything went well.

12
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,894
Okay. That's fine.

13
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,640
But there is one thing...

14
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,280
What do you mean?

15
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,694
I am hungry.

16
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:08,040
What a deep breath.

17
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:10,694
Hungry?

18
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:13,400
I heard that there is a snack street
next to Binhai University.

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,494
There are many delicious foods.

20
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:15,920
What are you going to eat?

21
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,894
-Why do I hear Cheng Erluo's voice?
-Here.

22
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,294
Mei Shu, Nan Xi, Xia Rui.

23
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,600
I miss you so much!

24
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:29,394
You're gonna play a good game
and strive for a place.

25
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:30,894
I'll take charge here. Don't worry.

26
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,294
If you dare...

27
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:33,694
I know.

28
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:35,494
Bin, I have some words for you.

29
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,594
If they get the pre-exam syndrome
and show bad temper,

30
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,194
just play Tai Chi to change the subject.

31
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,694
If they question your opinion,

32
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,694
you must not follow them,
and don't try to explain things.

33
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:48,294
If there is room, just tell jokes...

34
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:49,894
which can also relax them.

35
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:51,194
Besides, you...

36
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:52,720
Okay, let's eat something.

37
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:56,894
You're the only ones who can stand him.

38
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,894
I would smash the phone if I were you,
you know?

39
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:03,200
"The most beautiful candidate for the
Acting Department in Binhai University."

40
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:05,894
-Yishu.
-Yes?

41
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:07,094
You are on the list.

42
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,200
What?

43
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:10,400
Let me see it.

44
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,894
The reporter is too mean.

45
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:17,520
He cut us out.

46
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:24,394
There is no doubt that our Mei Shu
is really a beauty.

47
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,894
Pity.

48
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:28,720
Our Mei Shu is my girl.

49
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:32,294
Xia Rui Can you restrain yourself a bit?

50
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:33,694
You're not like a girl at all.

51
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,520
You're not gentle at all.

52
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,894
It's useless if you stare at me.

53
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:40,294
Look around.

54
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,194
Everyone is more like a host than her.

55
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:43,494
Pardon?

56
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:44,680
I...

57
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:51,894
Xia Rui.

58
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:54,794
Don't compare yourself with others.
You are the best if you are yourself.

59
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:55,960
Yes.

60
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,694
Of course. I am the best.

61
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,800
Yes.

62
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:09,504
=Episode 14=
=Youth!=

63
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,094
You scared me.

64
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,894
Why are so many people
taking exams in your major?

65
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:40,094
-Yes.
-You must have not had breakfast.

66
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:41,360
How did you know?

67
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,094
Here. I bought them all for you.

68
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:46,894
Can't go to the exam
with an empty stomach.

69
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:47,894
Did you eat some?

70
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:49,120
I did.

71
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:53,080
Why are you here?

72
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,894
I asked Bin to give you breakfast,

73
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,694
but he said that Yang Yufei
was gonna take exam in the afternoon.

74
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:00,394
I should rely on myself
rather than others.

75
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,394
So I bought them for you.

76
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,994
Which do you like? Buns, biscuits or...?

77
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:06,894
Xia Rui, why are you here?

78
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,000
Did you...?

79
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,760
Eat the buns first.

80
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:16,480
Hush!

81
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:20,294
Candidates, take your admission ticket
and prepare to enter the examination room.

82
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:21,480
Wait a minute.

83
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,294
Here. I can't accompany you inside. Here.

84
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,960
You take it as if I'm by your side.

85
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:32,394
Do you feel a little bit ease?

86
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,094
I am not scared because you're with me.

87
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:35,294
Okay.

88
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:36,894
It's all right.

89
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,694
-Go.
-I'm going in.

90
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:39,894
Cheer up!

91
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,440
Okay. Go.

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,160
Xia Rui.

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,780
We agreed that I'd take Nan Xi
to his exam.

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,480
Now you've come here. Didn't you trust me?

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,480
No, I just...

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,960
It just happened to be on the way
to the exams, so I came here.

97
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,280
What time will you take the exam?

98
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,980
Me? I...

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,560
Let me check.

100
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,580
Help me wait for him here.

101
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,580
I gonna take my exam.

102
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,240
Thanks, buddy.

103
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,780
Okay.

104
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,800
Hurry up! We are late!

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,380
-Hello, teacher.
-Hello.

106
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,320
Hello.

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,480
(Pass the exams at every moment)

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,680
Hello.

109
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
Hello.

110
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760
Hello.

111
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,580
Professer Gu.

112
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,800
Cheer up.

113
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,680
Professer Gu.

114
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,980
I wish you good grades.

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,980
Thank you.

116
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,380
That necklace is well-designed.

117
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,180
Did you make it?

118
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,580
Yes.

119
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,780
Cheer up.

120
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,060
Okay, I'm going in now.

121
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,980
Hello, teacher.

122
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,080
Hello.

123
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,980
And sing aloud
in the splendor of starlight,

124
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,580
but I cannot sing aloud.

125
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,580
Quietness is my farewell music;

126
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,980
Even summer insects heap silence for me.

127
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,780
Silent is Cambridge tonight.

128
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,000
Very quietly...

129
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,360
Oh, my god, I'm so nervous.

130
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,880
It's fine.

131
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,040
Relax, Xia Rui, relax.
Xia Rui is the best.

132
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,580
Quietness is my farewell music.

133
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,580
Students from the 45th to 50th, line up.

134
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,800
Yes.

135
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,360
All right, follow me inside.

136
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,580
Hello, teachers.
I'm candidate No. 46, Xia Rui.

137
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,780
I come from Chenghua High School.

138
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,880
My poem recitation today is...

139
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,580
"Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again."

140
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,980
"Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again,"
by Xu Zhimo.

141
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,180
Very quietly, I take my leave.

142
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,380
As quietly as I came here.

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,180
Quietly, I wave goodbye.

144
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,580
To the rosy clouds in the western sky.

145
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,180
The golden willows by the riverside.

146
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,580
Are the young brides in the setting sun?

147
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,980
Their reflections
on the shimmering waves...

148
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,280
always linger in the depth of my heart.

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,980
The floating heart growing in the sludge
sways leisurely under the water.

150
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,580
In the gentle waves of Cambridge,

151
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,180
I would be a water plant.

152
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,580
That pool...
The pool under the shade of elm...

153
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,080
That pool under the shade of elm trees...

154
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,380
That pool under the shade of...
elm trees...

155
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,180
is...

156
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,780
-Under the shade of...
-Stop. That's enough.

157
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,280
Next, please.

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,520
Thank you for your time, teacher.

159
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay, next.

160
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Woodie.

161
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,400
I seem to have messed up.

162
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,840
Xia Rui!

163
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Just giving you three minutes.

164
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,360
It's not a big deal!

165
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,240
This is not your major.
This is not your profession.

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,440
It's not a big deal, just admit it.

167
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
Relax.

168
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,440
Be stronger.

169
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
Now only the college entrance examination
is left.

170
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,800
Come on!

171
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
I can't let Nan Xi see me like this.

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
He will worry.

173
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,080
Be stronger.

174
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Smile.

175
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
Smile.

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,240
Definitely God in our Chenghua.

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,940
He even got the examiners contact card.

178
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,240
Professor Gu Siming,
Deputy Dean of Architecture College.

179
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,040
He is in a high position, right?

180
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,160
Now he can enter Binhai University
for sure.

181
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Is...? Is there anything on my face?

182
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,440
We just separated for a while.

183
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,840
What are you looking at?

184
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Thank you.

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Why are you corteous?

186
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,840
A little goldfish played a big role.

187
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,240
Really?

188
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
Did professor Gu see it?

189
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,840
What did he say?

190
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
He said that it's nice.

191
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,440
What are you looking at?

192
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,940
Was she smiling at me just now?

193
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,340
Yes.

194
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,640
Not only did she smile at you,

195
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,220
but she has you in her mind.

196
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,240
Xia Rui...

197
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,640
Such a joker. Please tell me more.

198
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,920
I like it.

199
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,320
You're hopeless.

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,240
(Countdown
to college entrance examination)

201
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,800
(Countdown
to college entrance examination)

202
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,240
Why'd you come to school
when you are already guaranteed?

203
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,440
Sleep at home if you want to.
Don't show off here.

204
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,560
No.

205
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,040
I also want to study.

206
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,840
Learning makes me happy.

207
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,540
I want to complete my high school road.

208
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,040
I want to stay with every comrade solidly
until the last moment.

209
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,740
Last moment?

210
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,440
You said that like you are going
to accompany us to death.

211
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,840
That's unlucky. Don't say that.

212
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,840
Of course not.

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,840
I mean to conquer this mountain,

214
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,240
and go ahead conveniently
to conquer the next mountain.

215
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,040
Life is to conquer mountains one by one.

216
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,540
When will it end?

217
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,040
You two can't watch war movies anymore.

218
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,740
Cheng Erluo, you are now entering
the university with both feet.

219
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,240
What are you feeling? Are you at ease now?

220
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
I don't have the result
of the art exam yet.

221
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,240
How can I relax by myself?

222
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,240
There are more than 10 days left.

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,440
(Countdown
to college entrance examination)

224
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,320
What's wrong with you, Bro Rui?

225
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,040
Are you possessed by a savant?

226
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,640
Okay, class is over. Class is over.

227
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,040
Goodbye, teacher!

228
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,040
Say now! Who are you?
Why do you occupy Xia Rui's body?

229
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Be quick to obey my command!
The evil spirit should subside!

230
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,120
You...

231
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,440
Nan Xi?

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,720
I'm kidding.

233
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,980
I...

234
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,440
Cheng Erluo, focus on your study.

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,440
Don't bother Xia Rui with her studying.

236
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,640
I just want to study hard.

237
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,740
Don't be surprised.

238
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,440
I just want to see how astonishing
I will be if I study hard.

239
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,640
Hush!

240
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,280
You really got sick.

241
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,960
Don't.

242
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,020
I was wrong.

243
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,920
Nan Xi?

244
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,620
Mei Shu?

245
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,760
Just these people?

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,840
Uncle, are all the letters here?

247
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,220
Yes, it's all there. Find them yourself.

248
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,200
Xia Rui, don't be too discouraged.

249
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm fine.

250
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,940
The broadcast host was originally decided
by us temporarily...

251
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,640
just to try my luck.

252
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,640
That luck means we tried our best
to do anything and let God decide.

253
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,220
Maybe I don't have such luck in my exam.

254
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,160
What are you doing, Nan Xi?

255
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,440
Xia Rui, I said before,

256
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,280
I will go wherever you go.

257
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,640
Don't be so stubborn.

258
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,840
I failed the art exam,
but I can take common exam.

259
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,740
Do you, the tutor, want to give up on me?

260
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,240
It's okay.

261
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,840
At least Xia Rui tried the art exam.

262
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,840
There is no regret.

263
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,640
Besides, Xia Rui's performance in
the cultural courses has improved rapidly.

264
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,440
-Yes.
-There is still a chance.

265
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah. I'm telling you.

266
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,880
There is a blessing in disguise.

267
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,680
I thought that if I passed the exam,

268
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,280
I would do what I disliked for a lifetime.

269
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,320
But since I failed it, I'm relieved now.

270
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
Xia Rui, wait for me for a while.

271
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,960
I'll be right back.

272
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,180
It's okay.

273
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,080
All roads lead to Rome.

274
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,080
Even if there is no road,
we still have paths.

275
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,680
If it doesn't work, we...
♪Cross the hills♪

276
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,280
Xia Rui, are you worried about Nan Xi?

277
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,280
There is no need to worry about him.

278
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,280
His grades in the cultural courses
are already so good,

279
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,880
and now he gets the extra points...

280
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,780
so he can enter the university for sure.

281
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,480
But I'm afraid
that he won't enter the university.

282
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,880
Nan Xi's brain circuit is a bit peculiar,

283
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,480
but he won't be stupid.

284
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,080
I am afraid that he would be this time.

285
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,680
It seems today, it's not a joke.

286
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,380
It's okay for me to climb the mountains,

287
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,480
but he can't give up his road.

288
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,880
For Nan Xi, I'm going to Binhai!

289
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,280
Xia Rui!

290
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,380
Since you fought for me
then motivated me to lose weight...

291
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,180
You have been taking care of me
for so many years.

292
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,880
Now is the time for me,
Little Cubby Cheng,

293
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,480
to repay you, Xia Rui!

294
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,680
Don't worry.
You have me and Mei Shu besides Nan Xi.

295
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,680
No matter how difficult
this road to Rome is,

296
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,580
Xiao Meishu and I
will accompany you to the end!

297
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,180
To what end?

298
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,280
Sit down.

299
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,880
You mean you won't let me go
until you die.

300
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,280
Repay her?

301
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,180
Do you treat Xia Rui as your mother?

302
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,480
Isn't this touching at all?

303
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,880
You two are laughing?

304
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,280
Shouldn't three of us hug together
and weep at this moment?

305
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,040
Okay. Come.

306
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
All right.

307
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,280
I got your thoughts,

308
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,480
but the moving type
is really unsuitable for you.

309
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,960
Don't do that again.

310
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,680
Okay.

311
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
Anyway, I have to cheer up.

312
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
And I'm going to Binhai!

313
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,612
-Binhai! It's waiting for me!
-Yes.

314
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,040
That's a deal.

315
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,880
I compared it.

316
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,361
This is clear and basic,
which is suitable for you.

317
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:43,520
Nan Xi You went to the bookstore
just to buy the questions?

318
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
As the tutor,
I'm going to start working hard.

319
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,880
That was so fast.

320
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Can't you give me
a little preparation time?

321
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,180
The time for a cup of coffee is enough.

322
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,480
-Cheng Erluo.
-Here!

323
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,280
You are responsible
for Xia Rui's physical condition.

324
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,680
Got it.

325
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,480
Zhao Yishu, you take charge
of Xia Rui's emotional stability.

326
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,800
Okay.

327
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,680
Let's work together...

328
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,520
and help Xia Rui enter Binhai University!

329
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,860
This is Xia Rui's training program.

330
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,080
Run for youth, Xia Rui!

331
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
Are you a devil?

332
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,880
I don't want...

333
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,040
Cheng Erluo, I gonna kill you!
Stop blowing!

334
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,000
I am a vigorous and young girl.

335
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,440
(Xia Rui, remember to have breakfast)

336
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,067
Come to my shop tonight.

337
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:50,720
I have something for you.

338
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:55,480
Boss Yi, I'm here.

339
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,364
Where is he?

340
00:21:58,444 --> 00:21:59,520
Boss Yi!

341
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:05,840
Why doesn't he clean this thing up?

342
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:14,040
A gift for a model Exam. Do you like it?

343
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:16,600
Nan Xi?

344
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,967
You... You did it?

345
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,798
This model exam is kind of difficult,

346
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:30,134
but you got 400 points,
which is a great progress.

347
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,498
We are all thinking about what gift
to give you.

348
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:33,864
Thanks to Nan Xi's creativity.

349
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:35,834
Yeah, Xia Rui We've done the math for you.

350
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,560
There are still 70 days to go
before the college entrance examination.

351
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,233
If you improve one point a day,
that's more than 70 points.

352
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:42,034
Don't pressure Xia Rui.

353
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:46,099
Do you still remember what I said
when we watched the sunrise?

354
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,100
Nan Xi, to be honest,

355
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,720
I am not brave as I look like.

356
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:58,480
I am afraid
that I will lose a lot of things...

357
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,000
when I grow up.

358
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:04,966
Such as my stupid friends...

359
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,763
and...

360
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:10,100
And the character
of not being afraid of everything.

361
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,480
And...

362
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,040
you who have been lost
and has come back now.

363
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,840
I...

364
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:23,334
I am so scared...

365
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:26,880
that all of you will leave me alone
when the time comes.

366
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:31,560
I can't do anything.

367
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,280
I don't know anything.

368
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:48,200
Nan Xi, don't you feel that way?

369
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm not afraid.

370
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,599
Because I found you,
and I won't lose you again.

371
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,960
I will always be Xia Rui's woodie.

372
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,440
Don't be afraid, I am here.

373
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:19,167
But l don't want to improve
with the way you are pushing me.

374
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,594
I don't want to be your trouble.

375
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,547
Never thinking that.

376
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,240
I said this before.

377
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,334
You are my destination.

378
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,474
How you can be our trouble?

379
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,239
Yes, Xia Rui you're not a trouble.

380
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,673
You have tried so far.

381
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:38,775
Yeah, Xia Rui.

382
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:40,373
Think about your first year
in high school.

383
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,533
I can't believe
that you work so hard in class now...

384
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:44,720
and that you still study after class.

385
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,907
Then...

386
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:52,307
Then I'll study harder and harder.

387
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,234
If walking doesn't work, I'll run.

388
00:24:54,314 --> 00:24:55,639
If six notebooks with wrong topics
are not enough,

389
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,974
the I'll make 60, 70, 80 notebooks.

390
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,774
I'll fight for it!

391
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:01,040
Xia Rui, fight for it!

392
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,174
All right. Drink it now.

393
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,520
It will be cold soon
if you don't drink it.

394
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:12,320
I didn't expect you to learn latte art.

395
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:15,607
Did you learn it from Boss Yi?

396
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:17,404
You guessed it.

397
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:19,511
Your little whale gave me courage
and confidence...

398
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,574
so that I can be admitted
to Binhai University.

399
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:25,360
This latte art is one of my returns.

400
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,720
I like it.

401
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:41,633
She finally smiled.

402
00:25:41,713 --> 00:25:43,320
It has become sunshine after raining.

403
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,104
Youth dare to fight.

404
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,960
There is no regret left.

405
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:02,406
I asked you to come here today
not for anything else.

406
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,834
Well, you never wanted a salary...

407
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:07,873
since you have been working here
for so long.

408
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:10,774
I can only use this coffee to pay you.

409
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:13,541
-I...
-Objection overruled.

410
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:15,803
Where did you get it?
I've wanted this for a long time.

411
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:17,200
It's a secret.

412
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,137
It's a gift for you to prepare
for the college entrance examination.

413
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:22,440
You'll refresh yourself after drinking it.

414
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,139
And you can drink it instantly.
It smells like my hand-made coffee.

415
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,120
-Thank you, Boss Yi.
-You are welcome.

416
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,600
Let's check how many errors you made.

417
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,720
No, they're all correct!

418
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,680
(Countdown
to college entrance examination)

419
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,920
Look at you one by one.
Is this the Class Nine that I know?

420
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,320
Where is the momentum
of being afraid of nothing?

421
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,560
It got you all down when you failed once?

422
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:22,153
I'll give you a reassurance.

423
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:26,820
The province said this
second model exam is really difficult.

424
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,988
The college entrance examination
will not be so difficult.

425
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:33,013
Actually, for this exam,
our class's grades are pretty good.

426
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:36,214
One classmates got to the top 10.

427
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:38,375
There were only two students
through the whole grade...

428
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:40,454
who could calculate the last question
in math exam.

429
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,283
Nan Xi is one of them.

430
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:46,118
There are also full score essays
by Lin Xiaoxiao and Zhao Yishu.

431
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,320
Every class has spread
throughout the grade.

432
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,253
And our Xia Rui...

433
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:56,800
got 447 points in this difficult test.

434
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,187
She improved 73 places
from the whole grade ranking.

435
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,994
She's commendable.

436
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:06,188
Sir, we all regressed except Xia Rui.

437
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:11,654
Mr. Hu I think everyone's
psychological pressure is too great now.

438
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:14,653
What's the pressure for you who
have been admitted to Binhai University?

439
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,720
It's called
"a bystander is always clear-minded".

440
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,753
You are a bystander now?

441
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,453
I said it wrong.

442
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:24,586
I mean, that it'll affect our learning
if we are under such pressure.

443
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,987
I think we should find a way to vent.

444
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:29,694
Then share your ideas, ways we can went.

445
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:33,453
I suggest that we watch a comedy in
the evening to learn to relax ourselves.

446
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,240
I happened to have the resources
of New Year's Comedy Movies...

447
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,121
for the last 10 years in my hard drive,
and I don't mind sharing with everyone.

448
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:40,087
It sounds good.

449
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,884
But the impact is too bad...

450
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:44,440
that watching movies
in the evening is learning.

451
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Forget it.

452
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:52,919
But the way to relax has an alternative.

453
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:59,113
If this week,
all the teachers said that you did well,

454
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:04,984
then this Sunday,
I'll take you out to relax.

455
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:07,454
Yes!

456
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:09,514
All right!

457
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:10,520
Ready for class.

458
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,900
Come on.

459
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,960
Take care, classmates behind.

460
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,287
Are you tired, Xia Rui?

461
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:37,784
Go.

462
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,080
Come on!

463
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:46,813
Guys, come on!

464
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:49,064
Life lies in sports!

465
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:50,986
Yes! Life lies in sports!

466
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:53,854
The outdoor activity Hu said
was climbing the mountain.

467
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,317
How does this relax us?

468
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:56,854
He clearly wants to exhaust us.

469
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:59,640
I really don't understand
what old people like.

470
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:05,187
Why do we take these crooked paths
rather than the roads?

471
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:07,884
Mr. Hu, are you lost?

472
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:12,480
Nan Xi, I found out that you,
and Mr. Hu are a perfect match.

473
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:14,554
Why?

474
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:17,254
This hobby of your for climbing...

475
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,574
is really incomprehensible.

476
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:20,880
I don't want to be matched with him.

477
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,787
Mr. Hu, you are disgusted by Nan Xi.

478
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:25,253
Mei Shu, what's wrong with you?
Do you have a stomache?

479
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,753
Come up. I'll piggyback you.

480
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,613
-It's okay.
-Why don't you give me a piggyback?

481
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:32,486
You think I'm an idiot who'll
piggyback you with your such weight?

482
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:35,054
I must pick a lighter one to piggyback.
Just ask Nan Xi to piggyback you.

483
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:36,883
Xia Rui, come up.

484
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:38,714
Wow.

485
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:41,353
-Come up.
-Xia Rui is gonna be a rabbit today.

486
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,320
I'll beat you. Get up, I am not tired.

487
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,087
Then why did you ask him to piggyback you?

488
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,914
No, I'm not tired. Just get up.

489
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:48,454
-Come up.
-Aren't you tired?

490
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:49,820
I'm tired.

491
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,654
Stop looking at us,
just climb the mountain.

492
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,519
I haven't seen you like this
when getting the admission ticket.

493
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,681
Go.

494
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,960
What are you doing?

495
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,854
Why are you here stopping the climb?

496
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:02,954
Did you find a wallet or a cultural relic?

497
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,921
-Sir, we are playing a game.-
What game?

498
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,787
Zhu Bajiei piggybacking a wife.

499
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,984
Wu Hanming, language!

500
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:11,987
Our Nan Xi is at least
a white-dragon-horse for his appearance.

501
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:12,960
All right.

502
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,586
The female students
can take a rest if you are really tired.

503
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,554
But never piggyback anyone on the back.

504
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:19,554
The road on this mountain
is really dangerous.

505
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,413
Got it, Mr. Hu. We'll go by ourselves.

506
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,520
Okay. Hurry up, okay?
Go, let's keep going.

507
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,753
Xia Rui, we blame you.

508
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,554
How?

509
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:29,484
Why did you involve Nan Xi?

510
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:30,880
I...

511
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,854
Never say that joke again.

512
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:37,854
Are you angry?

513
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:40,000
Did you hear that?
Never say that joke again.

514
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:42,454
I was talking about you.

515
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,734
Me?

516
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:47,254
If you are tired,
only I can piggyback you.

517
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:49,054
Others cannot do that.

518
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:51,454
But Chubby Cheng is not "others people."

519
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,680
All right, we go first.

520
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:56,754
He is.

521
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,254
Okay, it's just a little thing.

522
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,254
Don't thing too much. Just go.

523
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,534
Go.

524
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:05,254
Okay, I promise

525
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:08,400
I will not let anyone else but you
piggyback me in the future, okay?

526
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,654
Nan Xi?

527
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,100
Say it again.

528
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:18,754
What do you want?

529
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,054
What do you want me to say?

530
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:22,054
Could it be that, except you,

531
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:24,600
I won't let others piggyback me
and hold my hand?

532
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,354
Yes. Except me, all outsiders.

533
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:28,754
You are too overbearing.

534
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:30,200
I admit that.

535
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,954
I won't promise you that.

536
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:38,160
Besides you, my grandparents
and my mother are not outsiders.

537
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:42,440
That...

538
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,080
That...

539
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:48,160
Family members are okay.

540
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,454
Then I can promise that.

541
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,454
Then I swear from now on,

542
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:58,254
except for my grandparents,
my mom and you,

543
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:01,034
I, Xia Rui,
won't let others piggyback me, okay?

544
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,080
Okay.

545
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,654
Did you know?

546
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:17,080
I didn't say not to piggyback others.

547
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:20,054
She's cunning.

548
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,880
That's also not allowed.

549
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,040
We are here! The top of the mountain!

550
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:35,454
Classmates behind, hurry up, we are here!

551
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,054
To the top of the mountain, Hu!

552
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:39,054
-Do you know who you are talking with?
-Old Hu!

553
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:40,854
Classmates, hurry up.

554
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:41,954
We've arrived!

555
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:43,440
I'm exhausted.

556
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,720
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

557
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,580
Guys.

558
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
Climbing is hard.

559
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,920
But without this hard work,

560
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,820
how can you see the beauty in this moment?

561
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,520
I saw that some classmates stopped
and took a rest when they got tired.

562
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,420
Some classmates almost fell,

563
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,520
but gritted their teeth
and insisted on standing up,

564
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,820
and kept climbing up with the railing.

565
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,920
Although many students are slower,

566
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,720
I am happy that none of you gave up.

567
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,420
None of you got left behind!

568
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,920
Yeah! We did not give up!

569
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,720
Some classmates asked me just now...

570
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,220
Why didn't we take the big roads?

571
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,720
Why did we choose paths...

572
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,020
that are hard to climb
and easy to fall down?

573
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,720
Now you should understand.

574
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,620
Without these falls,

575
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,920
these pauses, these rugged paths,

576
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,920
how would you understand that persistence
is commendable?

577
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,420
How can we have the great joy...

578
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,320
of enjoying the beautiful scenery
at this moment?

579
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,300
-Am I right?
-Yes!

580
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,620
Guys, I know...

581
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,920
that many students were disappointed
in themselves...

582
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,520
as they didn't get a good grade
in the second model test.

583
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,840
And they are also afraid...

584
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
that me and their parents
will be disappointed with them.

585
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
But I want to tell you...

586
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,160
that I am not disappointed
with any of you.

587
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,920
Unless you give up on yourself.

588
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,720
Don't be afraid to take detours.

589
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,000
Don't be afraid to fall.
Don't be afraid of failures!

590
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,420
Remember today's climbing.

591
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,720
Remember all the feelings today.

592
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,120
Some years later,

593
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,020
look back and think about
who you are today.

594
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,120
You will never regret every step
you have taken.

595
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,760
You will be glad that you never gave up!

596
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,880
I am proud...

597
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,080
of all of you.

598
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,000
Xia Rui...

599
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,320
Don't be sad.

600
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,920
I am not.

601
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But I don't know why I want to cry too...

602
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,920
when I saw everyone crying.

603
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,080
God, it's so stupid.

604
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,160
It's not stupid. Not at all.

605
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,320
Come, classmates.

606
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Come and watch the sunset!

607
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,333
-Is it beautiful?
-Yes.

608
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,080
Shout out the university
you want to enter to the sunset!

609
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,920
Guys, do you remember...

610
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,120
the last sentence
of Zhao Yishu's Chinese composition?

611
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,320
Yes!

612
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,920
Let's call it out together, okay?

613
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Okay!

614
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,560
I know, spring is ours!

615
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,761
I know, spring is ours!
