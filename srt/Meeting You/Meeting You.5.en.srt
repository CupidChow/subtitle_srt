1
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:37,705
=Meeting You=

2
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,590
One more.

3
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,990
Right side.

4
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,306
Dear Shu.

5
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:53,507
What's wrong?

6
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:54,707
Are you all right?

7
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,028
Keep going!

8
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,355
Who threw the ball just now?

9
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,370
Li Da, was that you?

10
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,507
I just used more strength.
It's her fault for sitting there.

11
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:05,007
What do you mean by "it's her fault"?
This is the spectator seating.

12
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,707
If she wont sit here, would you expect her
to sit on the basket? It's fine.

13
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,607
You hit a girl with a basketball.
Can't you even say sorry to her?

14
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,907
Come on. Come on. Come on.

15
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,607
Li Da, go apologize.

16
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,991
Hurry.

17
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:20,107
Sorry.

18
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,107
What's with the tone?

19
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,107
-Keep going. Keep going.
-It's okay, really. I'm okay.

20
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,991
Hurry up and train.

21
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,607
Cheng Erluo.

22
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,407
Only because the coach was there,
I didn't argue with you.

23
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:34,007
But I advise you.

24
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:37,807
Don't believe that just because Coach Yang
likes you, you can rule the team.

25
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,907
You do have your own cheerleading team
and you have high prestige at Chenghua.

26
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:45,007
But on the court, it is personal skills
and teamwork that matter.

27
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,207
You, Cheng Erluo, and your Class 9
are not as good as us.

28
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,107
Li Da, such a big talk.

29
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:54,507
Looks like you won't be convinced
unless we play for real.

30
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,707
Of course.

31
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,607
Someone have displaced you from
Chenghua Basketball Team ever since.

32
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,707
No one else dares, but I dare.

33
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,207
Okay. Tell me. How should we compete?

34
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,407
Next PE class on Monday, Your Class 9
will have a match with my Class 15.

35
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,307
Let's talk to the teacher
about having a match.

36
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:12,107
Okay! See you in PE class next Monday.

37
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,891
Come on, dear Shu.

38
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,907
Luoluo, you didn't have to be like that.

39
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,307
Luoluo, I apologize to you.

40
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,107
I'll never stand you up again.
Is that okay?

41
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:28,607
It's my fault I didn't introduce
Nan Xi to you properly.

42
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:32,607
But you've already known
that he's an introverted person.

43
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:35,191
Luoluo.

44
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,207
Chubby Cheng, enough is enough!

45
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,607
I think he's thinking about the match
with Class 15 on Monday.

46
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,907
He was furious with Li Da today.

47
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,991
What match are you talking about?

48
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,691
(Episode 5)
(Wait for me, Little Bell)

49
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,907
This Li Da must be crazy!

50
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,107
He's going too far!

51
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,530
Chubby Cheng, bring out
your full power today.

52
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,607
Let Class 15 see how strong
our Class 9 is.

53
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:09,607
Not only must we win, we must also have
him apologize to our dear Shu in public!

54
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:13,507
Classmates! You're all coming
to PE Class later to cheer us on!

55
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,591
-Okay!
-Okay!

56
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,807
If certain students have extenuating
circumstances, it's fine if they don't go.

57
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,307
It won't stop us from winning. Come on.

58
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,907
-Let's go play.
-Go, go, go.

59
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,507
Nan Xi, don't take it personally.

60
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,107
Chubby just talks like that.
He's insanely childish.

61
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,168
But it's the first time that
I've seen him this angry in a long time.

62
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,450
Please don't take it to heart!
Are you okay?

63
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:38,491
If so, then I'll go first.

64
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,507
Cheng Erluo, don't embarrass
our Class Nine, got it?

65
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,507
When have I ever done that?

66
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,507
I'm surprised that
you're willing to talk to me.

67
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,507
It's not like I was angry with you.

68
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:07,207
All right. Defeat Class 15. Come on!

69
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,707
Of course.

70
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:13,091
-You got this!
-Come on!

71
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,207
Play fair.

72
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,191
Friendship first, competition second.

73
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,041
You got this!

74
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:36,991
Fight on Class 9!

75
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,307
Do you think I don't know
what kind of person Nan Xi is?

76
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,207
Aren't you so childish?
Can't you mature a bit?

77
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,607
Why are you asking me to choose?

78
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:19,691
You know your choice, but we don't!

79
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,507
Fight on Class 15!

80
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,107
Don't give him a chance.

81
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,491
Stop him!

82
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:38,691
Fight on Class 15!

83
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:24,741
-Cheng Erluo, come on!
-Cheng Erluo, come on!

84
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:38,741
Come on! Come on!

85
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,507
Come on! Come on!

86
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:54,791
Foul! Foul!

87
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,991
Come on.

88
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,107
It's okay. Come here.

89
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,507
Are you all right?

90
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,891
Take a break. It's okay.

91
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:27,191
-Does it hurt?
-We still have time.

92
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,704
Do I really suck?

93
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,006
What are you talking about?

94
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:38,507
I have seen your worst before.

95
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,571
You're much more handsome now.

96
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:22,307
In fact...

97
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:26,635
Was I the ugliest when I was Chubby Cheng?

98
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:31,203
It's when you weren't confident
in yourself.

99
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,107
And when you admitted defeat!

100
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,907
If you dare to admit defeat,
don't ever call me Boss again!

101
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,507
Aren't we just nine points behind?

102
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,307
Aren't you just under pressure,
because of your terrible enemy?

103
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,907
Bring out your morale!

104
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:42,707
Bring out your team's strength!

105
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,907
You have time to act all discouraged
here. Why don't you get energized?

106
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,307
She's right. You got this!

107
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:49,107
Nan Xi comes here.

108
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,907
This is probably the first time Nan Xi
has ever joined any class activity, right?

109
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,307
There are so many people here.

110
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,712
Why did you come?

111
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,107
I want to win.

112
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,507
What?

113
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:01,445
Show him this.

114
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,791
Whom?

115
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:04,488
Cheng Erluo.

116
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,569
Cheng Erluo, Nan Xi made it for you.
Hurry and take a look!

117
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,692
Is this Li Da?

118
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,207
Yes.

119
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,803
Come on! Come on!

120
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,706
You've got no problem winning this!
Double your efforts! You got this!

121
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,307
I know that his weakness is shooting
from zero to thirty degrees.

122
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:23,307
Coach warned him.

123
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:24,863
Then why don't you make good use of it?

124
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,151
I was too confused during the game.
I only remembered just now.

125
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,000
What does the "two degrees" mean?

126
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:36,707
Does it mean that my body
habitually leans two degrees to the left?

127
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,707
Yes.

128
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,913
So, as long as I lean two degrees to the
right, I can increase my rate of accuracy?

129
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,386
Yes.

130
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:46,640
But, what exactly are two degrees?

131
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:53,507
-Here we go.
-Go, go, go.

132
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:56,207
You got this! You got this!

133
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,207
Cheng Erluo, you can make it!

134
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,307
Come on! Come on!

135
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,307
You got this, Cheng Erluo!

136
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,391
Come on! Come on!

137
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:08,191
Come on!

138
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:15,011
Come on! Come on!

139
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,107
Two degrees!

140
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,391
Come on!

141
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,007
Come on!

142
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,807
Cheng Erluo, come on!

143
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:28,807
Let's go! Class 9!

144
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,991
Come on!

145
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:45,991
Class Nine! Winner!

146
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,307
Cheng Erluo, come on!
Cheng Erluo, come on!

147
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:50,907
Only two points behind now.

148
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,207
I can only get three points
only if I make Li Da do a foul.

149
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,291
Come on!

150
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,191
Cheng Erluo, come on!

151
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:06,791
Foul! Foul!

152
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:10,391
Come on! Come on!

153
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:34,007
Make the shot, Chubby Cheng.

154
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:48,691
-Come on.
-Come on.

155
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,791
Cheng Erluo, come on.

156
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,591
Chubby!

157
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,501
Li Da!

158
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:32,407
Leaving immediately after losing the game?

159
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:34,107
We're not done yet.

160
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:35,507
What do you want?

161
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:37,307
-Apologize.
-Excuse me?

162
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:40,591
Is your memory failing you
at such a young age already?

163
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:43,107
You hit our dear Shu
with your ball yesterday.

164
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:45,188
You think a lost match
will compensate for that?

165
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,607
It's okay I'm not in pain already.

166
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:48,654
Apologize!

167
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:55,591
-Apologize! Apologize!
-Apologize! Apologize!

168
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,991
Okay Cheng Erluo, you win!

169
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:04,896
I am sorry.

170
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:07,507
Is that enough?

171
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,107
In the future, you better remember!

172
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:13,482
When you hit a girl with your basketball,
you must apologize!

173
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,507
Why are you suddenly looking at me,
as if you've never seen me before?

174
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:27,107
Luoluo, you almost seemed to
be possessed by Rui just now.

175
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:30,507
When you were talking to Li Da,
you scared me!

176
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:33,891
Isn't that, because we won
the game, and I'm full of energy?

177
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,991
Today, thanks to Nan Xi...

178
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,307
Where is Nan Xi?

179
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:40,807
How come Rui is also gone?

180
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:41,789
Nan Xi!

181
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,234
Nan Xi?

182
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:46,911
Why did you put your hat on again?

183
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:50,907
There are too many people.
I'm not too used to it yet.

184
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,507
It's fine. Just take your time.

185
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,278
There were so many people
on the court just now,

186
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:56,507
you still had the courage
to hand that note to Cheng Erluo.

187
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,707
You bravely took the first step.

188
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,948
It's worth encouraging.

189
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,507
Also, Cheng Erluo has been
playing basketball for so many years,

190
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:06,107
but you were able to fix his problem
of missing penalty shots so easily!

191
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:10,108
Let me think about what
kind of reward I can give you.

192
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,251
Rui, Godly Nan Xi.

193
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:27,371
You guys left too early and perfectly
missed out on me knocking out Li Da!

194
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,307
Nan Xi, you were like a god today!

195
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,307
So godly!

196
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,482
You're a god. Thoroughly godlike!

197
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,475
Luoluo, didn't you want me
to make the happy decision,

198
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,307
of choosing between the two of you?

199
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:38,870
How come I haven't even chosen yet,

200
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,602
but you've come
and started expressing goodwill?

201
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,707
It happened so long ago.

202
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,507
Are you still not over it?

203
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,644
But Nan Xi, why did you suddenly
help me today?

204
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,521
Because Xia Rui wanted
you to win the game.

205
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:55,407
Exactly.

206
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:59,507
He helped you for Rui's sake
while you acted like a naive child.

207
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,820
You even acted and directed
your own jealousy scene.

208
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,249
Don't talk nonsense.

209
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:09,107
Nan Xi, it was all thanks to you today.

210
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:11,529
I've been so immature.

211
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:12,983
You disregarded past grievances
and helped me out!

212
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,107
We'll be brothers from now on.

213
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,471
You will be my Elder brother!

214
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,955
I'll pay attention to distance.
I'll pay attention.

215
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,907
Nan Xi, didn't I just ask you
what reward you wanted?

216
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,507
Whatever you want to eat
or drink or have, tell me!

217
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,907
It's Chubby Cheng's treat.

218
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,371
Yes, yes, yes!

219
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,859
No, thanks.

220
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,721
Come to my house after school
and I'll tell you.

221
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:34,707
Okay.

222
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,307
Are you two hiding something from us?

223
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,707
Can the two of us also come?

224
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,003
No.

225
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,679
What a harsh refusal.

226
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,972
Luoluo, Shushu, we're leaving.

227
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,388
Don't be jealous!

228
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,358
Go, go, go.

229
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,986
The weather, the scenery,
everything is great today!

230
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,907
-I think I'm out of tune.
-Yes

231
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:55,907
I got lost.

232
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:57,539
-It's lovely.
-Completely lost.

233
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,107
What's the matter this time?

234
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:01,307
Godly Nan Xi is not only
able to help me win the game,

235
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:03,757
he's also able to tolerate
Rui's off-tune singing.

236
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,957
I pale in comparison.

237
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,607
Childish!

238
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,605
Dear Shu, wait for me!

239
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,335
I seriously suspect
that you're pranking me.

240
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:35,108
You must complete
this entire problem set today.

241
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:38,681
You really regard yourself as a tutor?

242
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,007
I'm considering
how I should charge the fee?

243
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,807
You dare charge me!

244
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,312
I have a clear distinction
between public and private matters.

245
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:49,584
-You...
-However,

246
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,681
if you do well,
I can consider rewarding you.

247
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,056
Let's start!

248
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,737
Cheng Erluo.

249
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:26,675
Nongfu Spring? It doesn't leak a drop!

250
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:40,092
What's up?

251
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,638
Dear Shu.

252
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,740
I have a serious question for you.

253
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,437
Go ahead. Why are you so close to me?

254
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,374
Because the question is quite private.

255
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,426
What's the question?

256
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:02,071
When you're with me,
do you feel like sleepy?

257
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,489
Cheng Erluo, what are you talking about?

258
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:08,707
I'm saying.

259
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,007
When you're with me,
do you feel like sleepy?

260
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,207
I heard you. You don't have to repeat it!

261
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,747
Why would you ask that?

262
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:17,507
I'm just curious.

263
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,907
Curious about what?

264
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,489
I'm curious about Rui.

265
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,785
Rui?

266
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:25,680
What does this have to do with Rui?

267
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:27,801
Think about it.

268
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:31,707
When she's with Godly Nan,
Rui always falls asleep.

269
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,207
She puts her head against
his shoulder, just like that.

270
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,507
I wonder whether Godly Nan
has any kind of special ability.

271
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,621
Can I get that ability too?

272
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,967
Cheng Erluo, you...

273
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,849
You are...

274
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,152
Dear Shu.

275
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:37,458
What kind of history do you
think Godly Nan has had?

276
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,283
Why are you still thinking about him?

277
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,856
Although I've already admitted Godly Nan
as my idol, Rui is still not by our side.

278
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:49,445
It just feels weird.

279
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:51,378
You're right.

280
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:55,988
However, I think Rui is also very happy,
when she's with Nan Xi.

281
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:58,282
I can't help but admire Godly Nan.

282
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,326
I don't understand
what kind of magic he has!

283
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,568
He doesn't care about anything
or mind anything,

284
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,657
but he understands
and knows everything!

285
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,087
Yes.

286
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:09,174
Silent, but loud.

287
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,968
This is the standard male
lead criteria in idol dramas.

288
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,483
It's so annoying.

289
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:17,237
Why did I have to meet such
an excellent character in my life?

290
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,577
It consumes me with grief,
but I like it so much!

291
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,613
That's enough, Chubby Cheng.
Stop being sentimental.

292
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,950
If you have the time to talk about this,
you might as well use it to study well.

293
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,187
We're having a good time together now.

294
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,117
Don't mention those sad things!

295
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,457
Then it's more important to turn those
sadness into motivation to study well.

296
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,057
Demonstrate the spirit you brought
during the match. Do you hear me?

297
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,557
Yes!

298
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,887
I'm going home for dinner.

299
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,147
Wait a minute.

300
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:44,726
Even if you get one problem right,
you will get a reward today.

301
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,777
I can get a reward just like that?

302
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,257
-Yes.
-Really?

303
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,357
Let's go!

304
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:51,681
To do what?

305
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,763
To get your reward.

306
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:16,914
What's this?

307
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:18,848
-A gift.
-A gift?

308
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:21,104
Open it and take a look.

309
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:22,274
Okay.

310
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,767
Wow!

311
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,177
So many.

312
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:37,315
December 31?

313
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,303
Isn't that my birthday?

314
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:41,735
It's a birthday present.

315
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,273
I owe it to you.

316
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:44,758
All of them are in there.

317
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:48,252
Do you like them?

318
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:52,811
You don't have to be
so touching, Little Wood.

319
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:54,852
So.

320
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,183
Where are mine?

321
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:58,587
Yours...

322
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:01,347
I-I haven't prepared it yet.

323
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:03,270
What should I do?

324
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,148
Yours...

325
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,711
I'll give you all the snacks
in my snack bar.

326
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,529
But you don't like snacks.

327
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,094
Then what?

328
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,712
I-I can promise you one wish. How's that?

329
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:23,037
Then I'll just have to agree.

330
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:24,148
Okay.

331
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:27,780
Bye.

332
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:29,784
See you.

333
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,637
Go, go, go. Leave this sad place.

334
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:36,612
I would rather have Hu standing
in front of me than my report card.

335
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:39,117
I found since you became the vice
representative, you've changed a lot.

336
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,417
You care about your grades now.

337
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:42,677
Cheng Erluo!

338
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:44,077
Did you see our grades yet?

339
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,387
No, no! Rui, our grades don't matter.

340
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:48,907
What's important is that who got the
highest score in science is in our class!

341
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,367
-Really?
-Yes!

342
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:52,767
Excuse me. Let me take a look.

343
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,267
Rui, this is the first time this has ever
happened since the creation of Earth!

344
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,317
That's definitely the news of the year.

345
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,877
It must be a mistake.

346
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:00,887
Even if number one wasn't our Yufei,

347
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,507
there's no way it could be
someone from Class Nine!

348
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,587
What do you mean?

349
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:05,857
What a joke!

350
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:08,927
Do you think we're still the Class Nine,
who runs around and acts noisy?

351
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:10,577
Not anymore!

352
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,907
We are the Class Nine who has Godly
Nan Xi, who descended from the sky!

353
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:14,947
That's right!

354
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:17,417
For this grade, I'm willing to pay
as many tuition fees as I need!

355
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:18,887
Any fee!

356
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:21,237
You mean number one is Nan Xi?

357
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,857
Or else who, you?

358
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:25,547
Don't get excited too early!

359
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,520
Let's see how long this
new number one student,

360
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:29,720
will last in your arts and sports class!

361
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:33,907
Hey, girl! Who are you calling
the arts and sports class?

362
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,087
-Mr. Hu.
-Yes?

363
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:36,207
Homework.

364
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,327
I'm leaving.

365
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:38,853
Just a second, Xia Rui!

366
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:45,297
Although your grade in our class
was at the very bottom again...

367
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:49,179
you improved your overall grade ranking
by three points.

368
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,457
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

369
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,057
However, you must not be satisfied!

370
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,867
You must continue to study hard.

371
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,325
Victory awaits you
just a little ways ahead!

372
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:05,417
-Then I'll leave, Mr. Hu.
-Go ahead.

373
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,047
-Bye, Mr. Hu.
-Bye.

374
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,427
-Mr. Hu.
-Yes?

375
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,430
Nan Xi got first place
in the entire grade.

376
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:12,227
It's time to put him
into the elite class.

377
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,018
Let him come to our Class One.

378
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:17,851
I think Nan Xi's best at math.

379
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:21,267
Our class is an experimental math class.
It would suit him more.

380
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:24,734
Well, this depends
on Nan Xi's own inclinations.

381
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:27,277
Moreover, I haven't
discussed with his family yet.

382
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,075
Just wait a bit longer. No rush.

383
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:33,047
-How's it going?
-Mr. Hu is looking for you.

384
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,027
You're amazing. You got first place!

385
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:36,977
Class One and Class Two
are fighting over you.

386
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,781
Hurry up and go in.
I'm going back to the classroom.

387
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:14,087
What are you doing?

388
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,549
Rui, what are you doing?

389
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,848
Can't you make a noise?

390
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,887
You're acting so sneaky.
What are you doing?

391
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,697
Here's what I'm thinking.

392
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,531
Ever since Nan Xi's one drawing solved...

393
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:32,567
the penalty shot problem
that I've had for so many years,

394
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:35,037
I've mentally regarded him
as my elder brother.

395
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:37,694
I'm desperate to get closer to him.

396
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:44,716
But I know that Nan Xi won't allow anyone
except for you to get close to him.

397
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:48,587
Therefore, I can't force
this kind of thing to happen.

398
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:50,467
Then what are you still doing here?

399
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:53,327
However! Nan Xi got first place
out of the entire grade.

400
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,039
Rumor has it that he will go to Class One.

401
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:57,677
I was just thinking,

402
00:26:57,761 --> 00:27:00,438
I'll have less and less time
to stand by his godly side.

403
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:03,896
If I don't do something soon,
my idol will be far from me.

404
00:27:04,311 --> 00:27:10,335
So, I want get closer to my god
by five centimeters every day!

405
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:14,611
Childish!

406
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,687
This is called making progress!

407
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,243
A person like you, Rui,
who won right on the starting line,

408
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,348
wouldn't understand
the sadness of people like me.

409
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:25,101
I "wouldn't understand
the sadness of people like me".

410
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:29,447
Rui, first, have a seat.

411
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:30,812
Have a sit.

412
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:38,558
You want to stay in Class Nine?

413
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:41,100
-Yes.
-Would you tell me why?

414
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,814
I have friends in Class Nine.

415
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,602
I am really happy.

416
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:47,239
Okay.

417
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,302
You're a smart kid.

418
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,987
I won't say much.

419
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,804
If you don't want to transfer to another
class, the school will not force you to,

420
00:27:56,061 --> 00:28:00,877
but Nan Xi, you know that Class Nine
is a science, art, and sports class.

421
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:05,177
Most of them are going to take art exams.

422
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:06,714
Moreover, our school's rules state that,

423
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,043
you must submit an application
to enter an art and gym class.

424
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:12,438
Sir, I have already applied it.

425
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,955
The application needs to be signed
by your parents. Will they agree?

426
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:20,462
Didn't my mom agree?

427
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:23,636
Nan Xi, it's like this.

428
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,827
We put you in Class Nine,

429
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:28,927
with the intention of preparing you
for Chenghua's environment.

430
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,977
Then why can't I stay?

431
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:33,758
Because it's not a long-term plan.

432
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,391
It's fine right now,
because you're in Grade 2.

433
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:38,317
But how about when you get to Grade 3?

434
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,037
Especially during
the first half of the semester.

435
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:42,151
The vast majority of these students,

436
00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:45,923
will either go through special training
or get tutoring for art exams.

437
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,607
Moreover, they will
have to take lots of exams.

438
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:50,048
When that time comes,
the class' curriculum,

439
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:53,447
will become a self-study class,
where teachers answer questions.

440
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,739
When that time comes,
as a student intending...

441
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:58,236
to take the normal college entrance
exam, you can't stay in this class.

442
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:05,737
I've got a lot of hair split ends.

443
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:19,417
Nan Xi, have you decided?

444
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,545
Are you planning to join Class One
or Class Two?

445
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:24,270
I heard that Class One
has the best overall scores,

446
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:25,987
and Class Two
is best at Math Olympics.

447
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,727
In fact, these two classes
are both very suitable for you.

448
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:31,147
Of course our Nan Xi will go to Class One.

449
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,996
Class Two sounds stupid.

450
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:37,054
You want me to go to Class One?

451
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,753
You got first place
out of all the students in the grade!

452
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:41,067
Of course you
should go to Class One.

453
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:45,207
Otherwise, messing around with us
slackers wouldn't be appropriate, right?

454
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,647
Right, yes.

455
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,456
Xia Rui, the teacher is coming.

456
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,707
Nan Xi, actually,
I think it's okay to go to Class Two.

457
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,757
Class Two is full of your female fans.

458
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:08,251
And if you go to Class Two, you won't...

459
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:18,347
He's coming. He's coming.

460
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:21,057
Nan Xi, Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

461
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,147
-He's coming. He's coming out.
-Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

462
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,827
Nan Xi, I have a box
of chocolates for you.

463
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,857
Nan Xi, please come!

464
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,991
Come with me, come with me!

465
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:35,237
Go back to your class! All of you.

466
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:39,357
Give me all your presents. I'll pass
them to him. Thanks for liking him.

467
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:41,849
I've spoken on the phone with your mom.

468
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:43,881
Here are the two forms.

469
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:47,826
One is a transfer application
and the other one is for an art exam.

470
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,916
They both have been stamped by the school.

471
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:54,505
Go and talk to your mom,
and decide which one to submit.

472
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:58,507
Choose one form and get your mom's sign.
Then send it to me by express mail.

473
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,783
Nan Xi, how come you also
have an application for art?

474
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:05,735
Nan Xi, do you want to take the art exam?

475
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:08,776
Yes.

476
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,600
Does Xia Rui know?

477
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:18,086
Don't tell her. Okay?

478
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:22,181
Then, is there anything
you need my help with?

479
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,571
You can't help me.

480
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:27,921
Thanks.

481
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:33,357
Wow! Rui you're amazing! Where
did you get all these great snacks from?

482
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:35,897
I rubbed off on Nan Xi's luck.

483
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,775
Did you just open my
Godly Nan Xi's presents?

484
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:42,010
Our Godly Nan Xi doesn't like snacks.
Ask him if you don't believe me.

485
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:46,678
Look at the both of you talking!
It's like Nan Xi's not here.

486
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:50,997
We need to cherish the times,
when we can eat and drink for free.

487
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:52,567
When our Nan Xi goes to Class One,

488
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:54,299
won't we have to run
to the neighboring classroom,

489
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:56,347
to kill others
and take their trophies?

490
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:57,548
Nan Xi?

491
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:05,717
Rui, don't talk about
Class One all the time.

492
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,653
Godly Nan Xi has not left yet.

493
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:18,558
Don't you remember back
then when I, Cheng Erluo,

494
00:32:18,642 --> 00:32:20,337
was a popular guy,
who received Dove chocolates?

495
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,431
Let me tell you!

496
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:23,170
Now the female fans
have become richer,

497
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:25,207
after staying on-the-down-low
for such a long time.

498
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,817
They've started to send Ferrero.

499
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,867
Looks like it's time
for me to make a comeback.

500
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:31,627
You think that's considered
on-the-down-low?

501
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:35,317
Your fans voluntarily left you, after
witnessing your confusing behavior.

502
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:37,527
Nan Xi, don't try to imitate him.

503
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:39,657
He's giving you an example of exactly
opposite of what you should do!

504
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:41,177
Do you want me to have fans?

505
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:42,487
Of course.

506
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:44,845
They give so much food! Of course I do.

507
00:32:45,991 --> 00:32:47,815
If you want to eat snacks,
I can buy them for you.

508
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,531
Don't eat others' food.

509
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:17,969
Hello? I see, President Ren.

510
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:21,612
All right. All right.

511
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,715
He's having dinner.

512
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,781
Yes. Okay.

513
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:32,652
Okay. Bye.

514
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:02,031
Art students can major in design.

515
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,547
With your grades, you can study
design even without the art exam.

516
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:08,133
Mom believes in you.
