1
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,190
Play, play, play

2
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,630
Mr. Hu!

3
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,110
You're far too noisy this afternoon!

4
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,310
Look at you guys!

5
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,190
Mr. Hu, what are you holding?

6
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,990
The sports meet registration form?

7
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,090
Enough, enough, enough. Look at all of you

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,590
As soon as you heard the words "registration form," you got so excited that you practically bloomed

9
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,190
When I enter the classroom with exam papers, how come you don't become this delighted?

10
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,290
Fine. Send it down to everyone later. Whoever wants to sign up

11
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,790
just fill in the form and submit it on Friday

12
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,590
Students! Everyone should eagerly sign up for the sports meet this time!

13
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,490
Let's try to beat Class 15

14
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,690
- Do you have confidence?
- Yes!

15
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,690
Binzi

16
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,390
Hey, hey, hey! I'm talking to you, Binzi!

17
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,790
If you've got something to say, say it quickly. Don't you see that I'm busy?

18
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,490
What a terrible temper. Did you take the wrong medicine?

19
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,690
Isn't my current situation a gift from you?

20
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,390
What attitude are you expecting from me?

21
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,790
The truth is that you could quit

22
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,390
Boss Yi wouldn't tell Coach Yang

23
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,390
The reason why I, Liu Bin, am respected by Grade Three is, because I am trustworthy

24
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,190
Besides, Coach Yang promised me that, if I came to work here

25
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,790
she wouldn't make my friends have to do leapfrogs

26
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,390
Isn't it, because they

27
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,490
threatened to tell Yang Yufei about your embarrassing situation?

28
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,790
Superficial

29
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,790
Fine. Considering the fact that you're so loyal

30
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,590
let's get to know each other again

31
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,190
Class Nine of Grade Two, Xia Rui

32
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,990
Are you a true man?

33
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,590
I, as a woman, am better at resolving grudges than you are

34
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,290
Isn't gaining a new friend better, than gaining a new enemy?

35
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,990
I admittedly made mistakes in the past

36
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,390
Why are you wasting your words?

37
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,390
From now on, you have a new Brother Rui

38
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,190
Turn to me if you need anything

39
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,590
Brother Rui?

40
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,490
Do you have an issue with it?

41
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,990
I... since you're a girl, I will let you off the hook this time

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,790
but in the future, you will also a dude that your Brother Bin takes care of

43
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,390
- Brother Rui.
- Brother Bin

44
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,990
[Episode 7]
[We will protect our Nan Xi together]

45
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,790
Student, I understand your feelings as a fan

46
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,590
Cheng Erluo, what are you thinking about?

47
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,190
Who is your fan?

48
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,390
Y-you... Aren't you part of my cheerleader squad?

49
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,990
Fans change their idols in a matter of minutes

50
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,190
Don't you have a good relationship with Nan Xi? Help me give this to him

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,590
I...

52
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,490
If you help me, these will all be yours

53
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,090
As your former fan

54
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,690
I know these are all your favorite snacks

55
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,990
Am I, Cheng Erluo, someone who will betray others over snacks?

56
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,490
You aren't helping me? If not, then never mind

57
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,490
Wait a moment!

58
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,790
Leave the snacks here. I'll help you

59
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,190
Sisters, hurry over!

60
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,590
Hey, I'm only helping you. I...

61
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,990
Didn't I say you weren't allowed to accept these?

62
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,390
"Not allowed to accept". It's much easier said than done

63
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,190
Look at the young girls by the door

64
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,590
When they're with you, they're gentle kittens, but they become tigresses with me

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,990
If I don't accept them, they would tear me apart and gnaw at my bones, until there was nothing left of me!

66
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,390
Nan Xi, Nan Xi!

67
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,790
You don't understand. Ever since the thing between you and Yang Yufei failed

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,190
they've started thinking they have a chance!

69
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,090
Now you have became the man that even the campus belle couldn't successfully pursue

70
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,090
Your popularity has surged even more and now they've become even more daringly desperate

71
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,290
- So...
- Please come out, Nan Xi

72
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,690
Doesn't she no longer have a chance?

73
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,790
She comes again?

74
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,990
Why are you looking for me?

75
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,490
I came to tell you

76
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,390
the school will send two students to the Provincial Art Museum next semester, to represent the school in participating in its research

77
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,590
I was selected

78
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,690
There is another space

79
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,190
so I recommended you

80
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,790
Wait a minute!

81
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,990
The Provincial Art Museum is cooperating well with the program, and it will bring out some new collections that rarely get shown

82
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,790
I think you'd like it

83
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,990
I think Yang Yufei really pulled a big move this time

84
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,590
She is totally doing this to gain favor with Nan Xi

85
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,790
The Provincial Art Museum's new collection sounds awesome

86
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,990
Please consider it seriously

87
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,190
Even if you decide not to go, please give me a reason

88
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,990
I don't like crowds. Thanks

89
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,590
Wh-what is the meaning of this?

90
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,590
For that book. Thanks

91
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,690
It's fine. It was a gift for you anyway

92
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,390
I'll buy it

93
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,190
He gave it to you, take it. You bought a book for him, but he won't even appreciate your kindness

94
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,990
Is it really necessary for you to humiliate others like this?

95
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,390
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's fine

96
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,990
The bell is ringing. Let's go back

97
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,990
Was there a point in going overboard like that? Let's go

98
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,390
Nan Xi!

99
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,490
Why did you have to go overboard?

100
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,490
Exactly, Godly Nan. If you want to reject her, just reject her

101
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,390
Giving her money was a bit overly rude

102
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,790
However, I think this time, the effect was more than a little bit stronger

103
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,390
All of the campus-belle protecting envoys have probably even gained the yearning to kill you

104
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,890
However, refusing Yang Yufei in public is also good

105
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,490
Now, she must think of giving up

106
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,390
People like Liu Bin won't come and find him again

107
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,190
Xia Rui no longer has to fight for you anymore

108
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,390
Exactly, Rui. If anything like this happens again, you need to tell us

109
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,390
There will definitely not be a next time

110
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,790
Okay, okay, okay. No next time. No next time. No next time

111
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,090
It's really hard to be a boss. I get nagged by you every day

112
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,690
Boss, don't forget

113
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,790
You have to cheer for us during the match!

114
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,790
Okay. Good luck!

115
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,990
Yufei, don't be sad

116
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,390
Nan Xi is not worth your sadness

117
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,190
All right. I already said that I'm fine

118
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,990
However, the reason I'm telling you that, Nan Xi isn't worth it

119
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,990
isn't just because you're my good friend

120
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,990
I bumped into Nan Xi yesterday

121
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,490
My mother said Nan Xi is her friend

122
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,990
Friend?

123
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,990
My mom is a workaholic

124
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,190
Aside from the people she meets in the psychological clinic, she has very few friends, and I know all of them

125
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,190
That means there's only one possibility

126
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,590
You mean

127
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,790
your mother and Nan Xi met at work?

128
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,690
Right, and my mother has a subconscious habit

129
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,990
She calls all of the patients she cannot disclose any information about "friends"

130
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,590
Isn't your mother a psychiatrist?

131
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,290
My goodness! Is what she said true?

132
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,790
Guess who I am?

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,990
Xia Rui

134
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,690
- Hurry, hurry. Have a seat
- Thanks

135
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,790
- Did you finish your homework?
- No

136
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,290
A gift for you

137
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,390
What's this?

138
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,390
Error correction booklets

139
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,190
Two error correction booklets?

140
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,490
How many questions will I have to solve to finish them both?

141
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,990
Mathematics and English. One for each

142
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,390
One for each? Oh my goodness

143
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,190
Just English is enough for me

144
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,990
Now you've added math? I've already created recordings

145
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,390
Teacher Nan Xi, please spare me. I can't do it. I can't do it

146
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,590
Right. You haven't given me your English recordings yet

147
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,990
It's been three days already

148
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,090
I'll write them. I'll write

149
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,390
I'll write all math and English errors and send you the recordings too

150
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,990
I won't sleep until I finish writing all of items down. Are you satisfied?

151
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,890
- No.
- How can you be satisfied?

152
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,990
Sleep on time

153
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,590
Efficiency is important

154
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,190
Just force me to death

155
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,090
It's okay. It's okay

156
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,390
How about this? Come to my house to study

157
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,790
I've been so busy these past few days

158
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,690
Won't you bend the rules for me?

159
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,790
How are you busy?

160
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,390
I'm exhausted physically and mentally

161
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,390
- Then your homework—
- Nan Xi

162
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,190
Have you noticed that you've been talking a lot lately?

163
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,790
I didn't expect that there would come a day where I could associate you with "annoying noises"

164
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,090
You mean "noisy"
("Gua zao" should be pronounced "guo zao" )

165
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,790
Yes. You meant, "noisy"

166
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,390
The teacher explained it in class before

167
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,790
I'll take this booklet and record it down

168
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,690
Isn't that for English and math mistakes collection?

169
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,490
By the way, don't forget to study at my home tomorrow night

170
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,610
Isn't this Li Da?

171
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,320
I haven't seen you for a while since the last match. What's up? Where did you go?

172
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,750
What's it to you?

173
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:12,610
What I mean is, you can take advantage of our Godly Nan Xi's presence and have him guide you

174
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,910
We can't play ball today!

175
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,040
What do you mean?

176
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,610
It smells wrong. Why do I smell an illness?

177
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,990
What illness?

178
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,270
Illness in here

179
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,430
Really? Where? Why haven't I smelled it?

180
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,840
The one who farts first smells it first. It's the same logic.

181
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,960
Whom are you talking about so weirdly?

182
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,250
The emperor is not worried, but the eunuch is already anxious. Now observers are more concerned than the person involved

183
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,130
Say it again!

184
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,070
Xia Rui

185
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,120
Li Da, your mouth is really bad. Don't you see me, Xia Rui?

186
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,650
Apologies. I didn't want to see you

187
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,160
Li Da, I think you're addicted to apologizing!

188
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,310
Rui, you don't have to do anything today. I'll teach him a lesson. I'll make him apologize to Nan Xi

189
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,950
- You want to fight? Come on!
- Come on!

190
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,470
Look at you all. Are you a gymnastics formation? You're all hiding behind her

191
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,670
Nan Xi, I'm talking about you. What kind of a man hides behind a woman?

192
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,730
- What are you talking about?
- Come on

193
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,210
It's okay, Rui knows when to stop

194
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,840
- Apologize
- I'm not going to give a damn apology

195
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,500
Did l say anything wrong? He even went to see a psychiatrist

196
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,820
He must be sick

197
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,430
It's spread across half the school. If you have the capability, shut them all up

198
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,940
Besides, he dropped out of the research high school. Everyone knows it was because he couldn't continue studying

199
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,590
You—

200
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,410
Xia Rui

201
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,670
I'll tell you, we are not done here

202
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,740
Meng Shiran's mother is a doctor. Nan Xi is her patient

203
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,850
Nan Xi, do you dare to say it's not true?

204
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,810
Nan Xi? Nan Xi?

205
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,390
Nan Xi...

206
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,030
Nan Xi?

207
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,630
Nan Xi. Nan Xi!

208
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,810
Nan Xi!

209
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,780
Sorry, l fought again

210
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,200
But l stopped as soon as you asked

211
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,910
However, I need to clarify that, when I smashed him over my shoulder, that was normal self-defense. You can't count that as a fight

212
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,730
Okay

213
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,250
Little Wood, we have been looking for each other for 12 years. Do you still not believe in me?

214
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,810
Rest assured. What happened in the research high school will not repeat again in Chenghua

215
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,770
- I'm not—
- I know

216
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,590
No one understands what kind of person you are more than I do

217
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,580
Besides, I'm by your side. I will help you make more good friends

218
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,420
Dear Shu, Chubby Cheng and I are all your good friends

219
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,790
We will always be with you. Do not be afraid

220
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,150
It's all my fault. I didn't tell you that Aunt Lin is a psychiatrist

221
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,560
Don't care what others think of you or say about you

222
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,310
I know you, I understand you. l will always be with you

223
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,750
Okay

224
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,560
But I have to confess

225
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,710
I'm so stupid and violent, and it took so long for me to recognize you. Would you mind?

226
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,690
No. You're always good

227
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,020
You too. The people who are bad are the ones, who don't understand you, yet misunderstand you

228
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,010
You don't need to care about others. Just believe in yourself and in me, got it?

229
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,910
Ok

230
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,050
How did Nan Xi become like this? Is he a psychopath?

231
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,150
- Is this person sick?
- No way

232
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,950
How can that be possible?

233
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,380
Nan Xi. Nan Xi

234
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,080
What are you looking at? Haven't seen a handsome guy before?

235
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,080
Move, move, move! Get out. Do you not need to go to class?

236
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,050
We are here

237
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,180
Godly Nan, don't be afraid

238
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,310
The coach and the others already disciplined Li Da. They won't talk nonsense anymore

239
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,750
I didn't talk nonsense. What l said was the truth

240
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,390
Yes

241
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,790
But some people just can't stand to hear the truth

242
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,780
Were you not hurt enough yesterday? Can't control your dirty mouth, can you?

243
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,600
Xia Rui, be less arrogant

244
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,310
Because you're a girl, I was just going easy on you. Did you really think I was afraid of you?

245
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,320
If you have so much free time to do this, you might as well go plug the mouths of your classmates

246
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,240
It would prevent your baby Nan Xi from being unable to withstand the provocation and relapsing. Then he'd have no choice, but to confess

247
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,000
You treat me, Cheng Erluo, as a sick cat if I don't show my strength?

248
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,590
Enough. it's enough. Wait for me, Li Da

249
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,130
Don't be afraid

250
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,000
I think aside from being quiet all the time, he's pretty normal

251
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,840
He is indeed a master of IQ. He got first place in the grade just by taking the test once

252
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,070
- His grade was so impressive.
- Could it be that being too in love with studying can cause mental issues?

253
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,000
No way. No.

254
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,070
The tide cannot rise without the wind. Are you sure about it?

255
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,000
How about we stay away from Nan Xi?

256
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,400
Yes, yes. l just can't figure it out. He's already the first in the entire grade. Why doesn't he go to the elite class?

257
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,230
There must be an unspeakable reason for this

258
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,550
Is there any reason he can't let go of this class?

259
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,190
Disperse, disperse!

260
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,270
What are you doing? What are you doing? Disperse, disperse!

261
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:46,010
It would be so nice for you to take advantage of this early morning by doing vocabulary. Disperse, disperse, disperse!

262
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,770
Still watching?

263
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,770
Still gossiping? Read a book, hurry up!

264
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,450
Why are you whispering?

265
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,920
It's him. It's him

266
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,700
He looks pretty normal

267
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,750
People like him usually look like that

268
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,960
It's such a pity. He looks so handsome

269
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,200
You're too obsessed with beauty. Then you go see the doctor with him

270
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,960
You're the one obsessed with beauty!

271
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,800
The Little Mute is fighting!

272
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,000
It's him. An An is still crying even now

273
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,350
Why did he hit An An?

274
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,430
My mother said he's a little abnormal. She said not to play with him. Let's go

275
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,690
People like him usually look like that

276
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,970
It's such a pity. He looks so handsome

277
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,570
- You're too obsessed with beauty. Then you go see the doctor with him
- You're the one obsessed with beauty

278
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:18,150
When faced with decisions and challenges, ask yourself questions every day

279
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:25,310
Every moment gives you the courage to discover, what is important to you

280
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,830
and what a particular situation brings to you

281
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,760
You were the one who made me record it to help me correct my pronunciation

282
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,430
I've recorded it and you aren't listening. I'm still waiting for your comment

283
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,810
Sorry. l will listen right away

284
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,070
Teacher Nan Xi, I'm done the question booklet. Please check

285
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,150
Xia Rui

286
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,350
You copied the wrong question

287
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,270
I copied the wrong question? Impossible

288
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,230
Question 32

289
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,690
Look. "What made" is a past tense

290
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,210
That first in the grade looks pretty handsome, right?

291
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,570
Him? He is a mental patient. Such a pity

292
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,010
Students, what are you all looking at?

293
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,510
Curious about what the No.1 in the grade looks like?

294
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,300
Please. Come in and take a look

295
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,350
It's not suitable to be peeking and judging at the door

296
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,700
Is it any of your business?

297
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,870
Can't we take a look? Is the school run by your family?

298
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,780
No need to be noisy. The people with the loudest voices are the most guilty

299
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,070
We all paid tuition to go to school. Go back. Go back

300
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,210
As it is, like attracts like. People make friends with those like them

301
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,950
Hey, don't attack me personally

302
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,430
Someone heard Meng Shiran say that, Nan Xi is her mother's patient. How do you explain this?

303
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,280
What should I explain to you? Why shall I?

304
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,230
Stop quarreling. Stop quarreling! That's not what this is!

305
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,360
Then you call Meng Shiran out to explain to us

306
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,370
What are you shouting?

307
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,170
Can't you hear the class bell?

308
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,900
Mr. Hu

309
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,010
You go back first

310
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,600
Okay

311
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,090
What are you looking at? It's class time

312
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,190
Well. Let's see the next question

313
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,590
Passage one. Reading comprehension

314
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,190
The subject of this article is racial bias

315
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,590
There are a lot of new words,

316
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,290
so the difficulty is a bit high

317
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,790
But students, don't be discouraged

318
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,390
It doesn't matter if you do it wrong

319
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,390
Just take it as getting used to this question type

320
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,490
Come on. Let's take a look

321
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,390
What are...

322
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,690
How about this? Everyone, close the booklet

323
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,790
I'll say something off-topic

324
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,190
I remember last semester, l shared a full points composition with you

325
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,390
Everyone is biased against you, because they don't understand you

326
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,590
I will prove it to you

327
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,990
Look at you guys

328
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,690
When memorizing, you don't do it seriously and forget about it immediately after

329
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,190
I hope you can not only memorize these two sentences

330
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,990
you can also remember what they mean

331
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,590
because once you truly understand the meaning of these two sentences

332
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,090
it will be of great help to your future life

333
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,590
Rumor. The two sentences in this article are like this:

334
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,590
"It is easy for us to do something without careful thinking,

335
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,290
but it's hard to take back what we have done."

336
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,990
It means that some things you did inadvertently,

337
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,390
will easily hurt some people

338
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,190
Especially spreading rumors and sharing them all around

339
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,590
And once you do that, it will be difficult to take back

340
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,290
Mr. Hu. I want to say those sentences

341
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,590
Come on

342
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,090
- Read slowly. Don't be nervous.
- You're reading?

343
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,290
"It doesn't take much to us to spread a rumor.

344
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,790
But once you do, you can never completely

345
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,390
make up for the wrong behavior."

346
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,290
Good. Do l need to help you translate?

347
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,390
Let me translate it

348
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,590
It's not difficult to spread rumors

349
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,090
but once done, it's hard to undo it

350
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,790
Sir, I still have something to say

351
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,790
Go ahead!

352
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,290
There have been many rumors about Nan Xi recently

353
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,850
but as his classmates, not only did we not stand up for him at once

354
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,090
we even continued this gossiping and spread it around

355
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,990
We can't, just because—

356
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,390
We can't look at him through a lens filled with prejudice

357
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,190
just because his strength isn't self-expression, can we?

358
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,790
What l want to say is, isn't he right here?

359
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,990
Why do we let him sit here without getting to know him and believe in those rumors instead?

360
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,190
We also want to get to know him

361
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,690
but Nan Xi doesn't give us this chance

362
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,990
Exactly

363
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,290
He usually ignores us when we're talking to him

364
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,690
How can we know him when he's like this?

365
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,290
No, that's because—

366
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,590
l will work hard

367
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,490
I will work hard

368
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,990
to let you get to know me

369
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,790
Nan Xi, I hope you will say some words

370
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,190
personally in front of everyone. That is best

371
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,790
I know Meng Shiran's mother. It's true

372
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,590
When I was younger, I learned things much faster than anyone else

373
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,890
but I'm not good at speaking and communication

374
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,790
I have social anxiety disorder

375
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,990
I'm getting treated

376
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,990
and I have pretty much made a full recovery

377
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,190
This is why I am still here and studying with all of you

378
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,990
Exactly! Being a genius comes with its drawbacks!

379
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,990
Right! Everyone has been interacting with Nan Xi for a while

380
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,390
I believe you can all see, what kind of person he is, right?

381
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,190
Yes. Why would he come to study, if he hadn't recovered?

382
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,990
Enough, enough

383
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,790
Wise men don't spread rumors

384
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,690
You are all smart kids

385
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,790
Let me solve this matter

386
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,890
Nan Xi is a member of our Class Nine family

387
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,790
We should protect him

388
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,790
At the same time

389
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,190
we also need to look up to Nan Xi in studying. Shall we?

390
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,990
Okay!

391
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,990
Right, we will protect our Nan Xi together

392
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,990
Okay!

393
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,190
Enough. Enough. My head hurts again

394
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,990
Open the booklet and let's continue

395
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,190
Mr. Liu, wait a minute

396
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,590
Let's talk for a while

397
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,990
It's about Nan Xi in our class and Meng Shiran in your class

398
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,190
I think this matter caused a lot of trouble for Nan Xi

399
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,790
It's still necessary to call the child's parent—

400
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,390
Mr. Hu.

401
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,390
Wait for a while. I'm talking with Mr. Liu

402
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,990
I know you're talking about that, Mr. Hu

403
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,390
Can you not invite Nan Xi's mother to school?

404
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,390
How about this, Mr. Liu? Let's talk about it tomorrow

405
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,290
Goodbye, Mr. Liu

406
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,590
When did I say that, I would invite Nan Xi's parents to school?

407
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,790
Y-y-y-you didn't?

408
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,590
What do you mean? I can't even find them even if I want

409
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,190
Nan Xi's parents are both out of city

410
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,590
I just think Nan Xi doesn't want his mother to worry about him after finding out

411
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,590
So could you respect his wishes?

412
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,790
You are good. Now you've become the spokesperson for Nan Xi

413
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,590
Did he ask you to come here?

414
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,590
Of course not. l just think this is better for him, so...

415
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,790
Fine. I credit you for having a good heart

416
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,390
Rest assured. l won't tell Nan Xi's mother

417
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,390
I just told Mr. Liu,

418
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,390
we are looking for Meng Shiran's mother, Doctor Lin

419
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,390
Because this matter may have been caused by Meng Shiran's momentary mistake in speech

420
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,590
Therefore, we naturally need to find Doctor Lin to explain the exact situation

421
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,390
Only this way we can solve the problem, right?

422
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,890
You're right.

423
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,190
- Mr. Hu, you are so smart.
- Stop flattering me

424
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:53,190
- You need to have some confidence and trust in your Mr. Hu, okay?
- Okay

425
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,590
Okay. Go

426
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,490
Goodbye, Mr. Hu

427
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,990
Okay. No eavesdropping in the future!

428
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,190
- No problem. Goodbye, Mr. Hu.
- Goodbye

429
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,990
Mr. Hu is wise!

430
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,790
Nan Xi, how nice it is for you not to have a serious face

431
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,990
I won't vote for Cheng Erluo in this year's handsome selection. I will vote for you

432
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,490
Yes. So good. So handsome

433
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,790
What are you doing? What are you doing? Go. Go. Go

434
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,790
Go. Go. Go

435
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,490
You were the one who asked us to get to know Nan Xi more

436
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,590
Why are you driving everyone away now?

437
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,590
That's right

438
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,990
Rui means shut up

439
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,090
If you want to find Nan Xi, you need to ask me first

440
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,790
Xia Rui is too dominating

441
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:37,390
How is this called "Xia Rui is too dominating"? She's protecting our Nan Xi

442
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,390
Our Nan Xi can't adapt to such noise around his ears

443
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,190
- But you guys are too noisy. You are too—
- Cheng Erluo!

444
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,090
The loudest one is you!

445
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,490
Finally quiet. How nice it is like this

446
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,390
Xia Rui

447
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,490
Thank you

448
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,390
What for? Thank me for helping you to escape from everyone?

449
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,590
It doesn't matter. It's just a piece of cake

450
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,390
Thanks for...

451
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,990
everything you've done for me

452
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,390
Our adorable Nan Xi, you just took that step very bravely

453
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,190
That's a big step. So don't escape

454
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,690
With me here, even if the sky falls

455
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,990
I'll help you carry it!

456
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,490
But you have improved so greatly already

457
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,990
Even a language idiot like me, can speak English smoothly

458
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:45,390
So how can a tiny, tiny obstacle stop our genius Nan Xi?

459
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,190
Right?

460
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,390
Just smile. A smile

461
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,190
That's right!

462
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,190
Aren't you so adorable and bright like this?

463
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,790
Ignore the boring gossip

464
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,690
Laugh more every day. Be less heavily guarded

465
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,390
It's so simple, not hard at all, right?

466
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,690
Right

467
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,090
Watch me dance for you

468
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,090
Somatic developmental disorders?

469
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,990
A molecular heredity to nerve immunity?

470
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,890
Neuro-functional imaging?

471
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,790
Neurochemical central nervous system

472
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,990
Phylogenetic disorders...

473
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,590
What is this?

474
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,190
[Please help me to translate.]

475
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,790
[Chinese to Chinese?]

476
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,990
[Are you looking for a fight?]

477
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,020
[The basic idea in this article is that, when facing someone with a social phobia]

478
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,390
[guding them to a context that will expose their fear or anxiety]

479
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,590
[where they use feelings of relaxation to combat the situation, they should establish a conditioned reflex]

480
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,990
[to achieve the goal of replacing the feelings of fear or anxiety with relaxation]

481
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,990
[l seem to understand a little bit now]

482
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,190
[It just means that, if Nan Xi fears crowd]

483
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,290
[we need to try our best to make him stay in the crowd more]

484
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,390
[As long as we can make him feel relaxed]

485
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,990
[he will slowly start to lose fear]

486
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,890
[This is the information you asked me to find today. l sent it]

487
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,190
[If we establish a conditioned reflex between his fear and relaxation, like the simple knee-jerking reflex]

488
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,790
[he will gradually get better]

489
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,990
I have a plan now

490
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,290
Morning, Godly Nan!

491
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,190
Brother came to pick you up to school. Surprised?

492
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,590
Are you planting beans outside your home?

493
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,090
Don't be like this

494
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,990
Rui ordered me to do this. I didn't dare to say no

495
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,590
Godly Nan, have you actually considered playing basketball?

496
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,890
With a mind like this, you must be a pretty good basketball player

497
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,690
Have you considered it before?

498
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,790
Maybe it can cure your problem of not talking to people

499
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,890
and also cure your problem of being uncomfortable with physical contact

500
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,590
Right? It's a great thing

501
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,090
Godly Nan. Godly Nan?

502
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,790
Rui?

503
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,990
Rui? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

504
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,990
Exactly. Why are you laughing like some shallow fangirl?

505
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,890
Look at it. My plan is working

506
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,790
Do you dare to disturb my Nan Xi—

507
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,990
I was the one who made them do it

508
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,990
It's the same as you picking him

509
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,390
It's called...

510
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,690
- Conditioned reflex?
- That's it!

511
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,590
How about it? It works, doesn't it?

512
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,190
But Rui, don't blame me for giving you a wake-up call

513
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,590
Take a careful look at Nan Xi

514
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,390
Don't you see anything strange about him?

515
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,090
Strange?

516
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,590
Isn't he sitting here fine?

517
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,190
That's the problem!

518
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,690
Take a closer look!

519
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,190
What is Nan Xi wearing in his ears?

520
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,790
Ears?

521
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,190
He used this trick against me this morning

522
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,190
People from where love to shut off their phone?

523
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,990
"Sorry. The number you dialed can't be reached."

524
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,390
One more. How come out of 800 Spartan warriors,

525
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,690
- Restrain your sadness.
- Only remained 300?

526
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,390
Because Wu Bai went to sing, you know?
(T/N: Wu Bai is 500, and it is also the name of a singer)

527
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,290
Nan Xi!

528
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,290
Have some candy

529
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,880
Do you know whom I just saw? Who I just saw?

530
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,790
Who?

531
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,790
Meng Shiran.... Meng Shiran's mother came to school

532
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,590
Mr. Hu really found Doctor Lin?

533
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,190
Rui, you already knew about it?

534
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,290
Go.Take a look!

535
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,590
- What's going on? What did they say?
- Can't hear?

536
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,290
- Can't hear?
- I can't hear

537
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,590
What are they saying?

538
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,790
Will Nan Xi be fine?

539
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,090
What on earth?

540
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,290
Xia Rui

541
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,490
Can I talk with you?

542
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,290
So what you're saying is, Nan Xi has already spoken in public?

543
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,590
This is a huge step forward for him

544
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,190
More than that, more than that

545
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,090
Not only did he do it once in English class two days ago

546
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,590
he also publicly rejected Yang Yufei's invitation in front of many strangers

547
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,990
There were a lot of people around him then

548
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,990
It can also be called a public place

549
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,990
That's right. It's an unprecedented attempt for him

550
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,490
It means that during some specific situations, his desire

551
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,990
to express himself is stronger, than that of his fear of the situation

552
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,690
If we continue to guide him,

553
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,590
he will express more and more in the future

554
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,990
Really? That's great

555
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,990
Does that mean, l have to thank Yang Yufei for stimulating Nan Xi?

556
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,790
Right, Cheng Erluo. Do you remember, when Xia Rui and Liu Bin had that street fighter game?

557
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,990
Of course, l remember

558
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,690
Rui, you don't know know happened that day

559
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,990
Nan Xi thought you were going to fight the three male classmates

560
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,990
He was so scared, that he ran out of the building in a flash

561
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,390
School just got out at the time and there were so many people out on the streets

562
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,590
Nan Xi jumped into the crowd without thinking

563
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,390
He ran like a gust of wind. Dear Shu and I were shocked

564
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,890
Right, isn't Nan Xi most afraid of strangers?

565
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,790
He will instinctively move away when others touch him

566
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,690
But he got into physical contact with lots of people on the way over there

567
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,190
He did not get afraid or back away. Instead, he was wholeheartedly rushing toward you

568
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,990
- Was he so anxious that day?
- Yes

569
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,590
I wouldn't have been able to tell at all

570
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,080
Xia Rui

571
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,260
It's good that you are here

572
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,190
You would have missed the scene if you hadn't come

573
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,290
Did he bully you?

574
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,090
Promise me that, you will not fight with anyone in the future

575
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,430
This shows that in Nan Xi's eyes,

576
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,090
you are a special and important friend

577
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,090
Nan Xi told me some things about when you were young

578
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,290
He was a special child since a young age

579
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,390
He was not accepted by peers

580
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,890
He could only entrap himself in his own little world

581
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,690
If he ever stepped out of it

582
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,990
it is because of your existence, Xia Rui

583
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,290
A friend, who is genuinely good to him

584
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,790
would be the best medicine to cure him
