1
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:50,059
Stopping staring at me

2
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:51,293
Or I'll punch you

3
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:13,420
Why are you punished to stand here?

4
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:15,852
Because of being complained by children?

5
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:18,751
What's the reason?

6
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:22,374
The game is boring

7
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,287
I think the same way

8
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,595
These adults only like obedient children

9
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:28,866
but us

10
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,071
They don't hear us at all

11
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:33,612
But don't be afraid

12
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,810
My dad said that

13
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,219
we need to be brave baby whales

14
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:39,126
even nobody would hear us

15
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,989
Didn't your dad tell you

16
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:44,121
the story of the lost baby whale?

17
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:47,991
Poor thing. Let me tell you

18
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:56,083
Once upon a time,

19
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,223
there was a whale named Xiaohui

20
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,122
He especially liked singing since he was a child

21
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,503
Because of the frequency of its sound

22
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,066
was different from other whales,

23
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,019
he got lost one day

24
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,205
He swam alone...

25
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:23,961
I can't believe. I can't believe

26
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,512
Xiaomutou

27
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,423
changes to be

28
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,749
my kind helper

29
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,354
Actually, it's a pity

30
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:37,347
of two scores short

31
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,050
Actually, it's not that I don't want a tutorship

32
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,332
You just haven't been

33
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,483
the stressful

34
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,477
cram school

35
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,554
But tutors my mother likes

36
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,132
is either the retired practiced lecturer

37
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:51,031
or the excellent class teacher who quit his job

38
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,633
They're both strict

39
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,077
They're both the incarnation

40
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:55,600
of severity

41
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:57,926
I really can't stand it

42
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,062
I can help you

43
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,388
You help me?

44
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:03,124
Hmmm

45
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,675
You help me with tutoring?

46
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,681
Sure

47
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:08,322
Do you know

48
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,818
the key points you combed

49
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,171
is suitable for me

50
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,512
I seemed to fail in the last exam

51
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,265
It was already my highest score ever

52
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,200
Listen

53
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:19,597
But my mother may not agree

54
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:21,825
She just likes the combination of those two abnormal tutors

55
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:24,676
What a bore!

56
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,278
Forget about me

57
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,230
How do you do?

58
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,067
I heard a little bit about

59
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:34,930
that you dropped out of No.1 Experimental High School

60
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:37,849
Is it true?

61
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:41,991
Don't be afraid

62
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:43,902
You're now in Chenghua School

63
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,587
Rui is by your side

64
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:46,964
and nobody dares to bully you

65
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:50,916
Right, Xiaomutou

66
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:51,972
Yeah. Yeah!

67
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,633
I protect you

68
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:54,488
OK. OK

69
00:05:57,538 --> 00:05:58,143
What are you laughing at?

70
00:05:58,511 --> 00:05:59,164
Don't you believe it?

71
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:00,113
No

72
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:02,392
You’re the same as

73
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,133
when you were a child

74
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,047
Oh

75
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:16,408
Do you feel hurt?

76
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,075
That's too much

77
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:20,858
Wait here

78
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,113
I'll help you get your toys back

79
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:37,865
Xiaomutou, listen

80
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,274
Rui in Chenghua School

81
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,161
three times better than

82
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,558
Xiaolingdang in Xin Hua Kindergarten

83
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,967
Although I can't be in charge,

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,902
it's easy for me

85
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,563
to protect you

86
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,821
It's really easy

87
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,281
There's no problem

88
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:56,687
But I have to think about how...

89
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,164
What are you doing?

90
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:04,887
Don't you believe it again? You...

91
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:39,423
It's not good to touch a hat

92
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,186
You're taller than me

93
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,125
I won't always touch your head

94
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:26,217
Nan Xi

95
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:28,603
It's my house ahead

96
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:30,798
I live with my grandparents now

97
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,222
And my house is very close to the school

98
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,492
Come and play with me if you have spare time

99
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:34,311
Hmmm

100
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,334
Many years have passed

101
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,482
and I also made a lot of new good friends

102
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,556
But I still think of you from time to time

103
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,179
When my dad died,

104
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:47,912
you were the one who was always by my side

105
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:50,095
Because of the sudden job transfer of my mother...

106
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:50,594
Xia Rui

107
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,619
Don't suddenly disappear

108
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,598
I won't suddenly disappear

109
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:02,960
In the future,

110
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:06,793
we'll be together and we won't be afraid of anything

111
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:15,979
Don't get emotional

112
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,249
Don't get emotional

113
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:21,035
It's enough to make me cry once or twice a night

114
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,684
If I cry every day,

115
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:23,895
I'll lose ground

116
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,414
I don't want face, okay?

117
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,313
Keep this a secret, okay?

118
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,108
Got it

119
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,306
I have to deal with my mother when I go back

120
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,133
See you tomorrow

121
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:36,617
About tutoring

122
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:37,554
I got it

123
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,691
Believe me

124
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:41,317
Got it

125
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:45,280
Nan Xi

126
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:45,862
I feel like

127
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,437
you look better without a hat

128
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,328
I feel like he's glowing

129
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:48,441
Nan Xi is so handsome

130
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,351
Look at these girls in our class

131
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,366
Let alone the girls

132
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:54,386
I'm a little throbbing to see him

133
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,901
even I'm a boy

134
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:57,899
Don't be nauseating, okay?

135
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:02,765
Oh, my god

136
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,503
Maybe he's the last perfect man in the world

137
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,114
You've never seen a handsome guy? Sit down

138
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:11,702
Rui

139
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,327
The one who was ahead of you

140
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,585
was Nan Xi

141
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:15,903
You speak for him!

142
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,552
Tell me about it

143
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:18,763
Last night, you met each other face to face

144
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,590
Did you lose because of Nan Xi's handsome face?

145
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,026
I'm not that vulgar

146
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,878
The wrong problem collection I said yesterday.

147
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,531
Give me

148
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:39,626
Is there a secret between them?

149
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:42,973
Ask her

150
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,685
Ask her

151
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,830
Come on. What's going on? What's the truth?

152
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:48,539
After school, in Bird Tea Coffee

153
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,224
I have something important to announce

154
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:53,595
You sure?

155
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:55,945
Hmmm

156
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,338
This is what Xia Rui said?

157
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:04,964
Hmmm

158
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,924
Mr. Hu

159
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,143
Can you talk to Xia Rui's mother?

160
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,988
Did you really know Xia Rui from an early age?

161
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:25,151
Hmmm

162
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:29,412
No wonder

163
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:33,482
Okay

164
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:34,657
I'll take care of it

165
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:35,429
I'll handle it

166
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:38,609
You can go back

167
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,812
Can you imagine how funny

168
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,000
Peng was?

169
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,195
I really don't know about...

170
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:54,880
About... What did he say?

171
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:03,092
Dear Shu

172
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:04,730
Who am I?

173
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,154
Where am I?

174
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,824
If I'm dizzy, please tell me

175
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,186
I may be dizzy, too

176
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,853
Rui touched Nan Xi's head

177
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,241
just now!

178
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,475
My God

179
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:44,084
It's totally an idol drama

180
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,335
They played by themselves

181
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,902
But according to you,

182
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:50,852
you and Nan Xi have known each other since childhood

183
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:52,452
Why didn't you recognize him at the beginning?

184
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:55,702
You... You... You can't blame me

185
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,171
He was this tall at that time

186
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,307
But he's so tall now

187
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:01,921
He was a shota at that time

188
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,915
but now he's a hunk

189
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,312
No one can recognize

190
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,448
I can't believe it

191
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,181
Nan Xi is Prince Charming outside

192
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:12,400
In fact, he has strong sexual desire inside

193
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,207
What did you say?

194
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,403
But Nan Xi is really impressive

195
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:17,907
His summary of the month's exam is really amazing

196
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:18,987
Sure enough

197
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:22,820
Since you're a friend of Rui,

198
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,280
you're a friend of me Cheng Erluo

199
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:25,953
Hello, I'm Cheng Erluo

200
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,528
Hello, I'm Xia Rui

201
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:34,545
By the way,

202
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm on duty this week

203
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:36,836
I take the class key

204
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,782
Do you want to make an appointment together?

205
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:39,364
EVA (Evangelion)!

206
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:40,693
Yeah! Yeah!

207
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,343
We haven’t seen the new theater version yet

208
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:42,995
I'll download

209
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,313
Nan Xi, join us

210
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,288
I don't watch cartoons very much

211
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:50,086
Nan Xi

212
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:51,991
It's unfair for you to

213
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:52,798
sort EVA as animation

214
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:54,226
simply and rudely

215
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:55,442
Let me tell you something

216
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:56,130
See it?

217
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:01,141
You don't have to be so cruel to refuse me

218
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,639
Well, in that case,

219
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,921
let's go to have skewers

220
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:07,763
We haven't gone to for a long time

221
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:08,428
It's my treat

222
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,081
OK! OK!

223
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,038
There’s such a long line outside

224
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,486
It must take a long time to wait

225
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,563
My grandma made chicken soup today

226
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,275
We'll go back to drink chicken soup

227
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,975
It's a little strange

228
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,843
Tell me about it

229
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:32,840
Don't you go to have skewers?

230
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,205
Let's go. Hurry up! Or we'll line up

231
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,325
What's the matter?

232
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,488
What are you mumbling about?

233
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:49,585
Dear Shu, don't you think it's strange?

234
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,291
You mean Nan Xi?

235
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:53,965
To be precise,

236
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:56,065
it's the relationship between Nan Xi and Rui

237
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:57,525
With the words of Rui,

238
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,068
the revolutionary friendship between them

239
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,860
started from kindergarten

240
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,011
We were bound to each other at that time

241
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,708
So many years have passed since then,

242
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:04,764
did Rui mention it?

243
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:08,123
Maybe the experience between them

244
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,342
is the secret garden in her heart

245
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,158
I can't believe

246
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:15,160
The three of us grow up together since elementary school,

247
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,941
how can there show up

248
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,531
a fourth person suddenly

249
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,177
Didn't you always say before

250
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,601
that Rui and I

251
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:24,251
killed your masculinity?

252
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:24,465
I...

253
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:25,675
Now Nan Xi shows up

254
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:26,589
Isn't this quite good?

255
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,437
And I think Nan Xi is a good,

256
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:30,683
smart

257
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,202
and handsome guy

258
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:33,888
Anyway, I don't recommend playing with him

259
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,558
How shallow you are

260
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,626
He won't play with you

261
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,181
even you want to

262
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:47,085
What's the matter?

263
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,129
Dear Shu

264
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:49,957
Tell me your schedule

265
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:51,416
What are you talking about?

266
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,873
Who is the secret garden in your heart?

267
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,784
Who is the man hiding

268
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:56,852
in the garden?

269
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:00,400
You wanted to ask me the same question

270
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,777
but I asked first, right?

271
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:04,162
What a bore!

272
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,322
I'm kidding you. Don't be angry

273
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,628
Whatever you want to eat is on me

274
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:08,316
You should do that

275
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:13,063
Actually, you don't have to send me back every time

276
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,006
Don't you like it?

277
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:20,813
I'm afraid your parents will be worried if you come back too late

278
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:22,997
They won't

279
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,444
They're busy at work

280
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,471
That's what adults do

281
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:30,426
My mother and Uncle Chen do the same thing

282
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,648
They're very busy every day

283
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,583
Fortunately, I live with my grandparents

284
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,099
But they are the other extreme

285
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:38,080
They're much too talkative

286
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:41,748
I'm almost home

287
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:43,148
Do you want to go to my house for dinner?

288
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,442
It's time for dinner now

289
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:45,759
It's not a big deal at all

290
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:47,219
No, thanks

291
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,177
The aunt in my house must have prepared the dinner

292
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:50,767
Alright

293
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:51,657
Next time

294
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:52,808
Hmmm

295
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,363
Good

296
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,270
Tell me who is Nan Xi

297
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,301
Such a brat

298
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:11,619
Why do you come to my house?

299
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,040
There's no difference, okay?

300
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,556
Your grandpa Xia is mine too

301
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,894
My grandpa's house is mine too

302
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,092
Right, Grandpa Xia?

303
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:21,742
Haohao, come here. Here. Here

304
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,934
Grandpa, this is a tasting candy

305
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:27,149
I'm the real grandson, right?

306
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,329
If you like the feeling of being a "grandson", just do it

307
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:29,800
I don't argue with you for that

308
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:31,070
Stand up

309
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,376
Watch your mouth

310
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:33,906
Don't be outspoken without thinking

311
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,695
Haohao

312
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,208
When are you so close to grandpa?

313
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,386
Thank you

314
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,151
What made Madam Shao come here?

315
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,406
What are you talking about?

316
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,160
Your mother bought me and your grandma a massage device

317
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,702
Your grandma is enjoying it

318
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,922
Nobody came for you expressly, okay?

319
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:53,714
I know what's going on

320
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:55,150
My position at home

321
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,360
is below the massage device

322
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,114
How can you talk to grandpa like that?

323
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,279
Go ahead, Madam Shao, what are you doing here?

324
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,018
Mr. Hu called me today,

325
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,700
saying about the tutorship

326
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:12,370
So, I stopped by to ask you after work

327
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,693
I knew you came here today with other motives

328
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,755
What a Greek gift!

329
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,573
Who is the giver? Who is the receiver?

330
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:24,795
Then I don't know

331
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:26,789
This is what I just learned today

332
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:27,466
But

333
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,009
The teacher asked us to learn and use it

334
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,682
That's called

335
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,589
Never go to the temple for nothing

336
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:34,337
I have never learned that

337
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:35,227
Learn it right now

338
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:35,833
OK

339
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,037
Why did I give birth to you two little

340
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:40,295
naive things?

341
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,543
Since he and I are half-brothers,

342
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,454
I have the same gene with you

343
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:50,394
All right

344
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,174
I tell you something seriously

345
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:54,595
Mr. Hu told me

346
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,008
you made great progress

347
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,479
this time

348
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,894
Failure is related to the difficulty of the test paper

349
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,208
So he suggested me

350
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:08,006
not let you to go to cram school for the time being

351
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,466
But

352
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:12,005
he's found a classmate

353
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,513
for you

354
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:14,925
He can conduct one-on-one tutoring for you

355
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:18,189
He got the first place in the grammar exam

356
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:20,550
Nan Xi

357
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,452
Yeah, this is him

358
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:23,933
Sister, what's going on?

359
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:26,852
I made a deal with Mr. Hu that

360
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,193
we'll give you a time range of one semester

361
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,617
If you can't score above one hundred

362
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,086
by the end of the semester,

363
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:33,154
then lady,

364
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:35,800
you have to go to cram school honestly

365
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,918
Why is my life

366
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,449
only about grades

367
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,897
cram school and study?

368
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:46,719
It's time for dinner. Where are you going?

369
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,036
I’m going to study

370
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:49,401
Call me for dinner

371
00:20:58,171 --> 00:20:59,785
Nan Xi, are you home yet?

372
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:03,452
I just arrived

373
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:04,948
He asked

374
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:06,395
Mr. Hu about tutoring, right?

375
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,060
Thank you

376
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,493
It's not easy for you to accept tutoring

377
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:10,905
I'm very strict

378
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:12,697
Are you ready?

379
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,074
Hey, Xiaomutou

380
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,106
You think you're taller than me

381
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:16,139
and dare to scare me, don't you?

382
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:18,833
Let's start this weekend

383
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:21,622
No problem at all

384
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:22,417
I'm not afraid

385
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:28,956
This kind of

386
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,306
mixed Chinese and English expressions based on Chinese grammar

387
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,573
is not conducive to improving your level grammar

388
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:43,969
Good

389
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,186
The latest theatrical version of EVA

390
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,053
I've downloaded

391
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:01,284
Let's spare every minute to watch it

392
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:03,551
Chubby, you're efficient

393
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:05,105
Absolutely

394
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,147
OK, on Saturday

395
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:07,645
Okay, okay!

396
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:09,920
But I have to ask...

397
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,529
Do you know that?

398
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:12,357
There was a girl in Grade Twelve

399
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,650
fainted when she entered the school just now

400
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:15,466
Mr. Hu took her to the hospital

401
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:17,638
I heard it was because of acute appendicitis

402
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:18,860
and she has to have a surgery

403
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:19,952
It's so serious

404
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:21,752
It seems that Mr. Hu

405
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:22,693
can't come back soon

406
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,343
Then the first Grammar class

407
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,135
will be changed as free activity class

408
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,763
This year is really stressful

409
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:32,354
She fainted in pain because of appendicitis

410
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:33,374
But she insisted on coming to school

411
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:37,576
Anyway, it's the last year

412
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,739
for us to be happy

413
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:39,652
Let's enjoy ourselves in time

414
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,765
Cheng Erluo, did you bring basketball?

415
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:43,628
Sure. Let's play together

416
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:44,305
OK

417
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:49,823
See it?

418
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,461
Mr. Hu said in the group chat

419
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,748
that he can't get back to school in time

420
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,422
due to a temporary situation

421
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,632
and let Nan Xi tell the

422
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,745
answers and

423
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,587
analyses of cloze

424
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,513
Write down any doubts and questions

425
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:03,127
and hand in to Nan Xi

426
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,420
And Mr. Hu will analyze one by one

427
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:05,738
The rest of the time is for self-study

428
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,091
And subject representatives should keep an eye on members

429
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,962
Rui, we'll play basketball

430
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:15,030
Mr. Hu just said

431
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,980
it's self-study time

432
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:17,368
Why do you play basketball in the morning?

433
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,401
Sit down! Sit down!

434
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:19,303
Come back. Come back!

435
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:20,636
Rui

436
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:22,827
Aren't you feeling well?

437
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,477
How can you change mind suddenly?

438
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,388
Listen, chubby

439
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:27,385
I'm a subject representative

440
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:28,346
I have to fulfill

441
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:30,328
my own responsibility, right?

442
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:31,621
Just cooperate, okay?

443
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:32,939
Rui, the answer is...

444
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:33,746
Get seated

445
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:35,205
Sit down

446
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,193
Nan Xi, I can't understand question 42

447
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,546
Can you analyze for us?

448
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,196
Yeah! Yeah!

449
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:45,056
Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet.

450
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,026
Didn't Mr. Hu say

451
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:47,975
it's self-study time?

452
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:49,019
Write down the doubts and questions

453
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:50,372
And hand in to subject representatives

454
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:52,046
Mr. Hu will analyze one by one

455
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:53,672
Come on. Write down your doubts and questions

456
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,665
Anyone who has doubts and questions, write down over here

457
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:57,635
It's self-study time. Be quiet

458
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:58,419
Be quiet!

459
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,329
Don't let the students in other classes

460
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:01,587
think we're noisy even in self-study time

461
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:02,869
Mr. Hu will be embarrassed

462
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:03,676
Be quiet

463
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:35,992
I wrote down all doubts and questions

464
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,461
But you may have to copy it again

465
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:39,968
My handwriting is too untidy

466
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:41,000
Mr. Hu may not read it smoothly

467
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,315
Thanks

468
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,486
Stop being so polite to me

469
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:46,376
After school,

470
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:47,326
let's buy reference books

471
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:48,358
Today?

472
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:49,237
Hmmm

473
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,812
Chubby Cheng, tell Mr. Yi

474
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,666
I'm not going there

475
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,268
I'll pay a visit another day

476
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:56,784
Chubby Cheng

477
00:24:58,482 --> 00:24:59,395
Cheng Erluo

478
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:02,505
Chubby

479
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:03,786
It's alright

480
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:04,653
Go

481
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:06,053
We'll tell Mr. Yi

482
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:13,767
Mr. Yi,

483
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,441
Mr. Yi,

484
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:15,903
Here you are

485
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:16,271
Hmmm

486
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:23,962
Don't look around, Mr. Yi

487
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:27,118
Shu and I have been completely abandoned

488
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,542
Mr. Yi, Xia Rui let us tell you

489
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:31,391
that she can't learn coffee today

490
00:25:34,085 --> 00:25:35,604
Is it because of that Nan Xi?

491
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:36,269
Mr. Yi,

492
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,396
Think about it

493
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:39,081
We all started to know each other at the age of ten

494
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,826
It's been at least seven years

495
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:42,535
We call her Rui

496
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:43,330
because

497
00:25:43,615 --> 00:25:45,134
she's brave, generous

498
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:45,893
upright and forthright

499
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:47,092
But she

500
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,540
put on airs for Nan Xi

501
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:50,403
in the name of subject representative

502
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,697
She tried not to make Mr. Hu embarrassed

503
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,714
But she forgot me, Cheng Erluo

504
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:55,791
Okay, okay, don't be angry. It's okay

505
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,295
Mr. Hu was absent from class today

506
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,455
So he let Nan Xi tell the answers and analyses

507
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:01,488
At first,

508
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:03,363
Rui promised Cheng Erluo to go to see he play basketball

509
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,178
But she was afraid that Nan Xi couldn't handle alone

510
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:06,258
So she didn't go with him

511
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:07,564
And then Cheng Erluo didn't go

512
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:09,285
But

513
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,056
Rui

514
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:11,812
really put on airs of being class leader

515
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:13,474
She was rash and too much in haste

516
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:14,726
We'd been noisy

517
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:15,741
in self-study time before that

518
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:16,880
So

519
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:19,135
Xia Rui is brave and generous

520
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,820
and abide by the school rules and regulations

521
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:23,039
She deserves praise

522
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,419
Yes

523
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:25,484
But except that she's

524
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,561
only generous to Nan Xi alone

525
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:31,133
Maybe Nan Xi still doesn't know us very well

526
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:32,296
and he needs more time to deal with this

527
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:33,792
Do you feel any sense of friendship

528
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,014
from him?

529
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:36,224
No

530
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:39,725
When we watch EVA tomorrow,

531
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,945
I think it’s necessary to talk to Rui

532
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:06,689
Did Xia Rui tell you when he come?

533
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:08,517
Maybe she'll be here soon

534
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:09,953
Eat some French fries first

535
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:14,878
Who?

536
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,266
Who?

537
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,373
Hello, aunt

538
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:21,275
Is Nan Xi home?

539
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:22,188
Nan Xi

540
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,731
Yeah. Is he home?

541
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,025
Yes, but please stay here

542
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,295
Xia Rui, come on in

543
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:31,208
Please be seated

544
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:32,122
Oh

545
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:40,097
Have you brought your textbook?

546
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,241
Yeah

547
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:42,399
Yeah

548
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:05,707
I was in a hurry to go out

549
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,132
I forgot my textbook

550
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:07,974
It's alright

551
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,505
I just came to get familiar with the road

552
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:10,858
Go on what you were doing

553
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:11,997
and I'm watching by your side

554
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,558
Use mine?

555
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,726
What about you do if I use yours?

556
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,287
I finished

557
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:23,450
You did?

558
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,028
Why did you let come over?

559
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:27,437
Are you trying to supervise me?

560
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,471
It's two o'clock. Why hasn't Rui come yet?

561
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:46,272
I don't know either

562
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:56,074
Rui

563
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:58,021
The first horn is already in combat

564
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,189
How dumb I am!

565
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,868
I'm going to Nan Xi's house today

566
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:06,328
It’s the first day of English grammar tutoring

567
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:08,298
I forgot to tell you

568
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:10,446
Oh...

569
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:12,226
It's on me this time

570
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:13,425
You guys watch first, huh

571
00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:14,659
I'll treat you with pizza next week

572
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,436
Look. Look!

573
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:22,572
Then we...

574
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:24,070
Nan Xi is a hypocrite

575
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,634
Let's go, Dear Shu

576
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,343
I want to check what magic

577
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,399
does he spell on Xia Rui

578
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,069
What about these things?

579
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,493
Take what we can take

580
00:29:33,683 --> 00:29:34,573
And we can put them in order

581
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,689
when we come back

582
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:40,567
Which question?

583
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:51,995
Which one?

584
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:53,824
This

585
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:55,876
About this question,

586
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,146
you have to understand the author

587
00:29:57,822 --> 00:29:59,199
and Paspa's thoughts

588
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,035
You don't know, do you?

589
00:30:06,664 --> 00:30:08,040
When I overuse my brain,

590
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,571
I need to eat a snack

591
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:13,832
Your brain

592
00:30:14,675 --> 00:30:16,324
will operate smoothly

593
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:17,926
with the sound of rattling,

594
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:20,098
thus you can learn quickly and remember more

595
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:23,374
Good

596
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:25,344
Am I right?

597
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,073
As long as you're happy

598
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:28,868
Have one

599
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:29,747
No

600
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:33,556
Then I can only learn fast by myself

601
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:42,457
This is a true or false question

602
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,935
Do you know the direction?

603
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,157
This way, this way

604
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,263
Cheng Erluo

605
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:53,082
Think about it

606
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:55,171
You find Nan Xi's house

607
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:57,093
Mr. Hu will kill you if he knows

608
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,805
Don't be afraid

609
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,859
I'll explain by that I try to let Nan Xi

610
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:00,879
participate in sports activities

611
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:02,553
Speaking of which,

612
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,131
you haven't trained in days, have you?

613
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:06,184
The basketball team is about to compete

614
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:06,931
It's okay

615
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,166
When we get this done, I'll go back for training

616
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,486
Don't move my pillow. You're annoying

617
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,293
I'll sleep for a while

618
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:41,503
It should be here!

619
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:49,561
What are you two doing here?

620
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:52,528
Who is it?

621
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:02,912
Xia Rui

622
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,821
Don't tell me

623
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:05,879
you stood us up

624
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,018
because you want to do homework with Nan Xi

625
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,181
Don't try to explain

626
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,807
You’re really doing your homework

627
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:10,721
You...

628
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,946
Cheng Erluo, I'm telling you

629
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:17,035
We're both upright person

630
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:19,088
But you have to tell me

631
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,417
how do you know the address of Nan Xi?

632
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:20,892
And

633
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:22,791
What are you doing sneaking around outside?

634
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,678
Okay, then I'll be straight with you

635
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,351
You and Nan Xi meet again after a long separation

636
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,621
We are all happy for you

637
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:28,748
But you abandon the old friends for the new ones

638
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:29,793
Isn't this a little inappropriate?

639
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,846
Who did that?

640
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,056
Just tell me

641
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:34,350
how many times did you

642
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,299
stand us up after you get along well with Nan Xi?

643
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:36,059
How many times?

644
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:37,329
Isn't it just once?

645
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:39,192
And didn't I already apologize?

646
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:39,868
I'm really sorry

647
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,364
Will I make it up to you later?

648
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:42,598
What about Mr. Yi?

649
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:43,903
How can you mind

650
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,363
Mr. Yi's business?

651
00:33:47,523 --> 00:33:49,635
Okay, leave it alone

652
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,605
Tell me the truth today

653
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:52,282
Take an option

654
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:58,299
For... For... For what?

655
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:00,910
Luoluo's

656
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,370
"either-or happiness" game

657
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,170
Cheng Erluo, you're being childish

658
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:06,808
Are you still a primary school student?

659
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,596
The year of the third grade,

660
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:15,673
the kid Cheng Erluo

661
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,884
transferred to our class

662
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,177
and became Yishu's deskmate

663
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:19,590
He was

664
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,860
a chubby boy at that time

665
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,189
I wasn't chubby

666
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:23,767
How dare you talk back?

667
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,200
At that time,

668
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,746
he was bullied

669
00:34:26,746 --> 00:34:28,538
by one of my good friends

670
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,413
Yishu couldn't stand it

671
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:31,481
and ran to tell me

672
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:32,597
So I helped him out

673
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:33,427
At the same time,

674
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:34,727
I saw through

675
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:35,718
the oppressive side of my friend

676
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,661
Cheng Erluo, I didn't expect that

677
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:41,296
we three became the best friends

678
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,752
I know Nan Xi well

679
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:44,690
Stop being childish

680
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,699
Can you be a little bit mature?

681
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,004
Do I have to take an option if you want me to?

682
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,966
Then don't we know

683
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,580
if you know?

684
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:55,513
All right

685
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:56,665
Sorry for bothering you

686
00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:57,863
Yishu, let's go

687
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:01,020
Why does he be childish again?

688
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,314
I'll go and see if he's angry

689
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:03,483
Anyway, I have to rehearse later

690
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:04,106
and he has to go for training

691
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,423
I'll see you next week. Bye

692
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:06,028
Bye

693
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:12,057
Childish!
