00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,290
Nan Xi, you really have natural-born talent in design!

2
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,690
The little bell you gave me before, the things in the gift box

3
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,530
and the various works in this studio of yours have all been designed so uniquely!

4
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,890
Do you want be a designer in the future?

5
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,370
I don't know. I haven't decided yet

6
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,050
You don't know?

7
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen. Let me grandly introduce tonight's

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,950
most dazzling, most unique independent designer, Mr. Nan Xi!

9
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,690
Everyone, give a round of applause!

10
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,050
Xia Rui, do you like it?

11
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,190
Of course, I do. The word "designer" sounds so cool!

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,750
When that time comes, I'll stand by your side and be your assistant. What an honor!

13
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,290
You can, too

14
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,950
- Me?
- Yes

15
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,230
A designer?

16
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,590
No. Do what you like

17
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,270
The level of difficulty for this is very high

18
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,090
It's okay. I will accompany you in gradually finding it

19
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,550
Then your whole life may be wasted on me

20
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,010
My whole life? I'm not opposed to it

21
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,930
Right. There's an old saying that goes, "Good brothers for a lifetime"

22
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,170
A lifetime

[You've got me now, so what's there to fear?]

24
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,830
Let me grandly introduce tonight's most dazzling, most unique

25
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,410
independent designer, Mr. Nan Xi

26
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,270
Do you like it?

27
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,730
Of course, I do. The word "designer" sounds so cool!

28
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,750
When that time comes, I'll stand by your side and be your assistant. What an honor!

29
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,590
Did you finish reading the previous book?

30
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,550
- I did. I'm going to go read some other books later.
- Okay

31
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,770
This book is unavailable. I'll inform you once it's available

32
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,470
Thanks, teacher

33
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,130
Nan Xi, are you here to borrow books?

34
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,990
Yes

35
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,830
Congratulations. You got the first place in our grade

36
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,970
Yes. On your first monthly exam, you ended our Yufei's history of domination of the first place ranking

37
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,530
When you come to Class One in the future, I will need to learn lots from you

38
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,350
If you keep learning, aren't you making it impossible for us to keep living?

39
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,290
Why is that person so impolite?

Okay. Today's homework is a full text recitation

42
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,210
We'll have a spot check next class. Well, the lesson is over!

43
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,070
- Stand up!
- Goodbye, teacher

44
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,150
All right. Goodbye, students

45
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,970
I desperately need a glass of iced coke to refresh my energy. A refresher

46
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,530
What's going on?

47
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,310
Nan Xi, what are you looking at?

48
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,050
Nothing

49
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,930
Nan Xi, the uncle at the reception office and I have a good relationship. We chat sometimes

50
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,670
If you have anything you need my help with,  you can tell me

I want to ask you for a favor

No problem. What?

54
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,130
Uncle. Uncle

55
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,890
You've come, Kid?

56
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,390
- Uncle.
- What's the matter? Tell me

57
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,190
I've always wanted to tell you something

58
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,790
Go ahead. It's all right. Tell me

59
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,470
I don't know if it's appropriate

60
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,530
It's fine. Just tell me

61
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,090
Uncle, my grandpa passed away just a couple days ago, and you look so much like him

62
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,670
Every time I see you, I think of my grandpa

63
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,320
- How did your grandpa die?
- Grandpa!

64
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,700
Cancer. Grandpa!

65
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,450
Grandpa

66
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,790
Uncle, it's time for class. I have to go back to class

67
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,090
Can I come back to see you when I miss him?

68
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,170
Yes. Yes. Yes. Any time you want

69
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,730
Go ahead. Don't be late for class

70
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,510
Grandpa. I'm leaving then

71
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,170
Bye, bye

72
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,490
Nan Xi, what did you think about my acting just now?

73
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,870
- Pretty good
- Of course

74
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,510
Right. Your grandpa—

75
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,370
My grandpa indeed died when I was eight

76
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,170
It was cancer, so technically I didn't lie

77
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,890
Ok

78
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,050
And I heard that the courier from the reception office comes twice a day, so we need to check more often

79
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,950
Ok

80
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,810
Nan Xi, so are we really friends now?

81
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,370
Yes

82
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,890
Really? No take-backs!

No take-backs

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,030
Where did the two of them go?

85

I don't know

He... is not here now. What do you need?

88
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,990
When I was in the library, I unintentionally found out that, he needed a book that I happen to have

89
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,120
I can lend it to him

Nan Xi, what are you holding in your hand?

100
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,850
Give it to me. Give it to me quickly

Give it to me

Nan Xi, give me whatever is in your hand

- Whose thing is this?
- Mine

Hurry up!

- Did you write these to each other?
- No

111
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,950
I'm not clear on what the card is, but it wasn't written by Xia Rui

112
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,050
Check the handwriting

113
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,930
True, it wasn't written by Xia Rui. How could you possibly have such good handwriting as this person?

114
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,170
I just don't understand

115
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,110
If you didn't do it, why did you admit it?

116
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,410
- I... it was a conditioned reflex.
- What do you mean?

117
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,550
It's just that you've gotten used to being the leader at school

118
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,950
You're so brave, willing to carry the blame for everything

119
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,830
I'm telling you two! Puppy love

120
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,390
is a very serious matter, not a joke

121
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,850
I will ask you two one more time

122
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,950
Did you tell me the truth on this or not?

123
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,490
The book is not mine

124
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,370
Then whose is it?

125
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,890
I don't know. Someone probably left it after class. I saw it the moment I walked in

126
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,410
Fine. Then I will investigate it carefully

127
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,410
You two, wait for the results!

128
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,390
I suppose the rumors of you, our grade's top student, getting criticized

129
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,450
is going to spread through the entire Chenghua soon

130

I'm fine

131
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,510
You got in trouble because of it

132
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,370
This naturally isn't a big deal for you, since you're going to elite class anyway

133
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,290
The book... belongs to Yang Yufei?

134
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,610
Who else but her?

135
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,150
Didn't I tell you not to accept gifts for me?

136
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,840
Don't always reject others so directly

137
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,590
She's the campus belle after all. She has dignity to preserve

138
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,890
You don't mind?

139
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,730
I... of course I wouldn't

140
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,790
My friend attracted the campus belle. I am proud

141
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,730
I helped Yang Yufei hide this secret, so you have to ask her to return the favor

142
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,890
How is that any of my business?

143
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,690
You just received her book and didn't want to put it down. Now, it's not your business?

144
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,470
I didn't know she was the one who sent it to me

145
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,790
You let Mr. Hu look at the penmanship and poetry just now, and now you're saying you didn't know?

146
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,410
Who do you think you're deceiving?

Xia Rui

148
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,610
when have I ever deceived you?

149
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,330
It's true that you didn't in the past, but now I don't know

150
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,250
You always leave after class every day. How am I suppose to know what you've done behind my back?

151
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,550
You don't trust me?

152
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,390
I didn't say that

153
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,350
You're the one with the guilty conscience. Don't blame me

154
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,450
Then tell me now. What on earth did you do?

155
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,890
I can't tell you

156
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,050
You can't tell me again

157
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,510
Fine. Then don't

158
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,870
Okay. Class is over

159
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,010
Goodbye, teacher

Rui, we haven't been to Boss Yi's place in a long time. Want to check it out?

161
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,970
Okay

162
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,090
Nan Xi, are you coming with us?

163
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,830
He's very busy. I'll get my schoolbag

164
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,590
Rui!

165
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,170
Nan Xi

166
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,630
What's wrong with them?

167
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,390
I don't know

168
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,170
I just invited Rui to sit in Boss Yi's with me for a bit. Want to come with?

169
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,350
I should accompany Nan Xi

170
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,770
After all, our relationship with Rui has been long-lasting already, right?

171
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,830
What kind of strangeness have you been up to?

172
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,630
I can't tell you

173
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,870
What happened today?

174
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,050
You established a four-person squad just a little while ago, but then two left

175
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,130
One was abandoned, and the other became a follower and left voluntarily

176
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,310
Rui, there isn't much business here today. How about I teach you how to make coffee?

177
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,610
Next time

178
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,150
Is this a problem with her studies or her relationships?

179
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,030
I see. It turned out to be a relationship problem

180
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,110
Stop talking nonsense! Nan Xi and I are good brothers. Don't make fun of us

181
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,930
Nan Xi again?

182
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,650
It seems like after Nan Xi got first place in the grade, he's gained lots of female fans

183
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,170
Perhaps our Rui's a little jealous.

184
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,880
Who said that? I am so happy

185
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,250
I am so delighted

186
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,330
- Then why are you not in high spirits?
- I'm not!

187
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,830
Your expression is like a dead fish

188
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,870
I don't know either

189
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,930
It could be that he's been hiding something from me recently. It's strange

190
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,280
Rui, let me ask you this

191
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,950
Do you want Nan Xi to transfer to Class One so eagerly?

192
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,430
Is this something I can decide just based on my own wishes?

193
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,250
This is an inevitable reality

194
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,200
If you don't want him to go, why do you keep talking about about transferring?

195
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,370
It's made Nan Xi care a lot about this

196
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,930
I don't know either

197
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,810
Perhaps if I talk about it more, it will numb me

198
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,830
Once I'm numb, I'll accept it

199
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,710
Once I've accepted it, I will be able to face reality freely

200
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,090
Now I understand, why Nan Xi is not here

201
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,970
How about Cheng Erluo? He is a huge spender at my shop

202
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,270
Don't mention that traitor!

203
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,910
Traitor. We won't mention him

204
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,930
It's as thick as an elephant. I hold it like this

205
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,570
-Is an elephant's waist really so thick?
- Of course

206
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,670
It's incredibly round, just like a bucket. It's also long

207
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,510
What does it normally eat?

208
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,910
-It normally eats dog food. Nothing else
- Okay

209
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,170
Uncle, I'm going to go. You can rest, have a rest. I'm going back to class now

210
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,070
- I'll come when I miss you
- Okay

211
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,710
Okay. I'll put the stool here for you

212
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,510
The handwriting is so similar

213
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,160
Godly Nan Xi

214
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,450
I knew you are excellent, but I never realized you were so all-rounded!

215
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,390
I'm so touched

216
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,730
It's just that Rui doesn't know that, you're doing all of this and you've fallen out of favor with her

217
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,390
You're a golden flower of yesterday. Just like me

218
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,670
But honestly, don't be angry with Rui

219
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,830
She's just like this. She has a sharp tongue, but a heart as soft as tofu

220
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,250
Otherwise, why would she help you bear the responsibility for something as serious as puppy love?

221
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,750
I know

222
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,310
How could I possibly be angry with her?

223
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,430
Do you think Mr. Hu will buy it?

224
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,210
Let's try it first

225
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,210
[Application form for transferring to art class]

226
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,730
[Nan Xi's Mother]

227
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,050
Isn't that Liu Bin from Grade 3? Why is he here?

228
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,110
Stop talking. Go. Hurry

229
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,210
Well, Binzi, why don't we just barge into Class 9? Are you afraid of Mr. Hu?

230
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,170
Fear him? Nonsense!

231
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,710
What do you know?

232
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,030
What all these nerds to do every day is to come the library and make scenes

233
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,080
Last time, that dude staged a chance encounter with Yufei here

234
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,890
Such impure motives

235
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,710
Doesn't he like staging chance encounters? I'll have him encounter me "by chance"

236
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,430
Hey!

237
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,310
Nan Xi's classmate

238
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,410
What's up?

239
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,300
Xia Rui, go back and tell that brat Nan

240
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,830
that I'll be waiting for him here today. I'll wait until he comes

241
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,340
If he's a coward and doesn't dare to come

242
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,910
just tell him to voluntarily disappear from Yang Yufei's life

243
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,970
- Let's go.
- It's okay. Don't be afraid

244
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,480
I wonder why you Grade 3 people have so much free time all day?

245
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,990
You target our Grade 2 students whenever you're bored and don't let us go

246
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,830
It's just a pity that you've chosen to target someone from our Class Nine, aka one of my people

247
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,310
Fine. I am bored today anyway

248
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,540
What do you want, Brother Bin?

249
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,730
A fight?

250
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,310
Little girl. You sure talk big

251
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,950
You decide the time and place. The one, who doesn't come is the loser

252
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,270
I, Binzi, never fight women

253
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,370
If you insist on standing up for him like this, I'll fulfill your wish

254
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,590
Don't get cowardly!

255
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,270
Okay

256
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,070
Seems like I have no choice, but to attend this heroes meeting

257
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,930
Okay. Class is over

258
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,710
Goodbye, teacher

259
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,370
Rui!

260
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,870
Nan Xi, come out with me

261
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,510
Okay

262
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,590
Dear Shu, why did Rui run out so fast today? What's the matter?

263
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,170
I don't know. She went out just now

264
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,450
She runs around like a crazy person all day. She's not like you in anyway

265
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,610
Dear Shu, why are you taking books out after class?

266
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,430
I'm not

267
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,430
Is something on your mind?

268
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,350
Are you sick?

269
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,510
The truth is...

270
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,130
Boss Yi!

271
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,070
Hurry. Make me the top coffee. I need to replenish energy

272
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,010
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

273
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:34,070
Let me remind you of this as a friend. Later, do not interfere no matter what happens. I'm not going to take responsibility for accidentally hurting others

274
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,150
Are you going to cast a spell or arrange a dragon formation?

275
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,350
I'll attack the whole group by myself

276
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,250
Here, I will lend this to you

277
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,390
I received your application to transfer to the art class

278
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,450
I am here to ask you whether your decision is final

279
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,270
Yes

280
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,630
Okay. I talked to your mother on the phone

281
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,310
She wants you go to Class One

282
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,540
I gave you both forms

283
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,250
because those are the school rules to give the choice to the students and their families

284
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,970
You sealed the envelope twice. Nice job

285
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,950
I'm sorry

286
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,250
It's okay. Go back now

287
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,710
Mr. Hu

288
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,370
Will you talk to my mother to confirm it again?

289
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,230
I won't. Having the signature is enough

290
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,270
Mr. Hu

291
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,150
thank you

292
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,690
Quickly, go back now. Quickly

293
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,790
What did you say? Rui and Liu Bin? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

294
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,830
Rui wouldn't let me tell you. She was worried that if Mr. Hu found out, he'd think Nan Xi was engaging in puppy love

295
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,710
Even so, it can't be one against three. Where will they meet?

296
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,180
What are you talking about?

297
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,130
What's wrong with Xia Rui?

298
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,030
Boss Yi is here

299
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,550
I see you are alone. If this spreads, everyone will think that I, Binzi, bully girls

300
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,630
If you apologize to me, I'll let this go

301
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,290
Stay as far away from my grudge with Nan Xi as possible

302
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,590
"Senior Schoolmate Binzi, I'm so sorry". These six words are not difficult, right?

303
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,810
"Senior Schoolmate Binzi, I'm so sorry"

304
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,210
"Xia Rui, I'm so sorry." Five words, easier to say

305
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,890
Did no one tell you this, Senior? It's really embarrassing to try and roast someone, but fail

306
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,370
Stop talking nonsense. Come on

307
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,090
Come on

308
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,170
Save it! You still have to pay, if you break something in my shop

309
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,590
Nan Xi, Nan Xi, Nan Xi, don't get agitated!

310
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,090
Nan Xi. Nan Xi. Don't run away!

311
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,010
Y-You... Calm down, Nan Xi

312
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,010
Step aside!

313
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,790
I admit that, I can't compare with you in intelligence

314
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,870
- Get out of my way!
- But in running, I'm not afraid of you

315
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,550
- This is too pitiful.
- Yes, how violent. Too cruel

316
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,810
Classmates!

317
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,710
Are you talking about our Chenghua students?

318
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,850
It's the one from Grade 3. That guy is called Bin... whatsoever

319
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,490
- Liu Bin?
- Yes, yes, yes. It's him. He got beaten up so badly

320
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,430
Nan Xi

321
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,230
- Dear Shu.
- Cheng Erluo, go first

322
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,990
Are you okay? Then I'll go first

323
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,530
Seventeen

324
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,050
Eighteen. Okay

325
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,890
Excuse me

326
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,190
Nineteen. The move is very standard

327
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,810
Nan Xi, Nan Xi, Nan Xi

328
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,830
Cheng Erluo?

329
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,490
Shouldn't you be in the basketball court during this time? Why are you here? Come here

330
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,350
Hurry up!

331
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,510
Did I allow you to stop?

332
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,970
How many have you jumped?

333
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,310
I forget

334
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,720
You forgot? If so, then start over from ten

335
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,290
What?

336
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,750
I have to be willing to accept loss. I'll do it

337
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,450
Who is she?

338
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,850
Don't you know her?

339
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,510
She's Coach Yang of the basketball team. Xia Rui's Plus version

340
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,030
What do you mean?

341
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:34,910
Xia Rui is the little boss. She is the big boss

342
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,490
Xia Rui

343
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,690
Luckily, you've come. You would have missed the scene if you didn't come

344
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,970
Did he bully you?

345
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,610
He? You think he'd be able to?

346
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,370
Look at me

347
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,850
Promise me that, you won't fight in the future

348
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,570
Fight?

349
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,250
Up, up, up!

350
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,210
Good job

351
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,730
Another round

352
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,270
It's fine. I'll give you some time

353
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,450
No. One more round. One more round

354
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,070
Winner!

355
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,270
Another round?

356
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,430
- Best of three.
- Round three

357
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,490
The big move is coming! The big move is coming!

358
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,390
Winner!

359
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,870
Hurry up!

360
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,050
Okay. Stop drinking

361
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,450
One more round

362
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:10,250
Senior, you are willing to bet, but you can't be too angry. You are ruining the place

363
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,910
If I'm ruining it, I'll clean it

364
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,130
Let's solve the problem at hand first

365
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,330
Do you dare to bet something big?

366
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,410
How big? You want to drink 1.5 liters?

367
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,330
No. We aren't drinking water. No water

368
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,530
Push-ups. Do you dare?

369
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,450
Senior, you are in Grade 3 already. Could you not indulge yourself in games?

370
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,090
Calm down and go home

371
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,530
Now, you're scared. I'm going to find Nan Xi

372
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,930
Why are you acting so shamelessly?

373
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,130
- Push-ups. Do you dare?
- Okay. I'm in

374
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,130
Take a rest. I'll go get a cup of coffee

375
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,390
Rui. Let's be more magnanimous. Let him win and call it a day

376
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,210
Am I not magnanimous enough?

377
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,410
When I wanted to let him win, he said, "You don't respect me."

378
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,590
Why does he want to win so badly?

379
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,050
I have a tactic. Do you want to listen?

380
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,370
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

381
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,050
If I told you earlier, how would we have been able to show them how smart and strong you are?

382
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,790
Come here

383
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,610
I found you someone. That person will come here soon to help you

384
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,290
But don't let anyone know. Understand? Say something!

385
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,660
Don't do push-ups. I see that the outside area is very spacious

386
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,030
Let's do something dynamic. How about leapfrogs?

387
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,730
Awesome. Absolutely amazing!

388
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,730
You're the only one in Chenghua who could fix a character like him

389
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:42,410
I have to say it. The influence you exude is even taller than a mountain and deeper than an ocean. Who could ever look down on you?

390
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,570
Coach Yang, rest first. I'll go back to practice. See you later

391
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,870
Don't move. Since you've come, just practice here

392
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,250
No... It's not suitable. There are too many people here

393
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,770
Don't leak the secret practice of Chenghua Basketball Team

394
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,050
I think it's quite suitable. Come here. First, do 100 leapfrogs with him

395
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,290
No!

396
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,910
Never mind, they're all children. What are you doing?

397
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,490
Did I let you talk?

398
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,510
What is it? Not enough? Then 200?

399
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,950
No, no, no. 100 is okay. 100 is enough

400
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,590
Bro, if Coach Yang asks you to jump, you just jump? Do you even have a sense of individuality?

401
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,330
Aren't you also jumping, because she asked you to?

402
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,410
That's my coach

403
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,410
We're in a boss-subordinate relationship. What about you?

404
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,950
Coach Yang is Yang Yufei's young aunt

405
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,730
What?

406
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,310
- Aunt?
- You have the energy to talk? 100 more!

407
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,130
No, no, no. We're stopping. We're stopping.

408
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,450
Are you okay?

409
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,410
Bro, I didn't expect you to be such a noble lover. Teach me later

410
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm done. One should answer for his actions. I jumped for them too. 200 jumps in total

411
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,550
Look. This buddy is quite righteous. He's very similar to my younger self!

412
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,490
Shut up

413
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,910
That's enough. If you were to jump 300, your legs would become useless

414
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,510
Apologize to Boss Yi immediately

415
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,390
I'll just jump

416
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,330
It's fine

417
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,850
Why do you keep interrupting me?

418
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,790
Why are you always so soft-hearted?

419
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,930
Apologize. Hurry up!

420
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,270
Sorry

421
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,570
It's okay. Don't take it to heart, okay?

422
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,610
I just asked you to apologize, but you're making it seem like you've been badly wronged

423
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:36,490
Today, Boss Yi cleaned up all of these glass shards by himself. You need to pay for that too

424
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,470
How to pay for that?

425
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:43,310
You will work for free here every day after school for one week starting tomorrow

426
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,230
- One week?
- Do you think that's not enough?

427
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,290
No. It's a lot. Boss Yi, Coach Yang, you do your business here. Go. Go. Go

428
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,970
Teach me later. Teach me later

429
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,850
Teach me

430
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,590
Cheng Erluo, what are you standing there for?

431
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,670
I will keep doing

432
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,150
Didn't you say yesterday that your knee got bruised in that basketball game...

433
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,490
My leg hurts

434
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,410
Go on

435
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:19,060
Yishu, don't worry. He won't hurt himself. You've watched our training before

436
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,760
Okay

437
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,930
Slow down. Slow down

438
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,290
I'll treat you to skewers, since I made such a big scene

439
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,450
Rui, you're hurting me

440
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:48,470
The coach said that, if I don't lose 2.5 kg within a week, I'll be removed from the team!

441
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,230
If you don't go, we'll go

442
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,990
- Dear Shu, you're also going to be so cruel to me?
- Yes

443
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,110
Godly Nan, surely you still have a human conscience?

444
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,950
- Let's go. It's fine
- I can't

445
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,650
Fine. I go back with him

446
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,210
Besides, it's so late now. I still need to go home and practice piano

447
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,890
- Okay. You hold him
- Okay

448
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,170
Our Dear Shu treats me best

449
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,050
Slow down!

450
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,630
Wait for a minute

451
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,430
Rui, Rui, Rui

452
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,950
What's up?

453
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,570
I want to tell you that Godly Nan isn't transferring out

454
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,160
Let's go, Dear Shu. Steady me

455
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,710
What's wrong? Are things fine?

456
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,590
It's all right. He was saying that his leg hurts

457
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,510
Here, here, here!

458
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,250
The delicious-smelling skewers have arrived!

459
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,150
Take two skewers. This one is so delicious. I love it so much

460
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,390
Absolutely delicious

461
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,970
Eat some!

462
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,630
Why aren't you eating?

463
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,210
Could it be that, you've never eaten skewers before?

464
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,270
It's true

465
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,070
My goodness

466
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,150
Your Rui was the first one to ever take you to experience eating skewers. You're so lucky

467
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:32,050
When it comes to eating skewers, I'm definitely an expert

468
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,550
Does this place make you uncomfortable?

469
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,410
Xia Rui

470
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,750
why did you fight with Liu Bin? Was it because of me?

471
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,190
No

472
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,510
You're overthinking it. He and I didn't even fight anyway

473
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,170
This is really dangerous!

474
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,750
It's just a game. I'm able to hold my ground

475
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,010
He smashed a bottle!

476
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,750
That was an accident

477
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,690
I am not joking with you. This is serious

478
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,370
Not that serious

479
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,880
Okay, okay, okay

480
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,030
I promise that, there will not be a next time. Definitely not

481
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:39,270
Okay? Okay?

482
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,450
Okay then

483
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,210
If anything happens again, you need to tell me. Don't let me worry about you

484
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,470
Okay. I promise you

485
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,550
Then if anything happens to you, won't you have to tell me?

486
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,630
For sure

487
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,530
Then tell me

488
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,710
About what?

489
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,830
When we parted ways, Cheng Erluo told me about it. You're not transferring out

490
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,150
Yes. I'm preparing to become an art student through taking the art exam, so I can stay in Class Nine

491
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,350
That's why you two have been acting all sneaky lately?

492
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,950
Yes

493
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,110
Then why didn't you tell me?

494
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,190
You were more willing to trust him than me

495
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:29,750
It's not that I don't trust you. It's that I didn't dare to tell you about it before I succeed

496
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,960
I was afraid that you would be disappointed in me

497
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:44,690
I know you don't want me to leave, but you always say that I'm leaving

498
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,110
I-I was testing you

499
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,830
But you passed it

500
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,170
After you eat this skewer, we will continue being together

501
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,810
Wrong

502
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,390
We will always be together

503
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,370
Okay. Then I'll eat first as a sign of respect

504
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,530
Nan Xi!

505
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,110
Aunt Lin?

506
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:31,970
I was just in that store buying things, and I thought I saw someone that looked like you. I came here to check, and it's really you

507
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,470
Is this your classmate?

508
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,550
Hello. My name is Xia Rui. I'm Nan Xi's classmate

509
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,210
- So you are Xia Rui?
- Mom

510
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,710
I still have some things to do. I'll go first

511
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,990
Bye, Auntie

512
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,550
Mom, what were you doing?

513
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,270
Nothing. I just met a friend

514
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,770
A friend? Nan Xi is your friend?

515
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,810
Then is he—

516
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,870
Does Aunt Lin know you very well?

517
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,330
Aunt Lin is my mom's friend

518
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,670
We sometimes... chat

519
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,130
I wouldn't have expected her to be Meng Shiran's mother

520
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:17,350
Are you happy that I spent the day with you? After we get home, take a look at the mistakes collection, okay?

521
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,260
She is Meng Shiran's mother and Meng Shiran is Yang Yufei's friend

522
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,110
Yang Yufei likes you. This is such a confusing connection

523
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,070
I told you before. I don't like her

524
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,150
- Who? Yang Yufei?
- Yes

525
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,350
I only have you

526
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,010
as my only friend
