1
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,475
Nan Xi

2
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,450
Are you ready?

3
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,350
It's time to go to school

4
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,850
Ready to go

5
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,150
I'll call you later

6
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,050
Are you taking Nan Xi to school?

7
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,925
You know that

8
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,850
The doctor said his mental and emotional health

9
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,250
is recovering well

10
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,725
But now he's going to the school

11
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,000
Is it too sudden?

12
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,900
Have you thought about how Nan Xi feels?

13
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,075
He's very happy

14
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,500
All right, wait till you get back

15
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,875
It was your father

16
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,500
He said the European project was going well

17
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,450
He'll be back as soon as he's finished

18
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,475
It's too late

19
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,100
Slow down

20
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,150
It's too hot

21
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,175
Xia

22
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,550
Where's Rui's porridge?

23
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,900
I just put it here

24
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,475
I think I ate it just now

25
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,425
I think you did it on purpose

26
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,825
I'm getting old

27
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,250
I've been silly sometimes

28
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,425
You'll forgive me

29
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,450
Are you really silly?

30
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,100
If you're silly,

31
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,775
why did you fill

32
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,100
one more here?

33
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,700
Why don't you go back to your mother's?

34
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,425
You two know

35
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:49,775
how to gang up on me

36
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:50,675
I gotta go

37
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,175
Slow down and be safe

38
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,700
Be careful of cars

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,525
OK

40
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,350
Come on. Come on

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,775
You two

42
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,400
Both of you, come here

43
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,700
Can't you start earlier?

44
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,150
Class Seven?

45
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,625
Mr. Hu

46
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,200
What's wrong with him?

47
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,025
My ass. My ass

48
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,625
Well...

49
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry

50
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,050
Are you all right?

51
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,450
Are you hurt?

52
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,175
I'm so sorry

53
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:26,950
I didn't see you

54
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,975
Did you hurt?

55
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,450
Do you need to see a doctor?

56
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,075
Do you?

57
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,675
Hey

58
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,000
It's strange

59
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,450
Mr. Yi. Mr. Yi

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,475
Schoolbag

61
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,250
Take care of it. I'll pick it up after class

62
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,775
Bye bye

63
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:46,650
What?

64
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,700
Rui, run slowly

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,050
Mr. Hu

66
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,250
It seems that the rumor is true

67
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,125
What is the rumor?

68
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:56,950
I heard that

69
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,500
you were promoted to the director

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,950
and the youngest director

71
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,175
since the founding of Chenghua School

72
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:02,625
When you're our class teacher,

73
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,175
Class 9 is very important in our school

74
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,275
Lin Xiaoxiao, you're good at

75
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,825
sucking up

76
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:11,100
Don't be proud

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,775
I'm only going to be stricter with you

78
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,075
The bells have rung

79
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:15,650
Go

80
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,475
Go back now

81
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,075
Director Hu

82
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:20,875
What?

83
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,975
Mr. Hu

84
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,975
Well, it occurred to me that

85
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:25,700
there's a grammar problem

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,150
Can you come with me?

87
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,850
No...No...

88
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,650
Is it convenient for you to teach me?

89
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,850
Cheng Erluo,

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,975
you impressed me

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
You're so positive this semester

92
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,650
It's a new semester for me

93
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,375
Alright

94
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,500
It's not too late to start learning in Grade Eleven

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Right. Right

96
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,200
Hello,

97
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,550
You, stop

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,150
You...

99
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,175
It's him

100
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,050
What's your name? Which class? Uniform?

101
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,225
Take off your hat

102
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
New student?

103
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,150
Hey

104
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,725
The teacher let you take off your hat

105
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,625
Are you OK?

106
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,225
Alright. It doesn't matter

107
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,625
Mr. Hu

108
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,475
He should have a demerit

109
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,750
Alright. It doesn't matter

110
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,025
Are you Nan Xi?

111
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:37,725
Xia Rui

112
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,250
Come here

113
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:44,400
Quickly

114
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,375
Where's the restroom?

115
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,000
It's strange

116
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:49,775
Morning, Mr. Hu

117
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:50,800
You're late

118
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,725
and climbed over the wall

119
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,150
How many times have I told you

120
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,750
Don't over the wall

121
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,500
What if you fall down?

122
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,350
Mr. Hu, you misunderstood me

123
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,650
My stomach hurts. I'm looking for a restroom

124
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,050
The restroom is in the teaching building

125
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,775
When was the restroom fixed

126
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:03,625
at the school gate?

127
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,425
You can show me around

128
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:04,900
Come on

129
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,075
No. No...

130
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:07,375
Think it over

131
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,350
If I'm going to be late,

132
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,875
how come I don't have a bag on my shoulder?

133
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:13,950
The schoolbag should be in the classroom

134
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,575
It's in the classroom

135
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,350
Well

136
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,700
I'm waiting for you here

137
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,100
Go and get your bag

138
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:21,700
What?

139
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,850
Letter of apology

140
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,650
Sorry, Mr. Hu

141
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,350
I was late again for the first day

142
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:34,825
Class Nine Grade Eleven

143
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,525
Well

144
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:36,625
Stop it

145
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,250
The self-criticism for Grade Ten is out of date

146
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,075
You can't use it now

147
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,800
We're getting an upgrade today

148
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,375
As a sophomore in high school,

149
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,125
you're the only student who is late

150
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,725
800 words for letter of apology

151
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,975
After the flag-raising ceremony,

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,875
you read it

153
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,875
in front of all the school students

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,700
You need to reflect

155
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,100
Nan Xi

156
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:56,550
Come with me to the office

157
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,225
Rui

158
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,750
He's late too

159
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Are you okay, Rui?

160
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:07,800
Of course no

161
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,975
Who's he?

162
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,100
This guy

163
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,850
is Nan Xi

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,025
I'm gonna tell you

165
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,150
Nan Xi

166
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,375
is amazing

167
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,900
He studied in No.1 Experimental High School

168
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,975
But I don't know why,

169
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,150
he took half a year off school

170
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,825
You three

171
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,075
Can you take your books?

172
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,500
His father

173
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,575
is awesome

174
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,175
His father is a famous architect in our city

175
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,025
Nanyi

176
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,950
Can you stop making up? Take your books

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,850
The one who's cleaning the blackboard

178
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,025
Take your book

179
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,975
Chenghua Opera House, you know,

180
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,825
is the work of him who's graduated from famous university

181
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,225
The point is that his mother's better

182
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,850
She's the vice President of Cheng Shang Bank

183
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,675
and a visiting professor at Binhai University

184
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,950
Can a child from

185
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,175
an ordinary family

186
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:45,875
compete with him?

187
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,600
Of course no

188
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:47,400
Right?

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,950
So

190
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,675
no wonder he's so fierce

191
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,625
He bullied

192
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,550
our school hunk Cheng Erluo

193
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,125
Exactly

194
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,500
Do you think he's terrible?

195
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
He's really good

196
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,900
What?

197
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,775
Rui, you're here

198
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,375
I fell on my own

199
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,525
I wasn't knocked down

200
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,150
Really? Watch your words

201
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,775
Besides, I'm the main force of the basketball team

202
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,125
How can it be knocked down?

203
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,025
You move!

204
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,375
Get out of the way

205
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,825
We all saw that

206
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,100
You extended your hand as a gesture of friendship

207
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,050
He lowered himself

208
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,175
A fall back

209
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:14,800
Ouch!

210
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,900
The pain...

211
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,525
Fell on you?

212
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,900
Hurt you?

213
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,350
Rui, your accident

214
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,850
had something to do with him

215
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,025
I mean, both of you

216
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,150
are really

217
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,500
well informed

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,375
You two go straight to

219
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,950
a paparazzo team

220
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,450
You don't have to go to college

221
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,375
She's right. Think it over

222
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,050
Rui, what's wrong with you?

223
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,650
She's hurt

224
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,225
Let me see where it hurts

225
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:40,700
It hurts

226
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,025
How did you get it?

227
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,375
What are you doing?

228
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:45,625
I know you were late

229
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm helping you with your self-criticism

230
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,925
Dear Shu

231
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,275
you've treated me the best

232
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,450
Alright! Alright

233
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,400
Cheng Erluo, did it hurt?

234
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,600
People only care if I'm handsome or not

235
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,350
but you

236
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,825
care about my pain

237
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,775
Oh, come on

238
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:01,625
Yeah

239
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,225
If you hadn't failed to escort me today,

240
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:04,900
I wouldn't need her to write a review for me

241
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,450
Yeah

242
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,100
Rui

243
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
You can't blame me for that

244
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,175
It's all your fault

245
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,800
Hu is coming

246
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,125
Here comes the strange man

247
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,700
Did you yell Hu?

248
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:16,750
It's impolite

249
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,300
Nan Xi

250
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,250
Come in

251
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:40,200
Let me introduce him to you

252
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,475
This is

253
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,775
the new student

254
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,500
transferred to our class this semester

255
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,725
Nan Xi

256
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:48,525
I hope you will accept

257
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,425
this new student

258
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,000
with friendship and enthusiasm as always

259
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,775
Okay, okay, okay

260
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,625
This is primitive tribal way

261
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,300
Can't you do this less?

262
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,550
I have a headache when you yell

263
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,475
Nan Xi

264
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,775
Introduce yourself

265
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:23,600
Nan

266
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,350
He's so strange

267
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,225
Nan Xi

268
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,525
That is your seat

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,875
You can have your seat

270
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,800
Xia Rui

271
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:10,050
What are you looking at?

272
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:12,800
Is the letter of apology finished?

273
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,025
Report

274
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:15,775
Speak

275
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,550
I'm not the only one who was late today

276
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,925
You're very voracious

277
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,050
You made a mistake, but you want to drag him

278
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,700
I'm sorry to tell you

279
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,425
You were the only one

280
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,100
who was late for sophomore year today

281
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,375
Well, study by yourselves

282
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,000
No whispering

283
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:35,475
This guy isn't a school bully, is he?

284
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:37,700
Mr. Hu is too obvious in his favor

285
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,325
Mr. Hu has just been promoted to director

286
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,875
At this time he's taking over this new job

287
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,450
Don't mess with him

288
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:44,950
Don't write the review

289
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,000
Today I let him know

290
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,000
what is equality

291
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,375
Now

292
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,675
Xia Rui, who's late today, is going to

293
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,100
read her letter of apology under the national flag

294
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,225
to reflect on her mistake

295
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,950
She'll accept all of your supervision

296
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,350
I'm Xia Rui, Class Nine Grade Eleven

297
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,550
Today, I violated the school rules and regulations because I was late,

298
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,425
which brought a very bad influence

299
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,800
So I promise under the flag to you all

300
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,975
The self-criticism for Grade Ten is out of date

301
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:19,050
You can't use it now

302
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,150
We're getting an upgrade

303
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,650
Mr. Hu

304
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,850
Sorry, Director Hu

305
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,625
I benefited a lot from

306
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,550
Director Hu's speech just now

307
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,450
It reminds me of the school motto of Chenghua School

308
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,350
Objectivity, Cooperation, Diligence, Innovation

309
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,050
I follow the principle of being realistic and warm-hearted

310
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,575
to review and reflect in front of the whole students

311
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,175
Today, Nan Xi, Class Nine Grade Eleven

312
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,700
still roamed around the school

313
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,250
after the bell rang,

314
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,500
which brought a very bad influence

315
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,350
I was one of the witnesses

316
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,300
I fail to reflect to the school in time

317
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,950
according to the principle of being realistic

318
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,950
And I forget the principle of being warm-hearted

319
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,450
to help Nan Xi

320
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,875
to realize his mistake in time

321
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,550
Mr. Hu just said that

322
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:02,975
a small leak will sink a great ship

323
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,300
I was wrong because I was late

324
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,350
and covered up for

325
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,275
the late arrival of Nan Xi

326
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,900
You'll supervise me and make me...

327
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,525
Okay, okay, okay

328
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:19,400
I should have finished the letter of apology for her

329
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:21,625
I knew something would go wrong

330
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,350
if let her speak by herself

331
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,350
I was a little under the weather,

332
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,475
so I just babbled something

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,250
Nan Xi, one of the people involved

334
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,850
Why didn't he even join in raising the flag?

335
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,500
This privileged student

336
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,775
should be handled by Rui

337
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,200
to destroy his prestige

338
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:33,875
At this time

339
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,950
There's no time for caring others

340
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,275
Mr. Hu definitely not let Bro Rui go this time

341
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,750
What's going on?

342
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,700
Mr. Hu asked me to apologize to him

343
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:50,375
Did you agree?

344
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,025
A great man knows when to yield and when not

345
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:53,800
It's not a big deal to apologize

346
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,700
Rui

347
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,225
I don't worship anyone

348
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:59,150
but I worship you

349
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,750
Do you want me to show you the way?

350
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,250
Let me introduce myself

351
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,550
I'm Cheng Erluo,

352
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,725
a guard on the school basketball team

353
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,975
In fact, the first time I saw you,

354
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,050
Nan Xi

355
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,950
I think you are very agile

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,500
Do you like sports?

357
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,225
How about

358
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,650
we play basketball after school?

359
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,625
Sorry

360
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,600
Nan Xi

361
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,175
Hi, I'm Xia Rui

362
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:16,825
This morning,

363
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,300
you got me for being late

364
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,175
I'll put that in mind

365
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,650
But I shouldn't take it personally

366
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,875
and embarrass you in front of the school students

367
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,150
I'd like to apologize

368
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm sorry

369
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:28,600
You don't need to

370
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,800
Hey, I'm angry

371
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,300
I was so kind to apologize

372
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,575
What's your attitude?

373
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:35,300
If you think it's all right,

374
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,900
the least you can do is say that

375
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,575
If you're not okay with it, I...

376
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:39,225
What does that mean?

377
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,175
You have a good background

378
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,500
and look down on me?

379
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,625
Do you really think you're somebody?

380
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,075
It'll get worse

381
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,575
Don't be angry

382
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:51,950
I am the most generous

383
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,775
Piss me off

384
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:04,150
The question is quite difficult

385
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,050
Is anyone who wanna try?

386
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,200
Madam, Nan Xi can handle with it

387
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:15,600
Really?

388
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Nanxi, please come here and write your answers

389
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,250
If you don't follow Rui's rules,

390
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,025
you'll have tough time

391
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,750
Exactly

392
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,850
Nan Xi is very good

393
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,425
Let's give Nan Xi a round of applause

394
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,050
Alright?

395
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,650
I'm not going to talk about it in class

396
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,150
If you can't do it, you can ask me after class

397
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,175
Let's go to the next question

398
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,300
Mr. Yi, hurry up

399
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,975
If I'm late,

400
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:32,450
my grandma will nag again

401
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,550
Now you're in a hurry

402
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,300
You put your schoolbag here all day

403
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,375
I don't see you're worried

404
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,225
But I attend the class for one day

405
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,325
Have a taste

406
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,000
Thanks.

407
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:49,600
It smells great

408
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,025
Could you drink it more elegantly?

409
00:19:58,975 --> 00:19:59,750
Wine

410
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,550
Wine?

411
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:02,800
Taste again

412
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,175
The taste of plums still lingers after swallowing it

413
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,525
What kind of the plum?

414
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,925
These are sunbaked beans

415
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:13,625
from Santa Clara, Panama

416
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,100
I made a light bake

417
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:15,900
So

418
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,150
There's a real taste of wine berries in there

419
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,625
Mr. Yi

420
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,900
Rui was right again

421
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Can we get free of charge again?

422
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,700
Of course. We have a deal

423
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,900
If any of you can taste the beans,

424
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,700
you can drink free

425
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,400
Once or twice is fine

426
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,025
Mr. Yi can't make money

427
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,100
What if we drink too much and you run out of money?

428
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,675
It is hard to find a true friend

429
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,175
I have so many friends around me

430
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,175
Few of them can

431
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:41,025
taste coffee

432
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:42,750
It's my treat

433
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,250
I'm happy with that

434
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,350
Rui, your tongue

435
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,150
should be put in the lab

436
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,050
for research

437
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,550
I think your tongue deserves

438
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,175
a lab study

439
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,350
and see what's going on

440
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,150
You only

441
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,375
can taste the braised pork in brown sauce

442
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,050
You can't taste anything with your tongue

443
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:01,950
It takes a long time

444
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,500
for the average person

445
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,225
to sharpen their tongue

446
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,950
So Rui,

447
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:08,150
don't waste

448
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,550
your talent

449
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,200
Mr. Yi

450
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,650
Are you going to teach me how to make coffee?

451
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,525
Of course

452
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,425
I can teach you how to make coffee

453
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:15,700
When I go out to travel again,

454
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,650
I will ask you to help me look after the shop

455
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,625
I'd love to

456
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,150
Go ahead

457
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,750
It's free

458
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,325
Thanks.

459
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,950
There will be food and drink with Rui

460
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:29,875
Rui, what's wrong with you?

461
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,850
The transfer student

462
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,700
seems to study well

463
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,675
The transfer student?

464
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,650
You mean Nan Xi?

465
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:40,575
No kidding

466
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,250
He has an IQ of over 140

467
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,800
Hell with the member of Mensa

468
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,425
How would you know that?

469
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:47,225
This's from the king of gossip in our class,

470
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:48,350
Lin Xiaoxiao

471
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,575
Nan Xi is

472
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,450
really quite an amazing presence

473
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,050
He doesn't like to talk to people

474
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,375
and play with people

475
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,900
But everyone is watching him

476
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,150
And nobody knows

477
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,425
what he looks like

478
00:21:58,425 --> 00:21:59,375
He wears a hat every day

479
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,800
Is he bald?

480
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:02,675
Childish

481
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,525
We shall not attack unless we are attacked

482
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,050
Who cares if he's a top with an IQ of 140

483
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,775
Who cares what his background is

484
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:10,900
The member of Mensa

485
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,775
Who cares?!

486
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,175
He can do what he wants

487
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:15,000
as long as he doesn't mess with me

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,050
You're back

489
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,200
Dinner is ready. Let's eat

490
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,025
Hi, you are back

491
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,225
I'm really busy today

492
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:44,250
No time to pick you up

493
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,525
How was your day?

494
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,550
Are the students friendly?

495
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,025
Can you understand the lesson?

496
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:55,175
I have an international conference to attend

497
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,375
I'm going on business for a few days

498
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,675
They'll pick me up later

499
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:23,850
Nan Xi, I'm leaving

500
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,225
I'll be back in a couple of days

501
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:27,600
I have an appointment with Aunt Lin

502
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:28,575
When I get back,

503
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,050
I'll take you over and talk to her

504
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,025
Sis Liu

505
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,725
Please keep an eye on Nan Xi these days

506
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,700
and call me if anything is wrong

507
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,350
Okay, you can rest assured

508
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,575
The car is waiting for you downstairs

509
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:45,925
You can leave first

510
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,275
Put away all the English books

511
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,500
Let's have a quiz in this class

512
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,525
Pass it quickly

513
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:00,050
As usual

514
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,100
The exam is over

515
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,625
when the bell rings

516
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,975
Do it well

517
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,825
Do I have the answer on my face?

518
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,775
Didn't eat breakfast?

519
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,375
I skipped breakfast so I wouldn't be late

520
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,075
No whispering

521
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't look around

522
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,200
What a thing!

523
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,950
What did you see?

524
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,750
He has finished. Have you finished?

525
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:04,975
Three, Two, One

526
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:06,875
Ouch!

527
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,650
What's the matter with you?

528
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,750
Go to the restroom

529
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,350
I'll come back

530
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,475
Come back

531
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,350
You just write little

532
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,825
Do you want me to write the rest for you?

533
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:16,950
No. I want to go to the restroom

534
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,150
Why do you have to go to the bathroom every time you take an exam

535
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,025
What's wrong with you?

536
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:20,700
It's not a problem

537
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,150
It's a physical reaction

538
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,700
It's not a problem, teacher

539
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,625
Aren't you hungry?

540
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,850
You don't have a stomachache. You can't go

541
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,775
Mr. Hu. I can't hold it any longer

542
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,500
Go, go, go

543
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,675
You have to be back in 10 minutes

544
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Hu

545
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,275
You hold your urine

546
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,250
This one

547
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:13,950
Bro

548
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:16,850
Who?

549
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,875
It's me

550
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:20,950
Who are you?

551
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,375
Tong Liya in Chenghua School

552
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Tong Liya

553
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,350
There is no smell

554
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,650
Oh my God

555
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,925
Are you okay?

556
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,225
My waist

557
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,375
Why don't you

558
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,500
study hard?

559
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,300
What were you doing under the tree?

560
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,550
My waist. My waist

561
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,900
Nan Xi

562
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,550
Oh my God!

563
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,750
You...

564
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:38,650
You're a trouble maker for me

565
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,150
I'm begging you

566
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,800
Will you leave me alone?

567
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,050
Sorry

568
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,675
I played a trick on you in math class

569
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,750
But aren't you a genius?

570
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,250
Didn't you

571
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,625
turn the trick scene

572
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,050
into a show-stage?

573
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,325
I'm really begging you

574
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,925
Will you stop following me?

575
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,300
You go your own way

576
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,625
I go my own way

577
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,875
Your business has nothing to do with me

578
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,225
Oh, my God

579
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:36,350
You're really creepy

580
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,225
Do you think I...

581
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:38,100
What's going on?

582
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,675
Mr. Hu...

583
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:43,125
Xia Rui

584
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:47,225
Go to study

585
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:48,250
Hurry up

586
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,625
Transfer genius and problem girl

587
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,975
shamelessly embraced

588
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:54,200
in front of the director

589
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,875
That's sensational news

590
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,825
But I heard that Nan Xi dropped out of school

591
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:58,650
because he didn't like

592
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,775
physical contact with others

593
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:00,975
But that doesn't make any sense

594
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,225
That only means that

595
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:04,150
Xia Rui is the one for him

596
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,450
Yang Guo and Xiaolongnu

597
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,975
The routine of the leading actor and actress

598
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,225
locked

599
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:12,100
Good job

600
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,975
Excuse me, monitor

601
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:16,625
Why are your feet there? I don't see them

602
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,225
Cabbage

603
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:26,875
is yellow on the ground

604
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,425
Two or three years old

605
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,125
No Mom

606
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:36,475
Xia Rui

607
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:39,675
Clean the school pool for two weeks

608
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:40,900
No demerit

609
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,575
Deal?

610
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:43,650
Two weeks!

611
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,625
I clean by myself?

612
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,225
That's a big swimming pool

613
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:47,025
Did you do this for...

614
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:48,350
The home visit is about to begin

615
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,925
Deal

616
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,375
Get out of here

617
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,400
See you, Mr. Hu

618
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,950
Nan Xi

619
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,450
I was actually looking for you

620
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,350
I read your English paper

621
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,500
I think you are especially suitable to be

622
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,225
the English subject representative of our class

623
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:02,875
What?

624
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,650
Why is he the representative?

625
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,725
I have to sweep the swimming pool

626
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,700
It's not fair

627
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,275
Piss me off!

628
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,400
What things

629
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:28,725
Who's there?

630
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,750
Who dares to frighten me?

631
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:33,975
You met me today

632
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,900
I tell you

633
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,850
that I'm very strong

634
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,875
I can put your head on one side. You wanna try?

635
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,100
I'm not afraid of you

636
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:42,525
You come out

637
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Who're you?

638
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,575
How come it's you again!

639
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:14,350
Although you come to help me,

640
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,250
I won't thank you

641
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,675
Xia Rui

642
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,750
I have to talk to you

643
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,700
It's amazing

644
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,625
You started talking

645
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,375
What can I do for you?

646
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:35,650
The stuff on your chest...

647
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:39,825
Is that yours?

648
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,825
Of course

649
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,525
It's mine

650
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:49,975
Can I have a look?

651
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,100
Just let me have a look

652
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,200
What?

653
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,350
Please

654
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,175
Did you hear that?

655
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,850
It's the baby whale singing

656
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,025
I heard it

657
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,800
That's nice

658
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,850
Baby whales

659
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:18,300
No more fear

660
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,250
No more fear

661
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,750
Nan Xi

662
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,325
Nan Xi

663
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:27,850
Hello

664
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,175
Hey, wake up

665
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,300
Nan Xi

666
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,100
Artificial respiration?

667
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,225
Alright. It doesn't matter

668
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:33,950
Save a life

669
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,275
It's okay to save a life

670
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:51,425
Wow

671
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,475
Baby whales. Did you make it?

672
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,000
It's the baby whale singing

673
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:40,275
Wait

674
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,700
What are you doing?

675
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,475
Your clothes are wet
