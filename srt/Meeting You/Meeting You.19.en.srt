1
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,020
Xia Rui.

2
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,787
Let's sleep on the sofa.

3
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:11,818
What?

4
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,154
We'll sleep on the sofa.

5
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,655
Don't need to.

6
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,401
Hey, don't.

7
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,100
Nan Xi, be careful.

8
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,954
Oh, my goodness.

=EPISODE 19
IT'S HARD TO SEND THE LITTLE DEVIL AWAY=

10
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:23,315
Cheng Erluo.

11
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:24,876
Hey, Shu.

12
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,493
You haven't had your breakfast, have you?

13
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:27,919
I bought breakfast for you.

14
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,229
Eat well and be healthy.

15
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,787
So you are always beautiful.

16
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,557
What is it today?

17
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:35,151
Xia Rui told me this.

18
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:36,775
I knew it!

19
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:39,464
How is it possible that
a dull man suddenly understands?

20
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:43,098
Shu, what's wrong with you?

21
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,366
You look a little tired.

22
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,987
Did you not rest well?

23
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:47,999
No.

24
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,950
I'm a little nervous
about today's recital.

25
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:52,527
Nervous?

26
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:54,999
Our Shu has so much exposure.

27
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,966
Why should she be afraid of the recital?

28
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,534
Today is the very first performance
since starting university,

29
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:01,181
it sure is different.

30
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:06,263
Also, today the head of department will be
choosing a performer for the next play.

31
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,895
Not a problem!

32
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,397
There's this handsome Cheng Erlu
by your side.

33
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,769
No matter what problem you face.

34
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:14,389
There is nothing to be afraid of!

35
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,563
Alright, good luck then.

36
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:17,857
Good luck!

37
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,209
What are you doing?

38
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,488
Did I wake you up?

39
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:56,763
Is he awake?

40
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:59,297
He didn't wake up.

41
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,604
Since when did you become so careful?

42
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:03,163
Lower your voice! Don't wake him up.

43
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,834
Grind your coffee.

44
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Be quiet. Don't wake him up.

45
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,105
If he's awake, he's awake.

46
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:13,620
Since when have you become a strict wife
and a good mother?

47
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,161
You wouldn't change yourself
because of brother-in-law, would you?

48
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,157
It won't work.

49
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:19,958
Just can't get used to it anymore.

50
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,502
Li Jiayi betrayed me.

51
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,079
Because I'm too kind to her.

52
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,312
Don't you ever mention
about puppy love again.

53
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,123
I'm telling you from experience.

54
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:30,707
Think about it slowly yourself.

55
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:31,872
Remember to grind properly.

56
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,178
And make me a cup!

57
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:35,701
Do you think
this is a place to order food?

58
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,679
You are not obligated.

59
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,307
The society is cruel.

60
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:41,217
Money is not easy to earn.

61
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:42,187
I'm telling you.

62
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,264
You're not allowed
to watch dramas anymore.

63
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:45,981
Don't listen to mom too much.

64

(School of Arts:
Welcome New Students of 2019)

65
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,144
Hello, senior!

66
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,681
You guys go back first.

67
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,971
This is our tutor, Tian Rui.

68
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,626
Such a young teacher.

69
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,394
Senior is now in second year
of the Acting department.

70
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:09,473
Ready to stay and teach.

71
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:10,980
She usually tutors
our professional courses.

72
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,131
So I'm calling her senior.

73
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:16,310
So, I will follow Shu and
call you senior then. Hello, senior!

74
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,531
I remember you.

75
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,108
It's you who sent Shu
to the small theater, isn't it?

76
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,652
Shu, your boyfriend is so handsome!

77
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:24,225
You both are perfect match!

78
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,042
You should come
watch the play together someday.

79
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,151
No, no, no.

80
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,516
Senior, you have misunderstood.

81
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:30,973
Shu and I are just childhood friends,
not a couple.

82
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,057
Shu is now the school's popular girl.

83
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,322
Rumors like this can't be spread randomly.

84
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:37,308
My apologies, I misunderstood.

85
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:39,989
Senior, I'll go ahead and prepare then.

86
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,440
Okay, go.

87
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,262
What's going on here?

88
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,124
Her period?

89
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:53,784
Luckily the black man
covered me with a layer.

90
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:57,322
Only then
you get to listen what I just said.

91
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,549
You will see me blushing.

92
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,763
I really want...

93
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:12,329
I really want to abide by the etiquette.

94
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,801
Deny what has been said.

95
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:17,868
But these customs,

96
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,512
I have to ignore and leave everything now.

97
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,028
Do you love me?

98
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,306
I think your answer must be "Yes".

99
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,836
I will believe in you too.

100
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,468
Why is this?

101
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,681
Why can't you do such a simple problem?

102
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,631
Does your brain only store gossips?

103
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:54,605
You are an adult,
of course you think it's simple.

104
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,749
Please think from the point of my age.

105
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,607
Put yourself into my shoes, okay?

106
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:03,892
I'd say, why are you more stupid
than when I was a kid?

107
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:07,089
Just do my homework.

108
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,664
Why do you have to attack me like this.

109
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:13,431
-Look.
-Xia Rui.

110
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,343
I'll be going first.

111
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,335
Wait for me.
I'm having a class later too.

112
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,571
I'll go with you.

113
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:22,979
We are all gone.

114
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,592
How about him?

115
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:26,809
I am not a kid anymore.

116
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,606
I can enjoy being alone at home.

117
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:32,187
-Like me deeply.
-Deep, you big head!

118
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,131
Knock you.

119
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:35,862
You treat the golden child like this?

120
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,016
Because you are the golden child,

121
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:40,057
I can't leave you out of my sight.

122
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,521
I have to hand you over to Cheng Erluo.

123
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:47,377
My face! Let me go.

124
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,353
Rosalan is also good.

125
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:51,755
Although that's not the female lead.

126
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:53,731
But to get this role
in your freshman year...

127
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,147
is undoubtedly a recognition
of your strength, isn't it?

128
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,055
Cheng Erluo.

129
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:01,452
Let me ask you.

130
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:05,047
Do you really want me to find a boyfriend
and not bother you anymore?

131
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:07,624
This... What do you mean?

132
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,170
It is normal for you girls
to find a boyfriend.

133
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,757
Not to mention that I also said
our Shu's boyfriend must be outstanding.

134
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,235
You see Xia Rui is also in love.

135
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:19,796
Aren't we still friends?

136
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:23,348
So, I still welcome you to bother me.

137
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,358
This... I can bother you from now on, too.

138
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,790
Shu, here I am!

139
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:37,334
Nobody?

140
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,742
How can she leave? Didn't even call.

141
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,243
How about you go to class first.

142
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,264
He can leave him to me.

143
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:57,543
Chen Hao and you, can you manage?

144
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,203
Yes. I can control him.

145
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,058
Your class is important, hurry up.

146
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,179
Okay.

147
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,665
You have to be obedient, alright?

148

(Binhai Business School)

149
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:15,022
Business is all about meetings.

150
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:18,657
Let's introduce some meeting etiquette
and skills.

151
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:22,511
The first one is the greeting.

152
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:24,335
It is best if we mention names.

153
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,887
So boring. Take me out to play.

154
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,212
What is it?

155
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,992
Stop making noise. Do your homework.

156
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:34,991
Enough. Don't talk, be quiet.

157
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:38,089
That's enough, silly sister.

158
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,042
Have you heard of a word?

159
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:43,738
Licking the dog till the end
amounts to nothing.

160
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,955
What licking the dog?
What are you talking about?

161
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,015
Stop talking. Do your homework.

162
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,387
Since the first day I'm here,
I found out that...

163
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,498
you are psychologically "shorter"
than brother-in-law.

164
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:57,856
You are both in class.

165
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:01,093
What makes you think your studies
are less important than his?

166
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,095
Is it because we often brainwash you
that he is excellent?

167
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:07,695
You subconsciously feel that
you are not worthy of him?

168
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,586
What psychologically? What subconscious?

169
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:17,196
Since you are so smart,
why can't you chase that Li Jiayi?

170
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:22,634
The relationship problem between us
are not at the same level, okay?

171
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,018
Don't deny.

172
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,293
Alright, alright.

173
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,330
You are great, you are great.

174
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,528
Look at what you said.

175
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,836
What inferiority complex?
How is this possible?

176
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,411
I am your elder sister, regardless.

177
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,488
Then why don't you announce it
to your family?

178
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,481
Then why are you being so careful?

179
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,270
Are you both dating?

180
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:51,819
Are you worried in case
you both are not like you are now?

181
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,226
Will it break immediately?

182
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,626
Are you here to break the two of us up?

183
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:00,150
Don't you usually
call Nan Xi "brother-in-law"?

184
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,477
Mouth like honey.

185
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,693
Why do you gossip behind someone's back?

186
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,072
You never learn anything good.

187
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,483
Whom are you with every day?

188
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:13,710
I brought you something good.

189
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,329
Write.

190
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:21,934
Keep your mouth shut for two hours.
No talking.

191
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:26,801
If you don't listen to Chen Hao,
you shall suffer.

192
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,734
There is another point
we need to emphasize today is that...

193
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:37,586
Don't rush to show the information
you brought with you, letters, and gifts.

194
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,389
Only when you talk to the client...

195
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:44,626
Xia Rui.

196
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,498
Chen Hao.

197
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,126
Chubby Cheng.

198
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:50,627
Hey, brother.

199
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:51,835
I do not like you anymore.

200
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,276
It doesn't matter,
there are so many people who like me.

201
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:55,451
I don't need you.

202
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:57,028
You little one.

203
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:00,700
Do you know how many people
are begging me to like them?

204
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,985
One can blather better than the other.

205
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:04,053
Correct.

206
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,154
How is Shu?

207
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,805
Why didn't she return my message?

208
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:10,399
She may be in a bad mood today.

209
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,421
In a bad mood? What happened?

210
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,339
Did her recital not go well? Or what?

211
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,094
It's before the recital.

212
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,263
I don't know what's wrong with her either.

213
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:22,566
Forget it. I'll ask her later.

214
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:24,036
I have a class with the Head of Department
in a little bit.

215
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,342
Please take care of this little demon.

216
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,884
-No, no. I made an appointment.
-What appointment?

217
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,600
Except for basketball,
what other arrangements will you have?

218
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,309
Listen to Cheng Erluo. Don't run around.

219
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:34,252
-Take care of him. Bye.
-Xia Rui.

220
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,513
Alright. My sister is gone.

221
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:37,999
Just say anything.

222
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,505
What's the matter with me?

223
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,101
What did I say?

224
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,532
Can't you tell me anything?

225
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:46,678
Is it inappropriate for children?

226
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,793
Am I that kind of person to you?

227
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:50,856
Then tell me. What's the matter?

228
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,988
I'm really going to do something big.

229
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,438
What is that?

230
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:58,060
I can't reveal it.

231
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:00,399
-You'll know when you get there.
-Let's go!

232
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,535
Although I have no idea
what are you going to do,

233
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,366
but, your sneaky look, I like it!

234
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,340
-Let's go.
-Here, here.

235
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,534
Alright.

236
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,197
Chen Hao.

237
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,880
Chen Hao, why are you here?

238
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,116
Does your sister know?

239
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,610
Of course not.

240
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,977
She passed me to Chubby Cheng.

241
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:53,962
But he actually took part
in the stare contest behind my sister.

242
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,686
And almost lost.

243
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,746
I can't bear to see it.

244
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:01,628
So, while he wasn't paying attention,

245
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,765
I sneaked out.

246
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,269
What are you trying to do here?

247
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:07,633
I have observed.

248
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:12,716
By Xia Rui side, only our IQ levels
are on par with each other.

249
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:15,026
Brother-in-law. I've made a decision.

250
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:17,345
I'll follow you before going home.

251
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:19,684
Brother-in-law?

252
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:21,753
He is Xia Rui's younger brother!

253
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,049
How boring.

254
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,775
I thought it was her son.

255
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,562
Don't fool around.

256
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:32,556
I've sent a message to your sister
to pick you up.

257
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:34,621
Okay.

258
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,843
You're so cold to me now.

259
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:39,443
I will make you unable to reach me soon.

260
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:42,933
When you and Xia Rui
announce your relationship,

261
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:46,511
I will pretend you attacked me.

262
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:49,956
Then say you abused
and scolded me in Binhai.

263
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:53,805
See if mom will agree with this marriage.

264
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:01,085
What is that you want?

265
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:03,784
We will become a family soon.

266
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:09,297
But, we don't know each other very well.

267
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,690
How do you want to understand?

268
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,579
We need time.

269
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,048
But I am a little thirsty now.

270
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:27,650
Chen Hao.

271
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,294
Drink it.

272
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:40,866
What is this?

273
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,064
Coffee.

274
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,446
Can this be called coffee?

275
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,202
Binhai University,

276
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:49,428
can't even make a decent cup of coffee?

277
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,332
It is coffee.

278
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,162
Oh, my goodness.

279
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:57,007
You and my sister
have known each other for so long.

280
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,092
Don't you know the only thing
she is good at?

281
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:04,209
The difference between coffee and coffee
is too big.

282
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:10,481
So, what do you think is the difference
between coffee and coffee?

283
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,899
Look at this cup.

284
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,079
Firstly,
the color has no aesthetic feeling to it.

285
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,897
As diluted as the color of the red tea.

286
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:22,513
Followed by the taste.

287
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,232
My vocabulary is limited.

288
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,157
I can't describe to you in detail.

289
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,731
Look at my expression.

290
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,509
You just feel it.

291
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,548
Anyway, the coffee here
is far from the coffee Xia Rui made.

292
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,155
Your sense of taste.

293
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,303
What's up?

294
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:46,826
A little...

295
00:18:47,674 --> 00:18:50,918
-What is it?
-Come, I'll take you to a place.

296
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:53,836
We're not going home, right?

297
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,068
We're not going home.

298
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:56,313
I'm taking you to play.

299
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:57,540
Really?

300
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,074
Really, let's go.

301
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:01,961
Brother-in-law, I love you!

302
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,005
Stay away from me.

303
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,343
Okay.

304
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:12,797
Drink it.

305
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:19,569
What are the characteristics?

306
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,792
A little blueberry. But not very heavy.

307
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,756
And a little chocolate.

308
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:29,128
Recommendation index?

309
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,983
Well, three stars.

310
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,233
Perfect match!

311
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,137
Is this okay?

312
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:56,764
This is okay.

313
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,487
First of all, it is a little purity.

314
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,847
And a little bit of fruity sourness.

315
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,353
And then...

316
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:06,507
Here you are.

317
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:07,887
You're kind and pretty.

318
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,020
Your coffee art is nice.

319
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,175
You are so cute.

320
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:12,929
This coffee art is good.

321
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,523
You can jot it down.

322
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:19,271
This is your coffee.

323
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,500
Enjoy.

324
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:27,207
This is from selected pure beans.

325
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,770
It will taste a bit more mellow.

326
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,537
How many cups have you had today?

327
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:40,358
Let's go.

328
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,665
Romeo, Romeo.

329
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,902
Why are you called Romeo?

330
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:55,992
Deny your father,
abandon your family name.

331
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,714
Maybe you're not willing to do this.

332
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,182
Maybe you're not willing to do this.

333
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,905
But if you swear to be my love,

334
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,877
I don't want to be called Juliet.

335
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,321
Forget about it.

336
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,372
You are not Romeo.

337
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:19,068
I am not Juliet, either.

338
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:21,709
Shu.

339
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:28,163
Xia Rui, why are you here?

340
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,029
I came to see you.

341
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:39,314
This shop is okay, it's a bit...

342
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:40,818
How do I say...

343
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:42,592
-Lack of meaning?
-Meaning?

344
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes, lack of meaning.

345
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,796
Nan Xi.

346
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:52,696
What a coincidence.

347
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,417
Pretty sister.

348
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,942
Who is this cute little brother?

349
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,646
I... I'm his brother-in-law.

350
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:01,767
My name is Chen Hao.

351
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,774
Pretty sister,
do you know my brother-in-law?

352
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,515
You must be Xia Rui's younger brother.

353
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:08,988
Brother-in-law.

354
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:12,279
Nan Xi.

355
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,825
-Are you secretly in love with Xia Rui?
-Yes.

356
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,781
Why didn't you tell me?

357
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:20,579
I figured it out on my own.

358
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,997
Xia Rui has such a cute brother.

359
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,209
-I really envy her.
-Let's go.

360
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:30,026
I think sister
hasn't finished pasting the posters.

361
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,308
-We have to go.
-She can't paste them herself.

362
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:34,182
Why don't I help you?

363
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,543
Can I paste here?

364
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,630
Let me do it. You come down.

365
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,894
Travel safely?

366
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:52,910
Isn't this the end of the term?

367
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,602
The school has more people around.

368
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:57,033
So, the student union made some posters...

369
00:22:57,157 --> 00:23:00,419
to post near the school
reminding everyone to be safe.

370
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:02,805
Last weekend,

371
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:05,727
a female dorm was broken into,
undergarments got stolen.

372
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,899
Being tailed from late night self study.

373
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:09,880
Going to university is terrible.

374
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,875
But this is just a rare case.

375
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:15,554
So, our student union made such posters.

376
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,918
There is also the phone number
of the security room.

377
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:21,469
If you encounter any situations,
you can act immediately.

378
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,653
Sister, you are so pretty and kind.

379
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,179
Why don't we add each other on WeChat?

380
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,662
I will chase you when I grow up.

381
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:29,703
Alright.

382
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:37,377
What? Cheng Erluo said so?

383
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,977
He said he wanted to be your friend?

384
00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:40,494
My goodness! I'm furious.

385
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:43,985
This Cheng Erluo.
Why is he stupid, dull, and dumb?

386
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:46,178
I really didn't beat him enough. Really.

387
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,508
Don't blame him.

388
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:51,134
Maybe he really doesn't have any thoughts
in that regard.

389
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:53,449
Maybe I'm just wishful thinking.

390
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,276
What wishful thinking?

391
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,411
Don't you understand him yet?

392
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:57,612
He is...

393
00:23:58,469 --> 00:23:59,821
very slow.

394
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,115
So slow.

395
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:03,135
It's been so long.

396
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,968
I have tried
both explicitly and implicitly.

397
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,518
No matter how sluggish,
the person would have reacted.

398
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:10,556
But he still treats me as a friend.

399
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,048
The result is very clear.

400
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,895
Xia Rui, don't tell him about this.

401
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:19,724
I don't want to lose him,
even if we stay friends.

402
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:23,278
-Yishu.
-Stop talking about me.

403
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,371
It's nothing.

404
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:25,664
Why are you here?

405
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,623
Shouldn't you be accompanying
your demon little brother?

406
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:30,160
Stop mentioning it, my goodness.

407
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,404
I passed him to Cheng Erluo
in the afternoon.

408
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,001
So unreliable.

409
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:37,340
He took him to a stare contest.

410
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,012
Then didn't watch him,
so he ran to Nan Xi.

411
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
Then why are you looking for me?

412
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,968
I heard that you did not perform well
for your recital?

413
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:46,980
I'm here to comfort you.

414
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,474
Come. Alright...

415
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,595
It's okay, it's okay.

416
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:56,860
It's mom. Wait for me.

417
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,985
Okay.

418
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,669
How is it, mom?

419
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,245
Xia Rui, good news.

420
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,943
You can get rid of Chen Hao tonight.

421
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,719
What... what? What do you mean?

422
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,041
Uncle Chen and I are on our way to Binhai.

423
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:12,915
We will pick him home tonight.

424
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,401
Tonight?

425
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,211
But aren't you coming back
the day after tomorrow?

426
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,441
The company has some issues,
we came back early.

427
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:21,669
Work is definitely more important
than your son.

428
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:24,652
Shouldn't picking up Chen Hao in advance
be something good for you?

429
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,289
What happened?
Did Chen Hao have an accident?

430
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,658
How can that be possible? Of course not!

431
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:30,629
He eats well, drinks well,
sleeps well here.

432
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:31,804
And studies well.

433
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,894
I was just worrying about that.

434
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:35,825
Room rates may not be refunded.

435
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,964
It's a bit of a waste.

436
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:39,917
Don't worry about this.

437
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,671
How much? I'll reimburse it.

438
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:42,914
Okay, that's great! Bye.

439
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:48,018
So refreshing.

440
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:49,892
Relieved.

441
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,504
Let's go to the next stop.

442
00:25:58,881 --> 00:25:59,937
Brother-in-law.

443
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,409
Still drinking?

444
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:04,684
I'm a real minor.

445
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:07,363
You're destroying the flowers
of motherland.

446
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,316
You will be condemned for that.

447
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:13,373
Then go home and do your homework.

448
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,669
It's okay, I can still drink.

449
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,710
Brother-in-law.
Where do you want to drink next?

450
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,035
There's four more.

451
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:27,124
Four more?

452
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:34,668
(Love Art)

453
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,742
Crap, crap, crap.

454
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:39,602
-What to do. What to do?
-What's up?

455
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,269
One phone is switched off.
One not answering.

456
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:47,026
If mom is here and doesn't see Chen Hao
and if she knows I stay with Nan Xi.

457
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,447
I'm in trouble, I tell you.

458
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:50,749
-I'll go find them with you.
-No, we can't.

459
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:52,505
It's a waste of time
if we look for them together.

460
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:54,789
You take a look at the school gate.

461
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,911
Or help me ask
if anyone has seen them both.

462
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,217
I will meet Cheng Erluo.

463
00:26:58,297 --> 00:26:59,828
Go, go. Slow down.

464
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,845
Not out yet.

465
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:03,990
Xia Rui.

466
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,767
What do you mean?
You said Chen Hao was missing with Nan Xi?

467
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:09,336
-What happened?
-Long story. Mom will be here soon.

468
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,537
I can't get in to boy's dorm.
You go have a look.

469
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,059
I'll search at the library
and Architecture School.

470
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:15,123
Let's split. What about Shu?

471
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:16,462
How about I call her?

472
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,943
You still dare mention about her.

473
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:19,773
-Speak properly.
-Why are you beating me?

474
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:21,893
I'll hit you... I'll hit you.

475
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,284
What does this have to do with Shu?

476
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,869
You bastard.
I don't have time to tell you now.

477
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,221
Find them for me quickly.

478
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,533
Or I'll hit your head.

479
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:30,779
Hurry up!

480
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:38,927
Where is Nan Xi?

481
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:40,254
Have you seen Nan Xi?

482
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:41,445
No?

483
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:46,858
Find Nan Xi.

484
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:48,213
Seems like it.

485
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,117
-Hello, security.
-Hello there.

486
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:52,510
Did you see two people. A tall fair one.

487
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,433
There is also a short kid.

488
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:55,697
I've not seen them.

489
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:56,956
No?

490
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,306
Nan Xi.

491
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:11,113
Sorry.

492
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:20,115
Gao Ting, have you seen Nan Xi?

493
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,980
My goodness.

494
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,852
Where did they go?

495
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:30,610
Oh, my goodness...

496
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,525
Xia Rui! Cheng Erluo!

497
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:34,451
Am I hearing things?

498
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,172
What's the matter with you two?

499
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,662
Hi, we are fine.

500
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:49,315
I heard you and Nan Xi are together.

501
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,700
Congratulations!

502
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,108
Yes, indeed!

503
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,856
Our Nan Xi is already owned by someone.

504
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:56,580
Yang. The gossip between you and Nan Xi.

505
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,726
How many years have passed.

506
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,147
You're still into him?

507
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:04,130
Do you mean I am still a bit threatening?

508
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,345
No.

509
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:08,182
-Xia Rui, I didn't mean that.
-Take it easy, I'm just kidding.

510
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:10,393
Me and Nan Xi...

511
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:11,875
How did you know about it?

512
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:14,214
Don't over-think.
I didn't ask about it intentionally.

513
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,054
I just met Nan Xi and your brother today.

514
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,250
You met them both?

515
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,691
Your brother is so cute.

516
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,633
He added me on WeChat
and sent me some photos, too.

517
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:23,019
-What?
-What?

518
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:24,353
Let me see.

519
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:25,638
Hurry up.

520
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,419
My goodness.

521
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:43,620
Excuse me, I'd like to ask,
have you seen this little boy?

522
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,348
There is a tall, thin, fair guy with him.

523
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:47,428
I seem to have seen.

524
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,419
An adult and a child,
two handsome guys, right?

525
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,405
-Yes, yes.
-They were so strange.

526
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,189
They both ordered this cup of coffee.

527
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,679
In the end, only the kid took a sip.

528
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,527
Then, they went there.

529
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:57,979
-There?
-Yes, there.

530
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:00,257
Xia Rui, Shu will come here later.

531
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,308
No, you don't care about Shu now.

532
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:04,541
Let's find them and tell her afterwards.

533
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,762
Brother-in-law.

534
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:09,283
Eight cups.

535
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:11,181
I can't take it anymore.

536
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:14,119
Drinking like this, I will get sick.

537
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,514
You have to be responsible for me.

538
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:19,747
You obviously drank only eight sips.

539
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:21,020
How was it eight cups?

540
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:22,677
All the same.

541
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,287
I'm a kid.

542
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:33,078
Nan Xi!

543
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,948
Chen Hao!

544
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:40,014
-Keep walking.
-Why? My sister called us.

545
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:41,247
Don't look back.

546
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:42,718
Listen to me. Nan Xi.

547
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:43,864
Didn't hear us?

548
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,204
Is it?

549
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:46,767
Nan Xi!

550
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,747
Run!

551
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,890
Why are they running?

552
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,742
We didn't do anything wrong.

553
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:54,160
Chase them!

554
00:30:54,648 --> 00:30:56,361
Hurry up, and don't talk.

555
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:58,847
I can't make it.
I drank so much coffee...

556
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:02,008
and with all this exercise now,
I will fall dead.

557
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:10,651
Xia Rui, are you okay?

558
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:25,043
Hello, mom.

559
00:31:25,123 --> 00:31:27,696
I brought Chen Hao out
to play for a while.

560
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:29,253
I will send you the location.

561
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,710
You can come over to get him.

562
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,786
You're arranging a driver to come over?

563
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:34,926
Okay, I will send you the location.

564
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,228
Okay, bye.

565
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,909
Oh, my goodness!

566
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:47,438
Where are they?

567
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:49,780
They? They?

568
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:55,120
I lost them.

569
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,810
You lost them?

570
00:31:57,101 --> 00:32:00,022
Nan Xi was running away with a small
burden by his leg, and you lost them?

571
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:01,763
No, you can't blame me.

572
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:03,472
I just came from there.

573
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:06,352
Suddenly there's a group of old ladies
coming out at me.

574
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:07,768
When they finally left,

575
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:10,256
both of them were already out of sight.

576
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,386
The person picking up Chen Hao
will come in a while.

577
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,305
And they've disappeared again.

578
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:16,118
Where can I find them?

579
00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:17,809
Let's find them separately.

580
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:19,959
-What else can we do?
-It's the only way.

581
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,734
-Then I go.
-Wait a minute.

582
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,222
Who is this?

583
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:27,577
Nan Xi.

584
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,272
Nan Xi.

585
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,724
I have a question for you.

586
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,121
Tell me honestly.

587
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:42,514
What did you do today?

588
00:32:42,947 --> 00:32:44,328
To be honest.

589
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:45,970
I don't know either.

590
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,126
You don't know where you went?

591
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:52,636
I mean,
it's not that I don't know where I went.

592
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,731
I just don't know why I went.

593
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:58,222
Just for a sip.

594
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:03,356
I have something to tell you.

595
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:07,417
While there is still time,
let's talk about things between men.

596
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,092
Don't be rude! Who are you talking to?

597
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,631
It's not your business anyway.

598
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:14,730
This afternoon.

599
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:18,442
I may have no mature body right now,

600
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:22,289
but I might have already suffered
irreversible damage.

601
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,597
But I know.

602
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,497
It's for my sister's good.

603
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:26,914
But don't be too happy.

604
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,007
You are still under the observation.

605
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:32,752
Now, why don't you tell others
about your relationship?

606
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:35,118
In case it changes someday
and you break up.

607
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:39,044
It's hard to explain to family.

608
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:42,489
I won't.

609
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,366
TV shows teach us
not to speak too confidently.

610
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:50,974
I won't.

611
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,136
Fine, I understand.

612
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:54,870
Xia Rui.

613
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:57,515
-Is this you mom's car?
-Hurry up.

614
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:59,499
Get in the car, Chen Hao.

615
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,581
Chauffeur, please open the trunk.

616
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,614
I'm watching you.

617
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,906
Did Chen Hao take the wrong medicine?

618
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:21,865
Nan Xi, are you being secretive
all day for Xia Rui?

619
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,031
Shut up if you know the truth.

620
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:27,585
We'll still be friends.

621
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,983
Okay, you have to do a little favor
for me too.

622
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:34,154
It's been a whole day.

623
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,275
Are you hungry?

624
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:37,280
Let's get something to eat.

625
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,872
I still have to revise. I'm leaving now.

626
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:42,073
No, Shu.

627
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,796
Eating won't take too much time.

628
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:46,461
I'm not done with you yet
with Shu's issue.

629
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,475
Please reflect on what you did, here.

630
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:49,710
Go.

631
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,566
Xia Rui. Nan...

632
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:55,318
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

633
00:34:57,957 --> 00:35:00,533
Who did I offend today?

634
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,727
You can tell me now.

635
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:27,622
Where did you take Chen Hao to
this afternoon?

636
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:31,210
-If you don't say, I'm leaving.
-Wait a second.

637
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:42,203
(COFFEE MAP)

638
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:43,918
What is this?

639
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:45,493
Coffee map.

640
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:47,343
A gift for you.
