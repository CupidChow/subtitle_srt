1
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,193
Xia Rui!

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,917
Where are you going?

3
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,089
I am staying...
I am staying outside for two days.

4
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,673
Staying outside? I just saw you.

5
00:01:56,151 --> 00:02:00,954
Oh, my goodness! Are you staying in
with that boyfriend of yours?

6
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:06,083
My God, girl!
Do you want everyone to hear it?

7
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,474
How about this?
You help me to keep this a secret.

8
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:12,388
I will pay for all your milk
tea for this month. Okay?

9
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:15,671
But, it's almost the end of the month.

10
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:20,352
I will also pay for next month, alright?

11
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,172
Now that's more like it!
I will help you carry your luggage.

12
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,933
But, let me tell you.

13
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,950
There are things you need be mindful of
when living together.

14
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,320
I read an online comment
from someone saying that...

15
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,850
staying together is one of the reasons
why couples break up.

16
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,636
You better be careful.

17
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:42,406
I treat you for milk tea
and you treat me like this?

18
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:45,091
I am not cursing you.
I am worried about you.

19
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:48,083
Also, what was his explanation
on the photos two days ago?

20
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,977
I saw it with my eyes.

21
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:54,406
You went crazy when you saw photos of him
dancing with other people.

22
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,788
Yang Yufei?

23
00:02:55,869 --> 00:03:00,061
Oh, no. You misunderstood.
That's just a misunderstanding.

24
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:01,439
-Slowly.
-Okay.

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,679
-Watch your hand.
-Alright.

26
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,203
This is the last box.

27
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:15,617
Did I bring too much stuff?

28
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,668
How can it be? Not much.

29
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,747
But, we need to move it upstairs later.

30
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:23,364
Do you want to move it now or later?

31
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,517
Let's move it now.

32
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,436
But...

33
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:33,788
suddenly, I don't have energy.
No energy at all.

34
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,827
Then, do you want to rest for awhile?

35
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,419
I think I probably need to recharge.

36
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,084
Recharge.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,443
What are you doing?

38
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:51,331
Oh, no. Oh, no. I am about to shut down.
I am done for.

39
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:54,663
Low battery.

40
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,258
Alright, fully recharged!

41
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,890
=EPISODE 22
LET'S STOP BEING FRIENDS WITH THEM=

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,767
Xia Rui, are you finished?

43
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,768
Still not done?

44
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:22,935
I am done!

45
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,365
-You are done?
-Yeah.

46
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,275
Let me introduce to you.
This pile over here are clothes...

47
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,891
that are okay to wear again
since they're not dirty.

48
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,794
I can just wear them again.
Over there are my pants.

49
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,985
Also, for these jackets,
you can grab them on the go.

50
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:45,199
As for shoes, I will just
slip on the ones I see.

51
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,167
As for these books,
they are neatly put here.

52
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,808
Look, grab one of it
and there's hospitality management.

53
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:52,230
Isn't it convenient?

54
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,078
I hung up the clothes here
to prevent wrinkling.

55
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:58,518
Over here are my beauty products.

56
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:02,093
Am I an expert in storage?

57
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:06,053
As long as you are comfortable,
then it's fine.

58
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,465
Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

59
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,175
Boss Yi wants me to bring you along
to work tomorrow.

60
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,207
I don't know what he is planning.

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,713
I will accompany you.

62
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:32,376
It's not you accompanying me.
He wants to meet you.

63
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:37,717
If I go there,
it's considered me accompanying you.

64
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,265
Come over here.

65
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,306
You are getting good at sweet talk lately.

66
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:47,817
Who taught you this?

67
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,829
Have you finished memorizing the text?

68
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,393
I am going to memorize it now, Nan Xi.

69
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,183
Nothing, nothing.

70
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:33,306
I have helped you
settle the university forum issue.

71
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,707
Had it not been for Boss Yi intervening,

72
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:38,340
I would have blacklisted Yang Yufei.

73
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:39,986
Yang Yufei?

74
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,847
What does this have anything to do
with her?

75
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:42,991
Why are you taking it out on her?

76
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,672
Isn't she the one who uploaded the post?

77
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:47,287
Of course, it isn't her.

78
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,460
She is also a victim.

79
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:54,267
If she didn't upload the photos,
then who did it?

80
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,627
It was her classmates,
who like spreading baseless rumors.

81
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:01,954
When Yang Yufei was in school,
didn't she have a crush on Nan Xi?

82
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,350
Yes, she did.

83
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:08,685
But, Yang Yufei was not involved in it.

84
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:12,654
Also, I was in that class too.

85
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:14,083
You are spying on Nan Xi?

86
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,676
How is this spying?

87
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:17,240
This is considered as caring, okay?

88
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:20,286
Moreover, Yang Yufei had contacted me,

89
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,222
to tell me that she will help me
delete the post.

90
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,502
The innocent need not do anything.

91
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:27,207
Just letting it to is the best response.

92
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:29,222
Didn't you have a crush on Yang Yufei?

93
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,750
What happened all of a sudden?

94
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,395
I, Binzi, am a person with principles.

95
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,192
I always focus on facts, not people.

96
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:37,949
Let me tell you.
Be careful with your words.

97
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,143
You might lose the people you love.

98
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,976
Okay.

99
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,199
Sorry to keep you waiting.

100
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:55,411
Oh, my goodness.

101
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,974
How is he so handsome?

102
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,525
I want to add him on WeChat.

103
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,648
I see what you did there, Boss Yi.

104
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,394
Without him here,
your business wouldn't run.

105
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:14,213
I was wondering why you asked Nan Xi
to come here.

106
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,433
It's because you wanted him to be the
mascot to increase customer turnover.

107
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:18,571
I disagree with that.

108
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,691
I gave him the best spot in the cafe.

109
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:22,805
Why?

110
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,407
So that he can appreciate your charm
while you work.

111
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,258
If you don't believe me,
ask him if he likes it or not.

112
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,596
Nan Xi didn't even want to come here
to begin with.

113
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,887
You really are a fox.
Good with words, too.

114
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,248
You are misusing the idioms again.

115
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,085
Why does your Nan Xi
have to be so attractive?

116
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:39,262
Look at them.

117
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:41,068
To show you my appreciation,

118
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:44,962
I will teach you the core technique
of making coffee, okay?

119
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:46,701
Deal!

120
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:52,709
It's a rare opportunity
to see our boss perform.

121
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:53,904
Is the camera focused?

122
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,052
Yes, of course.

123
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,877
Let me see, let me see.

124
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,220
What do you think?

125
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,722
Was it worth your tuition fees?

126
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,908
Master, please accept me as your disciple.

127
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:09,838
Stand up.

128
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:12,531
Hurry up and deliver the coffee
to the customer.

129
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,228
Wait, let me do a closeup. Put it here.

130
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,552
When did you start this hobby?

131
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,916
As the only full-time employee here,

132
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:24,392
I have 3,128 fans, you know?

133
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:26,112
My fan base is even larger than Nan Xi's.

134
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,763
Then, you can do a live broadcast.

135
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,295
Don't people do eating broadcast lately?

136
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,669
You can do a live broadcast
just by drinking coffee.

137
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:34,869
Good idea.

138
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,713
Let me take another picture.

139
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,900
Wow, you even put a filter on the picture.

140
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,204
Are the two of you done?

141
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:42,277
The coffee will get cold
if you don't stop talking about it.

142
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,314
Okay, okay, okay.

143
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,010
Whose salary should I deduct
if customers complain?

144
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,158
No, no, no.

145
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,192
Wow, if a person is handsome,

146
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,303
he looks good in every photo,
no matter it was taken.

147
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,239
Hey, what kind of photo is this?

148
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,771
This angle doesn't do justice to his face.
You still think he looks good?

149
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:06,387
He was just sitting down
while I took these.

150
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,382
Why don't you try?

151
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,538
Okay then, I will try. Go away.

152
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:10,767
Oh, my gosh.

153
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,137
Stretch your legs out. Stretch them.

154
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:17,922
Pose for the camera. A handsome pose.

155
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,233
Yes, that's it!

156
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,575
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

157
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,770
Take it.

158
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:28,660
This photo looks better.

159
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,624
Hi, can you send us a copy of the photo?

160
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,741
Oh, I have a lot of photos. Do you...

161
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,063
No, no, no thanks.

162
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,592
Follow me. Follow me.

163
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:58,347
Nan Xi!

164
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:00,182
Huh? What?

165
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:01,363
Nan Xi!

166
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,009
What is happening?

167
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:07,877
Nan Xi, Nan Xi!

168
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,370
Did you just disconnect the internet?

169
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,696
In the future,
the internet will be off at 11:00.

170
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:15,044
This..This is not a university dormitory!

171
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:18,398
Why did you disconnect the internet?
I am playing games! They will report me!

172
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,800
What time do you usually sleep?

173
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,294
When I am in the dormitory,

174
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:23,879
I only sleep
when they disconnect the internet.

175
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,995
What time do you go to sleep now?

176
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,150
Now...

177
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,319
I slept a little late.

178
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,735
This is the second time this week...

179
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,162
that I saw you staying up till morning,
playing games.

180
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:41,717
It's not because I like this game
that I played it.

181
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:43,302
I played it just to kill time.

182
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,079
Kill time?

183
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,022
Didn't you stay up late, too?

184
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:52,006
I was watching a documentary
to get some inspiration.

185
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,667
So that's why I...

186
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,052
So...

187
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:02,437
So, that's why you stayed up late
playing games...

188
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,249
just to accompany me?

189
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,955
I am going to sleep.

190
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:12,464
Xia Rui.

191
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:16,148
I am sorry. It's my fault.

192
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,580
I disconnected the internet
without asking you.

193
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,467
So, you are just going to say sorry?

194
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:30,873
Or why don't I just reconnect
the internet for you?

195
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,448
There is no need.

196
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,740
Unless you play a game with me.

197
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,511
Can you?

198
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,402
Alright, let's play.

199
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,961
-You laughed.
-I didn't.

200
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,271
-Give it to me. You laughed.
-I didn't.

201
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,567
-I didn't.
-My turn.

202
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,006
-I didn't laugh.
-You laughed.

203
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,597
Come, come, come.

204
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:14,031
I don't want to.

205
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,278
I want to draw on you.

206
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:24,860
-You laughed!
-I didn't.

207
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,634
Why are you still fooling around?

208
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:30,428
Are you this brave now?

209
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,530
You can't draw me.

210
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,877
Nan Xi drew too much on your face.

211
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,759
Who knew that this marker pen stain
would be hard to wash off?

212
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:50,365
Let me tell you.
Nan Xi's face is no better than mine.

213
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:51,885
There's still a mole near his mouth.

214
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,918
I feel better when I think about it.

215
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:58,728
I don't know if it's still a good idea
for both of you to live together.

216
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,647
Hey, is Chubby Cheng helping Si Bo
to go after you?

217
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,589
It looked like Si Bo asked him personally
for help.

218
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:13,404
Or maybe it's like what they said.
They just happened to talk about me.

219
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,920
He's too stupid.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,843
He's too slow. He's too insensitive.

221
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:24,218
Anybody could tell there was a reason
why Si Bo kept talking about you.

222
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,000
He is not just insensitive,
but hard-headed as wood.

223
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,637
You already gave him so many hints.
How come he still don't get it?

224
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,602
Yeah, it's been so long.

225
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,583
I thought that
he would understand me by now.

226
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:39,443
You also know that we girls mature earlier
than boys.

227
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:44,373
I thought I could wait.
Three years, five years, ten years.

228
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:47,673
But now, even when someone pursues me,

229
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,606
he still isn't bothered by it
and just goes with it.

230
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:54,773
I don't think I can't wait any longer.

231
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:57,720
It's also my fault.

232
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,562
I was so busy moving out
that I had no time to teach him.

233
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,017
Seriously.

234
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:05,782
It's okay.
Actually, that's his own problem.

235
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,354
Good thing I am busy recently.

236
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,446
Busy with rehearsals.

237
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:11,050
My first TV show started script reading.

238
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:13,738
I don't need to think
of all those messy things.

239
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:18,188
Finally,
others will get to see my precious friend.

240
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,556
Congratulations!

241
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:27,161
What are you guys talking about?
You both look happy.

242
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,458
I will go back to rehearsals first.

243
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:32,793
Don't... Don't, Shu.
Why do you leave when you see me?

244
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:34,686
Are you still mad at me?

245
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,004
It's has nothing to do with you.

246
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,853
You... Why are you avoiding me recently?

247
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:41,845
Stop interrupting her rehearsals, alright?

248
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:43,487
How about this?

249
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,894
Tonight, both of you come to our house.

250
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,311
I haven't treated you both to a meal
after I moved out.

251
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,758
Tonight, Nan Xi will be cooking.

252
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:56,152
Let's have a housewarming party.

253
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:57,168
What do you say?

254
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,489
What do you say?

255
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:02,480
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

256
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,322
The post was really taken down.

257
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,616
Could it be that
I misunderstood her before?

258
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:13,934
Binzi, seriously.

259
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,673
Xia Rui already said that
it was a misunderstanding.

260
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:17,988
Not only you don't trust her,

261
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,866
but you also didn't sell any coffee
and was absent for half a day.

262
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,518
I would have forgotten about this matter.

263
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,588
I haven't deducted your salary
for your absence.

264
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,241
Don't overdo it, Boss Yi.

265
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,313
I am just helping Xia Rui clear her name.

266
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:30,369
Hmm, how generous of you.

267
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,506
This was just a simple misunderstanding.

268
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:35,904
It became more complicated
after you butted in.

269
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,635
Then, did I really misunderstand Yufei?

270
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:44,647
Hey, your general
has created a chance for you.

271
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:50,803
Boss Yi,
did you do something behind my back?

272
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:52,758
Young man.

273
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,513
This is me helping you.

274
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,451
What do you want to drink?

275
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:04,290
One cup of latte, no sugar.

276
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,298
Alright.

277
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:09,092
Who was the one who swore
not to sell me any coffee a few days ago?

278
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:13,462
Yufei.

279
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,499
It's my fault.

280
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,041
I knew you were the one
who took down the post about Xia Rui.

281
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,279
An apology is not enough.
You need to show me some sincerity.

282
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,522
Boss Yi, are you done with
the six cups of espresso that I ordered?

283
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,848
Coming!

284
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:31,285
Here you go, boss! Your coffee.

285
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:36,005
Do you really want Binzi
to finish all of these in one go?

286
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,686
Didn't you say that
he wants to prove his sincerity?

287
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,394
Drink all of these in one go?

288
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,121
Maybe you should forget it.

289
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,598
There's a proverb that says,
"A real man is flexible."

290
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:48,630
Right?

291
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,606
Sometimes,
a man should back down when he can.

292
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,528
Forget it, forget it.

293
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:53,913
Don't stop me, boss.

294
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:55,176
I will drink it.

295
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,274
I, Binzi,
always take responsibility for my actions.

296
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:59,194
What's right, is right.
What's wrong, is wrong.

297
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,735
What a real man.

298
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,485
What a real man, indeed.

299
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,362
I didn't ask you to drink them all.

300
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:14,718
I am done.

301
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,268
Anyhow, Yufei. I was wrong.

302
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:21,409
I shouldn't have treated you poorly
before finding out the truth.

303
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,201
Alright, I forgive you.

304
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,035
Really?

305
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:27,133
-Not satisfied?
-Satisfied, satisfied!

306
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:31,025
Boss Yi, I have class later.
I'll leave first.

307
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:32,784
Bye!

308
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:34,760
Goodbye.

309
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:36,256
You're welcome.

310
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:37,699
Alright, stop peeping!

311
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:45,767
Binzi, you already apologize
and confessed to her.

312
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,924
Why are you still acting?
Go and wash the cups!

313
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,154
Who confessed?

314
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,584
Nothing, nothing.

315
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:54,668
However, let me tell you,
these will be deducted from your salary.

316
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:59,158
Fine, I am in a good mood today.
Go ahead and deduct my salary.

317
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,621
But, I'd like to ask you something.
My heartbeat should be faster...

318
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,077
after drinking these espressos.
How come I still feel so calm?

319
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:09,860
Well, maybe someone has secretly
add water into the espresso.

320
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,070
Boss Yi, you are the best.

321
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,217
Go away, go away!

322
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,168
I am worried that you lost your sanity
while apologizing.

323
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,685
Since you already added water,
you can't ask me to pay for six cups.

324
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,868
-The most is two cups.
-No, can't do!

325
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,852
Three cups!

326
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,050
Deal!

327
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,437
-Xia Rui.
-Yes?

328
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:28,331
I have been wanting to ask you something.

329
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:29,420
Ask ahead.

330
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:32,477
Living together... No.

331
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:35,085
How's life staying in the same place?
Is it good?

332
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,313
You can't be serious.

333
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,264
Both of you have such good life now.

334
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:48,071
We have completely different habits
and schedules.

335
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:52,087
I like to sleep in through the morning.
He wakes me up 6:00 AM.

336
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:57,430
She just placed her stuff everywhere.
It's so messy that she put it outside.

337
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,500
Also, he especially likes to hide stuff.

338
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,519
I can never find it
whenever I need to use it.

339
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,800
Do you know that
she doesn't like to clean up?

340
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,439
He can mop for 800 times in one day.

341
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,487
I even think that the floor
wouldn't get so dirty easily.

342
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,029
She forgets to close the door
when she uses the toilet.

343
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:20,395
Also, he walks around without a sound.
It scared me in the middle of night...

344
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,394
so much that I almost had a heart attack.

345
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,456
Well, from my perception,

346
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:26,897
I don't think it's suitable
for you to live together.

347
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,397
Seeing this, I think that
you will break up sooner or later.

348
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,021
Impossible!

349
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,073
Come, Shu. Have some.

350
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,528
You only gave her vegetables?

351
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,048
Thank you.

352
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:43,399
Shu, you don't need to thank me.
I am not used to you thanking me.

353
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:45,434
You will get used to it.

354
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:50,672
Don't we have ice cream in the fridge?

355
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:53,636
We have all flavors.
Later, you can eat any of it as you like.

356
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,410
I've been trying to quit sugar recently.
You guys just go ahead.

357
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,861
Shu, you don't need to lose weight.
You will become too thin if you do.

358
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,258
Xia Rui, why did you kick me?

359
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,882
Just eat your food, alright?
And don't talk with your mouth full.

360
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:10,881
I'll go wash some more vegetables.

361
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,394
I'll help you.

362
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:13,903
Just eat!

363
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,778
Do you still remember Bailing
from our dormitory?

364
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,717
-Bailing?
-Yes.

365
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:22,522
Her mother wants her to go matchmaking.
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:26,099
What's the rush?
She hasn't graduated yet.

367
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,130
Also, Bailing is pretty.
Why the rush for matchmaking?

368
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,565
How is being pretty
related to matchmaking?

369
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:38,315
Shu, will your family
also arrange matchmaking for you?

370
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:39,446
How ridiculous!

371
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:40,935
It's ridiculous?

372
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,188
It's ridiculous!

373
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,403
People should be together because of love.

374
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,807
You see, for matchmaking,

375
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,788
everyone just state their conditions.

376
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:53,428
They compare candidates with each other
like in the market.

377
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:54,909
I don't think it's ridiculous.

378
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:57,128
The objective is there
along with the conditions.

379
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,929
If it's works, fine. If it doesn't,
just split up. I think it's good.

380
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:03,655
Shu, how can you be thinking like this?

381
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:08,052
Let's stop talking about the matchmaking.

382
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:10,414
Aren't we celebrating us
moving in together?

383
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:12,049
-Come, come, come.
-Xia Rui, wait.

384
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,148
Shu,

385
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:18,740
I think that it's not good
for you to think so.

386
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:21,218
As a long time friend since a young age,

387
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,244
I should help you, give you some advice.

388
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,502
Falling in love
isn't something you trade with others.

389
00:22:25,582 --> 00:22:28,429
You need to find someone that you love.
That way you'll be happy.

390
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,641
How will you know that if I love him,
he also loves me back?

391
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,331
Shu, you have someone that you love?

392
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,606
Who's the guy? Do we know him?

393
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,776
Can't we just eat?

394
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:42,034
If we can't finish the food,
I will put all of it into your mouth.

395
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:43,674
Just eat!

396
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:46,227
Your saliva is all over the table.
Just continue eating.

397
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:47,531
Eat, eat, eat.

398
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,420
No, why are both of you
attacking me today?

399
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,420
Just eat.

400
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,929
Xia Rui, I have to leave first.
I will see you tomorrow.

401
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,109
I will send you off.

402
00:22:57,189 --> 00:23:00,038
Why are you leaving so soon?
There's still plenty of food.

403
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:06,226
She's walking home alone. It's dangerous.
Aren't you sending her off?

404
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,409
He doesn't have to.
I can walk home alone.

405
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,982
What are you doing?
Do you want me to beat you up?

406
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:18,099
-Go. Hurry up. Pick up the pace.
-Shu!

407
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,397
Oh, my goodness.

408
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,015
Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness.

409
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:30,786
Being their friend is tiring.

410
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:32,714
I am mentally tired.

411
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:35,338
Let's stop being friends with them.

412
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,310
We should have done so earlier.

413
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,738
We should stop bothering
with their issues.

414
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:42,611
We can't intervene.

415
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,016
Shu, Shu.

416
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,544
Shu, I want to talk to you.

417
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:49,840
Talk about what?

418
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,352
I think what you did today
was unacceptable.

419
00:23:53,318 --> 00:23:54,356
What did I do?

420
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,687
You can lash out on me.

421
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:59,210
But, you can't do it
to Nan Xi and Xia Rui.

422
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,820
It's hard for us to meet up together.

423
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,127
The meet up turned sour because of us.

424
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:07,094
What you meant to say is that
I am the party pooper, is it?

425
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,845
I will just open up the truth.

426
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:13,644
No matter what I said, you'll be angry.
I might as well tell you the truth.

427
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:15,765
You want me to be honest with you?

428
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:17,577
Okay, let me tell you.

429
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,989
Cheng Erluo,
do you know that you're a hopeless idiot?

430
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:24,177
I am angry
but that's not the reason for my anger.

431
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:26,656
Every time, you don't even why I am angry.

432
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:28,817
You always think that
I am being unreasonable, right?

433
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:30,855
How could it be not?

434
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,111
I kept on thinking
about my mistakes recently.

435
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:36,550
I just didn't come and fetch you.
I already told you I was training.

436
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,746
In your eyes,

437
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,274
I was easily provoked
by small matters, is it?

438
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:42,692
Let me tell you.

439
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,881
I am furious, but it's not because of you
missing out on picking me up.

440
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,037
The reason is because...

441
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:51,320
when I tried to distance myself from you,
you kept on bonding with me.

442
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,958
When I tried to bond with you,
you ditched me cruelly.

443
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,452
I am angry because...

444
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,631
no matter what I said, you,
being a blockhead will never get it!

445
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,379
What have I done wrong?

446
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,668
When did I ditch you cruelly?

447
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:06,663
Just like this!

448
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,619
If you want to quarrel, then fine.

449
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,018
Why did you become like Xia Rui?

450
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,951
Xia Rui, Xia Rui.

451
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:29,058
Are you okay?

452
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,065
Stomach ache.

453
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,612
Stomach ache?

454
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:33,750
Yes.

455
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:38,986
Wait here.

456
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,536
Oh, my gosh.

457
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,619
Come, drink this brown sugar water.

458
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,418
Why do I need to drink this?

459
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:06,714
Don't ask any question. Just drink it.

460
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:14,648
I don't want to drink it.

461
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:15,781
No, you have to.

462
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,022
Have one more sip.

463
00:26:17,102 --> 00:26:18,278
Come on.

464
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,670
Drink more. It's good for you.

465
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,590
I don't want to drink it, Nan Xi.

466
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,127
Okay, okay, okay.

467
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:32,066
Lay down.

468
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,849
What... What are you doing?

469
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,093
Why are you giving me a heating pad?

470
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:16,518
I asked Shu.

471
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:18,552
She said that this is more comfortable.

472
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,580
If you are still in pain,

473
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:24,736
let's call her and ask her again.

474
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,524
What did you consult her on?

475
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,598
It's on.

476
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,820
It's about that thing.

477
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:40,422
Well, don't your period come
and visit you every month?

478
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:45,365
I asked her what can a man do
during that time.

479
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:48,080
No... Nan Xi.

480
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:49,741
I do not...

481
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:53,480
But I need to go to the bathroom.

482
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:21,321
Come and sit down.

483
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:25,747
Let's take another sip.

484
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,591
Nan Xi, it's not that.

485
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,517
It's not because of my period.

486
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:40,093
It's probably because
of the expired ice-cream.

487
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,140
You...

488
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:50,792
You got a stomach ache?

489
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:51,921
Yes.

490
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:56,332
When did you prepare all of these things?

491
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,993
Tell me, is there anything else?

492
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:01,909
I just remembered that
I still haven't completed my assignment.

493
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:03,274
I am going to do so now.

494
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:05,190
The Woodie is getting embarrassed.

495
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,962
No.

496
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:25,550
Come on, it's still not good enough?

497
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:28,995
Three meters isn't enough for each floor.

498
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:31,086
Three meters is still not enough?

499
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,647
The height for public building
should be 3.9 meters for each floor.

500
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,673
There's a 30-meter difference.

501
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,226
You need to redo this building plan.

502
00:29:40,974 --> 00:29:42,343
Oh, he's right.

503
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,212
What were you thinking throughout the day?

504
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,477
You put only three meters for each floor.

505
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:49,241
Are you constructing an apartment?

506
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,130
It's easier to count that way.

507
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,042
Didn't you know
there's a thing called a calculator?

508
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:56,803
How can you get into Binhai University
with this brain?

509
00:29:56,883 --> 00:29:59,014
Don't you dare insult me!

510
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:01,481
You got chips on my building plan!

511
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:04,230
If you are so good,
show Nan Xi your building plan!

512
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,201
I haven't finish drawing mine.

513
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:11,016
Nan Xi, have you finish drawing yours?

514
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,962
Let us have a look.
We want to learn from it.

515
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:25,781
This is so meticulous!

516
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:29,317
Nan Xi, you're a genius in architecture!

517
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:32,446
My graduation project
might not be as excellent as this.

518
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:37,004
Looks like you are a shoe in
for first place in midterm.

519
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,034
It's marvelous!

520
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,212
Senior, what are you doing here?

521
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:47,527
Professor Gu asked me to help out
with the design competition.

522
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:49,088
I happened to pass by. So, I came in.

523
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:53,055
I heard that this year's
architecture design competition...

524
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:54,436
will be held in our campus.

525
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:55,596
Also, I heard that...

526
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:59,564
the winner will get to participate
in an exchange program in Italy.

527
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:01,994
Why both of you knew everything?

528
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:04,436
How is this a secret?

529
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:05,882
It's nothing!

530
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,617
Are you interested in taking part?

531
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:10,986
Hao Tian,
I think both of us can give it a try.

532
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:14,779
What if we got lucky
and we got the first place.

533
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:16,655
We will then be popular in campus.

534
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:20,532
No way. I was already badly abused
by Nan Xi at home.

535
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,357
I don't want to get humiliated
in public again.

536
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:23,739
Come here to help me have a look.

537
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,160
Why did you give up easily?

538
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,868
What about you, Nan Xi?

539
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:28,597
Interested in taking part?

540
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,664
Thanks, senior. But, I am not interested.

541
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,369
Your talent should be seen by the public.

542
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,570
Architecture isn't a competition.

543
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,379
It's okay...

544
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,188
since the deadline for sign ups
is still a long way.

545
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,813
If you change your mind,
go and look for Professor Gu.

546
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,741
Thanks, senior!

547
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:53,686
Are you going to Cafe Yami?

548
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,513
Senior, you also know Cafe Yami?

549
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,583
Everyone knows it.

550
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:02,610
I heard that the coffee
and the environment there is good.

551
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,927
I happened to be free today.

552
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,358
Can you show me the way
so that I can try the coffee there?

553
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:21,304
Come, have a look.

554
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,131
How is it?

555
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:28,040
Eight points!

556
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,474
Not bad, Xia Rui!

557
00:32:31,554 --> 00:32:34,610
You have mastered coffee art
during the whole afternoon.

558
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,183
Looks like aside from having
an excellent sense of taste,

559
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:38,795
you have skills too.

560
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:42,145
You are my top student.

561
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,588
Nan Xi, is it pretty?

562
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:46,752
It's pretty.

563
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:50,733
You are not listening
to a professional opinion from the master.

564
00:32:50,813 --> 00:32:51,679
But you are asking him?

565
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,606
Aside from looking at you passionately
and telling you,

566
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,654
"The drink is good."

567
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,913
"The food is good."

568
00:32:57,993 --> 00:32:59,350
What else can he do?

569
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,184
The drink is delicious and pretty.

570
00:33:03,264 --> 00:33:04,815
Then, it's good enough.

571
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:08,212
Try my first creation. Try it, try it.

572
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:11,622
Even though this coffee
is for you to practice,

573
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:13,307
you can't simply give it others.

574
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,181
-Is it good?
-It's good.

575
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,407
Are you listening to what I am saying?

576
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:20,788
I will also let Si Bo try it
and get his opinion.

577
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,606
Is my business still running?

578
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:25,745
Is my business still running?

579
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:28,603
Why so stingy?
Just deduct it from my salary.

580
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:31,448
Looks like it doesn't matter
whether I am the boss.

581
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,580
I think it's best
to give the WBC invitation...

582
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,090
to someone else.

583
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,912
WBC?

584
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,493
Invitation?

585
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:43,648
And he is bragging about it.

586
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,157
I can only brag about it now.

587
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,071
Is this for real?

588
00:33:50,768 --> 00:33:52,039
Let me have a look.

589
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,535
It's my fault, it's my fault.

590
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,363
-Let me see.
-Have a good look.

591
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,479
Is this real or fake?

592
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:04,572
You really have a hidden talent.

593
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:07,908
Your master is in the coffee business
for many years.

594
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:11,624
I just happened to see through that world.

595
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:13,687
What is WBC?

596
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:16,182
It's the World Barista Competition.

597
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,669
This is an exclusive competition.

598
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:21,640
Baristas who made their debut
at the competition are geniuses.

599
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,185
You also know that I am a relaxed person.

600
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:26,880
I don't like being in the competition.

601
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:30,089
But, I went to the WBC a few times.

602
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,470
They learn from each other,
which creates a good environment.

603
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,126
This year, they organized
another competition in Jiangzhou.

604
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:39,448
They specifically asked me to participate.

605
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:43,214
I am still considering
whether to go or not.

606
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,213
That's being ungrateful.

607
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,571
Others are dying for this chance
and you're still hesitant to participate.

608
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,421
What a show off!

609
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,475
How about you take my place
in the competition?

610
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:56,923
Be the representative of our cafe.
What do you say?

611
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:00,549
Are you joking? How can I participate
in such grand competition?

612
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:04,303
Young lady, this competition
is an excellent opportunity...

613
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:07,336
for youngsters to practice their skills.

614
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:11,326
If you want to be a top barista,

615
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,215
aside from skills,

616
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:15,761
your mentality is also important.

617
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,735
Learn from the experts.

618
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:23,146
Meeting the masters will benefit you.

619
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:26,272
Wouldn't I embarrass you if I participate?

620
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:29,526
I told you,
I don't bother with trivialities of life.

621
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,706
Why should I be afraid
of being humiliated?

622
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:35,969
Why is it that your words
don't sound encouraging at all?

623
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:37,281
Xia Rui.

624
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:39,307
Go and have a try.

625
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:42,896
No, this is a grand competition.

626
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,214
As a beginner,
isn't this a little too fast?

627
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:47,378
I believe in you.

628
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:50,640
But, I lack self-confidence.

629
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,256
Then I'll go with you.

630
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,520
To Jiangzhou?

631
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,039
Yes, to Jiangzhou.

632
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:58,434
Nan Xi said he will go with you.

633
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:00,104
You should believe in yourself.

634
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:07,156
Am I making a hasty decision?

635
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:09,597
I now regret it a little bit.

636
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:14,378
What should I do for the preliminary,
Nan Xi?
