1
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,600
=Meeting You=

2
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,270
Come and see what grandma has found!

3
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,960
Stop looking.

4
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,380
It was nice.

5
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,670
Quiet cute.

6
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,520
It's black history.

7
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,240
Like a doll.

8
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,580
Then she grew up so fast
and became a tomboy.

9
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,690
Is she 5 years old in this?

10
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,070
That was the year
her mother started her career.

11
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,570
We took her here.

12
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,290
Her father passed away early.

13
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,170
Grandma, don't be like this.

14
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,890
Why are you saying this in front of her?

15
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,360
Come on.

16
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,010
Let's not look at this.

17
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,940
Let's watch TV.

18
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,990
"Approaching Science" is next.

19
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,720
Let's watch TV.

20
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,200
Nan Xi.

21
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,590
I knew you didn't sleep.

22
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,600
Here you go.

23
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,750
You have to forget about the photos.

24
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,770
You have to forget.

25
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,760
Forget everything.

26
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,800
I can't forget them.

27
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,390
You can't forget them?

28
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Can't forget, huh?

29
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,330
Then I will do some magic.

30
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,850
Nanxi, Nanxi, forget them all.

31
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,530
I won't forget the pictures.

32
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,230
You cried when you were young.

33
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
Do you remember?

34
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,570
I asked you to do flips
on the monkey bars.

35
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,110
And just right after you flipped...

36
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
Your pants ripped, and I saw your bottom.

37
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,430
I won't laugh at you.

38
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,570
Nan Xi.

39
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
If...?

40
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,600
Would you like
to go back to your childhood?

41
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,230
No.

42
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,520
If it was me,

43
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,190
I wouldn't go back, either.

44
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,000
Because I think I am quite happy now.

45
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,560
Because I am with my Xiaomuto.

46
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,120
But I have a little regret.

47
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
What do you regret?

48
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,230
That it would be great if I'm not ill.

49
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,790
We can cross the year together.

50
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,840
Then celebrate the birthday happily.

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,160
Wouldn't that be nice?

52
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,030
We can celebrate my birthday together.

53
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,280
I will celebrate every birthday
in the future with you.

54
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,120
Thank you, Xiaomuto.

55
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,960
Xia Rui.

56
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,920
Thank you.

57
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,360
(Episode 13: Binhai, we're coming.)

58
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,440
Xia Rui.

59
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,040
Happy birthday.

60
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,170
I love you, Xiao Meishu.

61
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,820
What would you like to eat today?
It's my treat.

62
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,610
This is Cheng Erluo's gift.

63
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,690
It's a gift voucher for Bird-Tea coffee.

64
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,390
Chubby Cheng knows how to save time.

65
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,730
He doesn't have much time.

66
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,370
You always stand on his side.

67
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,120
So I forgive him.

68
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,700
Let's go.

69
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,640
Did you see Mr. Hu this morning?

70
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,140
He has band-aid on his face
and he was limping.

71
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,100
And he didn't ride his precious bicycle.

72
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,450
He came by the bus.

73
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,570
Do you know why...?

74
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,240
-Why?
-For protecting students.

75
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,290
Mr. Hu faced violence
and didn't make a sweat.

76
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,850
Is that true?

77
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,590
A hundred percent true!

78
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,850
Here comes the evidence.

79
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,140
Come, sit down.

80
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,460
You are one of the students
who is being protected.

81
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,260
Can you share it with us?

82
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,400
-Share what?
-What do you want her to say?

83
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,140
Mr. Hu's heroic behavior
of saving her and Cheng Erluo.

84
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,540
How did you know that?

85
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,300
I'm telling the truth. She admitted it.

86
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,110
But what happened to her
and Cheng Erluo?

87
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,770
She and Cheng Erluo were almost bullied
by the gangsters on new year's eve.

88
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,970
Mr. Hu saved them.

89
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,150
Are you hurt?
Cheng Erluo should've protected you.

90
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,660
-What 's wrong with him?
-I am fine.

91
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,160
-The two of them are fine.
-We are fine.

92
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,860
Mr. Hu was injured pretty badly.

93
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,410
Mr. Hu? Why?

94
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,160
The whole world knows about it.

95
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
-Only you don't.
-The whole world knows?

96
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,850
I hope you didn't tell the other classes.

97
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,600
Mr. Hu was beaten by some gangsters
for saving his students.

98
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,200
Is it for real? That was amazing.

99
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,081
There is more. He then shouted,

100
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:16,191
"No one can touch my students!"

101
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,040
So manful!

102
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,370
Such a brave man!

103
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,070
But it seemed he was beaten quiet badly.

104
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,720
-I feel sorry for him.
-That was how he got in injured.

105
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,710
It's almost class time.

106
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,710
Hurry.

107
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
The rumor is true.

108
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,140
It's all my fault
for being sick at that moment.

109
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,880
If I were there,
I wouldn't have left Mr. Hu alone.

110
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,880
Chubby Cheng was useless.

111
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,720
I am glad you had a fever.

112
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,100
Hurry, tell me the details.

113
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,819
How did Mr. Hun help you?
And how did Cheng Erluo ran away?

114
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,100
He didn't run away.

115
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,920
He was just worried I got hurt.

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,500
Mr. Hu's shouting did frighten us.

117
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,160
My mind went blank,
so we followed his words and left.

118
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
Mr. Hu...

119
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,920
He's strict to us in class.

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,500
He's quite a gentleman
when an emergency happens.

121
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,499
According to this,
we should give him a pennant.

122
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,680
Class leader, am I right?

123
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,000
A pennant is bit old-fashioned,
don't you think?

124
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,780
You are right.

125
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,780
The we have to show him our respect.

126
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,120
-Yes.
-I wanted to stay low-key.

127
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,480
Now people
are talking about this everywhere.

128
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,120
Without him thinking,
it was Cheng Erluo who spread the news.

129
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,559
He is about to go to training.

130
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,019
He's not worried
about what Mr. Hu will say to him.

131
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,600
And he started to play dead.

132
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,960
Stand up.

133
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,060
Good morning, teacher.

134
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,560
Good morning, everyone.

135
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,140
I accidentally fell
in the bathroom last night.

136
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,840
Applause.

137
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,200
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Hu.

138
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,240
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Hu!

139
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,980
Who cleaned the board?

140
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,080
The dust came into my eyes.

141
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,400
Thank you for your hard work.

142
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,160
You didn't expect us the be so sensitive.

143
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,020
Mr. Hu, maybe you should have a day off.

144
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,940
We will be good.

145
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,880
Yes, have a rest Mr. Hu.

146
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,300
Okay, all of you should sit down.

147
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,000
I know what you are planning.

148
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,560
You want to butter me up.

149
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,860
I will give you less quizzes, am I right?

150
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,060
Let me tell you, it's impossible.

151
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,420
I may be hurt a bit,

152
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,560
but I have enough strength to teach you.

153
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,040
-That's true.
-That's true.

154
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,140
I will tell you something important.

155
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,880
This week, the school will invite
some professors from all universities...

156
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,840
to do seminars for everyone.

157
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,240
They are from all professions.

158
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,680
You can check out the details
on the bulletin board.

159
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,840
What we need to emphasize,

160
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,604
for those who plan
to apply to schools on their own,

161
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:49,219
you can pay more attention to that.

162
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,060
Don't miss it.

163
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,900
Open your books to page 32.

164
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
(Lecture of the Department of Architecture
in Binhai University)

165
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,300
There will be a lecture from the professor
of Architecture next Thursday.

166
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,000
I have to tell Nan Xi.

167
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
But there will be a lot of people
in the hall.

168
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,980
Won't Nan Xi be uneasy?

169
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,600
Don't worry, I'll go with him.

170
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,620
You forgot what Dr. Lin said.

171
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,160
If there is a slight
emotional fluctuation,

172
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
Nan Xi's grades will be affected.

173
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,200
You are right.

174
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,159
I almost forgot.
He was three places down in the last exam.

175
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,880
No, that's not a good idea.

176
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,300
But there's actually nothing
to worry about.

177
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,440
He dropped from ninth to 12th.
That's normal.

178
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,600
That's not okay.

179
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,940
What if he gets disqualified
only because of that?

180
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,900
It's about going to university.
That can't be taken lightly.

181
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,620
If you take your grades seriously,
that will be nice.

182
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,180
The students with lower grades
aren't so competitive.

183
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,919
I can improve every subjects
by a tiny bit.

184
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:49,000
It's a quality improvement.

185
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,800
But I think Mr. Hu wanted Nan Xi to join.

186
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,660
The seminar will help him a lot.

187
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,019
What can I do?

188
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:59,440
I think Mr. Hu was so clear about it.

189
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,880
Nan Xi must know about it.

190
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,320
If he wants to go,
he would pay attention to the news.

191
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,779
But if you ask Nan Xi,
he will force himself to go.

192
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,580
Then it will backfire.

193
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,799
So I think you should let Nan Xi decide.

194
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,721
What do you think?

195
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:17,720
It totally makes sense.

196
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,220
You are so thoughtful, Xiao Meishu.

197
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,880
Okay.

198
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,120
When will you be more diligent?

199
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
Me and Nan Xi won't worry so much.

200
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,920
Yes, I will do it.

201
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,940
Yes, let's go.

202
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,200
Give it to me.

203
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,200
Give it to me.

204
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,119
Teacher Nan Xi.

205
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,100
I only got five or six sentences wrong.

206
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,220
Please...

207
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,520
Trying to butter me up is no use.

208
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,480
Give it to me.

209
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,680
-Nan Xi...
-Give it to me.

210
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,400
-Teacher...
-Three...

211
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,160
Two...

212
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,620
One...

213
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,220
Having three sentences wrong
means half are wrong.

214
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,320
Don't you want the points?

215
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,480
Copy it 100 times.

216
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,860
What about Pipa Xing?

217
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,660
Teacher Nan...

218
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,299
I will try harder next time.

219
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,500
Stop punishing me.

220
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,080
Don't do that. That won't work.

221
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,479
I'll make a new study plan.

222
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,420
Do you have more plans?

223
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,080
The code is...

224
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,000
"Cram up Chinese plan".

225
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,840
Teacher Nan,
"Cram up English Plan" is not done yet.

226
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, yes.

227
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,160
The you will memorize the poem
in three days.

228
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,280
In three days?

229
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,960
You want me to memorize the poem
in three days.

230
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,680
You should ask the poet's spirit
to possess me.

231
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,980
Or you should do a craniotomy...

232
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,260
One day is enough.

233
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,680
Just one day.

234
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,800
Teacher Nan, three days.

235
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,480
Then, one hour.

236
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,420
I will go memorize it now, Teacher Nan.

237
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,480
-What the heck?
-Attitude.

238
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
What happened, Xian Rui?
Did anyone piss you off?

239
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,660
I have to memorize the poem in three days.

240
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,720
Nan Xi is giving me a hard time.

241
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,900
Three days is a bit tight.

242
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,040
But it's okay,
drink a life-extending water.

243
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,300
Work harder in the afternoon.

244
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,920
I really want to eat my text books
with coffee.

245
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,280
Which part was I reciting?

246
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,840
"It comes out after a thousand calls."

247
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,200
Xia Rui, Zhao Tishu.

248
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,520
-Hello, Mr. Hu.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Hu.

249
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,280
You two don't study,
but you instead go to a coffee shop?

250
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,059
No, I was doing reading practice.

251
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,180
I wanted to find a quiet and open space...

252
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,720
to practice and get coffee on the way.

253
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,579
Stop talking nonsense.

254
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,780
-You just can't stay in the classroom.
-No.

255
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,500
Xian Rui, I am not nagging you.

256
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,239
If you can spare some time in studying,

257
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,840
your grades will go up.

258
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,820
I heard from teacher Wang,
the dictation in the class,

259
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,320
only you couldn't complete it.

260
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,600
Teacher Wang reports me everyday.

261
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,467
It's wrong for Teacher Wang
to care about you?

262
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,460
No. No. It's very good, right?

263
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,580
Mr Hu, Xian Rui was really trying.
I promise.

264
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,719
Don't promise me.
I'm also worried about you.

265
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,519
I didn't ask you in front of everyone.

266
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,919
Were you and Cheng Erluo hurt that day?

267
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,880
No.

268
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,480
You two will be adults soon.

269
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,920
Be more careful, okay?

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,539
But thank God,
you will graduate in six months.

271
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,860
I will relax after you graduate.

272
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,620
Mr. Hu, this is my coffee shop,
not your office.

273
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,520
You can scold them in your office.

274
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,620
We are also guests.

275
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,659
I don't like you scolding them
in my face, okay?

276
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,580
Go back now!

277
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,040
After drinking something, go back quickly.

278
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

279
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,100
-Bye, Mr. Hu.
-Yi, I'll be leaving now.

280
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,520
Bye, Mr. Hu.

281
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,080
I wish I will never see you again.

282
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,780
You got caught.

283
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,500
What are you looking at?

284
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,800
Mr. Yi is a really nice guy.

285
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,860
Why is he friends with Mr. Hu?

286
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,919
It's fate.

287
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,019
Sure enough, it's his true color.

288
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,579
They're all nonsense.

289
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:23,080
Nonsense?

290
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,560
Stop! What are you doing?

291
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,140
Don't bully my students!

292
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,720
You overthink him like God.

293
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,520
I have doubts in this.

294
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,420
But this sounds like what he would do.

295
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,460
You really are his friend.
You back him up.

296
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,520
Xia Rui, you are curious
why Mr. Hu and I are friends.

297
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,820
It's easy.

298
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,500
Just like me and the coffee,

299
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,960
him and his students.

300
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,360
Mr. Yi, don't say that.
You just gave me goosebumps.

301
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
I know you don't believe it.

302
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,360
Come on, I'll show you something.

303
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,560
Mr. Hu forgot to take it.

304
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,880
Here, you two can read it carefully.

305
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,960
Mr. Hu recorded the learning situation,
rooms to improve.

306
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,120
And the flaws of all the students
in your class.

307
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,680
He always said
that he has to understand you to help you.

308
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,100
If he doesn't love you guys,
why would he do this?

309
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,500
Does he have too much time?
He could use the time to drink coffee.

310
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,500
The art exam is coming.

311
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,740
The entrance exam is less then six months.

312
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,380
You really have to work harder.

313
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,640
Repay Mr. Hu.

314
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,180
Did you hear me?

315
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,280
Okay, you two are quite behaved today.

316
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,240
What would you like to drink? My treat.

317
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,460
-Same as usual.
-Can you change for once?

318
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,959
-I don't like change.
-Aren't you tired of it?

319
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,020
-What about you?
-Me, too.

320
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,740
If you say so. Don't regret it.

321
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,120
I have new beans.

322
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,120
I didn't expect that.

323
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,280
You are curious why Mr. Hu and I
are friends.

324
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,640
Why aren't you surprised?

325
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,019
You knew already.

326
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,220
You knew, but you didn't tell me.

327
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,320
He suggested you
to copy the wrong words again.

328
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,780
My hands are so sore every day.

329
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,040
He told you to do that?

330
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,520
No wonder you are very bossy.

331
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
He was behind all these.

332
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,400
Now you know.

333
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,600
What did I do to deserve this?
Do I owe you or Mr Hu?

334
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,480
I am gonna die.

335
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,460
Maybe a bit of both.

336
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,880
"There is a long way to go."

337
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,659
You don't understand.
It means the path is long.

338
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:07,640
You will walk over it, take your time.

339
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,880
Now I am reciting another one now.

340
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,020
What's next?

341
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,960
Copy it 100 times.

342
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,299
You should ask the poet's spirit
to possess me.

343
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,790
You go find his spirit first.

344
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,960
Bye.

345
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,360
(English exercise book, Xia Rui)

346
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,080
(I won't make mistakes any more!
Fighting!)

347
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,020
I just couldn't understand this poet
for three years in high school.

348
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,320
If you push me again,
I will go write a poem.

349
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,480
Then I will fully understand
what he meant.

350
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,560
Forget it.

351
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,200
I don't think I will learn how to.

352
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,779
I think I should go to Tang Dynasty...

353
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:28,320
and burn all the poems he wrote.

354
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,001
There will be many people
who will thank me.

355
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:39,721
Then the statue in school will be mine.

356
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,000
Xia Rui...

357
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,800
"She will be a heroine of this country
and..."

358
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,440
What...?

359
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
Listen.

360
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
Cool!

361
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,540
What?

362
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,640
Memorize it.

363
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,960
You are good.

364
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,720
Okay, stop it.

365
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,440
You have to recite the last two sentences.

366
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,980
You will see them in the exam.

367
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,960
Can I just recite the last two?

368
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,400
All the poems.

369
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,859
Nan Xi, in the last exam, did you...?

370
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:44,840
-No.
-What do you mean no?

371
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,900
It's not because I'm helping you.

372
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,840
How did you know what I want to say?

373
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,560
Just recite it.

374
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,140
No. I heard the high school seniors
are sick in the head.

375
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,640
They would stay up late studying
just to get more grades.

376
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,820
What if it's so competitive?

377
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,440
And they take the place
that belongs to you, then...?

378
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,240
I will never blame you.

379
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,440
Yeah.

380
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,280
You really don't know
how to chat with people.

381
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,680
I thought...

382
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,279
I am happy to study with you.

383
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,720
Then I study more efficiently.

384
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,660
I got it.

385
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,800
Hurry up and recite it.

386
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,640
Nan Xi.

387
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,120
You...

388
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,999
Nothing, I can recite them.

389
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,480
You don't need...

390
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,240
Hurry.

391
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,920
I have to do something for Nan Xi.

392
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,004
Xia Rui.

393
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:06,560
Professor Gu.

394
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,795
-Professor Gu, please wait.
-Why are you two here?

395
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:15,306
Professor Gu,
can I introduce Nan Xi to you?

396
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,832
He is great at woodcraft.

397
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,327
And he can design wood art.

398
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:20,397
His work is pretty detailed.

399
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:22,390
He is also interested in architecture.

400
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,571
He hopes to get into your university
and to study there.

401
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:29,159
Xia Rui, it's class time. Go back already.

402
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:32,191
Professor Gu, Nan Xi is really a genius.

403
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,190
-Look at his eyes.
-Xia Rui...

404
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,212
-And his hands.
-Xia Rui, enough.

405
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,592
-They're pretty. Look at his hands...
-Sorry.

406
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,746
-Professor Gu...
-Go back to class!

407
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,240
His name is Nan Xi,
he is good at woodcraft.

408
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:49,247
Sorry, Professor Gu,
the students are naughty.

409
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:53,120
But I mentioned this boy to you.

410
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
He is talented.

411
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,800
Why did you pull me away?
That was a good chance.

412
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,291
If he is willing to understand you,
you will get a chance.

413
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:10,880
If you don't like to talk, I can help you.

414
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,480
-I can tell a lot...
-Did you recite the poem?

415
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,502
Nan Xi?

416
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:19,909
Where are you, Nan Xi?

417
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,240
Nan Xi?

418
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:26,910
I hope I can see the students here
in my university.

419
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,860
You will. Thank you so much.

420
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,891
-Take care.
-Professor Gu...

421
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,789
-The...
-Xia Rui.

422
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,346
-Stop!
-No. Nan Xi...

423
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,600
I told you about it.

424
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:43,179
Wait a second.
Can I take a look at your book bag?

425
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,030
Of course.

426
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,589
There, Professor, Nan Xi made this bag.

427
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:49,720
I never had a wooden bag.

428
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,291
I thought it would be heavy
and easy to break.

429
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,190
But it's very easy to use.

430
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,968
The layout is great.
I can see everything inside.

431
00:28:58,048 --> 00:29:00,640
-Can I open it?
-Sure.

432
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:02,280
Look.

433
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,580
Please tell Nan Xi.

434
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,302
I will wait for him
at the university recruiting event.

435
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:17,868
Really? Thank you, Professor Gu.

436
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:20,120
Professor Gu, thank you.

437
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,880
-Take care, Professor Gu.
-Take care, Professor Gu.

438
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:32,600
Go home.

439
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:38,989
Nan Xi, let me tell you something.

440
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,120
Professor Gu... He said...

441
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,668
He said he will...

442
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:46,922
Sit down, tell me slowly.

443
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:49,713
I can't sit down after running.
It's bad for the heart.

444
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,720
Don't you know about this common sense?

445
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,140
Wait.

446
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,640
Don't rush, slow down.

447
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:01,989
Well, Professor Gu... He said...

448
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,403
He will wait for you
at the university recruiting event.

449
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,949
He remembered you.

450
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,480
This recruitment is a guarantee.

451
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,834
As long as you take the vacancy,
you will have no problems.

452
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,196
You don't have to worry
about the entrance exam...

453
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:18,996
Now I'm worried about you.

454
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,135
Worried about me?

455
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:21,800
Why are you worried about me?

456
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,200
Are you done reciting?

457
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Why?

458
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,360
Are you done reciting the poem?

459
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:35,810
I think Professor Gu said something else.

460
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,991
I didn't get it, I will ask again.

461
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,337
Don't try to run. Recite it now.

462
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,758
I am kind to you,
but you're not in return.

463
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:46,520
I helped you a lot.

464
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,660
Let me off for a day. Okay?

465
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,514
You tried so hard to get me in.

466
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:54,089
I will also try to get you in.

467
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:57,019
Don't worry, I will go with you.

468
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:57,961
Think about it.

469
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,320
If I am not in your university life,
how boring will it be?

470
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,013
Xia Rui, if you can't go,

471
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:09,210
then I won't, either.

472
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,739
Stop the nonsense, you have to go.

473
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:14,800
It's your dream to study architecture.
You can't give up easily.

474
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:21,430
I didn't mean what I said before.

475
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,257
Don't take it seriously.
I will get in, don't worry.

476
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:28,360
It's just a poem.

477
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,840
They're just 871 words. I can do it.

478
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:35,726
I am good at it.

479
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,400
Xunyang...

480
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:43,960
I know. Don't remind me.

481
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Come on.

482
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:52,280
You asked me not to remind you.

483
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Feng...

484
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,440
(Ranking of the final examination)
(First: Nan Xi)

485
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,490
Take a look.

486
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,840
It's done.

487
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,150
It's a great photo.

488
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,710
-Thank you.
-It's not good, my eyes are closed.

489
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,079
-What did you do?
-You blinked, okay?

490
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:05,237
Let's take one more?

491
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:10,080
You didn't have to come
and look what you are saying now.

492
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:14,323
Yang Yufei came
to the university recruiting.

493
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,545
You want to be with her,
but you're too embarrassed, right?

494
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,169
Right?

495
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,435
You also want to get into Bin University.
Why are you so arrogant?

496
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:22,449
Maybe I will get in this year.

497
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:26,249
Gosh, only if you can beat me.

498
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,949
Yes, the art exam is also here.
It's the same place.

499
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,040
It's a shame that Cheng Erluo
is in the game.

500
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,902
He can't be here with us.

501
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:37,429
Tomorrow is the final game, right?
How is he?

502
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,509
He is already asking me to celebrate.

503
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:43,440
He is so confident.

504
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,459
Don't worry, he will win.

505
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:48,560
If you say so, he will win.

506
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:51,360
Why?

507
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,079
Only tourists take pictures with the gate.

508
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,680
They came here to visit.

509
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,610
How can they get in?

510
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,400
Beauty, can I take a picture for you?

511
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:03,240
No, I am sorry.

512
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:11,360
Wow, there are so many people. Let's go.
