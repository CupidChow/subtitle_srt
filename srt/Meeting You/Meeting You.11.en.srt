[Meeting You]

2
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,780
Kiddo, hurry up

3
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,660
What's the situation?

4
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,180
The latest information, mother was very angry when she came back

5
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,660
Your confrontation with the teacher made her lose her face

6
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,240
But dad and I worked hard to lift up her spirit

7
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,140
How did it go?

8
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,280
As long as you don't talk about school, you should be fine

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,110
She probably won't mind you talking about Nan Xi and your relationship,

10
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,220
she just won't have it another way with the exam

11
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,500
You bastard. Go in. Go in

12
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,100
Well, I don't want to go abroad

13
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,550
Even if Binhai University is too far away

14
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,480
I want to go a local university and stay with my friends

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,500
I want to take a broadcast host class

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,390
If I use this to take the art exam

17
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,900
I should still be able to go to a better school. Yup. Yes

18
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,520
What if you fail the exam?

19
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,160
I still have a year to prepare. I'll definitely try my best

20
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,520
If I fail the test in the end, I will do what you want

21
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,680
I'll go wherever you want. I won't resist

22
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,380
Okay

23
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,860
Then we'll wait until the day your college entrance examination results come out

24
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,420
I'll book that broadcast host class for you tomorrow

25
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,160
Okay. Wait... You agreed too quickly

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,610
Is it a problem?

27
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,460
No, no, no. No problem at all

28
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,480
[Episode 11]
[We promised to be together forever]

29
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,740
- Binhai Normal University?
- Yes

30
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,120
I didn't fill out the college entrance application by myself

31
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,540
My mom and Mr. Hu decided for me

32
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,960
Binhai University has such a high entrance score, I will never make it

33
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,980
But I want to be in same city with you. So this school is the most suitable one

34
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,240
There is also a major in broadcasting and hosting

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,260
And I can try to apply for it through the art exam

36
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,900
Then I will also try for the Binhai Normal University

37
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,140
Don't. I think it's good enough that we can stay in the same city

38
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,510
I can always choose other schools through the art exam

39
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,060
Actually, I want to try Binhai University. Maybe I'll get lucky

40
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,380
You need to think about it. Do you want to be a broadcast host?

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I don't know yet. But it's the best choice right now

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't take it if you don't like it

43
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
I know what you mean

44
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,380
But I have nothing to lose. I can at least have a try

45
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,200
That's good. Then we can start our one-on-one tutoring

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,980
Okay. Let's get back to it today

47
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,200
But let's go somewhere first

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
- Where?
- Follow me

49
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,120
All right?

50
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,840
Isn't it cute?

51
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,100
Very cute

52
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,620
Cute

53
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,160
Try this one

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,520
How about this?

55
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,320
Lovely

56
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,370
Is it Cute?

57
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes

58
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,930
Is it cute?

59
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,400
Yes

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,740
Are you serious?

61
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Anything you choose is cute

62
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,220
You are so cheesy

63
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,300
My god

64
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,200
Xia Rui

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,380
What's wrong?

66
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,160
Buy this notebook. You can use it when taking notes

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
- For me?
- Yes

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,020
Oh my god! Have you ever seen Rui use such a girly notebook?

69
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,360
It's cute

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,620
Is it cute, too?

71
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,940
Wow

72
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,220
I'll also buy one. I will note all your mistakes in it

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,820
I think you're pranking on me

74
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,080
You know what, if we continue like this, we'll become uglier

75
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,760
I think it's pretty cute

76
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,680
Okay

77
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,830
Thank you

78
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,380
Enjoy

79
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,040
It smells good

80
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,870
How's it?

81
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,180
Are you happy?

82
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,700
Yes, but I'm stuffed

83
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,980
Okay. Now that you are full, we'll go somewhere else

84
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,560
Where?

85
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,670
We go to study English

86
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,160
No! It's too quick!

87
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:07,280
No. It would be a waste to take notes in the first notebook that Nan Xi bought for me

88
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
[Xia Rui's wish list]

89
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,520
I want to watch the sunrise from the top of the mountain with Nan Xi

90
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,720
I want to travel with Nan Xi

91
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,400
It's fine to bring Shu and Chubby Cheng along

92
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,220
Am I late? Did the roll call begin?

93
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,180
You missed it. You are the first one on the list

94
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,940
Mr. Hu wants you to write one thousand words of self-criticism

95
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,500
I shouldn't have dreamed about breakfast. That's why I was late

96
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,040
I was in a buffet and couldn't finish it all. It was really delicious

97
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,000
Xia Rui, you haven't been late in a long time. I'll write it down first

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,220
Aren't you too deep into the play, Teacher Nan Xi?

99
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,220
Guys, have you heard that our adult ceremony has been canceled?

100
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,200
What? Canceled? Really?

101
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,700
It's true. I heard from my teammate

102
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,010
He said that his class had announced it in the early morning

103
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,620
It said that it will collide with this year's entrance exams

104
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,710
But isn't the adult ceremony a tradition at Chenghua?

105
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,780
How can it be canceled so suddenly?

106
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,330
I think that it will actually be good for the students in the third grade

107
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,660
We could release some of the pressure

108
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,400
Dear Shu, I couldn't agree with you more!

109
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,960
Guys, please listen to me

110
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,710
Although the adult ceremony has been canceled,

111
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,140
the spirit of becoming an adult can never be canceled

112
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,640
Is there anything you wanted to do before becoming an adult, but never had the nerve?

113
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,220
Cheng Erluo, can you be mature?

114
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,620
We're going to lose our youth if we are not crazy now

115
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,210
Cheng Erluo, you are being a monkey again?

116
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,000
No, no. Stand up. Stand up

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,110
In order to help you understand that you're a monkey

118
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,900
please keep standing while listening to this lesson

119
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,800
Stand and listen? Oh bro, that's cool!

120
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,180
Bro? What are you talking about man?

121
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,740
Get out

122
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
Get out!

123
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,040
Let's start our lesson. Don't pay attention to him

124
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,600
Turn to page 37

125
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,360
Let's take a look at the following sentences

126
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,780
Be careful

127
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,680
I haven't eaten anything since breakfast

128
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,280
And the following sentence

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,180
She hasn't left home for a year

130
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,980
You should pay attention to the usage of "haven't"

131
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,180
What are you doing?

132
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,580
Enough! Enough! Self-study

133
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
You come over!

134
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,680
I was wrong I was wrong!

135
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,780
What do you think Cheng Erluo is doing?

136
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,180
The rebellion before adulthood

137
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
I don't think he'll live up to eighteen

138
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,080
I agree

139
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,380
What are you doing, Chubby Cheng?

140
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,180
Cheng Erluo, if you keep behaving like this, you won't even reach eighteen

141
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,580
I agree. Is being eighteen years old so scary?

142
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,880
People who don't know you will think that you have the Peter Pan syndrome

143
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,080
We will still be the same after passing eighteen

144
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,680
Of course it's different

145
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,480
There are some things that can only be done before eighteen

146
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,780
Similarly, some things can only be done after eighteen

147
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,580
Am I right, Nan Xi?

148
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,480
Well. It makes sense

149
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,080
See? My Nan Xi said so

150
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,680
Nan Xi, what do you want to do the most at the adult ceremony?

151
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,680
I know

152
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,280
You want to be with Rui mostly

153
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,980
But just to give you two a suggestion, just join us

154
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Unless you only want to stay with each other and do something

155
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,180
Cheng Erluo?

156
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,080
Rui, I'm kidding. Don't hit my face

157
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,580
Rui, Rui, Rui. You--

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,160
Okay. Okay. Okay

159
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,180
Xia Rui, stay with us to have a meal

160
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,380
No, thanks. My grandparents are waiting for me at home

161
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,580
Okay. You are welcome to visit Nan Xi for your homework at any time

162
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,580
Nan Xi is happy every time you come

163
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,580
I'll go now

164
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,380
Okay. Be careful on the way

165
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,380
Okay. Bye

166
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,280
Xia Rui took the wrong notebook?

167
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,380
What's this? It's too difficult

168
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,980
Lin Qingya, I like you!

169
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,580
What did I say? I am definitely not the only one

170
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,380
who wants to be crazy before becoming an adult

171
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,780
Let's go, bros!

172
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,080
Hurry up. Hurry up

173
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,580
Stop staring! Back to your class

174
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,380
Okay. Okay. Don't shout. Don't shout

175
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,180
So cool

176
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,980
Back to your class. Or you will be punished

177
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,840
Warrior, you are so handsome

178
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,980
Cheng Erluo! It's you again

179
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,180
Warrior, you are so awesome

180
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,680
Dear Shu! Have you seen it? So cool! So handsome

181
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,580
I shook hands with him. I shook hands with... Dear Shu!

182
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,380
Shu!

183
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Nan Xi, I asked around

184
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,680
The warrior's name is Qin Fen

185
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,380
Although he's a bit of a looser, it seems that he has been with the girl he loves

186
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,680
This is textbook-like youth

187
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,580
The school ruled that premature love is forbidden

188
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,480
So, what's going on between you and Rui?

189
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,780
We're friends

190
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,580
Lan Xueer, I like you!

191
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,080
Here they go again!

192
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,920
Lan Xueer!

193
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
What are you shouting about?

194
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,580
Go back to your class

195
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
Go back

196
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,280
I will have you all punished if you don't go back to class at once

197
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,480
Look at you

198
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,880
Do you look like grade three students now?

199
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,580
You are so reckless

200
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,900
I tell you, these incidents are very bad

201
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,380
It seriously affect the study and mental health of all students in the school

202
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,380
Here, the school declares

203
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,180
all students should supervise one another

204
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,480
Nip it in the bud

205
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,680
Don't let me catch any of our classmates

206
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,380
Well. Ready for class

207
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,680
I tell you, don't let me catch any of our classmates

208
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,180
Guys. Stop. Stop. Stop

209
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,380
Listen to me

210
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,780
I want to discuss something with you

211
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,980
What's the matter?

212
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,280
The adult ceremony is supposed to be held next Monday

213
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,880
We are not teenagers anymore once it's over

214
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,480
Although the ceremony is canceled, aren't we still teenagers?

215
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,780
Let's spend the last day of our youth more meaningfully

216
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,980
I suggest that we skip the evening study on Sunday night

217
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,880
Let's go to the rooftop to welcome the arrival of our eighteen years old

218
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
How about it?

219
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,980
Do things together! Have fun together!

220
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,680
Naive

221
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,780
Rui, why are you so unsociable?

222
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,980
We'll go together. What are you afraid of?

223
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,080
Who said I'm scared?

224
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,480
Then let's go together

225
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,580
Anyone against?

226
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,180
Well, then it's settled

227
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,880
We all go together. Go together on Sunday

228
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,580
It's fixed. Sunday. Sunday

229
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,180
Nan Xi, I actually did this for you

230
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,580
I've arranged it for you

231
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,280
I will help you and Rui to have some time on Sunday night

232
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,180
You're welcome. Leave it to me

233
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,680
Nan Xi, I didn't expect you to respond to my plan. So touched!

234
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,480
Let me tell you my plan

235
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,380
We all will go to the rooftop, right?

236
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,380
When we drink, everyone's mood naturally goes up

237
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
I'll be responsible for making Rui happy

238
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,480
You just stay close and be handsome

239
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,780
Wait for the right moment and take Rui aside

240
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,680
Say whatever you want. How's that?

241
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
What do you want me to say?

242
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,180
It's your business now. Do you want me to teach you?

243
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,080
You can't go up to there to exchange exam answers

244
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,980
I'll show you some cool stuff

245
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,980
Isn't it cool?

246
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,380
At your sign, I'll ignite it

247
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,580
and make the atmosphere romantic

248
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,780
How's that? Cool, right?

249
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,980
Isn't it perfect?

250
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,080
Where did you go, Cheng Erluo?

251
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,980
It's cold. So cold

252
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,780
Let's go back

253
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,980
Why is it so cold in the middle of the night?

254
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,280
So cold

255
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,380
Why do we have to run up and freeze ourselves?

256
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Be quiet! You guys, be quiet!

257
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,480
I'll show you something

258
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,380
- Let's go
- Wait a minute

259
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,980
Wow!

260
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,480
Follow me

261
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,180
Wow. My goodness!

262
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Stand back. Stand back

263
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,580
What's this?

264
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,180
Is Cheng Erluo crazy? My god

265
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,380
Cheng Erluo, you are crazy! You dare to do this

266
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,480
The principal will come here after he notices this

267
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Everyone, run quickly

268
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,980
Don't! Don't leave

269
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,180
I'm not finished yet

270
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,780
Check the No.2 building

271
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Is he going to blow up the school?

272
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,380
He bought the wrong one

273
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,880
What?

274
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,680
Was he supposed to buy the silent one?

275
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,480
Bad boy, Nan Xi

276
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,780
Go

277
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,780
Hurry up and take a look upstairs

278
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,380
Hide

279
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,840
Come

280
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,780
Come

281
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,180
This way

282
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,380
I'll take this floor. You guys go upstairs and take a look

283
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Dear Shu, don't be afraid. I'm here

284
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,680
Don't run

285
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,880
You, stop!

286
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,180
You caught me

287
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,480
Where are you running?

288
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
Behave!

289
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,380
You, an adult man, came here for a cup of milk?

290
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,180
You don't check the evening study?

291
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,380
You want to exhaust me?

292
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,880
Can I take a day off?

293
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,380
Yes, you can. Eat quickly and go home for rest

294
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,780
Don't delay me closing the door

295
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,480
No. I'll leave at twelve

296
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
My favorite croissant

297
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,180
Principal Liu

298
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,680
Hello?

299
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,180
Yes. It's me, Principal Liu. What?

300
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,780
Okay. Got it

301
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,180
So busy

302
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,380
These little monkeys

303
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,280
I must have owed them in my last life

304
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,580
Bye-bye

305
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,080
They get in trouble every day

306
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
I'm leaving

307
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,580
You must have truly owed them in your last life

308
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,980
Yes, for sure!

309
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,080
All right. Sit here

310
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,380
When did you prepare these?

311
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
Last week

312
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,880
- Last week?
- Yes

313
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,380
These are so much better than the ones Cheng Erluo got

314
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,180
Sit here

315
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,380
You are so thoughtful

316
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,480
Wow. So cozy

317
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,780
So warm

318
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,780
You brought it?

319
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,380
Because you cherish it

320
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,280
Thank you

321
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,180
Your bamboo cup is pretty good

322
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,680
My father gave it to me

323
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,380
It was the souvenir he brought back from his business trip

324
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,780
I think it's pretty, so I'm using it

325
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,980
I often think of him, but feeling warm

326
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,580
But my grandparents

327
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,580
They rarely mention anything about him

328
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,580
But I know that they miss him

329
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,880
They're just afraid to mention it

330
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,380
So you live with them

331
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,580
Yes. I think my presence is a comfort to them

332
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,680
Your father is a lucky man

333
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,980
At least he knows what you like

334
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,380
It's better now

335
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,280
I cried badly when I mentioned my dad before

336
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,380
But now, it's okay

337
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,180
I was lucky to have you at that time

338
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,380
I'll be here in the future

339
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,280
He left nothing except this cup

340
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,580
I can't remember what my dad looks like

341
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,280
It's kind of fuzzy

342
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,780
But it doesn't matter

343
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,380
You know what

344
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,080
it feels like my dad is still with me when I look at this cup

345
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,380
Why? I'm fine

346
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,380
I got used to it after so many years

347
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,780
- Nan Xi
- Yes?

348
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,080
I will tell you a little secret

349
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,600
Don't laugh at me

350
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,280
I won't

351
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,580
Actually, I have a wish list

352
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,180
The first wish is to watch the sunrise on the mountain

353
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,780
One time, my mom took Haohao to my grandparents' to celebrate the New Year

354
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,680
It was noisy till the early morning

355
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,980
When I sent them downstairs

356
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:24,180
the sun rose and a ray of sunlight hit my face like that

357
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,580
I just looked at the light

358
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,180
I felt happy

359
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,680
So, since then, I want to be in places

360
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,480
from where I can watch the sunrise

361
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,780
Nan Xi, to be honest, I am not brave as I look like

362
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:05,180
I seem to be more afraid of growing up than Cheng

363
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,380
I am afraid that I will lose a lot of things when I grow up

364
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,780
Such as my stupid friends

365
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,690
and my fearless personality

366
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,380
And you, who have been lost and came back now

367
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,880
I-I am so scared that all of you

368
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,980
will leave me when the time comes

369
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,980
I don't know why

370
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,380
I suddenly had this feeling when I was filling my application form that day

371
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,180
You'll all become excellent

372
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm the only one left

373
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,280
I can't do anything

374
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,780
I don't know anything

375
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,560
Nan Xi, don't you feel that way?

376
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm not afraid

377
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,540
Because I found you and won't lose you again

378
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,420
I will alway be Xia Rui's little wood

379
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,390
Deal

380
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,200
We will never separate even when we grow up

381
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,600
Deal. Never separate

382
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,080
Yes

383
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,180
Xia Rui, we will be together forever

384
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,280
Xia Rui. Xia Rui

385
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,040
Xia Rui

386
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,500
Nan Xi

387
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,120
What's wrong?

388
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,080
You just...

389
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,460
Xia Rui. Look

390
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,640
Wow

391
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,880
Wow, so beautiful!

392
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,940
Great! You try it

393
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,070
Xia Rui

394
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,240
happy eighteen!

395
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,100
Nan Xi, happy eighteen!
