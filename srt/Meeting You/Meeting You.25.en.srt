1
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
Sister-in-law.

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,478
I didn't expect Nan Xi...

3
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:03,445
to chose to participate
in this competition at the last moment.

4
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,160
Do you think Nan Xi will get first place?

5
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,588
Remove "do you think".

6
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:19,963
It will definitely be the first place.

7
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,619
Sister-in-law.

8
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,268
If Nan Xi needs anything,

9
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,883
just call us.

10
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:26,160
Do not hesitate.

11
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:32,121
What are you doing? This is for Nan Xi.

12
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,314
Can Nan Xi alone eat so much?

13
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,437
I want him to eat this much, any problem?

14
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,078
He wants to share with his roommates.

15
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,601
His roommates helped him a lot this time.
I want to treat them.

16
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,230
If there's nothing else,
go do your live stream.

17
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,376
Don't think about my food here.

18
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:48,179
=EPISODE 25
SHE IS XIARUI=

19
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:42,650
Xia Rui.

20
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:46,658
Sorry.

21
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:48,948
Why are you apologizing?

22
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,686
Just now..

23
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,736
I swear.

24
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:56,856
I didn't see anything.
I really didn't see anything.

25
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,957
Didn't see anything?

26
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,757
I didn't see a thing.

27
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,002
That's good, then.

28
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:21,439
It's this area that
has a power outage, right?

29
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:26,700
This is a small, old area after all.

30
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:31,929
Maybe some of the circuits
are not that good.

31
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:33,636
Okay.

32
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,384
Then, do you think...

33
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,098
Tomorrow morning,

34
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,963
the electricity should return, right?

35
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:44,729
Should be.

36
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:00,525
Nan Xi.

37
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,374
What?

38
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,707
You remind me of grandma.

39
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:10,561
When I was living in grandma's house,

40
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:13,130
this is how she dried my hair.

41
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:17,058
She would say that
sleeping with wet hair is bad for health.

42
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,376
Living with you makes me feel like...

43
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:27,231
going back to grandparents' house.

44
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:29,431
I feel at ease.

45
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,469
The electricity came back suddenly.

46
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,559
It's quite sudden.

47
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,458
Then go to sleep, okay?

48
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:38,340
Good night.

49
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,169
Okay...

50
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,298
Good night.

51
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,931
Nan Xi.

52
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:53,982
Good night.

53
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:00,885
Good night.

54
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,805
Good night.

55
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,670
What are you thinking?

56
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,066
You bad Xia Rui.

57
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,181
What is in your head?

58
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:29,709
So awkward, so awkward.

59
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:35,860
So embarrassing.

60
00:09:58,196 --> 00:09:59,891
Nan Xi is too good.

61
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,892
Throughout the drying process,

62
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:06,290
the wood is not deformed at all.

63
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,994
So worth it.

64
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,613
I don't ask for much.

65
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:14,802
After Nan Xi gets first place,
just give me special credits.

66
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,310
My goodness.

67
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,724
You should ask for more.

68
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,888
Why don't you let Nan Xi
add your name into the certificate?

69
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,470
Am I that shameless?

70
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,567
Come and help me.

71
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:24,808
Here, here, here.

72
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,577
How do you do this?

73
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:30,951
-Help me hold on to it.
-Sure, sure, sure.

74
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,937
Hold it up just like this.

75
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,571
Let me do it, let me do it.

76
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:08,093
Shu, my competition's over.

77
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:09,873
Why didn't you come see it again?

78
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:13,035
I'm rehearsing.

79
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:19,201
Why did you lose interest recently?

80
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,289
I was never a basketball fan.

81
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,444
There's porridge in the thermal flask,
remember to eat.

82
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:17,041
Do not frown, finish the food.

83
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:23,757
I'll come check after class.

84
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,931
I, am, missing, you.

85
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,872
-Where are them?
-I asked them to go back.

86
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,896
That's so much. Can you finish it?

87
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:08,506
Rest assured. I can do it.

88
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,083
I'll help you.

89
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,141
Oh, gosh! Oh, my goodness!

90
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:08,353
Nan Xi. It's 7:00. Get up, get up.

91
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:10,507
At 12:00,
we need to bring tables to the venue.

92
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:11,672
Or else, we'll be disqualified.

93
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,536
-What time is it?
-Eleven o'clock.

94
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:14,839
Hurry, hurry.

95
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:16,911
Oh, no.

96
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:24,190
My goodness. How do we move this over?

97
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:32,060
The design plan
of this water flowing table,

98
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,976
should get the highest score
in preliminaries.

99
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:36,235
So, it took the best spot in this venue.

100
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,048
Why haven't they arrived yet?

101
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,069
It will end in less than an hour.

102
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,244
He's not thinking of forfeiting, right?

103
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,311
Contact Xia Rui, ask her what's wrong.

104
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:49,963
Okay.

105
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,438
No way, little girl.

106
00:15:56,518 --> 00:16:00,549
Too many people moving now.
I've sent out all the cars today.

107
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,030
Even if they come back now,
it'll be two hours later.

108
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,713
Okay, thank you. Understood.

109
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:08,769
No way.

110
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:16,786
-Hello.
-Hello, Xia Rui.

111
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:18,313
Why is your phone always busy?

112
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:19,587
Where's Nan Xi's work?

113
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,156
Why isn't it delivered yet?
It's only his that's left.

114
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:26,017
We can't find a car
to bring the table to the venue.

115
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,003
Don't worry, I'll find a way.

116
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,657
Okay, okay, goodbye.

117
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:36,513
What's wrong?

118
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:41,221
Si Bo, I may need your help.

119
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:46,272
What's the matter?

120
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,792
This Nan Xi and Xia Rui.

121
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:49,500
Time is running out.

122
00:16:55,894 --> 00:17:00,738
Cheng Erluo. Do you really want me
to be friends with Si Bo?

123
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:06,778
Cheng Erluo, are we just friends?

124
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:11,812
How do you know the person likes me back?

125
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:17,637
I've never been a basketball fan.

126
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:21,072
-Xia Rui.
-Chubby Cheng.

127
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:23,161
What happened? Who offended you again?

128
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,253
Where's Shu?

129
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,198
You still dare mention about Shu?

130
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:30,282
-What happened?
-What do you think it is?

131
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,644
If you don't tell me,
how would I know what's wrong?

132
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:35,820
Are you really stupid?

133
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,975
Can't you see she's avoiding you?

134
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:39,628
Don't you like her at all?

135
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,506
Didn't you visit the forum?

136
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:44,311
Go find out about Best Restaurant.

137
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:49,980
Asked to Best Restaurant,
I'm not single now.

138
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,147
There's no failed confession
in Best Restaurant.

139
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:54,197
If there is, just go for second time.

140
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:59,127
Cheng Erluo, actually today, I...

141
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:03,343
Actually today I want to tell you...

142
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:13,228
Cheng Erluo, you are a big fool!

143
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,137
When I want to keep my distance from you,

144
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:17,976
you approach me again and again.

145
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,729
When I want to walk to you, you leave.

146
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,049
Why is your face red like a monkey's butt?

147
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,124
I hope Cheng Erluo's training goes well.

148
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,100
Cheng Erluo, you must get the MVP.

149
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,786
Please don't get hurt.

150
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:59,834
Si Bo, the 14 of us are quite talented.

151
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:01,800
Why are you so confident in me?

152
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,820
And willing to come back to school
to practice with me.

153
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,061
This question is not easy to answer.

154
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,623
Hao Tian,
is Nan Xi really going to forfeit?

155
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,250
Panghu, stop saying it. Shame on you.

156
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,046
You asked me to bet on him.

157
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,714
I'll definitely lose.

158
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,069
I asked you to bet?

159
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:31,242
This hand is yours.
Why is it me who asked you to bet?

160
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:32,575
You blame this one me?

161
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,062
-You deserve this.
-Be quiet.

162
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,228
Two minutes left. We need to hurry.

163
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,850
Go, go, go.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

164
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,176
Careful, careful, careful.

165
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,473
Beware of steps.

166
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:51,120
Si Bo, your kindness today,
I'll remember it for a lifetime.

167
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,209
You're talking too much.

168
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:53,642
-Get in quick.
-Go, go.

169
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,056
Careful.

170
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,440
Get me a microphone.

171
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,214
Sorry, everyone.

172
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:10,974
Because of time, Nan Xi's work...

173
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,230
Please wait!

174
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,792
Sorry, wait a second.

175
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,354
Make some way, thank you.

176
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:22,710
Sorry, I am late.

177
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,896
As long as you came.

178
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:31,759
Hello, everyone.

179
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,279
Welcome everyone
to Binhai University's 18th...

180
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,910
University Student's
Creative Design Competition.

181
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,754
We have received 1127 design entries...

182
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:46,271
from students across the country.

183
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,402
Fifteen design works entered the finals.

184
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,709
These 15 works have been completed.

185
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:59,470
So from today, these will be publicly
exhibited here for a month.

186
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:06,498
Professional judges and public judges
will select the winner together.

187
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,966
I now declare,
The Creative Grand Finals, start now.

188
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,783
Good.

189
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:37,094
As the contestant with the highest score,

190
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:39,100
could you explain the theme of the work?

191
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,273
First impression?

192
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,801
Many people think that
the first impression is fleeting.

193
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:53,623
But we think that
first impression is eternal.

194
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:58,508
Then, what's the reason for choosing wood
as the main raw material?

195
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:02,526
Rooted and twined,
the tree lives for hundreds of years.

196
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,360
This is our promise to each other.

197
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:08,204
But I found these two boards
not only irregular in shape,

198
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:10,014
there are also many signs of decay.

199
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:13,935
So, as a designer,
why did you choose them?

200
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,651
Not all trees are perfect.

201
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,683
When trees become wood,

202
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:22,061
they will be destroyed,
crushed and abandoned.

203
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:26,393
They cannot be used as
they are due to their defects.

204
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:31,646
What I want to say is,
many people are imperfect in this world.

205
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,060
They were born alone.

206
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,057
But once they meet,
they embrace each other.

207
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,192
Be there for each other, never apart,

208
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,432
only then there's a chance
to become perfect.

209
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,720
From first impression to eternity.

210
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,585
From imperfect to perfect.

211
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:54,208
I believe that all public judges here,
after hearing your story and enthusiasm,

212
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,301
will have a different understanding
and impression about your work.

213
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,954
As everyone knows, the Binhai
University's Design Competition...

214
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,145
helps new, aspiring designers
achieve fame each year.

215
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,744
Do you have confidence in your work?

216
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:10,596
-This is my roommate, my roommate.
-This is my brother.

217
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:13,303
As far as I know,
many design companies here...

218
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,831
have intentions to acquire your work.

219
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:19,383
Do you think this work
will hit a new highest purchase price?

220
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:23,262
Sorry. It's not for sale.

221
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:26,583
What made you decide
to reject the offer so resolutely?

222
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:29,019
This work belongs to Xia Rui.

223
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,495
Xia Rui must mean a lot to you seeing
as she received such an important gift.

224
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,219
Without Xia Rui,
there will be no first impression.

225
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,474
So, may I know who's Xia Rui?

226
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,288
My girlfriend.

227
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,467
Again...

228
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:53,296
That's cheesy,
but let's be happy for them today.

229
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,254
Everyone, take a short break.

230
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,529
I know you like coffee.

231
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:10,187
These past two days
were exhausting for everybody.

232
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,890
Have a cup of sweet Shui Rong C,
as supplement.

233
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,012
You drink mine.

234
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:22,879
Thank you, Si Bo, for today.

235
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,598
Without you, it'd have been really hard
for Nan Xi and I to arrive on time.

236
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:26,703
Thank you so much.

237
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:29,862
Actually these drinks should be my treat.

238
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:31,328
Just a glass of drink to thank me?

239
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:32,780
Of course not!

240
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,156
Should I treat you to a meal?
Let's do it tonight.

241
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:37,448
-How about we celebrate?
-I'm just kidding.

242
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:39,425
I simply helped a little,
no need to thank me.

243
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:41,792
I'm also one of the organizers
for this competition.

244
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:45,413
It's my duty as well to let the work
arrive to the venue safely.

245
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:48,869
But we can have this meal,
you pick a place.

246
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:49,936
I'll treat.

247
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,313
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

248
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,292
Let's eat.

249
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:09,376
Cheng Erluo.

250
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:12,212
Shu is not here yet.
You make yourself drunk.

251
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:14,091
Are you a child? Look at you.

252
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,075
I am happy.

253
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:17,772
I am happy for you.

254
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:19,768
Also happy for my Nan Xi.

255
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:20,927
Nan Xi.

256
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:22,427
Promise me,

257
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:25,608
when you arrive in Italy,
take good care of Xia Rui.

258
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,016
Come, finish this drink.

259
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:30,160
What Italy? It's not confirmed yet.

260
00:25:30,835 --> 00:25:34,652
Whatever Nan Xi wants to do, he can do it.

261
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:37,697
Nan Xi will go to Italy if he says so.

262
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,879
After calling you God Nan for so long,
trying to be like you,

263
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:47,500
unexpectedly, in the end,
I'm still not good enough.

264
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,543
Okay, okay, enough.

265
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:51,360
Stop drinking.

266
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,069
He's trying to get drunk,
why are you drinking with him?

267
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:56,835
I'm not drunk.

268
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,811
God Nan,

269
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,556
when you arrive in Italy,
take good care of Xia Rui.

270
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,523
I promise you.

271
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:06,849
A promise is a promise.

272
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:09,054
No need to cheers. Put it down.

273
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,389
Xia Rui. Actually, you are right.

274
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:21,658
I'm indeed a fool.

275
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:25,641
Nan Xi.

276
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,761
Do you think I'm a fool?

277
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,239
Yes.

278
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:36,428
It seems we can reach consensus
on some things.

279
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:37,688
Come.

280
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:40,152
I'm done.

281
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,795
You do as you want.

282
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:45,078
Stop drinking.

283
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,439
Shall we end it for today?

284
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:01,178
Cheng Erluo.

285
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,106
You drank quite an amount.

286
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,366
Let me send you back first.

287
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:05,851
You don't need to.

288
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:07,556
Shu is not here yet.

289
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:09,111
How can I leave?

290
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:10,485
Si Bo.

291
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:14,110
As I see,
the one who should leave is not me.

292
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:16,330
It is you.

293
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:19,849
What are you talking about, Cheng Erluo?

294
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,834
Sorry I'm late.

295
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:25,445
Shu, you're finally here.

296
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,158
Come, sit.

297
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:28,517
What happened?

298
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:29,858
While the two can still walk,

299
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:31,555
each of us take one
and bring them away quickly.

300
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:32,495
Okay.

301
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:33,856
Stop drinking.

302
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,617
Let me help you.

303
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:38,423
Si Bo.

304
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,187
I finally know your intention now.

305
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,297
Thank you.

306
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:45,764
But,

307
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:50,279
we will solve our problem by ourselves.

308
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,393
Okay, okay.

309
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:02,205
Whatever that is, talk about it
when you wake up tomorrow.

310
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:03,788
Si Bo, sorry for troubling you.

311
00:28:03,868 --> 00:28:05,671
I said, I don't need to!

312
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,675
Go, go, go.

313
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:12,893
Slow down.

314
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,186
I'll go see him.

315
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:33,751
Why did I come for this meal today?

316
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,348
Nan Xi. Do you think I can't see you?

317
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,933
How much did you drink?

318
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,236
A little bit.

319
00:28:53,073 --> 00:28:54,138
Let's go home.

320
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:55,371
Let's go.

321
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,564
-I said, I didn't drink much.
-You slow down. I know.

322
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:15,090
You don't need to help me.

323
00:29:15,896 --> 00:29:16,928
Today,

324
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:18,949
is a really happy day.

325
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,718
Isn't it?

326
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,163
Shu.

327
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:46,899
Best Restaurant.

328
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:51,733
You said,

329
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,046
you have something to tell me.

330
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,028
It was nothing.

331
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,288
It's okay.

332
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,353
You don't have to say it.

333
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:05,097
I have.

334
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,847
Listen well.

335
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:15,493
Zhao Yishu, I like you. Zhao Yishu,
I like you. Zhao Yishu, I like you.

336
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:27,564
You drank too much. Let's talk tomorrow.

337
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,667
I'm telling the truth after drinking.

338
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:34,842
What I'm telling is the truth.

339
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,636
You didn't come watch me play basketball.

340
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,194
Are you angry with me?

341
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,376
No.

342
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,416
You're lying.

343
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,489
You're mad at me.

344
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:49,997
You can be mad at me.

345
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:55,921
Before this, I was stupid.

346
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:58,249
I was too stupid.

347
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,101
Seeing you in someone else's car,

348
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:04,250
not coming to watch me play.

349
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:07,234
This makes me really sad.

350
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,563
Cheng Erluo.

351
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:14,086
Do you know why you are saying these?

352
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,289
Because you like me?

353
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,670
Or is it because I didn't watch you play,

354
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,897
you're not used to it.

355
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,361
I didn't know about this before.

356
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:28,584
Now I know.

357
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,567
What do you know?

358
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:37,062
I know why you told me,

359
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:40,356
you were never a basketball fan.

360
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,531
I don't want to be a coachman,
I want to be a prince.

361
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,780
There's no prince as fat as you.

362
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,564
Why won't you be together with me?
Be my prince.

363
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:03,544
My princess.

364
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:08,869
Can I invite you to dance with me?

365
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,611
What are you doing?

366
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:24,757
Cheng Erluo,
I've waited for you for so many years.

367
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:27,836
I've been expecting for you,
thinking about our everything.

368
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:32,197
But you've been indifferent.

369
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:38,098
Now, I've finally made up my mind
to reconsider my feelings for you.

370
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:40,389
And you say you like me.

371
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,696
Shu, I was wrong. It's not too late...

372
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:45,059
Don't be like this.

373
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,290
Sorry.

374
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,904
I need to really think about it.

375
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:04,221
Shu, I'm waiting for you.
