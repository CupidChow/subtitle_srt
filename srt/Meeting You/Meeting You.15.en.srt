Total score, 697 points.

17
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,330
This is almost 700 points.

18
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,720
God Nan Xi, you are so, so, so awesome!

19
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,520
I can foresee
how we can take over Binhai University.

20
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,530
Nan Xi, you are extraordinarily great.

21
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,320
Rui, you're the only one
who hasn't checked it. Come on.

22
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,640
-Okay, I'll check it out.
-Check earlier and you'll be at ease.

23
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,810
That's right!
This year's paper was easy.

24
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,050
You will definitely be fine.

25
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,640
Even Cheng Erluo has scored 420 points.

26
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,269
You will definitely score more than 450.

27
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,950
What do you mean
by, "Even Cheng Erluo scored 420?"

28
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,270
I put in a lot of effort revising, okay?

29
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,980
Rui has always been working harder
than me,

30
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,190
which is why it shouldn't be a problem
for her to score over 450 points.

31
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,360
That's right.

32
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,770
Well, then, I will call it now.

33
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,840
Here we go.

34
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,080
It's connected.

35
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,230
Thank you for calling
the College Entrance Examination hotline.

Still good, still good.

40
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,920
This year's Chinese questions
were indeed a little difficult.

Mathematics, 90 points.

42
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,700
It's okay, Math was difficult this year.

43
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,240
It's really good to be able
to just pass it, really!

-There are more, there are more.

Yes! Counter attack!

47
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,940
Steady, steady, steady!

48
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,900
One more, one more.

50

Total score, 449 points.

52
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,840
Binhai Education University.

53
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,660
For the past two years,

54
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,410
the admission scores
were around 450-460 points.

55
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,729
But you are only short of one point.

56
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,920
The score may have been lowered this year.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,440
But...

58
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,000
But Binhai Education University scores
have never been lower than 450.

59
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,360
Nan Xi?

60
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,480
Nan Xi.

61
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,040
What's wrong?

62
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,240
Even I haven't cried. Why are you crying?

63
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,240
It's okay.

64
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,600
It's okay.

65
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,640
Wherever you study,

66
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,560
I will go with you.

67
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,190
Sorry, Nan Xi.

68
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,640
I didn't do well this time.

69
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,400
All of your effort...

70
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
and your persistence...

71
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,680
I know them more than you do.

72
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,760
Don't say sorry.

73
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,640
We don't need to talk about this.

74
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,720
But...

75
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,680
I have made a promise to my mum.

76
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,720
She said...

77
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
that if I don't pass this exam,
she'll send me abroad.

78
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,640
What should I do?

79
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm afraid that we will get separated.

80
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
Xia Rui.

81
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
Do you believe in me?

82
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,640
For us to be together,

83
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,960
work hard once more.

84
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,840
Okay?

85
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,360
But what should we do?

86
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,300
I know the situation
that you are talking about.

87
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,010
But can you stop emphasizing
on these reasons?

88
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,980
Stop blaming it on other people, okay?

89
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,850
I... Wait a minute.

90
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,990
Wait a minute.

91
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,880
Rui, use some time to think...

92
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,080
about what the introductory teacher
has said to you.

93
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,100
It's okay to enroll half a year later.

94
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,630
How about we first look
at the schools' conditions?

95
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,760
Then we'll pick two suitable schools.

96
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,980
Hey, Eimin.

97
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,600
Yes, what I meant was,

98
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,060
whatever it is,
think about yourself first.

99
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,910
Can nothing be done
with the performance report?

100
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,130
Does it not have anything to do with you?

101
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,080
Fine, fine, fine, okay.

102
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,930
As long as you get it, it's good.

103
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,550
Okay, okay, okay.

104
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,870
I want to see the report on Monday, okay?
Okay, okay.

105
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,040
Bye.

106
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,110
Have you finished reading it?

107
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,480
I feel that you should forget
about Binhai University.

108
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,760
Mama knows that you have tried your best.

109
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,750
Fortunately, your English score isn't bad.

110
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,990
Applying for overseas universities
shouldn't be a problem.

111
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,550
Take advantage of this summer holiday.

112
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,410
Practise your speaking skills.

113
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,050
If it still doesn't work,

114
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,830
we will send you abroad
to study the language.

115
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,120
-Mom.
-Yeah, what is it?

116
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,060
I...

117
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,620
I don't want to go abroad now.

118
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,250
-Why are you...?
-No, I am willing to go abroad.

119
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,780
But not now.

120
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,530
I have my own reason.

121
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,760
Trust me.

122
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,040
Rui.

123
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,420
Do you have any problems?

124
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,070
Are you hiding something from me?

125
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,690
Three days.

126
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,070
Just give me three days.

127
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,360
I will tell you the answer, okay?

128
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,840
Who's that?

129
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
It's me.

130
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,120
Xia Rui.

131
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,470
Is Nan Xi...?

132
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,160
He's reading there.

133
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,760
Nan Xi.

134
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
Nan Xi.

135
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,540
How was it?

136
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,960
What did your mom say?

137
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,080
Did she disagree?

138
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
She agreed.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
Our plan is a success.

140
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,680
Are you angry?

141
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm not.

142
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,680
You look very good when you smile.

143
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,480
Like flowers in spring.

144
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,380
Look at how good-looking you are
when you smile.

145
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,000
Smile more in the future, okay?

146
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,520
This is for you, have a look.

147
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,520
Will our plan succeed?

148
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,560
I don't know.

149
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,090
You don't know?

150
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,400
We're gone then
since you are not very confident.

151
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,610
That's your mom after all.

152
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,560
Will you feel nervous when you see my mom?

153
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,710
Just a little.

154
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,420
I've never seen you like this before.

155
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,480
Admitting to your weakness so quickly.

156
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,730
Isn't this good?

157
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,660
It's good, very good.

158
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,390
Who says it's not good
to be unintelligent?

159
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,960
Unintelligent?

160
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,440
Tell me about this, I don't understand.

161
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,900
Okay.

162
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Look at this.

163
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,520
(Xia Rui's Career Plan)

164
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,270
Oh, it's like this.

165
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,610
How is it?

166
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,930
It's very clear.

167
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,200
Also very simple.

168
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,840
What's wrong?

169
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,360
Can't you understand it?

170
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,800
-Ah?
-Then why are you nodding?

171
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,510
Looks like I have to make some changes.

172
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,400
Changes? What is there to change?

173
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,550
According to the genetics,
a child's IQ derives from his mother.

174
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,520
Since you can't understand it,

175
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,360
I'm afraid your mom
won't understand either.

176
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,310
Looks like you have more guts right now.

177
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,780
You used to say I was stupid, that's fine.

178
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,670
Now you dare to speak blatantly
about my mom, don't you?

179
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,440
Admitting that you are stupid
is also an improvement.

180
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,560
Not only you have more guts,
you can't stop now, too!

181
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,760
Your face is still too thin,
it should be a little thicker.

182
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,280
Nan Xi,
you've exceed your speaking quota today.

183
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,480
I am now ordering you
to keep your silence.

184
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,490
I've never expected the day
when I have to tell you to shut up.

185
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,280
It's really a big change in the situation.

186
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,010
But this plan looks so difficult.

187
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,840
Are three days enough?

188
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
If not, I will ask my mom again,
and beg for another two days.

189
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,790
Are you playing sound waves with me?

190
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,360
You're so into the act.
Are you planning to take up acting?

191
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,720
This is too difficult for me.

192
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,920
Fine.

193
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,040
I'll forgive you this once.

194
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,040
All right. No more fooling around.

195
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,090
Let me talk to you about this problem.

196
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,660
First of all, it is...

197
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,770
What are you laughing at?
Be a little more serious.

198
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,920
This is the analysis of your situation.
This is the university's screening test.

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,080
These are the universities you can get in.

200
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,360
And this is the score.

201
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,840
Come, come. Put on the glasses.

202
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,120
Looks good. Okay.

203
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,060
Rui, go sit in the living room
with Nan Xi for a while.

204
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,220
Mom will bring you some drinks.

205
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,240
Okay.

206
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,030
Is the child, Nan Xi, here?

207
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,190
Yes.

208
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,440
I don't know what these kids are up to.

209
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,180
Xia Rui must be hiding something from me.

210
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,760
I haven't seen her for three days.

211
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I don't know what is she busy with.

212
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,040
Relax, they've always been together.

213
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
I often speak to Nan Xi's nanny.

214
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,790
They have been together every day
for these past few days?

215
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,380
Not just these past few days.

216
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,010
Evere since our Rui's revision
for the college entrance examination,

217
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,650
it has been this child, Nan Xi,
who has been tutoring her.

218
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,560
You don't even know where Rui's blessings
have come from.

219
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,410
To be able to meet such
a good little boyfriend...

220
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,290
Mom, what are you talking about?

221
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,560
He's already a teenager.

222
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,460
Why are you calling him
"a little boyfriend?"

223
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,680
Grandma, grandma, grandma!

224
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,570
Is my brother-in-law wearing a suit
to propose to my sister?

225
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,230
Chen Hao!

226
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,740
I need to control your time
watching dramas.

227
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,870
What are you thinking
in your little brain?

228
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,280
What brother-in-law?

229
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,770
Stop talking about it.

230
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,720
Your mother is not happy.

231
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,340
Xia Rui.

232
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,220
Tell me honestly.

233
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,520
Does what you want to tell me
have something to do with Nan Xi?

234
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,680
Mom,

235
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,800
everything I'm going to tell you next,
I decided together with Nan Xi.

236
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,480
Decided?

237
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,020
What have you two decided?

238
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,719
Auntie, I know that you are not satisfied
with Xia Rui's score.

239
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,530
-That's why you intend to send her abroad.
-Correct.

240
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,600
Do you have any opinions on this matter?

241
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,000
I do not agree with it.

242
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,440
Mom, what Nan Xi meant was,
with regards to my future life,

243
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,910
he also has a plan to tell you about.

244
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,920
And he'd like to see if it is possible.

245
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,840
Nan Xi...

246
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,920
has a plan
with regards to your future life?

247
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,840
Please listen to it first.

248
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,880
Auntie, I know that we are still young.

249
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,500
But it concerns Xia Rui.

250
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,400
And I am very very serious about it.

251
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Xia Rui and I have known each other
since we were kids.

252
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,640
Although separated for many years.

253
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,750
But ever since we met again,
we still trust each other.

254
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,210
And for the two years of high school,
we were getting along day and night,

255
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,100
I will say I know her
no less than anyone else.

256
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,280
Auntie, although we are still young...

257
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,740
and have yet to experience social life...

258
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,720
Please believe in me.

259
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,510
-The rest of Xia Rui's life...
-Okay, okay. Stop talking.

260
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,710
Stop talking.

261
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,320
Don't say anything
like you will be responsible...

262
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,020
for the rest of her life.

263
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,240
These are lines from a TV series
just to deceive children like Hao.

264
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,370
Don't, don't, don't.
I really can't listen to this anymore.

265
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,190
Correct. Both of you are grown-ups.

266
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,150
But you're only 18 years old.

267
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,200
Coming to talk to me about marriage...

268
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,140
Aren't you both too anxious?

269
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,630
Auntie...

270
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,709
Nan Xi, how about this?
Let's swap positions to think.

271
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,160
If you were a parent,

272
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,380
would you trust your daughter to a child
who just graduated from high school?

273
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,380
-No, auntie...
-You won't understand.

274
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,590
You don't even know how parents think.

275
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,580
Why am I encountering such a thing?

276
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,880
My daugther is only 18!

277
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,480
She has not reached the legal age
for marriage.

278
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,600
Mom.

279
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,520
Why not take a look at this first?

280
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
(Proposal)

281
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,680
A proposal?

282
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,290
You are quite creative.

283
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,900
Are you treating this as a business?

284
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,430
Selling my daughter?

285
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,790
Fine. Let me have a look.

286
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,010
Let me see what have you written.

287
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,960
But let me to tell you.

288
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,880
No matter what the plan is,
I will not agree to it.

289
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,800
(Xia Rui's Career Plan)

290
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,680
Xia Rui's career plan?

291
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,750
Looking at God Nan's confidence,

292
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,169
I really want to stay and listen
to what they are going to say.

293
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,010
If needed, I can also help. Right?

294
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,390
You don't have to help.

295
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,510
Your help will only make it worse.

296
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,190
Xiao Meishu,
is my position in your heart that bad?

297
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,200
No. It's because Nan Xi
has planned everything.

298
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,040
If you help this time,
it could only be a waste of time.

299
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,400
What you said seems to make sense.

300
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,910
I'll believe you for the time being.

301
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,410
Thank you for believing in me.

302
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,060
Shu, you didn't stay to listen.

303
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,680
What did Rui say about Nan Xi's plan?

304
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,480
It seems like Nan Xi helped Rui
with finding a good school.

305
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,650
Other than allowing Rui
to study in Binhai University,

306
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,200
she will also make use of her specialties.

307
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,540
Is there such a good school?

308
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,010
Why didn't I know about it?

309
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,490
That's because Nan Xi
is putting in a lot of effort.

310
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,029
The school is not necessarily the best.

311
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,230
But it's definitely
the most suitable for Rui.

312
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,480
Once God Nan takes action, he knows best.

313
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,000
I hope they can succeed.

314
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,770
They will definitely succeed.

315
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,040
The four of us
will create history together in Binhai.

316
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,430
Shu, wait for me.

317
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,820
Auntie, this is Xia Rui's career proposal
that we made together.

318
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,110
Have a look at this.

319
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,570
First of all, which university
is good for her to attend?

320
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,860
A local university,
or an overseas university?

321
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,840
-Correct?
-Correct.

322
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,890
I know Xia Rui has tried her best.

323
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,920
But it being the borderline score,
staying here is not the best choice.

324
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,910
So, I want her to go abroad
to get better resources.

325
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,600
What if we found
a suitable university for Xia Rui,

326
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,130
one you are satisfied with?

327
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,230
Please have a look.

328
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,840
These local universities
have been chosen based on score.

329
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,680
This is the most suitable one.

330
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,000
It's Binhai Business School,
the major is in hotel management.

331
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,910
Binhai Business School. Hotel Management.

332
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,470
Mom, there is more information
on Binhai Business School at the back.

333
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,400
Their school is one of the
top management schools in Binhai city.

334
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,720
And their employment rate and
employment direction are in the top three.

335
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,630
You collected all of these?

336
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,080
No. Nan Xi and I did it together.

337
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,630
Even if Binhai Business School
is really suitable for her,

338
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,489
it doesn't mean
that she will successfully get into it.

339
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:58,290
If this school is really as good,

340
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,180
then with Xia Rui's score,
the chances are very low.

341
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,370
Last year's admission requirement
was 435 points.

342
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,810
And her score is 449.

343
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,720
According
to the province's statistical conversion,

344
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,120
it is equivalent to
last year's 440 points,

345
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,509
and she will be able to be admitted.

346
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:14,850
The fluctuation of scores
is not more than 10 points.

347
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,220
Mom, just think of it this way.

348
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,050
If I study abroad, not to mention,
if I can graduate successfully,

349
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,170
there are also many
potential hidden drawbacks and dangers.

350
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,100
But if I can go to Binhai Business School,
it is very close to home.

351
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,560
If you do not trust me that much,

352
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,540
isn't it more convenient for you
to supervise me?

353
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,800
Also, Binhai Business School
is located in University Town...

354
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,330
which is close to Business University.

355
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,030
It'd be convenient for me to go to class.

356
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,170
And also, in Binhai Business School,
there is a famous influencer cafe.

357
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,760
If I can work there,
it'll be very helpful for my career.

358
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,430
Will a cafe really help solve
your employment problem?

359
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,539
Behind is the information of the cafe
participating in barista activities.

360
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:57,300
They will regularly participate
in the National Barista Competitions.

361
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,610
All the judges are famous baristas
from across the country.

362
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,630
If I am lucky enough to work with them,

363
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,539
this means
that even during my time in university,

364
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:08,560
I can get information and connections.

365
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,200
Mom.

366
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,589
It's not that I don't want to go abroad.

367
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,890
I don't want to go abroad
to escape failure in my exams.

368
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,980
If that's the case,
I will always be a failure.

369
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,990
I'd prefer to learn
and accumulate experience here...

370
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,510
to give me a little boost of confidence.

371
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,720
If there is an opportunity to go abroad,

372
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,640
I'll be able to grab it and learn better.

373
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,820
-Grandpa?
-Yeah?

374
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,410
Is she still my sister?

375
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,840
Why can't I understand anything she said?

376
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,970
Me neither.

377
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,120
Is Nan Xi here to propose marriage?

378
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,980
I think there is a bit of that intention.

379
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,960
So, should I keep an eye on them?

380
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,300
Strike while the iron is hot,
to confirm this matter.

381
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,430
Yes, yes, yes.

382
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,080
Strike while the iron is hot.

383
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,350
And what is my mom doing there?

384
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,170
There's no sense of crisis at all.

385
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,890
If she misses this opportunity,

386
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,560
I don't know how long
my sister would have to wait...

387
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,920
to meet the next person interested in her.

388
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,770
Actually,
your mom is not familiar with Nan Xi.

389
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,800
I'll have a proper talk
with your mom later.

390
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,350
I think Nan Xi is not bad.

391
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,550
He's pretty good, right?

392
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,250
Grandpa, I support you.

393
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,190
Tonight, I'll talk to mom.

394
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,480
This time, I've really made up my mind.

395
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,990
I want to do something I like
and am good at.

396
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,980
As you know, I wasn't good at anything
when I was growing up.

397
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,120
Thanks to Boss Yi,
I discovered my love for coffee...

398
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,040
and my talent in coffee making.

399
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,030
Aunt, Xia Rui's is serious
about becoming a barista.

400
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,390
I really meant what I said.

401
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,740
I've placed an order and bought
a lot of management books.

402
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,120
And I also used my New Year's money
to apply for management training course.

403
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,080
If you don't allow me
to attend the course,

404
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,760
the money will go to waste.

405
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,350
How did you even get the money
in the first place?

406
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,600
I got grandpa to give me next year's
New Year's money in advance.

407
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,770
Dad.

408
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,480
Why are you fooling around with the kids?

409
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,350
Actually...

410
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,480
I thought, "What's the difference
in giving it sooner than later?"

411
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,100
Isn't this the same as you in business?

412
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,100
Don't you often go the the bank
to take a loan?

413
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,720
Let's go, quickly.
Just continue talking. We'll get going.

414
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,170
Mom.

415
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,790
I'm already an adult,
I'm already 18 years old.

416
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,420
I can take responsibility for my own life.

417
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,090
What kind of road will I take?
How far will I go in the future?

418
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,680
I want to try it myself.

419
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,570
Rui.

420
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,660
You see, you made it
into such a big thing today.

421
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,880
You're also wearing something formal
like an adult.

422
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,030
You also made a career plan.

423
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,400
But did you do it alone?

424
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,240
It was Nan Xi who helped you a lot.

425
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,940
You want to be responsible for your life.

426
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,490
Can you do it alone?

427
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,810
She's not alone.

428
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,560
Not now.

429
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,700
Not in the future, too.

430
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,640
I'll be responsible with her
in the future.

431
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,680
Nan Xi.

432
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,410
This is not a child's play house.

433
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,150
I know you and Xia Rui
are very good friends.

434
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,350
But Xia Rui can't rely on you
for the rest of her life.

435
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,170
It's impossible for you
to be by her side for a lifetime.

436
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,190
-That's why...
-We will definitely always be together.

437
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,010
I will not lose Xia Rui again.

438
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,240
Please do not send her abroad.

439
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,350
Also, Xia Rui is not relying on me.

440
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,500
We depend on each other.

441
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,100
If not for Xia Rui,

442
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,270
I wouldn't have gone through high school.

443
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,120
Not to mention, the university.

444
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,810
We have always been depending
on one another.

445
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,440
We will always be together in the future.

446
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,840
Mom.

447
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,720
Just believe in me for once.

448
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,040
Lao Yi really just left
without saying goodbye.

449
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,760
"Xia Rui."

450
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,820
"Leaving is not the end."

451
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,070
"It is a new beginning."

452
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,720
"I left you with a parting gift."

453
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,080
"It's a little token for working with me
for three years."

454
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,780
"Us meeting is fate."

455
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,760
"If we are destined to,
we will meet again."

456
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,920
Rui.

457
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,720
What is it that Lao Yi has left for you?

458
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,860
Just these?

459
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,990
What do you mean by "just these?"

460
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,520
Bourbons, Roplanes, Gesha,
they were put together.

461
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,220
They are very expensive, okay?

462
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,520
As long as you are happy with it.

463
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,440
Rui, just now,
when I was filling the application,

464
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,590
I asked Lao Hu.

465
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,000
Lao Hu told me that Lao Yi
ended his career...

466
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,940
because he was going after coach Yang.

467
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,210
Lao Yi and Coach Yang?

468
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,530
Are they together?

469
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,240
Not yet at the moment.

470
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,360
Coach Yang will transfer
to another province.

471
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,600
Lao Yi is traveling
a thousand miles seeking love...

472
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,879
without a single word.

473
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,360
He just packed up and followed.

474
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,520
Looks like
there will be another Bird Tea Cafe there.

475
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,080
I will be waiting to attend their wedding.

476
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,490
I thought
that I wouldn't need to say goodbye.

477
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,920
Seems like I need
to say goodbye to him now.

478
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,520
But...

479
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,840
I still feel a little reluctant.

480
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,180
It's done.

481
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,080
After finishing this coffee,
we need to start working.

482
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,370
Here's yours. Go to the back and clean up.

483
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,740
Sure.

484
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,810
Here's yours. Let's go there and clean up.

485
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,880
Okay.

486
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,960
"Must pass every exam."

487
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,420
What a simple wish to have in high school.

488
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,320
I hope Cheng Erluo's training goes well.

489
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,720
This is Shu's handwriting.

490
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,360
I hope Cheng Erluo will get the MVP.

491
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,230
Please do not get hurt.

492
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,130
You need to win the high school
basketball league championship!

493
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,390
Xiao Meishu's wishes.

494
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,870
Why are they all about me?

495
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,720
She cares about me so much.

496
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,660
Cheng Erluo, come and help!

497
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,110
-Okay!
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.

498
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,120
Wow, this is so heavy.

499
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,880
Come take this.

500
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,859
Let me do it.

501
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,030
Come here, Shu.

502
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,480
Let's clean this place.

503
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,440
(Xia Rui, I like you.)

504
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,760
Don't, don't, don't.

505
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Do you need help on your side?

506
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,880
Okay, I'll help you.

507
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,240
Just tear off the paper like this.

508
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,600
(Xia Rui, I like you.)

509
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,240
What?

510
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,810
It's nothing.

511
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,000
You just pull it. Don't think about it.

512
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,120
I'll come and help.

513
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I'll go help them.

514
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:27,760
You can tear it just like this.

515
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,960
(Xia Rui, I like you.)

516
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,440
Fool, today's words.

517
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,729
I didn't say it to comfort your mother.

518
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,020
I was afraid that your mom won't agree.

519
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,209
I suddenly felt anxious
and spoke out the truth of my heart.

520
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,459
I want to be with you forever.

521
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,050
Not as a good friend.

522
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,280
But to hold your hand...

523
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,440
and accompany you until we're old.

524
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,360
(Xia Rui, I like you.)
