3
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
(College of Architecture)

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,710
It's been two days
since you students enrolled.

5
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,900
So, you have some basic understanding
of the school.

6
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,900
Some students also reported...

7
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,300
that the ratio of boys to girls
in our class is seriously out of balance.

8
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,210
Yes, it's too serious.

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,710
This is also an existing problem
in our department.

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,190
But there is no problem
that cannot be solved.

11
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,740
The 13-character policy...
Just get used to it.

12
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,910
Happiness lies in contentment.
Cherish the person in front of you.

13
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,530
One of our classmates
hasn't met everyone yet.

14
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,790
I will now officially introduce him
to everyone.

15
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,080
Who is that?

16
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,750
Come and introduce yourself to everyone.

17
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,760
Okay.

18
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,540
Gao Ting.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,880
Thank you.

20
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,450
Okay, find a seat to sit down.

21
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,730
This Gao Ting doesn't seem good
to get along with.

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,500
I am Gao Ting.

23
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,660
Nan Xi.

24
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,030
Okay, let's go back to class.

25
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,090
Everybody knows that the name
of our major...

26
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,260
is Architectural Design.

27
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,880
I believe everyone
is already eager to try...

28
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,000
when applying for our major.

29
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,210
Now, congratulations to all of you.

30
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,550
Your dreams have come true.

31
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,970
Complete an architectural model design
within two weeks.

32
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,150
Two weeks?

33
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,850
You must be joking, professor!
The deadline is too soon!

34
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,100
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

35
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,740
I know this is difficult for everyone.

36
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,280
For this assignment,
you will be assigned as a bedroom unit.

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,830
Work together as a group.

38
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,730
The materials and content are not limited.

39
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,440
Professionalism is not required.

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,920
What is important...

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,310
is to show everyone's ability
to conceive and imagine.

42
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,600
We are good in bedroom designs,
Xiao Tiantian.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,560
We're good enough,
but we must endure until the end.

44
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,030
-Why do you care so much?
-It's him.

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,020
-Gao Ting.
-Classmate Gao Ting.

46
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,600
Gao Ting, wait a minute.

47
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,070
I haven't had time to introduce myself.
I am Hu Jing.

48
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,950
You can also call me Fat Tiger.

49
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,070
My name is Hao Tian, so sweet.

50
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,150
Hello, but I don't live in here.

51
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,270
Well, I know.

52
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,280
Your dorm bed is always empty.

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,770
Yes, yes, yes, we just want to ask.

54
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,100
What are you going to do
about the group assignment?

55
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,030
-Group assignment?
-Correct.

56
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,770
Professor Gu said
to use the bedroom as a unit.

57
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,080
There should be someone else
in our bedroom, right?

58
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,169
Yes.

59
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:56,360
Is he willing to cooperate?

60
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,050
-Nan Xi, that...
-Do you need anything?

61
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,010
-I-I-I want to ask you.
-Sorry.

62
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,090
Did you wait for a long time?

63
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,470
No. Did class go well today?

64
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,240
-Yes.
-That's great.

65
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,880
So sneaky. What are you doing?

66
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,350
Swordswoman,
we have a few words to tell Nan Xi.

67
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,930
Speak.

68
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,520
Nan Xi, we think...

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
putting few small dumplings
that meet each other...

70
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,670
in the same steamer...

71
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,650
and go through the cultivation of steam
and high temperature...

72
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,380
will make them perfect together.

73
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,180
This... What a fate it is, right?

74
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,450
I think this fate is worth cherishing.

75
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,950
I don't like xiao long bao.

76
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,980
I lost to you in the entrance examination.

77
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,950
I hope this time,
we will do our best and compete again.

78
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm looking forward to your work.

79
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,430
This... This is just your 0.5 version.

80
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,050
I can tell that both of you
are from the same department.

81
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,650
I am different from him.

82
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,890
Okay, it's just a metaphor.

83
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,050
Yes, yes,
our dumplings are also a metaphor.

84
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,000
Actually, today
we just wanted to apologize...

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,340
for what happened
on the first day school.

86
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,140
Nan Xi, just look at our fate.
We're in the same dormitory.

87
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,550
-Forgive us.
-Yes, forgive us.

88
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,850
You both already apologized.

89
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,150
-Then, do you forgive us?
-Yes.

90
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,960
That's great!

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,930
Swordswoman,
we would like to say sorry to you, too.

92
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,930
-Okay.
-Forget it.

93
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,220
Nan Xi, when are you going back
to the dorm?

94
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,410
Let's make a model together.

95
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,450
-A model what?
-It's nothing.

96
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,561
-What "dormitory as unit?"
-Don't worry.

97
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,701
-What?
-Nothing.

98
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,910
-Am I doing this right?
-It's like this.

99
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,330
The two of them are here.

100
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:13,070
-Coming... Coming...
-Come, come in.

101
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,410
-Hello.
-Why do you look like that?

102
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,450
Come in fast, come in.

103
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,700
So unique.

104
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,840
Artistic.

105
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,880
Sure enough, the aesthetic of God Nan Xi
cannot be understood by us mortals.

106
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,170
Nan Xi, what is this for?

107
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,280
Do you want to camp indoors?

108
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,040
Yes, don't most rented houses come
with their own furniture?

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
Why is there nothing here?

110
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,470
How do you live?

111
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,030
Nan Xi likes the house without anything,
so it's easy to renovate.

112
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,400
Come here, Cheng Erluo, come here.

113
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,870
It's quite pretty. Go, paint the wall.

114
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,290
Did you ask me over
just to be your painter?

115
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,990
It's easy. Wait for the furniture
to be added later.

116
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,750
That's real physical work.

117
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,750
I thought I was here to clean up.

118
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,150
You're asking me to do such a thing.

119
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,540
It's okay. I'll help you with it.

120
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,310
That won't work.

121
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,950
Come here.
Rest and watch us do physical work.

122
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,460
Hurry up. What are you doing?

123
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,360
Good.

124
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,050
Xia Rui, these are some of the works
that Nan Xi left at home that I packed.

125
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,250
I don't know if it's what Nan Xi prefers.

126
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,650
Contact me if you need more.

127
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,130
With these, it will look like a home.

128
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,830
One.

129
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,130
Two.

130
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,350
Three.

131
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,850
Xia Rui, I'm back.

132
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,230
Look, I have prepared a little surprise
for you.

133
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,750
Auntie sent them here for you.

134
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,250
What's wrong?

135
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,130
These are not right.

136
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,250
What are you doing?

137
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,450
Didn't you say you didn't want them?

138
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,850
Didn't you say you don't like them?

139
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,130
I will put them away and send them back.

140
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,250
Anyway, you think these things
are superfluous.

141
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,530
I didn't mean that.

142
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,950
I just want you to feel...

143
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,450
that you can adapt better
if you had your belongings.

144
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,150
I just wanted you to feel at home.

145
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,350
I'm sorry for being superfluous.

146
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,250
Who said you were superfluous?

147
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,850
You said it.

148
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,730
You said you didn't like it just now.

149
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,430
I like it.

150
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,550
You're so inconsistent.

151
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,330
Let you talk about the good and the bad.

152
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,550
I mean, I like everything you do.

153
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,050
It's just...
These things, they're not right.

154
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,450
Didn't you do all those things?

155
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,250
How are they not right?

156
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,950
Many of these are semi-finished
and experimental products...

157
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,250
which cannot be displayed.

158
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,330
You call those semi-finished products?

159
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,250
I think these semi-finished products
will definitely be sold at a good price.

160
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,050
What a pity.
If you don't like it, I will pack it.

161
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,130
Don't pack this.

162
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,250
I didn't get to buy flowers
this morning...

163
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,250
so I just threw in two celery
to see the effect.

164
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,850
Keep this, I like it.

165
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,800
Strange,
there are so many beautiful pieces,

166
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,850
yet you call them semi-finished products.

167
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,150
I put a few celery in here,
and you say it is a piece of art.

168
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,650
I really don't understand
your elite aesthetics.

169
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,950
Fine. I'll give it to you if you like it.

170
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,250
I made many things in this house.

171
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,450
This is the only one you made.

172
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,050
Celery flower arrangements...
They're just right.

173
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,530
I like everything you do.

174
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,050
Don't flatter me.

175
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,550
I don't know how to make any furniture.

176
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,350
What will you let me do? What can I do?

177
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,050
Flower arrangements.

178
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,450
Look, the green pairs up with the yellow.

179
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,730
Doesn't it look like an art piece?

180
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,450
Just a few celeries make an art piece?

181
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,450
You're such a bootlicker.

182
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,230
But I quite like it.

183
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,250
Okay, let's go buy flowers tomorrow.

184
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,050
I'll help you buy fresh flowers everyday.

185
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,750
Okay.

186
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:22,350
As for this, let's settle it tonight.

187
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,530
How do you want it to die?

188
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,050
Fried beef or fried pork,

189
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,730
sliced or diced?

190
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,440
All of those are fine. You decide.

191
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,050
Nan Xi, look.

192
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,730
Nan Xi, Nan Xi, look.

193
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,530
Why are you exercising?

194
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,850
Are you back?

195
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,250
Yes.

196
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,250
Xia Rui, you are back.

197
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,150
You're starving us to death.

198
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,050
Can I starve you? I am not that capable.

199
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,050
You are lazy.

200
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,850
There are so many snacks.

201
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,050
Starving you is a small issue.

202
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,850
-What should we do if Nan Xi starves?
-Be careful, I'll beat you up.

203
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,050
Isn't it unhygienic to order in?

204
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,050
By the way, is your ready-made kitchen
still unused?

205
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,950
How about we do it at our house tonight?

206
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,950
I called Shu over.
She'll come after her rehearsal.

207
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,750
Who said that our kitchen
has not been used?

208
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,450
What?

209
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,450
The two of you secretly used the stove
behind my back?

210
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,050
Don't eat snacks, let me cook.

211
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,050
What? Can Nan Xi cook by himself?

212
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,650
I must have my meal here tonight.

213
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,250
Otherwise, you both are partnering
to sideline me.

214
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,650
This isn't the first time.
Did you just realize that?

215
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,850
No, Xia Rui, you will lose me easily.

216
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,250
All right, all right, just one meal.

217
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,650
Didn't you want to call Shu over?

218
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,650
It's been long since we gathered.
Stay for a meal here.

219
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,050
Let Nan Xi cook, okay?

220
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,250
Okay.

221
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,200
That'll be it.

222
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,930
You came up with this idea.
You go grocery shopping.

223
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,400
Fine, I will buy them.

224
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,450
I'm errand boy material.
I acknowledge that.

225
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,330
What should I buy? Tell me.

226
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,750
-Striped bass...
-Pork belly.

227
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,330
What?

228
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,250
-Chili.
-Tomato.

229
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,850
Wait, wait, wait. Decide on one.

230
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,550
-Scrambled eggs with green onion.
-Broccoli sirloin.

231
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,450
No. What do you actually want?

232
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,850
Add on some cola and chicken wings.

233
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,330
What?

234
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,730
-Just buy them.
-Just buy them.

235
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,930
Didn't you say you were cooking at home?
Why did it change to pizza?

236
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,150
Wouldn't it be good
if you were like this earlier?

237
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,730
Next time, will you still dare to ask?

238
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,450
I don't care.

239
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,550
Nan Xi's cooking,
I will try it sooner or later.

240
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,730
I will not give up.

241
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,350
What are you doing, Shu?

242
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,050
Why are there so many lemons?

243
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,550
I'm making lemonade.

244
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,550
The human body needs 100 milligrams
of vitamin C everyday.

245
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,850
I need five-and-a-half lemons.

246
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,850
These are not even enough for us.

247
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,250
Just drink C100.

248
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,530
Sweet and sour.
It's definitely better than lemonade.

249
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,750
Remember to come
and help me after finishing this.

250
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,450
Hmm, it's better than lemonade.

251
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,650
Come on.

252
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,550
Coming.

253
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,450
How is it? How is it?

254
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,050
A little bit higher on the right.

255
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,950
A little bit higher?

256
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,850
Yes, yes, lower it a little bit.

257
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,250
All right, all right. It's good.

258
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,350
I will be nailing it.

259
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,050
Okay, watch out for your hand.

260
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,130
All right.

261
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,230
Are you okay?

262
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,230
I'm sorry I didn't stand firm.

263
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,730
Rui.

264
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,250
Is this...?

265
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,050
Why did Nan Xi engrave Xia Rui's name
on his bed?

266
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,330
Could it be...? Nan Xi and Xia Rui...?

267
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,330
-Thank you.
-No worries.

268
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,850
I ran out to throw the trash.

269
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,030
You're finally here.

270
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,650
Nan Xi, stop resisting.

271
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,450
I know all of your plans.

272
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,450
You decorated this house
not just to live by yourself.

273
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,030
It's for Xia Rui as well, right?

274
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,650
Why are you looking at me like that?

275
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,250
I just wanted to see if I can help, right?

276
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,150
You and Xia Rui have neither confessed
nor made the relationship clear.

277
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,450
You can find me if you need help.

278
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,550
No need.

279
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,650
Don't leave. Why don't you need it?

280
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,950
You carved Xia Rui's name
on the head of your bed.

281
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,050
You're so mushy. You are really mushy.

282
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,050
I'm warning you, don't spout nonsense.

283
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,150
Don't tell Xia Rui especially. Get it?

284
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,550
I know.
Also, don't you really need my help?

285
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,050
Would you need help
with a candlelight dinner and fireworks?

286
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,450
Otherwise, I can also lend you
the "Handbook for Chasing Women."

287
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,650
Cheng Erluo,
you are already in university.

288
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,530
Can you be a little mature?

289
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,450
Xia Rui, are you leaving?

290
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,250
I have class at 8:00 tomorrow.
I'm a little tired.

291
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,050
I miss my little bed.
I'll get going first.

292
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,750
Let me go with you.

293
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,050
It's okay.
I see that you are quite tired today.

294
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,850
Rest early. See you tomorrow.

295
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,350
Bye.

296
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,850
Xia Rui.

297
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,605
Didn't Xia Rui say she'll wait for you
to come back in the afternoon...

298
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:03,550
to eat together?

299
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,830
Why did she leave?

300
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,050
Why are you looking at me like this?

301
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,650
Nan Xi, I didn't do anything.

302
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,850
Why don't you go back and rest first?

303
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,050
I'll find out about this.

304
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,050
I'll inquire about this.

305
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,040
I will.

306
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,250
Xia Rui, why are you so weird today?

307
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,650
I collected a parcel
for Nan Xi the other day.

308
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,150
What parcel?

309
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,250
A surveillance camera.

310
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,150
A surveillance camera?
Why did he buy that?

311
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,280
It should be hung outside the bedroom door
as before.

312
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,250
It's installed at the door of the bedroom.

313
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,550
Is it necessary?

314
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,750
There shouldn't be any outsiders, right?

315
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,960
Was what I did right or wrong?

316
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,430
Xia Rui, why do you think so?

317
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,250
Look, he finally adapted
to a new environment,

318
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,250
but I took him out
of this safe environment.

319
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,650
What if he now puts himself back
in the safe camera case he bought?

320
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,850
Am I not harming him?

321
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,650
I think it is a bit radical
to let Nan Xi stay in the dormitory.

322
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,750
You are doing it right.

323
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,450
Don't worry,
maybe the camera has other uses.

324
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,450
If you are really worried about him,
I think it's better to ask him directly.

325
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,850
So we can help him.

326
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,880
You are right.

327
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,450
Are you done?

328
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,450
When can your problem be fixed?

329
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,650
Do I have one?

330
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't have one.

331
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,850
Isn't this my strength?

332
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,450
I didn't help you less in
the inquiring news back then in Chenghua.

333
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,050
You inquired about Nan Xi.
I'm too lazy to bother you.

334
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,720
Didn't you ask me for it?

335
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,920
(To: Nan Xi)

336
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,550
Nan Xi, do you know
why Xia Rui got suddenly upset?

337
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,320
I found out.

338
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,730
Okay, I already know.

339
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,150
You know. How did you know?

340
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,850
I haven't said it yet.

341
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,600
Can you read minds?

342
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,050
This... It's still early.

343
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,350
Why don't we go
and have a skewer for dinner?

344
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,050
I'll treat you.

345
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,450
Why can't I invite guests
even though it's my treat?

346
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,650
Save it first for next time.

347
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,750
Let's get have it tomorrow noon.

348
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,050
Decide tomorrow.

349
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,450
I have an appointment
with Nan Xi tomorrow noon...

350
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,350
in front
of the Department of Architecture.

351
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,040
See you tomorrow.

352
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,280
See you tomorrow.

353
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,800
Shu is the only person in the world
who will never abandon me.

354
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,350
I never thought lecturers
would delay class so much.

355
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,350
Have you been waiting long?

356
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,960
It's okay.
Nan Xi hasn't finished his class yet.

357
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,450
Xia Rui, can you stop walking around?

358
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,050
I'm getting dizzy.

359
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,050
Don't bother.

360
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,750
You see. It's so hard to be friends
with couples in love.

361
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,650
We are just light bulbs
when they have a good time.

362
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,050
When they argue,
we'll be the punching bag.

363
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,850
It's none of your business.

364
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,150
That coyness...

365
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,250
Who are you talking to?

366
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,050
I am talking about you.

367
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,950
Are you still the Xia Rui I know?

368
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,650
I know you're worried
about Nan Xi's camera.

369
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,850
Do you want to listen to my opinion?

370
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,050
Even if I wanted to, it's unnecessary.

371
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,250
No, have you two thought about it?

372
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,650
Nan Xi and I are both male.

373
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,650
Yeah, what a coincidence. My God.

374
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,450
Don't keep me guessing. Tell me, quick.

375
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,850
Okay, think about it.

376
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,730
First of all, is Nan Xi's camera
used to take pictures of people?

377
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,650
-Yes.
-So, the point is, who is he targetting?

378
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,250
Who will be in Nan Xi's house?

379
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,650
Who is worthy of being recorded
by Nan Xi's camera?

380
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,720
Shu?

381
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,120
Xia Rui?

382
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,450
Do you want to say you are the one?

383
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,150
I still have this self-acknowledgment.
There is only one truth.

384
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,150
What is it?

385
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,050
The truth is that Nan Xi
installed a camera at home...

386
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,850
just to take pictures
of his handsome look everyday.

387
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,850
Let me tell you.

388
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,950
I have the same tendency as Nan Xi.

389
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,450
I want to make a documentary too.

390
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,680
To record my unruly and handsome demeanor.

391
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,850
Come here.

392
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,450
Do you want to get rewarded?

393
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,050
What is that? Peerless elegance?

394
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,550
Is your mouth really working?
Your mouth...

395
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,650
Ask Nan Xi if you don't believe me.
You're still...

396
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,750
I am here. Looking for me?

397
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,250
Nan Xi, you came at the right time.
I have something to tell you.

398
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,550
What is it?

399
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,250
He slept in class
and is still sleepwalking now.

400
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,050
Right? Go to sleep!

401
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,840
Believe it or not, I will tear your mouth
if you continue spouting nonsense.

402
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,850
Comrades, comrades, comrades.

403
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,450
I grabbed sweet and sour ribs today.

404
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,850
Come, let's share the meat together.

405
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,450
Come, come.

406
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,450
Aren't they to be shared?
Why did you take them all?

407
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,750
Shared meat. First come, first served.

408
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,650
Isn't that right, Nan Xi?

409
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,960
Xia Rui, eat quickly.

410
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,450
Hello, classmate Shu.

411
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,360
I'm Li Haixing from Automation class.
Can we be friends?

412
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,950
Classmate, classmate,
this table is occupied by the four of us.

413
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,050
This canteen is so huge.
Don't squeeze with us.

414
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,041
Get another place.

415
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:28,520
Have youtaken it?
Is your name written on this table?

416
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,240
Look.

417
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,050
I just wrote it.

418
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,850
How dare you talk
to your senior like this?

419
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,450
What's wrong
with talking to you like this?

420
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,050
Do seniors hit on juniors like this?

421
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,760
I didn't harass you.

422
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,040
Fine, you guys have guts. Fine.

423
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,050
Shu, let me tell you.
Today is no better than before.

424
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,250
Your photo is still on the top
of the forum.

425
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,650
So, you must remember this line
in the future.

426
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,650
Watch out for fire, thieves and perverts.

427
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,450
If anything happens in the future,
you must inform me immediately.

428
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,650
-I'll show up whenever I'm needed.
-Okay.

429
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,450
-And me too.
-Okay.

430
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,450
Xia Rui, I'll send you back.

431
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,960
-No need to.
-You do.

432
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,630
You're so quiet.

433
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,250
Yes, our college has fewer people.

434
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,330
Not so many has happened.

435
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,320
I mean, you are so quiet today.

436
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,920
-Nan Xi.
-I'm here.

437
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,450
You received a parcel yesterday.

438
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,400
I opened it by accident.

439
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,050
I saw it.

440
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,450
The house is almost done tidying.

441
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,680
When are you going to install it?

442
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,250
You don't want me to install it?

443
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,050
You rented the house.
You can install it if you want to.

444
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,040
-It's up to you.
-I won't install it then.

445
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,320
-Really?
-Yes.

446
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,760
I've been a little busy lately.
I don't have time for it.

447
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,550
Yes, you've either been
in the laboratory every day...

448
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,950
or you'd come back and continue working.

449
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,560
Have you encountered any problems?

450
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,850
Yes. There is an assignment
which is quite difficult.

451
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,050
Assignment?

452
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,550
There are assignments you can't solve?

453
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,160
It shouldn't be a professional problem.

454
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,250
It's dormitory homework.

455
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,850
Dormitory...

456
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,650
Is it the group assignment
with Hao Tian and Fat Hu?

457
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,840
Are you feeling uncomfortable
working with them?

458
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,450
No.

459
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,640
Did they hurt you?

460
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,400
-It's not that as well.
-What's going on?

461
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,420
It's my problem.

462
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,960
I knew it.

463
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,330
You have an idea about your assignment,

464
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,310
but you don't know
how to tell them, right?

465
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,360
Yes.

466
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,070
Nan Xi, do you know
that you have done a great job?

467
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,950
This is a group assignment.
You didn't think of escaping.

468
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,210
Instead, you're thinking of how to tell
your two roommates in the first place.

469
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,350
I'm proud of you.

470
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,720
You have opened your heart.

471
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,869
This is the hardest and
most difficult step you have completed.

472
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:04,650
The next step, just lay this
piece of homework before your roommates.

473
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,150
Actually, this is the easiest step.

474
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,390
Believe me, Woodie.
This is the simplest way.

475
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,410
Just lay this piece of homework
before them.

476
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,869
It's better to face them in person
instead of speculating here.

477
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:18,310
Believe me,
it's not difficult at all, okay?

478
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,870
Okay.

479
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,880
It's still early.
Do you want me to come with you?

480
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,420
Okay.

481
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,000
Let's go back.

482
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,880
No. Why do I feel
that the ratio is a bit wrong?

483
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,990
It can't be.

484
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,810
I've researched it several times.

485
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,670
This data should be perfectly fine.

486
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,680
Don't be blind. Don't do it.

487
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,920
Nan Xi.

488
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,920
Nan Xi.

489
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,790
Wll, did two of your small self-esteem
get cultivated?

490
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,110
Are you ready?

491
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,370
It's not that easy to work together
with our Nan Xi.

492
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,470
Nan Xi's requirements are very high.

493
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,930
Be careful and be on track.

494
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,950
Don't blame our Nan Xi
if your pride has been hurt.

495
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,150
Does that mean Nan Xi
is going to work with us?

496
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,690
This is what Professor Gu requested.

497
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,569
Otherwise, how would he even work
with both of you who are bad at measuring?

498
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:20,160
-This is too sudden.
-Yes.

499
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,370
Nan Xi, are you serious?

500
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,749
I have finished the drawing
and my part is done. The following...

501
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,210
-Leave it to us.
-Leave it to us.

502
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,990
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Leave it to us.

503
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,210
Should we ask Gao Ting again?

504
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,090
We now have the number one professional.

505
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,550
The second grade
seems to be less important.

506
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,200
It seems so.

507
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,520
Gao Ting, you are here.

508
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,530
Great. Nan Xi has already done
the drawing and now you just join us.

509
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,410
Our alliance is strong.
Our team is surely invincible.

510
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,320
No need. I will do it myself.

511
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm not important anyway.

512
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,410
-What happened?
-Shut up.

513
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,570
Nan Xi, Nan Xi. Do you want to join him?

514
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,120
No need. He can come whenever he wants.

515
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,400
That's true. Nan Xi came to us too.

516
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,200
Don't say anything
if you don't know how to.

517
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,730
I think Gao Ting and Nan Xi are kings.

518
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,610
A mountain cannot tolerate two tigers.

519
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,250
Just like meat buns.

520
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,450
You can't stuff two big pieces
at the same time.

521
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,430
Fat Tiger, why is all that you say
related to food?

522
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,310
I'm really worried
about passing Nan Xi to you.

523
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,170
Swordswoman, don't worry, we are a team.

524
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,720
As long as I, Fat Tiger, have a bite,
Nan Xi won't starve.
