1
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,757
Oh, no.

2
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,009
-Xia Rui.
-Yes?

3
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:00,599
What are you drinking?

4
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,758
Ginger Cola.

5
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,349
Ginger Cola?

6
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,261
Do you have a fever?

7
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,029
No it's not that.

8
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,524
I don't.

9
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,124
Just that
I don't know if I'm tired recently.

10
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:25,048
My resistance has dropped a bit.

11
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,691
So I want to drink a bit for precaution.

12
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:31,768
-Then I'll try it, too.
-Don't, don't.

13
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:34,466
You'll get infected in case
I really have a cold.

14
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,339
Then I will brew another glass.

15
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,872
I'll drink with you.

16
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:53,909
What, what is this taste?

17
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:02,690
Your expression just now is so funny.

18
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,621
-Do you want to take another sip?
-No, no.

19
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,423
-Drink it yourself.
-Take another sip, Nan Xi.

20
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:09,288
-I don't want to.
-Another sip, another sip.

21
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:12,109
-Drink it yourself. I'm busy.
-One more.

22
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:16,784
Show me your boyfriend's strength again.

23
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:28,948
=EPISODE 23 THE BEST COFFEE=

24
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,246
Okay, that's all for today's rehearsal.

25
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,616
Everyone worked hard.

26
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,285
Go back and practice
what was rehearsed today.

27
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,482
Try your best to get good results
in the final exam.

28
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,689
End of class.

29
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:54,672
Yishu.

30
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,028
What's wrong with you today?

31
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,653
What's with your state of mind?

32
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,231
When you realize the man you deeply love
for many years doesn't love you,

33
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,528
where are your tears?

34
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,720
Resentment?

35
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,210
I'm sorry, senior.

36
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:12,334
My understanding for this role
may have a different meaning.

37
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,022
I think this feeling...

38
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,660
is not resentment.

39
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,039
You are playing a role, not yourself.

40
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,203
Maybe you do not have such feelings.

41
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:26,832
But the character will have it.

42
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,976
The crying scene is a small climax.

43
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,285
When the show officially starts,

44
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,116
I hope you are able to cry.

45
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,252
Okay.

46
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,999
It's okay,
adjust your state, try your best.

47
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,974
Thank you senior, goodbye.

48
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,100
Goodbye senior.

49
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,051
Shu.

50
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,630
Thirsty? Tired?

51
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,517
Drink some sweet ShuiRong 100.

52
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:51,595
Take vitamins from five and a half lemons
to get enough supplements.

53
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:54,746
You've already hit me and scolded me.

54
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,766
Forgive my immaturity, please?

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,752
Actually,

56
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,026
I went back and gave it a thought.

57
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,096
I was also wrong.

58
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,460
Is your leg okay?

59
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,831
I have thick skin, I'm already fine.

60
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:15,134
Shu. I guarantee you in just a few years
you will definitely be a big star.

61
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,816
By that time, I, Cheng Erluo,
will be your number one fan.

62
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,721
Why didn't you go training today?

63
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,743
Captain is busy, so it ended early.

64
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,096
I was too busy awhile back.

65
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:26,746
The task of picking you up was hindered.

66
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,095
But from today,
I, bodyguard Cheng, is back in action.

67
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,698
How was it?

68
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:34,041
Has anyone harassed you recently?

69
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:37,277
No.

70
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,591
Good then. Where are you going later?
I can fetch you.

71
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,493
It's still early,
let me find Xia Rui first.

72
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:44,605
Find Xia Rui?

73
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:47,604
That's great.
Let them see our reconciliation.

74
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,834
You wait for me. I'll go get changed.

75
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:53,654
Sure. No worries, take your time.

76
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:54,747
What to do?

77
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:55,893
What's wrong with Xia Rui?

78
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:57,072
Is she unhappy?

79
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:59,829
She's getting a headache
because of the competition.

80
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,362
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:05,886
Xia Rui, who bullied you?

82
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,637
Si Bo, you're also here?

83
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,912
I've always heard that
Yami cafe is pretty good.

84
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,126
I'm free today anyway. So I came over.

85
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,978
By the way, I suddenly remembered
I have something to deal with.

86
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,198
I have to leave.

87
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,395
Don't, Si Bo.

88
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,069
You've just arrived
and you're leaving already?

89
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,002
I've watched the competition video
against the sport college today.

90
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,657
I have a question
I've been wanting to ask.

91
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,409
If it's okay with you,

92
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,654
can I have ten minutes?

93
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:32,801
Sure.

94
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,618
Xia Rui. Give us two cups.

95
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:37,470
Give us two of the best.

96
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:40,040
Quick, let me show you.

97
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,560
Have you reconciled?

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,977
It can't keep going on like this.

99
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,842
That's right.

100
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:50,056
Reasoning with a fool like him,
there is no point.

101
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,481
Si Bo didn't look for you anymore
after that?

102
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,628
Are you guys meeting
for the first time here?

103
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,443
The first time.

104
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,126
Then he's quite a gentleman.

105
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:02,465
He kept his words.

106
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,156
But...

107
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:07,286
Why does it feel like
he's retreating in order to advance?

108
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,509
It feels a bit weird.

109
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,779
It's okay.
You have made it clear to him anyway.

110
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:15,934
But this Cheng Erluo.

111
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:19,594
It's a three people movie
but he's acting as if he's not in it.

112
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:23,000
I think you need to make it clear to him.

113
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,577
You see, even our Nan Xi has spoken.

114
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,526
Say what?

115
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,181
About Si Bo having a crush on me?

116
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,050
No.

117
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,250
It's telling Cheng Erluo
that you like him.

118
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:40,573
Human feelings...

119
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:43,404
are like these three glasses
of Shu iRong 100.

120
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:46,399
Grapefruit stands for bitterness.

121
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:51,486
Green lime stands for sweet and sour,
just like you.

122
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:55,973
Then, lemon means youth without regrets.

123
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:59,247
Like you, who's like a flower, fragrant.

124
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,536
Both of you came a long way.

125
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,612
And tasted everything along the way.

126
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,091
You have to understand.

127
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,768
He also has to understand.

128
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:12,086
How do I tell him?

129
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,174
Tell him that I'm sorry.

130
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:17,296
You've only treated me like a sister.
But I've always liked you?

131
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:19,593
Forget it, just go with the flow.

132
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,550
No, you can't let this go with the flow.
You can't let it flow.

133
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,762
Especially
when there's a third party involved.

134
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:27,327
Like a suitor who's courting you.
That's even worse.

135
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,719
Just look at that Cheng Erluo.

136
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,494
Such an insensitive person.

137
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:33,547
If you don't tell him,
he will never know you like him.

138
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:35,941
So awkward,
why don't you resolve this mess at once.

139
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,229
Isn't it right, Nan Xi?

140
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:39,726
-Yes.
-See.

141
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:42,548
Even Nan Xi
has become a relationship expert.

142
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,417
Why can both you show affection
just by talking about my problem?

143
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,447
You can invite him
to the Best Restaurant.

144
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:56,713
Best Restaurant?

145
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,156
You never heard of it?

146
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:02,495
I heard it from my customers here.

147
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,456
No unsuccessful confession
has ever happened in this Best Restaurant.

148
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,949
If it doesn't succeed,
you just add a dessert.

149
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,017
It'll surely work.

150
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:11,389
Just give it a try,
that's a holy land for confession.

151
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:16,450
Why are the three of you
whispering sneakily like mice?

152
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,820
Are you talking behind my back?

153
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,979
-Yes.
-No.

154
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,181
Is it a yes or no?

155
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,588
-No.
-Yes.

156
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,017
Do we need to talk about you
behind your back?

157
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,180
That's true.

158
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:29,546
But it's really great
I got to bump into Si Bo today.

159
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,621
You quite like this Si Bo, don't you?

160
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,658
Of course! Let me tell you.

161
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:39,375
Si Bo is the second most excellent person
I've met in my life.

162
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:42,021
Of course, the most excellent is Nan Xi.

163
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,574
I'm just telling the truth.

164
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:48,897
But Si Bo is really nice.

165
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,871
He even offered to help me
with practice next week.

166
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:51,999
Shu.

167
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,750
Do you particularly dislike Si Bo?

168
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,105
It seems like both of you
are avoiding each other today.

169
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,420
At least you noticed that.

170
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,336
Nothing, don't think about it.

171
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,563
That's good then.

172
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,376
I was thinking about taking a week off.

173
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:18,067
But our coach is back,
he's asking me to come back.

174
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:19,772
I guess I can't have dinner tonight.

175
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,904
I'm leaving.

176
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,556
Really, there's something
really wrong with his brain.

177
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:32,276
How about this? I'll talk to him for you?

178
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,373
It's okay, no need for that.

179
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,506
It's almost end of semester.
Everyone's quite busy.

180
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:40,498
You're just going to drag it like this?

181
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,452
I'll tell him
after the end of semester report.

182
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,294
Alright then,
I'll wait for your good news.

183
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,748
Great, great, great.

184
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,711
Nan Xi.

185
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,387
Come quickly!

186
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:10,494
Okay.

187
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,687
-What is it?
-Help me move this, I can't move it.

188
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,955
Here, three, two, one.

189
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,296
Be careful.

190
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,071
Gently, gently.

191
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,084
Long live, mom.

192
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:31,410
My goodness.

193
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,368
Coffee machine?

194
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:41,991
Don't worry.

195
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,021
I won't treat you like a guinea pig.

196
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:49,238
Because we'll both be guinea pigs.

197
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:57,272
You can't escape.

198
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:01,047
Try this cup first.

199
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,384
This cup, I've reduced the water volume
based on the previous espresso.

200
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,233
Shortened the extracted essence.

201
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:09,829
And that makes the coffee richer,
drink quickly.

202
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:15,291
I also used peel particles
to neutralize the sweetness of milk.

203
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,483
To highlight the fruity aroma.

204
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:19,662
It's quite nice.

205
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:21,447
As for the fruity aroma,

206
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,758
I can't taste it.

207
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:24,863
Really?

208
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,254
Then, try tasting all of these.

209
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,249
After tasting,

210
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,661
please write down your feelings
and ratings.

211
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:36,967
Try your best.

212
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,610
Well, this is pretty tasty.

213
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,291
I can taste the fruity aroma now.

214
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,664
You still have to write it down.

215
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,749
What about you?

216
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,872
I came up with a new formula.

217
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,404
I have to try.

218
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,166
Xia Rui, I have to concentrate
on one thing at a time.

219
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,370
I can't multi-task.

220
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,666
I'll wash the cup first.

221
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:05,607
You can taste my coffee
while washing the cups.

222
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:09,584
How is it?

223
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:12,446
A bit bitter.

224
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,531
True, a bit bitter.

225
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:19,728
Must've used the wrong beans,
let me try again.

226
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:22,971
Xia Rui, I think
it's because I've drank too much.

227
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,214
I can't taste it anymore.

228
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,175
Then, take a rest and try again later.

229
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,061
Nan Xi, I can't hold it anymore.

230
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:37,288
Right away.

231
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:38,404
Okay.

232
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:46,580
Quick.

233
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:00,254
Why are you still here?

234
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,872
I have to go again.

235
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,253
Sleep like this.

236
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:50,031
You first.

237
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:53,367
You go first.

238
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,360
It's fine.

239
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,592
I'm not in a hurry.

240
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:01,196
I'm also not in a hurry.

241
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,590
Well.

242
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,735
I will heat up the bread for you first.

243
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,500
You can eat on the way.

244
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:11,500
Is that so?

245
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,607
Yes.

246
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,291
I'll go first then.

247
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,778
Sure, you go first.

248
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,170
Really?

249
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:21,006
Go!

250
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,444
Okay!

251
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:40,968
Not too bad.

252
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:42,518
Getting more and more skilled.

253
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,487
It's still a bit...

254
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,764
It's okay, this cup is for you.

255
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:57,528
This tulip is so life like and vivid.

256
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:00,447
I cannot bear to drink it.

257
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,612
I think you should bring it
back to the dorm.

258
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,383
And leave it at the windowsill.

259
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:08,354
And look at it like this, everyday.

260
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,435
Are the younger generation these days,
all so hypocritical?

261
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:16,972
Everything I say is the honest truth,
okay?

262
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:19,336
That's right.
Do not slander our friendship.

263
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,508
Go, mind your own business,
don't bother us.

264
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:23,079
I was wrong, sisters.

265
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,381
Let's have a taste.

266
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,575
Taste it, taste it.

267
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:31,605
How is it?

268
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:37,310
It's okay.

269
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,471
Not bad.

270
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:41,435
Sure enough, hard work pays off.

271
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:45,589
I am feeling more confident
about your coffee competition now.

272
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:46,828
Try your best.

273
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,043
Okay.

274
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:50,021
What's wrong?

275
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,803
What else is unsatisfactory?

276
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:56,559
I have confidence
when it comes to the taste of coffee.

277
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,706
-Okay.
-But this pattern...

278
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,128
Although baristas
think latte art is optional,

279
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,865
but I myself quite enjoy doing latte art.

280
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:08,099
And I think it's also quite important.

281
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,061
That's right.

282
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:12,357
Of course, what you like
is the most important, it's okay.

283
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:16,630
Although there are improvements
in my skills everyday.

284
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,818
But these patterns,
I just keep imitating them.

285
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,679
But no breakthrough at all.

286
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:25,820
The highest level of latte art
is originality.

287
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:31,598
Boss Yi is right.

288
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to be original.

289
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,416
How will you hold a pen?

290
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:49,907
I think I can do it again,
isn't it just an exam?

291
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,352
Can't trouble me, Xia Rui.

292
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:53,243
Have a taste.

293
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:00,245
Is it nice?

294
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:02,946
Yes.

295
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,208
This is a new product
developed by our boss today.

296
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,767
Besides having a hint of fragrance...

297
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,684
There are 10,000 viewers?

298
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:26,085
Your fingerprint is more than enough.

299
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,217
Got it, hurry up.

300
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:29,404
We're late.

301
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:44,829
Sorry, sorry.

302
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,040
Hi, everyone.

303
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,226
Anyway, I'm teaching you
how to make coffee today.

304
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:50,417
I will show the demonstration directly.

305
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,924
Don't turn it off.
No, surely the operation is wrong.

306
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,041
I'll do it again. I'll do it another way.

307
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:06,218
It's fine, exams are more important.

308
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,654
I'm only gone for one day.
I'll be back soon.

309
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:23,072
Don't rush, take it slow.

310
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:25,858
Look, like this.

311
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,720
Goodnight, Xia Rui.

312
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,048
Nan Xi.

313
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:29,665
Do your best in the exam.

314
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,438
Okay.

315
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:40,791
Your competition, try your best.

316
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,300
Okay.

317
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,885
I hereby announce,
the World Barista competition.

318
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:49,462
Eastern China preliminary rounds
officially begin.

319
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,388
Next, we'll invite the judges
to come on stage to score.

320
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,159
There are two components
that are making your coffee.

321
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,466
What's the...

322
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:15,537
The first is syrup.

323
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,046
What is the second one?

324
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:19,667
Pu Er Tea.

325
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,704
Extraordinary.

326
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:25,975
Interesting.

327
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:59,355
I hereby announce five contestants
entering the finals.

328
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:05,745
They are Fang Huaien, Xia Rui, Wu Tingyou,
Lin Zhiyao and Zhuoling.

329
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:10,438
As expected.

330
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:16,602
Congratulations to these contestants.

331
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:33,840
2017 World Barista Competition
Eastern China Region Rematch...

332
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,364
will officially start in three hours.

333
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,292
To all the contestants, do your best.

334
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:56,755
Students, get ready for the exam.

335
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,586
Please put away your phones.

336
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,008
This exam is very important.

337
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:04,976
I hope everyone will take it seriously.

338
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,361
Boss Yi, I'll go to the bathroom.

339
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,738
Xia Rui, what's wrong?

340
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:36,528
Boss Yi, I did not prepare anything
for the rematch.

341
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,578
What should I do next?

342
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:39,988
Are you nervous?

343
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,546
How can I not be?

344
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,182
Please don't scare me.

345
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:46,179
How is it possible that
Xia Rui is nervous.

346
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,839
Stop teasing me already, please help me.

347
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,707
-I'm nervous.
-Okay, okay.

348
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:54,332
Do you remember what I told you before?

349
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,966
Empty your mind.

350
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:59,043
And only think about
the person you love most.

351
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,893
Coffee made in this way, is the best.

352
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,575
The person I love most.

353
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:12,134
Thirty minutes have passed.

354
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,020
Please answer the paper carefully.

355
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,214
Read carefully.

356
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,471
Nan Xi.

357
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,480
Professor, I have something urgent.

358
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,812
This, you...

359
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:46,980
Baby whale? You made this?

360
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:51,635
I will call you Woodie from now on.

361
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:53,180
You can call me little bell.

362
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,408
Baby whale is our secret.

363
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,363
You can't tell anyone else.

364
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:05,111
Nan Xi, I think I am pretty timid.

365
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,850
Especially scared of losing things.

366
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:13,425
Just like you, lost and recovered.

367
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:18,331
I'll be here, don't be afraid.

368
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:22,066
I've told you.

369
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:24,114
You are my end.

370
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,790
Xia Rui.

371
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,262
Promise me, always be my end.

372
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,573
I can't believe
you learned how to do latte art.

373
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:09,942
Did you learn from Boss Yi?

374
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,128
Guess.

375
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,050
When you got into Binhai University,

376
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,571
it was you
who gave me courage and confidence.

377
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:20,581
This latte art is one of my memories.

378
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:33,459
One cannot be too delicate with latte art.

379
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,423
Which is why the pattern
cannot be too complicated.

380
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:38,759
If you emphasize on the beauty.

381
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,053
You can add some decoration on it.

382
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:57,314
What's the matter?

383
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:58,863
You're so cute.

384
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:14,566
Okay, all the coffees are completed.

385
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:17,425
We'll invite the judges
to come on stage to score.

386
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:22,094
The annual World Barista Competition...

387
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:25,572
East China Region rematch
is coming to an end.

388
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:31,635
Which barista from our East China Region
can make it to the finals?

389
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:36,507
I hereby announce, the top three finalists
making it to the finals.

390
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,426
They are Wu Tingyou.

391
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:45,719
Lin Zhiyao.

392
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:53,520
And the champion for this
East China Region Preliminary Round is...

393
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,434
Zhuoling, congratulations!

394
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:02,079
Congratulations to all the winners.

395
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,984
Let's welcome Mr. Umberto
to hand out the awards for the winners.

396
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,694
Nan Xi.

397
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:14,929
Nan Xi.

398
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,279
Nan Xi.

399
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:22,453
It was already unexpected for me
to enter the rematch, right?

400
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:25,776
Yes.

401
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,598
Didn't you have an exam today?

402
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:30,983
Yes.

403
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:32,956
You finished the paper?

404
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,941
Yes.

405
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,079
Our Woodie is a genius indeed.

406
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,777
Thank you.

407
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,573
The coffee I made today, was my best.

408
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:48,060
Do you want to have a taste?

409
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:51,469
Yes.

410
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,593
I'll make it for you
when we go back to Binhai.

411
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,359
Okay.

412
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,963
Xia Rui.

413
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:06,952
Mr. Umberto.

414
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,401
Although you didn't win anything
this competition,

415
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,953
my biggest surprise this time
was discovering you.

416
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,625
Me?

417
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:17,488
Your sense of taste
and understanding of coffee.

418
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:20,987
I haven't seen a barista
like this in years.

419
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:23,832
Thank you, sir.

420
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:25,879
I really like making coffee.

421
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,838
I've seen your information.

422
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,485
You are now a university student
majoring in management.

423
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,660
Correct.

424
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,407
Have you thought about coming to Italy?

425
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:39,045
To learn how to be a professional barista.

426
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:43,712
Me? Italy?

427
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,473
I'll give you my business card.

428
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:49,228
To be exact, it's with me.

429
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,759
As long as you pass our language test,

430
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,078
I'm willing to be your referrer.

431
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:58,435
And undergo a one year barista training
in our school.

432
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,152
Thank you, Mr. Umberto.

433
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:10,894
I am grateful for your recognition.

434
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,963
But I am sorry that
I am unable to accept your invitation.

435
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:17,355
Do you mind if I ask why?

436
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,443
Because when I graduated high school,
my mother wanted me to go abroad.

437
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,488
In order to stay in China back then,

438
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,163
we put in a lot of effort
and tried our best.

439
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:30,112
If I go abroad this time,
all our efforts back then will be wasted.

440
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,511
-You guys?
-Yes, us.

441
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:37,046
Without us, I would be unable
to draw the baby whale pattern.

442
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:38,223
I understand.

443
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:41,715
People who are more important than dreams,
should be treasured.

444
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:45,439
I respect your choice,
if you ever change your mind,

445
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,099
please feel free to contact me.

446
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,517
Thank you, Mr. Umberto.

447
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,478
Thank you.

448
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:57,994
It seems that Mr. Umberto
really appreciates you.

449
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:00,648
Xia Rui.

450
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:04,419
Let me.

451
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,208
Why have you been in the bathroom
for so long?

452
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,679
I really want to go,
please wait for me, okay?
