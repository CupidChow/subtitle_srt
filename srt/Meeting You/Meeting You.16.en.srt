1
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000
Nan Xi.

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you ready?

3
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Let's go.

4
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
Good morning grandma!

5
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Is breakfast ready?

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
It's downstairs.

7
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm going to have breakfast!

8
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
She's really grown up now.

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Good morning grandpa!

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,700
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Hot! Hot! Be careful.

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Isn't it the nine o'clock train?

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
What's the hurry?

14
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Today is Monday

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Nan Xi said there might be a traffic jam.

16
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Rui Rui.

17
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
Your mother is calling again.

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,300
Is it really unnecessary to send you off?

19
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,600
This girl is all grown up, can't make her stay anymore.

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
This is mom's friend at Binhai

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,500
Uncle Wang's business card

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,600
At Binhai, no matter what you encounter

23
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
you can find Uncle Wang.

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,000
- He will try his best to help you.
- Okay.

25
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,600
You've never left home.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you can't get used to staying in the school dormitory,

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
it's okay.

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Do not force yourself. Okay?

29
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,900
Okay.

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,700
It's late.

31
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,600
Get in the car.

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Mom.

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
If you miss me, call me.

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,600
Video call is also fine.

35
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
Okay.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay.

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,900
I am leaving.

38
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,200
Go.

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,900
After three months

40
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,200
I'll come back after winter vacation.

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,300
Alright, alright.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Okay, okay, okay.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
Good, good, good.

44
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm leaving.

45
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
Once you're gone

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
no one will complain to me anymore.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Me, my life will be better.

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Stop watching your idol drama.

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Don't get caught.

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, okay, okay

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't worry.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
Xia Rui, Have a round with grandpa.

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Let's go.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
One, Two, Three, Four

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
- It'll hurt, be gentle.
- Five.

56
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Six. Seven.

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,700
You learn this fast.

58
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
Taxi is here.

59
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,200
- Grandpa.
- Nan Xi!

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,600
- Grandma.
- Nan Xi.

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
This young man is so handsome.

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
We'll be leaving then.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Let me do it.

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
She is strong, let her take it.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,300
I'm definitely not his favorite.

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
- Please consider calling home every night.
- Yes.

67
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,100
I know, I know. How many times have you said it.

68
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,500
Hurry up and leave.

69
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,400
Go back inside quickly, goodbye.

70
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,100
[Episode 16]
[A new beginning]

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I, Xia Rui am back again!

72
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I... back!

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
No, it's I'm back.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Nan Xi.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,800
This... What is the purpose of language communication?

76
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,200
- What is it?
- To communicate.

77
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,700
Then, what is the point of communication?

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,300
What is it?

79
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,800
To understand what we express to each other

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,000
and to avoid misunderstanding, right?

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
So when I said  I back

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Did you understand what I said?

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
I understood.

85
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,500
Then I... back

86
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,600
I am back

87
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Am back

88
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
When I express these, does it make any difference?

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,300
There seems to be no difference.

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Well, that's it then!

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
The grammar is wrong.

92
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,500
Grammar is only important for the exam.

93
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,000
But we are now at the start of classes

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Not sitting for an exam.

95
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
- But if we're talking about English exam...
- Nan Xi

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
It's the first day of school.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Relax.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Binhai University, I coming.

99
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
It's I'm coming.

100
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,300
I ran over as soon as I received your call.

101
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,800
Why haven't you checked in?

102
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm done, but Nan Xi hasn't yet.

103
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,200
What is Chubby Cheng doing?

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
He told us to wait here

105
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
so he'll help us with luggage?

106
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,300
We waited the whole day, but he's nowhere to be seen.

107
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
He's already gone missing and escaped on the first day of school?

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He probably hasn't finished training.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
But their basketball club is also insane.

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Morning exercise on the first day of school.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Ruined our first train traveling plan coming here.

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
I even bought playing cards!

113
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
What a waste! You even have to change your booking.

114
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
- I'm furious!
- It's okay.

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
Isn't he scared of taking the night train alone?

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
I kept him company.

117
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,700
Moreover, we have plenty of time to travel together.

118
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,800
- Just keep the cards first, okay?
- Okay then.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Are you busy later?

120
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,400
No. Just waiting for Cheng ErLuo.

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Then you keep Nan Xi company here.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I need to get him registered.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
It's so crowded there.

124
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,500
I feel confused just looking at it

125
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,000
It'll be fine.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,300
Let's go together.

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,800
Listen to me, stay here obediently.

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
I'll be right back. Be good.

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Alright.

130
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,200
Here, give him some information.

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Next.

132
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Student. That student.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hello, what is your name?

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,100
I'm helping a friend.

136
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
It's Nan Xi.

137
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,400
Nan Xi?

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Are you Nan Xi?

139
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
The double first-place Nan Xi from our professional culture class.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
- No, no no.
-That's not right, Nan Xi?

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
It's a guy, why is this a girl?

142
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,200
No, no.

143
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm his friend and I am helping him out.

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,900
Then, what is your relationship with Nan Xi?

145
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Didn't I say it?

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
We're friends.

147
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,000
Just leave Nan Xi's affairs to me in the future.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
Leave everything to you?

149
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,500
Yes, what I mean is I help him.

150
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,000
Sure, no problem, I understand.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then, here is the information.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Please help him keep it.

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,500
No, wait. Teacher...

154
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,900
It's OK, we've been through it.

155
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,200
Senior understands. Okay.

156
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Next.

157
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Sure enough, university is different from high school.

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,700
But how can these people be so gossipy?

159
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,200
It's just as the saying goes

160
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,700
from the end of puppy love to marriage

161
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,600
it's something that happens over high school summer vacation.

162
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Sinister people.

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I need to bring Nan Xi to take pictures after lunch.

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,400
And stick the pictures here after taking them.

165
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,200
Then our Nan Xi will be the best looking boy in this campus.

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
Okay everyone!

167
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
The one standing next to me

168
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,100
has already been popular in our school forum during the art exam.

169
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,300
The prettiest freshman Zhao Yishu.

170
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,800
And the one next to her

171
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,600
is the first place in our school's architectural professional culture

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
Nan Xi!

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
This is so unexpected.

174
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
These two are the talented and the beauty.

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
A match made in heaven!

176
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't talk nonsense.

177
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,900
What? Don't talk nonsense, okay?

178
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,200
Then can I please ask both of you

179
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
what is your relationship?

180
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Look at this camera.

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
What is the matter?

182
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
What are you doing?

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,500
Stop shooting.

184
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
This student

185
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,800
Do you know, what are you doing in broad daylight?

186
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,400
You are infringing on a reporter's independent interview right.

187
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,300
Do you know that?

188
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,200
This student,

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
You are violating the privacy of the interviewee.

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,600
You secretly take pictures, distort facts and spread rumors.

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,900
What kind of reporter are you?

192
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,800
Go away!

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Panghu Look! She deleted all the videos!

194
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,400
I will definitely give you a decent funeral.

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,800
Next time before you take someone's picture

196
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
please inform them first, get it?

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Everyone please comment.

198
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
It took me the whole morning to shoot.

199
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
- She deleted it and asked us to leave.
- That's right.

200
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Why did you drop my oil cake?

201
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
You give it back, you compensate!

202
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
Please control yourself.

203
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Which college are you from? So barbaric.

204
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
None of your business.

205
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,100
Freshmen.

206
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
Welcome everyone to Binhai University.

207
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
Shu, are you alright?

208
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
This person... Who is this person?

209
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
You don't even know him?

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
This is senior SiBo.

211
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,900
I think you guys owe them an apology.

212
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,800
But, senior we are from the press team.

213
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,200
You are from the press club?

214
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
We are

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
I remember the reporters from Binhai University press team

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,600
when taking portrait photos

217
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,200
they get consent of the party involved.

218
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,400
If you guys are interested in joining them

219
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,200
shouldn't you guys first understand their rules and regulations?

220
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,500
Just apologize.

221
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,800
Sorry.

222
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Well, I shouldn't shoot without your consent.

223
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,600
- And?
- What else?

224
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,300
Also, they are couple.

225
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
We shouldn't jump to conclusions

226
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,500
and promote Shu as Nan Xi's girlfriend.

227
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
Shu and Nan Xi?

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
This student are you here to be funny?

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,300
That's it.

230
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,000
Everyone is from the School of Architecture.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
And will meet in the future.

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Let bygones be bygones.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Just let it go.

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why did the School of Architecture recruit such people?

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Which college are you from then?

236
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,600
- I --
- This is my boss

237
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,900
ChengHua Middle School First Lady, Xia Rui.

238
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,000
Next time if you see her around call her 'Brother Rui'.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
There's nothing to lose.

240
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
So, is it sister or brother?

241
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Enough! Everyone go back.

242
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It'll busy in the beginning of semester.

243
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
Just leave.

244
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,500
Xia Rui. Don't blame them.

245
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm fine.

246
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
But when I face you guys

247
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't say three words.

248
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
This is so not me.

249
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
Please remember.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
- You are the most unique.
- Exactly.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Why are you more sensitive after attending university?

252
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
It's okay.

253
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
Yeah, why did I suddenly become sensitive?

254
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
-It's okay, university is wonderful.
- Exactly.

255
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,700
Ignore them.

256
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,000
Quick, let me introduce you.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
This is a Class Four Senior, Senior Lu SiBo

258
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,000
From the same department as Nan Xi

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
and the captain of our basketball team.

260
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
I am stepping down this year.

261
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Nice to meet you in the final year of university.

262
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
Why does this senior look so familiar?

263
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,700
- Where...
- Where did I see him?

264
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,000
We should have met during your Art Exam.

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes. During Art Exam at the school gate, right?

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Nice to see you... you guys again.

267
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,400
Okay. I have something else.

268
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100
Let me deal with it first.

269
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Nan Xi.

270
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,800
I've seen your entrance exam.

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,600
I really admire your talent.

272
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
If you need anything at our college next time,

273
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,200
find me anytime.

274
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
I'll take my leave now.

275
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,000
- Goodbye, senior.
- See you.

276
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,000
Haven't you been to the dorm yet?

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's not enough time

278
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,200
with the situation just now.

279
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
I say

280
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,400
I don't know how is it like at the girl's dormitory

281
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,800
But our male dormitory

282
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,900
the scent of man is a bit strong.

283
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm ready.

284
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
How strong? H-how strong is it?

285
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Nan Xi

286
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,700
I don't know if he'll get used to it.

287
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
Shu

288
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,800
This is the letter from our dormitory.

289
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,700
Later

290
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,000
just put the box back into the dormitory with ErLuo, okay?

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I have to accompany Nan Xi to see his dormitory

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm so worried.

293
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
It's okay I can do it myself.

294
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,800
Be obedient, I'll accompany you today.

295
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
- Put on your bag.
- It'll be fine.

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Be obedient. Quick.

297
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Put on your bag, let's go.

298
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Bye.

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
- Bye Bye.
- Bye Bye.

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
-Give me.
- I'll take it.

301
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,900
Are you listening to me?

302
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,500
Let's go, I'll take it.

303
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,600
Binhai University.

304
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,700
Hello student!

305
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,600
This is nice.

306
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,200
I didn't expect to meet the famous guy from your college the first day of school.

307
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
But what the reporter said was right.

308
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
You are the new male idol.

309
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,800
He's the senior idol.

310
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,600
If this senior Lu looks after you in college in the future

311
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,000
I be can rest assured.

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,900
You don't know all the girls looked at me when I shouted your name.

313
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,900
The true radiance of our Woodie.

314
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,400
It is impossible to flinch from you.

315
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,300
Oh.

316
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,800
Other than Oh and Ohm

317
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,200
Can you say something else?

318
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,800
Yes.

319
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,900
- You're making me angry on purpose, right?
- Oh.

320
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,800
- You still said that.
- Oh.

321
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,100
- You're asking for it, right?
- Oh

322
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,500
I realized once you entered university

323
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
your true colours are showing.

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,200
You better not pick up bad habits from others, do you know that?

325
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,500
Will it have a bad influence?

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
Bike, bike, bike.

327
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Quick.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
Look at how wonderful university life is.

329
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,700
I must give up on my old mentality.

330
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,600
I need to become an ambitious and progressive college student.

331
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
What else can you improve on?

332
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,700
I wish to improve this.

333
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,600
You've been bad, too.

334
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I haven't.

335
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,500
Look at this university.

336
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,800
There are all kinds of people here.

337
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
No one will pay attention to you all the time.

338
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,200
You need to learn how to relax, okay?

339
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Relax.

340
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Okay.

341
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,500
I saw the anime club over there just now.

342
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,200
And also basketball club

343
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
And also there is this Silence Club.

344
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,300
Silence club

345
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
It really suits you.

346
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,400
Tailored for you.

347
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Don't even think about it.

348
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
I will not go.

349
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,600
Definitely not.

350
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
Of course I know you won't go.

351
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,100
I'm just thinking about how wonderful university life is.

352
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
Without LaoHu's and ShaoZong's control.

353
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,800
I can freely do anything I want.

354
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I need to cherish these four years that were so hard to win.

355
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
Is this the same university life as we imagined?

356
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,600
The university life I imagined?

357
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,200
It's... you.

358
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,200
There's you.

359
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,300
And then?

360
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,000
Nothing else.

361
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,800
That's it?

362
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
That's it.

363
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Okay.

364
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,300
I know you treat me Xia Rui, the best.

365
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,200
Don't worry.

366
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
As long as I'm here

367
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
I will make sure your university life

368
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,700
even better, more wonderful

369
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,400
A thousand times more beautiful.

370
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,100
Ten thousand times more

371
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,800
A billion times.

372
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Ten billion times.

373
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
One hundred billion times.

374
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
How about it?

375
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,700
I believe that.

376
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,200
But isn't our college too far away from here?

377
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,300
Our canteen seems to be quite close.

378
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,400
How about taking a walk here every time after meal?

379
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,800
We can also ride bicycles just like them.

380
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
We can ride everyday.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
-Really?
- Yes.

382
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,700
I cannot wait.

383
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm so happy!

384
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
-Are you happy?
- Yes.

385
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,000
Do you want to go to university quickly?

386
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We are already in university.

387
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
Oh that's right.

388
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Step aside.

389
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,900
Step aside, step aside, step aside.

390
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,700
Step aside, step aside.

391
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,100
Step aside.

392
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Step aside, please step aside.

393
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Faster, kill it.

394
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,700
Faster kill it.

395
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,200
- Left.
-Fast, fast, faster!

396
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,000
Faster!

397
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Step aside!

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Quick quick!

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Here, step aside!

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Step aside!

401
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
What are you doing?

402
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,400
Don't move.

403
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,900
Stop it!

404
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,000
Nan Xi

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Excuse us.

406
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,900
No way.

407
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,400
Absolutely not.

408
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
No, no, no.

409
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
Think about what your two roommates are.

410
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,300
A paparazzi with no bottom line.

411
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,200
And another one,

412
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,800
wants to have a funeral for his oil cake that fell on the floor

413
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Is he Lin Daiyu?

414
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,100
No, no.

415
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,200
Also please think about the living environment.

416
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,800
I feel like I'll pass out if I take in two more breaths.

417
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
No, no, really no.

418
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, cannot.

419
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
A quadruple room

420
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
with only two in there.

421
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
The other two beds are empty, what does that mean?

422
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,600
It means that the other one got scared away by them, too.

423
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,300
Your major is so strong.

424
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Why are all the recruits weird?

425
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,200
Weird major.

426
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
You... you are a genius.
You're a genius, okay?

427
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
You're different.

428
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
What about this?

429
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,500
I'll move in to stay with you.

430
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,100
My goodness, how dare you.

431
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,400
You just went viral today

432
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
and you are moving into the
girls dormitory tomorrow.

433
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
You're like a monk who lives in an all girls' cave.

434
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
No, no, no, absolutely not.

435
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,400
Give me uncle Wang's phone number.

436
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,400
Your mom told me

437
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
if there are any problems,

438
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
just find uncle Wang.

439
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Hello, uncle Wang?

440
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,800
Hi.

441
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
- Good morning uncle Wang.
- Good morning.

442
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,700
Let me take you guys for house viewing.

443
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,100
Okay.

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Shu, you can never imagine

445
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,800
That Papparazzi and Oil Cake shares the same room as Nan Xi.

446
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,000
I won't stand and watch Nan Xi jump into this fire pit.

447
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We're out looking for houses now.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,800
What?

449
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Cohabitation?

450
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,800
Cheng ErLuo!

451
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
- Who asked you to eavesdrop?
-Is it not Cohabitation?

452
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
We're not cohabiting!

453
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,700
I'll get back at you for this.

454
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,200
Well, regarding the house

455
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Sister Ren has already informed me.

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,900
Don't worry.

457
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

458
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,200
Uncle Wang has some houses.

459
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
The main issue is the distance, right?

460
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I think it's within 2 kilometers.

461
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,000
- It can't be too far from school.
-Yes, yes.

462
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
How big do you want the house to be?

463
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,600
Is it a two bedroom?

464
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,700
Or, the two of you in a bedroom?

465
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,200
Two bedroom.

466
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Is Xia Rui moving in?

467
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Because one room can be a bedroom.

468
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,500
The other can be a studio.

469
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
So, at least two bedrooms.

470
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
So it's a studio.

471
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,600
So, this two bedrooms house

472
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,400
do you want luxurious or exquisite design?

473
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
No, uncle Wang.

474
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Nan Xi stays by himself.

475
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I stay in school.

476
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,700
I stay by myself?

477
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,800
You're not staying?
- No I'm not.

478
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
That's true.

479
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,900
For a girl to stay off campus it's not too safe, right?

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
I don't want to stay by myself.

481
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,800
There's a full set of Mahogany furniture inside this house.

482
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Walk-in closet, an open kitchen

483
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
overlooking the city night view,
close view of community garden.

484
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Most importantly, the landlord is abroad.

485
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
This house is fully authorised to me.

486
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
And it's cheap.

487
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,600
Doesn't need 100,000 or 80,000.

488
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
13,000 monthly.

489
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,700
All expenses including utility bills,

490
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,400
management fees and gas bill, everything is included.

491
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,200
The lowest price in the whole community.

492
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,900
3 months rent in advance with 1 month deposit, 49,998.

493
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,200
Just come with a bag.

494
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
This is your house tonight, come.

495
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,500
Wait a minute.

496
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,800
Fift... fitfty thousand?

497
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,100
Yes.

498
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Is it expensive?

499
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
That's okay.

500
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,900
Tell me a figure so I have an idea.

501
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,900
30,000? That's easy.

502
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,500
Three... thousand.

503
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,800
What?

504
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,200
Thre... Three thousand?

505
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,700
Is there a problem with 30,000 or 3000?

506
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,200
No it's not. Come here.

507
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
This is the only bungalow area
left in the central city area.

508
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,500
As the saying goes

509
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,200
keep your feet on the ground and
be at ease by living in a bungalow.

510
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Three by two square meters.

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,600
There's no other
in all of Binhai.

512
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,800
Only 7 minutes walk away
from Binhai University.

513
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,700
No road crossing,
no traffic light.

514
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,800
Surrounded mainly by elderly people.

515
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,500
All that is needed are peace, safety and security.

516
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Rent is 3500 monthly.

517
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,400
Slightly over budget but definitely great value for money.

518
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,900
It is a bit old but

519
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,200
the interior design should be fine.

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,400
This...This government planning should be supported.

521
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Don't worry.

522
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,900
Let's have a look at the next one.

523
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Three elements of renting

524
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
cheap, stable and strategic location.

525
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
The next one has all of those.

526
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
The only minor shortcoming

527
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,400
[SHARED KITCHEN AND BATHROOM]

528
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
It's just right above here

529
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,300
Eighth floor

530
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,100
This is the breath of life.

531
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,900
I have to say this is what your generation lacks.

532
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,800
This small community

533
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,500
breaks the unfamiliarity between neighbors.

534
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,600
And allow us to experience deeply the
warmth of humanity.

535
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
How is it?

536
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Not bad, right?

537
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
Uncle Wang.

538
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,100
Don't go.

539
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,200
Actually, a new era, new housing

540
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
requires new pursuit.

541
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Previously, I was too stubbornly conservative.

542
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,400
Along the way, I got inspired.

543
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,000
I think the next one should suit you.

544
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
But Uncle Wang

545
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,600
this looks like an industrial area.

546
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
That's right.

547
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,200
This is an industrial area.

548
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Come on.

549
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Let's take a look first.

550
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Maybe there's unexpected reward.

551
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,700
Okay then.

552
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,300
If it doesn't work, go to a hotel tonight.

553
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,000
Come on.

554
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,200
This is the last one after viewing so many houses.

555
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,600
This used to be a design company.

556
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,500
The boss is well-to-do now.

557
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,800
The house has just been vacant recently.

558
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,400
This house is pretty well structured.

559
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Double story.

560
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,400
Upstairs could be made a bedroom.

561
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
Bottom level could be leisure area.

562
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Nan Xi is involved in architecture.

563
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You should like this house.

564
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,800
Nan Xi.

565
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,600
This can be your studio.

566
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,700
-Yes.
- Right?

567
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,300
Here we can put your coffee machine.

568
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

569
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,700
- You?
- Yes.

570
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,200
It's really suitable for young people.

571
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
How is it?
Are you satisfied?

572
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,600
- Are you satisfied?
- Yes.

573
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
We'll confirmed if you're satisfied.

574
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,300
I'll take it.

575
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,500
Here.

576
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Nan Xi please sign here.

577
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll handle the rest.

578
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,100
Who...
Who is calling at this time?

579
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
What is it Chubby Cheng?

580
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,000
Xia Rui, why are you so mad?

581
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
What 's the matter? Spill it.

582
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Do you want supper?

583
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,800
Celebrate the official start of our university life.

584
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Shu and I discovered a skewers shop.

585
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
The rating is five stars.

586
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Send me the address.

587
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,500
Chubby Cheng and Shu want to eat skewers.

588
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,200
Do you want to go?

589
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,200
Let's go.

590
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,600
It's already past six o'clock.

591
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm hungry.

592
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,200
Okay, okay, let's go, let's go.

593
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,100
Let's go and eat.

594
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Come on.

595
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,200
What are you doing? Let's go.

596
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,400
Oh no!

597
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,800
No, Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

598
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,200
You eat skewers this way?

599
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,000
There's no soul to it.

600
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
Only you have a soul.

601
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
How much is a pound of soul?

602
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,900
It's definitely not as expensive as lamb skewers.

603
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,100
We're already in university

604
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,400
Why is the way you mess with me still so old fashioned?

605
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Aren't we worried that you're not used to leaving ChengHua?

606
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,000
Im just helping you, alright?

607
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,300
Our Nan Xi can eat however he wants.

608
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,700
Just ignore him.

609
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,200
Nan Xi!

610
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
Wait, no.

611
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,100
The naggy fat and thin duo from today

612
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,000
are really from your dorm?

613
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,800
Why would I lie to you?

614
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,300
It's really easy to meet your enemies.

615
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,600
Absolutely no way!

616
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,500
Our Nan Xi cannot live with those people.

617
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,000
How did the house viewing go?

618
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,200
It's done.

619
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,700
So fast?

620
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,100
The villa area on the side?

621
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,400
An exquisitely designed big house?

622
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,500
Our Nan Xi doesn't like big houses.

623
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,400
He wants an empty house and remodel it himself.

624
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm really curious.

625
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,600
What kind of house caught Nan Xi's attention?

626
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,400
The house that can catch Nan Xi's attention

627
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,300
must be very unique and one of a kind.

628
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,600
It has to be the only one of its kind in the world.

629
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,900
Nan Xi, I have a small unreasonable request

630
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,033
- In your big house, can we--
- No

631
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:04,126
Can you let me finish it first?

632
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:07,576
Leave me with a small tiny little corner, will you?

633
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,067
About this you have to ask Xia Rui.

634
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,767
What do you want?

635
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:15,753
As far as I know in Binhai University

636
00:31:15,753 --> 00:31:19,067
I am definitely a dark horse in the school popularity list.

637
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,358
I need to have a hiding spot

638
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:23,466
just in case those young admirers come after me

639
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,323
I need to have a spot so I can run to and hide, right?

640
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,578
I can even keep you company.

641
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,683
The admirers...

642
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:31,132
The...

643
00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:33,627
Both of you

644
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:35,527
Okay, okay, okay.

645
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,786
We'll look at your perfomance and decide then, okay?

646
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:39,670
I have a few more words.

647
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,001
Although we're already in university we must not disband our Cheng Yi Nan Xia group

648
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:47,798
And now the time has come for the two of you to contribute to the group.

649
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:50,123
I hereby announce from tomorrow

650
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:52,919
for the sake of our Nan Xi's
next four years of living environment

651
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,927
and for the sake of our interesting university life ahead

652
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:58,007
both of you have to start helping, okay?

653
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,382
The event is officially launched.

654
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:01,350
Cheers.

655
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:06,809
Nan Xi. I'm already in class.

656
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:07,838
Are you here yet?

657
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,792
Let me tell you. As compared with your school

658
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:13,792
Our junior school building is really too plain.

659
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,903
Woodie have you seen your classmates yet?

660
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:17,773
How do you feel? Are they friendly?

661
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:21,534
The Paparazzi and Oil Cake duo just keep a distance if you don't like them.

662
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:23,825
I've seen my schedule,

663
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:25,470
I finish earlier, I'll pick you up

664
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,409
I've also told YiShu and Chubby Cheng

665
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,185
See you there at noon.

666
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:36,756
Nan Xi, it's the first day of university. Try your best!

667
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:42,153
Try your best!

668
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,802
Okay

669
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,421
Just a two word reply?

670
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:58,836
My note is so long and full of enthusiasm.

671
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:00,720
That's all he has to say?

672
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,028
This person is cold.

673
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,613
Xia Rui, the teacher is here, get in quick.

674
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:09,416
Okay, okay.

675
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,196
I'll let you off this time.

676
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:15,562
Nan Xi, quick! I've saved you a spot.

677
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,451
This spot is good.

678
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:21,710
What should we do？

679
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,566
Do you think Nan Xi is holding a grudge?

680
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,768
I just think

681
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:28,962
You were too enthusiatic just now.

682
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:31,120
He's probably not used to it.

683
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:35,092
I am Gu Siming

684
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:37,154
For the next four years

685
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:39,713
I am your main lecturer

686
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:42,211
who is in charge of everything.

687
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,599
Okay, okay, okay.

688
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,510
There's still one classmate who
did not meet everyone.

689
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:59,161
Up next, I will officially introduce him to everyone.

690
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:04,244
Could the person Professor Gu said be the mysterious fourth person in our dorm?

691
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,666
Come.

692
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,002
Introduce yourself to everyone.

693
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:12,402
Okay.

694
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:15,600
Gao Ting.

695
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,300
Thank you.

696
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:21,264
Find a place to sit down.

697
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:23,775
I think this Gao Ting

698
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:26,115
doesn't seem good to get along with.

699
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:31,199
I really wonder what kind of weird dorm mates we have.

700
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,286
One is first place, one is second place.

701
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:36,277
How can we deal with two icy cold people in one room?

702
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:37,515
What are you talking about?

703
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:39,974
I've investigated Gao Ting.

704
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:42,242
He is a local from Binhai.

705
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:44,332
His parents both work in our school.

706
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,655
He won't live in.

707
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:47,555
I am Gao Ting.

708
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:51,200
Nan Xi.
