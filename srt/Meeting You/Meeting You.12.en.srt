[Meeting You]

2
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,060
Play fireworks in the school?

3
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,590
What did you think you were doing?

4
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Do you want to be a king?

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,360
I am also a victim

6
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,880
I was fooled

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,270
-He told me it was okay...
-Is that the point?

8
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,960
Is there a difference at all?

9
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,610
They said that the impact will be a little smaller

10
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,290
A little smaller?

11
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,070
Do you know what a big trouble you've gotten yourself in this time?

12
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,040
Don't think you can enter the Binhai University

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,000
with such low scores and as a member of basketball team is a proud.
-No No No

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,010
I'm telling you, you still need mine and the principal's signatures on the documents

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,120
If any punishment is on the official record

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,790
All your qualifications for special recruitment will be canceled

17
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,410
Let alone Binhai University, with your scores,

18
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,060
you'll be unable to enter any good university in this city

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,160
Do you understand?

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,330
In two days, hand me a 10,000 words of self-criticism text

21
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,070
10,000 words? It'll take forever to finish

22
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,530
Oh, yes. It's a bit too much

23
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,190
I didn't think it thoroughly

24
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,580
How about this? 20,000 words

25
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,370
- Submit today before school ends
- No Mr. Hu

26
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,520
It's not much. It's not much

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Why do you increase the number of words?

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,250
Are you playing idioms with me now?

29
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,800
I can play in English, too

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,370
It's "Sit floor, price up"

31
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,810
Go away! Nonsense

32
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,560
Do you think that as your English teacher,

33
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,080
I should be proud of what you've just said?

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,010
It's my honor to be your pride

35
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,190
Get out, get out right now!

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,370
Don't come back until you finish writing

37
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,540
- Hello, teacher
- Hello

38
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,770
- Mr. Hu
- Yes? Miss Li

39
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,750
Is your class preparing any programs for the New Year's party?

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,880
Go to the student office and report

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,260
I also want to talk to the school leaders

42
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,870
This year's Spring Festival is early, and it's final soon

43
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,070
The third graders are under much pressure

44
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,290
And many students in our class are going to take the art test soon, too

45
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,470
So, this time our class may miss the party

46
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,740
- Okay I see
- Thank you, Miss Li

47
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,220
[Episode 12]
[I can't forget the first time I saw you]

48
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,860
I draw it really well this time

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,560
There are no mistakes for sure

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,800
You sure did a good job

51
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,980
And it's very delicate

52
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,420
You promised...

53
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,570
But, the answer is wrong

54
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,030
Impossible!

55
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,920
Rui, Rui

56
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,060
Breaking news! This year's New Year's party is on the way!

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,030
So what? What's this big news?

58
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,830
No! I heard Mr. Hu said that

59
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,410
our class is too busy studying and this year we won't participate

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,720
Then don't participate

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,660
It's not right. Why didn't Mr. Hu ask us and made the decision by himself again?

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,560
Less than half a year away from the college entrance examinations

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,460
We have to concentrate on study. Leave the party to grade one and two

64
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,190
I won't let that happen

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,410
This New Year's Party is the last group activity of our class nine of grade three

66
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,390
Don't you want to leave with a good memory?

67
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,510
Cheng Erluo, since you're so active, how about you holding an event?

68
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,240
We'll support you then

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,850
Yes

70
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,730
Of course! What's so difficult? Right, Rui?

71
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,630
Show our determination to them

72
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,430
Cheng Erluo, let's not mention the New Year's party

73
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,830
Was it the only thing you heard when you were being scolded by Mr. Hu?

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
I almost forgot about it if you didn't mention it, Dear Dear Shu

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,750
Mr. Hu asked me to write a self-criticism text, 10,000 words

76
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,750
- You re the only one who can help me with this
- I refuse

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,480
Dear Shu, I beg you, Dear Shu

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,500
Look at you. It's all because of you, Dear Shu's writing a self-criticism text for you again

79
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,820
If it weren't for him trying to get into Binhai University, I wouldn't have helped him

80
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,090
Right. My Dear Shu treats me best among all of you

81
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,460
Rui, as for Binhai University, how are your preparations for the broadcast host major?

82
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,060
Will you play something dedicated just for us?

83
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,980
[A Chinese poem]
Um"Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again"?

84
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,540
You just try ordering a program?

85
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,240
I advise you to stop this dangerous thinking

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,570
Not dangerous, let's listen

87
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,620
I don't think you can play with Cheng Erluo anymore

88
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,700
Look at you

89
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,260
Let's say it clearly. Did I teach him bad things? He is the teacher now

90
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,890
He's so good that l can't catch up to him

91
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,990
See what you both said

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,810
Why don't you become sworn brothers on the spot?

93
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,220
I think it works. Nan Xi, what do you think?

94
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,260
I don't think so

95
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,490
Okay. Don't perform cross-talk now

96
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,660
Rui, you haven't shown us your progress

97
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,470
as you have been practicing for so long

98
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,610
How about having us judge your presentation right now?

99
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,720
Try it

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,860
Shall I?

101
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,120
I'll try

102
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,270
"Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again"

103
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,470
by Xu Zhimo

104
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,860
Very quietly I take my leave,

105
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,360
as quietly as I came here

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,020
Quietly I wave good-bye to the rosy clouds in the western sky

107
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,570
I cast my sleeves a little, not taking even a strand of cloud away

108
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,390
It's a shame. I should prepare more

109
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,550
Rui, you are usually carefree

110
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,950
Why are you nervous now?

111
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,220
You're usually careless. Why be nervous on an important task?

112
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,570
I don't know. It's just...

113
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,010
It's not right. It's not big of a deal. Why am I still nervous?

114
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,680
Why am I still nervous?

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,550
Maybe it's the lack of stage experience

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,160
Is there any difference between reciting during the exam and

117
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,340
- reading out the self-criticism text?
- Of course there is

118
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,090
Whether you usually want to read or call on everyone to do something,

119
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,740
it's actually your inner voice

120
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,740
No wonder

121
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,680
I feel like that I am not myself when I perform

122
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,040
I see. The "Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again" just now

123
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,150
It felt like someone was holding a gun to your face to make you read

124
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,500
Be quiet

125
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,120
In fact, on the stage, there are some moments when you have to role play

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,600
And you may want a response from your audience

127
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,630
Oh, no wonder

128
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,660
I get nervous just thinking about those lines

129
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,390
I'm scared when I'm nervous. That explains a lot

130
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,750
Our Dear Shu grew up on stage since childhood

131
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,490
Experts know everything

132
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,820
Actually it doesn't matter. There are still two months till the art exam

133
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,120
We still have a chance

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,770
Oh my god

135
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,260
New Year's party is a good opportunity

136
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,320
You can try it

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,680
But the host of the New Year's party

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
is already taken by Yang Yufei

139
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,190
Nan Xi means that we can make a show by ourselves

140
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,530
No

141
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,860
It will all be our friends. That's embarrassing

142
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,960
Without talent show, what can we perform?

143
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,680
- It's ok. I'm with you
-With me?

144
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,830
Right, and us. Let's go together

145
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,220
- Yeah. Together
- Yes!

146
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,650
What can we perform?

147
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,140
Singing, dancing, poetry recitation? So boring

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,690
What to perform?

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,920
I have an idea if you really want to participate

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,840
Cheng, Yi, Nan, Xia! We're a group now!

151
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,680
What a bad name!

152
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,400
- Shameful
- Go and eat something

153
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,110
[I live me as me]

154
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:54,110
[The role of destiny, I have to grasp myself]

155
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,220
Wow! Bravo! You sing so well!

156
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,830
There is a problem, though

157
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,390
How we come to stage like this?

158
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,960
I cannot let you sing unaccompanied or solo on stage

159
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,710
How about we dance with you in the back?

160
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,140
Maybe we can vocal harmony like Accapella?

161
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,130
Do you think we are capable?

162
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,880
We only can knock the iron triangle behind you

163
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,840
- Wow! What's this?
- Wow!

164
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,160
Wow! You made it?

165
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,840
Wow! It's so pretty!

166
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,160
Wow! What's this? How to use it?

167
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,960
Listen to it. I produced this

168
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,030
- This is Good!
- Yes

169
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,060
I think we should practice this well

170
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,600
We sure win with our high level of creativity

171
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,190
And it is not difficult to play

172
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,170
We can practice well in a short time

173
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,770
Didn't Mr. Hu say that let's see what you can make?

174
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,450
Since he has expectations for us,

175
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,490
- we can't let him down
- Right

176
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,250
What are you doing? Why are you hitting the table as the first thing in the morning?

177
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,660
You are capable now, aren't you?

178
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,590
It's the notice of New Year's Party

179
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,920
Seven o'clock next Monday night. At school auditorium

180
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,780
Next Monday? The day of New Years Eve?

181
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,290
Right. That day

182
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,860
How about we go to the countdown after the performance that day?

183
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,140
- That day happens to be...
- Xia Rui

184
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,730
The next morning I will go to the suburbs with my parents

185
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,000
so I might have to go back early

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,800
I have to go to my grandma's house that night

187
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Okay then. I thought you...

188
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,000
Forget it

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,420
My grandparents are going to a wedding party that day

190
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,820
I have to stay home alone

191
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,000
All right. We will come over to accompany you after we go back, ok?

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,450
But what we have to consider now

193
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,240
is that there is only one week

194
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,140
left before the show

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,990
[I live me as me]

196
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,950
Rui, Rui

197
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,960
How about you stop first and let's do it again?

198
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,030
No, Rui

199
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,910
Although comedy shows are also very characteristic

200
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,710
we're not doing that...

201
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,760
Ok. It sounds nice

202
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,530
I have a broadcasting class later, I have to...

203
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,740
- Go now. -Hurry up, hurry up
- OK

204
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,130
Xia Rui

205
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,540
Don't worry about this, take your time

206
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,430
OK, I'll leave it to you

207
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,420
Bye. Come on!

208
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
Miss

209
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,670
[Live me as me]

210
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,380
[I live me]

211
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,480
[I live me]

212
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,980
[I live me]

213
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,950
Why don't you go back to rest?

214
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,860
Leave now. Hurry up

215
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,760
This evening is the school's annual New Year's Party

216
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,250
This year, we have hard study task

217
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,650
so there is no show in our class

218
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,250
But I still hope that everyone will go and take a look

219
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,230
Relax for a moment. Tomorrow is New Year's holiday

220
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,490
Here, I wish you all a happy new year

221
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,410
Happy New Year!

222
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,740
Class is over

223
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,030
Goodbye teacher

224
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,250
Cheng Erluo, where is our program listed now?

225
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,230
Are you a number of our class? Only you don't know that

226
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,430
Nine! Nine!

227
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,010
Mr. Hu may don't know about it

228
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,650
Don't let him know about this!

229
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,480
Rui does such a big thing without telling him

230
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,170
Just for the scene that he is dumbfounded on the spot

231
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,610
Guys

232
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,570
If you have finished eating, you can go straight to occupy a seat

233
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,730
This is our last New Year's party this semester

234
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,920
So we must astonish Mr. Hu

235
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,700
astonish Chenghua!

236
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,610
Oh, no

237
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,620
I seem to forget the wooden hammer I'll use for the show

238
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,950
Look carefully again

239
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,800
We'll performing soon

240
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,310
I must've forgotten it at home

241
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,030
It's okay, my house is close. I'll go home and get it

242
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,360
- I'll go with you
- No, I'll go back by myself

243
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,150
Where did Rui go?

244
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,650
Why hasn't she come back?

245
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,650
Xia Rui still doesn't answer the phone

246
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,970
What should we do?

247
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,380
I'll find her

248
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,170
Let's go together

249
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,730
Where are you going?

250
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,370
Our performance is coming soon

251
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,890
I... we can't act

252
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,690
Don't worry, Nan Xi's there, Xia Rui will be fine

253
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,880
Cheng, Yi, Nan, Xia

254
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,620
It has Xia Rui's hard work in it

255
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,020
We have to finish the show well

256
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,880
Don't let Xia Rui have regrets, please?

257
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,860
Xia Rui, answer the phone

258
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,620
Xia Rui

259
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,840
Xia Rui?

260
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,450
Xia Rui, I'm coming in

261
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,360
Xia Rui

262
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,200
Xia Rui

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,600
What time is it now?

264
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,740
It's night now

265
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh my God

266
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,010
Our show

267
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,330
You lie down first

268
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,430
Don't worry

269
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,830
We have Zhao Yishu

270
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm so sleepy

271
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,300
When I came back, I feel so sleepy

272
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,190
I just lay down for a while

273
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,000
But I fell asleep

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,250
You have a fever

275
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,470
Let's go to the hospital

276
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,180
Don't go to the hospital

277
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,570
I don't like hospitals

278
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,230
Don't go to the hospital

279
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,500
Okay, no hospital

280
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Where is the cold medicine?

281
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,960
I don't know

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,670
Xia Rui, eat something

283
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,060
Let me

284
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,380
Eat something first

285
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,980
Then take the medicine

286
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,960
Medicine?

287
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
Where did the medicine come from?

288
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,640
I bought it

289
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,830
- You bought it?
- Yes

290
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,240
Did you go to the pharmacy by yourself?

291
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,630
Yes

292
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,460
Is the pharmacy crowded?

293
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,920
Not much

294
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,970
I don't want to eat

295
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,180
Two more sips

296
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,370
Just two

297
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,780
OK

298
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,380
Sis, happy birthday to you!

299
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,100
Wait

300
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,550
You are Nan Xi?

301
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,430
Yes. It's me

302
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,450
Why are you at Grandpa Xia's house?

303
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,150
I came to visit Xia Rui

304
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,250
Are you in my sister's room?

305
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,860
Where is she?

306
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,050
She's sleeping

307
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,310
Whoops

308
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,910
You two

309
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,230
Why?

310
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,670
I gotta hang up. I have to digest it

311
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,130
- OK
- Tell my sister

312
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,690
that I risked my life to stay up late today to wish her happy birthday

313
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,820
And

314
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,580
I won't tell my mother. Think about how to repay me

315
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,100
Oh

316
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,160
Nan Xi

317
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,360
You have to be nice to my sister, understand?

318
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,010
Got it

319
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,060
Ah, so sudden

320
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,940
Be persistent, don't give up

321
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,300
Wow, Dear Shu, it was so amazing!

322
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,400
Did you hear how they cheered for me?

323
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,000
Did you see how they cheered for me?

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm so handsome

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,200
Okay. You are the most handsome, and you sing the best

326
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Our Dear Shu sings equally well

327
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,500
Is Rui OK?

328
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,300
She has a fever

329
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,600
Nan Xi is with her

330
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,800
OK

331
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,800
Don't move

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Your milk tea is ready

333
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,200
Thank you

334
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,700
You're welcome

335
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,000
It's quiet fun

336
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Of course

337
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Sorry. I am so sorry

338
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,200
Girl, my clothes got dirty

339
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
Should you wash for me?

340
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,100
You did it on purpose

341
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,200
Who are you?

342
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
Guys, play with him

343
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
Wait, you don't

344
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Officer!

345
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Go and catch them!

346
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,800
- Stop
- Don't run

347
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Don't run

348
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,600
Stop

349
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,200
Don't run

350
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,400
-Stop
- Don't run

351
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Don't run. Stop

352
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,800
Stop

353
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,600
You two go over there and block them

354
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,900
OK

355
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,400
Don't run

356
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Stop

357
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't run

358
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Run?

359
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
- You run
- Run again

360
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,900
What are you doing?

361
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Stop now!

362
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,600
You two, come here!

363
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Don't move

364
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,300
Don't be afraid, come here

365
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,100
Go now. Go!

366
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,400
Who are you?

367
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm the director of the third grade at Chenghua High School

368
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Don't bully my students!

369
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,500
Teacher of Chenghua High School

370
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,800
cares about the things outside of school?

371
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
You really want it the hard way?

372
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll call the police now

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't leave!

374
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,200
Shall we withdraw, brother?

375
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,170
Are you OK, Dear Shu?

376
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,000
It's okay

377
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,700
Get some rest

378
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,600
Call police first

379
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,300
Yes. Call the police

380
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,300
Hello?

381
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,700
There's a fight near the milk tea shop

382
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,100
Yes, four people

383
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,700
Please come here

384
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,600
OK. Thanks

385
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
It's okay now

386
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,600
Dear Shu

387
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Am I confused?

388
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,800
That's Mr. Hu, right?

389
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Yes

390
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,000
Game over

391
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
I secretly set fireworks at school first,

392
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
then privately participated in the New Year's Party

393
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
and was caught in the fight this time

394
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,100
Do you think I will be expelled?

395
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,300
How is that possible?

396
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
You won't

397
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,200
Although Mr. Hu always talks about the expulsion

398
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
he never really expelled anyone

399
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
There are very few punishments

400
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
That's because they haven't done it yet

401
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,300
It will be fine

402
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,200
It's alright

403
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Fine

404
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,900
I believe you

405
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll take you home, Dear Shu

406
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
How about we rest awhile?

407
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,800
My legs' are still shaking

408
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,100
Get on

409
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'll be fine if I just stand for a while

410
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
- No need to do this
- Why are you shy now?

411
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
We did this when we were kids

412
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,100
Get on

413
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Who is shy?

414
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,100
Dear Shu

415
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,500
You can eat more

416
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,400
You're too light

417
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,200
I've eaten a lot

418
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,900
You call that a lot?

419
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,000
You have to eat more like Rui

420
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,200
That's called a lot

421
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,000
Do you dare to say this in front of Rui?

422
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
We still don't know if Rui is fine

423
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,200
Otherwise, let's go to grandma's house first

424
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,400
There is no need. Nan Xi is there

425
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Nan Xi

426
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm kinda worried

427
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Do you think he can take good care of Rui?

428
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Let him take the opportunity and learn

429
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,200
There's a first for everyone

430
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
But he...

431
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Dear Shu, you are smart

432
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,900
Why is your brain dull today?

433
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,900
-Am I dull?
- Yes

434
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,000
The revolutionary friendship between Nan Xi and Rui

435
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,600
does not allow third parties to participate. Don't you know that?

436
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,800
It seems that you are not dull in other people's affairs

437
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,200
I mean... Yes, I am dull

438
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Then, Dear Shu

439
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
-Do you want some speed?
- Okay

440
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,100
Then you should hold on tight

441
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,400
Cheng Erluo, let me go

442
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,400
Xia Rui

443
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,900
Xia Rui

444
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,100
Time to take medicine

445
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,300
Good

446
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,800
How can I just fall asleep?

447
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Where is Nan Xi?

448
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,100
Xia Rui, are you awake?

449
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,200
Yes

450
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
May I come in?

451
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
Yes

452
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,600
How are you?

453
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,500
Feel better now?

454
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes, much better

455
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,700
This is for you

456
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,200
What is this?

457
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,300
Open it and take a look

458
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,600
Wow!

459
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,400
Wow!

460
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,200
I thought you all forgot my birthday

461
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
How could we forget?

462
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,100
Xia Rui

463
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Happy eighteenth birthday

464
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,020
Rui, we're back

465
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,000
Come to eat now

466
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,200
Sweat after eating

467
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,000
- It smells good
-Don't get sick next year

468
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay

469
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Come over

470
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,600
Come on

471
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
Why are you sitting here?

472
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
He is a guest

473
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Stand up and sit there

474
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,200
Sit

475
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,900
Have a sit

476
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,100
Wife, bring two bottles of drinks

477
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
You have diabetes, you can't drink

478
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,800
I am happy to have a guest today

479
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Go and bring me one

480
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,190
The guest hasn't started yet

481
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,600
but you eat first?

482
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I strip it for him

483
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,700
We only left for two days, yet you are sick

484
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,000
Hon

485
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
what was I talking about?

486
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
I knew she couldn't leave us

487
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
I am fine now

488
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Nan Xi

489
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,800
I really want to thank you for coming for her

490
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
If you hadn't took care of her last night

491
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,500
She would be in a big trouble

492
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Grandfather, you're welcome

493
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,000
It's what I should do

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Nan Xi

495
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,800
Your parents must be worried for you didn't go back home last night

496
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,200
My dad is abroad

497
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,400
My mom is on a business trip

498
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
There will be someone at home tomorrow

499
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,600
How can your parents let a teenager stay at home alone?

500
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,500
If there is no one at home

501
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,400
Come and stay here

502
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
I stayed home alone yesterday

503
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,300
You didn't even call me at night

504
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,600
It should be the same for him

505
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,700
Nan Xi

506
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,200
You continue to stay in our house today

507
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
And go to school with her the day after tomorrow

508
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
There is no empty room, is there?

509
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
We have one

510
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
OK. That's it

511
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,200
OK. Then I will stay here. Thanks

512
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
You're welcome

513
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Let's eat

514
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,400
Nan Xi, try this

515
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,600
Dear Shu

516
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,100
What did you do with your parents?

517
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,400
Same old three things

518
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,800
Party, chatting and farmhouse

519
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,200
I thought there would be any new fun this year

520
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,700
The greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment

521
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,200
It's not as good as the four of us celebrating the new year together

522
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,000
Is Rui okay now?

523
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Why don't you call and ask yourself?

524
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
I forgot

525
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,800
Don't worry, Rui has recovered

526
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Nan Xi took care of her all night

527
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,000
Rui could already eat, drink, dance and jump

528
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,600
when grandparents came back home this morning

529
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
I am relieved now

530
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,000
I've been worried about too many things

531
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
You're worried?

532
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Then why don't you call Mr. Hu to care for him?

533
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
I really forgot that

534
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
I'll call him now

535
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,600
He's fine

536
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
I called him earlier

537
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,900
But he didn't answer

538
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,000
Then, let's go and find Mr. Hu

539
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,600
Do you know where he lives?

540
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,400
Me, Cheng Holmes knows every address

541
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Forget it

542
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,900
Hu is such an adult

543
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,200
Besides, he doesn't work out for nothing, does he?

544
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
He should be fine

545
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,400
Also we have already called the police

546
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,200
Forget it. I'm not thinking about it

547
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's check on him when we go to school

548
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,400
Yes. We need to thank Hu in person

549
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Dear Shu

550
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,400
What do you say Hu is doing at home now?

551
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
What is he doing?

552
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,900
Is he watching TV while eating sunflower seeds

553
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,000
and picking smelly feet?

554
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,400
You are disgusting, Cheng Erluo

555
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,600
Dear Shu, I was kidding

556
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,800
-My old man
- Yes?

557
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,400
Wash the dishes

558
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,100
Don't be hasty to wash dishes

559
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,000
May I take a rest first?

560
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm stuffed

561
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
You like doing nothing after you're full

562
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,000
Or let me do this?

563
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
Then I gotta watch TV first

564
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Old man, what do you mean?

565
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
You...

566
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,800
You know nothing

567
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Young people like to wash dishes nowadays

568
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
Am I right?

569
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
How can you ask the kids to do things?

570
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,400
Come here

571
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,200
They like doing this

572
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,400
But actually they love each other very much

573
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
I know

574
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,200
In fact, they're having us to wash the dishes

575
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,800
I also know it

576
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
Are you stupid? Why don't you refuse?

577
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,500
I like washing dishes

578
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,300
OK

579
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,000
Are you sure about it?

580
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,200
I like washing dishes

581
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
OK, then you do it

582
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,400
You put the bowl down first

583
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,800
Take that

584
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Yes, pump this

585
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Let me do it, master

586
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
- This
- I'll give you gloves

587
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Master, you're really a master

588
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,000
I know at a glance that you haven't washed dishes at home

589
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Take a rest

590
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,100
I'll do this

591
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
It's fine

592
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
I can wash dishes

593
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,400
for another year

594
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Nan Xi

595
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Come here, let me tell you something

596
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
- No
-Come here

597
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
No

598
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,000
What did I say?

599
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,700
Young people like washing dishes

600
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Go. We should leave now
