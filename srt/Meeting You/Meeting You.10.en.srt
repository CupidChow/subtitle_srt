Yes

Yes

Not just good friends

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,580
We two are

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,700
still good brothers for life

Can you not have pause next time you speak?

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
No way, Dear Shu Can you stop doing it next time?

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
Can you stop doing it next time?

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
Do you still want a next time?

17

No, no, no, no, no

18
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,480
You've become as violent as Rui since you spend a lot time with her?

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,360
If you know Rui, believe it or not, she is not as gentle as me

20
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
I almost forgot to tell you something

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,840
Rui asked me to tell you yesterday

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,240
Don't joke about Nan Xi and her next time, do you understand?

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,540
Otherwise, she won't be as gentle as me

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
Where is it? This is too inhumane!

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
The school hasn't even started yet and they just post everyone's results

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,440
Yeah we can't even live anymore

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,920
The third year of high school is really hell

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,880
Excuse me

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,080
Dear Shu, you did a good job too

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
What about Xia Rui?

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,860
Don't worry, I'm watching it from the front to the back

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm sorry, let me see!

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,660
- Why are you pushing?
- Sorry

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,100
Do you find it?

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,380
Xia Rui, hurry up

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,200
How did you do?

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,460
How did you to?

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,500
Why did I fall back thirty places?

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,160
Mr. Hu said that this year's questions were really difficult

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,120
Was it hard?

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
Yes, it was really hard

44
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,640
Checking the list?

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,900
Senior, you have finished the college entrance exam and came back just to see us?

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,600
I flunked and I have to repeat one year

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,720
This year's college entrance examination is indeed competitive

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,220
The questions are simple, otherwise I can get into a

You are amazing, I didn't know you can make coffee

It's not that hard

104

Fortunately, it's simple

105
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,280
If it's complicated, I can't do it

106
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,200
Why don't I see your classmates with you?

107
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,660
I don't think you are having a fun day today

108
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,160
What's the matter? I can tell you what's wrong

109
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,720
You can tell me what's wrong?

110
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,360
I really don't like how you just said it

111
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,500
Why do you think I can't? I'm one year older than you anyway

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,440
Besides, I grow up with experience

113
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,760
How dare you say that you're full with experience?

114
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,680
I wasn't joking with you

115
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,850
My grades are not good, but in terms of life discussion

116
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,640
I am definitely better than your classmates

117
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,000
So confident Okay, then I will tell you

118

What do you plan to do if you don't get accepted to college next year?

119

I can only leave it to my fate

120
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Let's ignore this for one or two years

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,430
Wouldn't you be jealous if

122
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,600
all of your friends were admitted to college?

123
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,300
There is a saying

124
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,720
"One day, we will meet in a high place"

125
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,420
I have good mentality since I went through a lot

126
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,480
We can't let ourselves get to us We have to stand up every time we fall

127
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,660
We have to stand up every time we fall

128
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,640
I want to ask you

129
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,320
Do you really have nothing to worry about?

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,900
It's not so pleasant, because my friends are admitted

131
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,160
to college and no one plays games with me anymore

132
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,190
But luckily you are here

133
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,380
How about go for a round?

134
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,120
No, I want to study

135
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,680
You can't make a mind without thinking, right?

136
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,800
Carpe diem!

137
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,980
Let's play a round Whoever loses treats a drink?

138
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,080
Let's go Just one round

139
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,060
I think you are a loser today

140

Let's go

141
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,360
Incredible!

142
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
This is too great!

143
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,880
Big move up

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,560
Why do I always lose?

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,040
I can beat you in minutes

148
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,080
Are you feeling better now?

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,740
Test scores are not important

150
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,860
There is nothing that can't be solved in a round of this

151
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,560
If you are in a bad mood, you can come to me and I will take you to fly

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,320
Students in the third year of high school are under great academic pressure

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,760
How can you live the whole senior year in a bad mood?

154
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,240
It makes sense

155
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,910
How can I help Xia Rui?

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
Have you decided which university? The form will have to be turned in soon

157
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
Where is Xia Rui? Why is she not here yet?

158
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
If we can't be in the same school, I want to at least be in the same city

159
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,660
It's better to be match our schools before we turn them in

160

No

163

Well, the three of us first check, then go back to the classroom and talk to Xia Rui

164
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,460
Fine, then so be it

165

I will apply for Binhai University, trying the basketball special admission

166
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,940
The coach told me last year

167
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,340
As long as my college entrance examination scores are not too outrageous

168
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,860
The chance of admission is more than 80%

169
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,760
I also apply to Bin Hai University

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,420
Such a coincidence! Both of us are in same spirits

171
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,600
Dear Shu, I understand that you are the only one

172
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
who can't be separated from me in this world

173
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,640
Bin Hai University ranks in the top ten in the country and is close to home

174
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,900
Besides, this kind of comprehensive performance department is easier

175
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,660
My cultural course is also more dominant

176
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,880
You are so thoughtful

177
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,010
You are proficient in all kinds of stuff like piano, chess, calligraphy, and painting

178
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,540
Surely you won't have a problem

179
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,140
Nanxi, what about you?

180
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,940
Same as Xia Rui

181
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,020
A bite of dog food

182
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,740
Let me tell you two things briefly

183
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,160
Thanks to Zhao Yishu, our dream tree has been completed

184
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,220
All your dreams are on it

185
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,240
I hope you can work hard for your goal in the last year

186
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,520
The second thing is, according to the form filled out by everyone,

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,740
the school is going to hold a tripartite meeting

188
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,400
with you and your parents in the near future

189
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,440
Solve the problems of all graduates together

190
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,480
Especially the focus is to help those students

191
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,000
who have not yet determined their goals

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Okay, that's it

193
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,300
You pack up, and don't be late for the evening's self-study

194
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,340
Okay

195
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,140
- Good, the class is over
- Bye

196
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,640
I have sorted out this booklet for you

197
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,760
No. School's just begun. Take it easy

198
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,040
The previous review direction was a little off, I have summarized it for you

199
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,440
Okay. Okay. I know I did poorly at the end of last semester

200
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Xia Rui, don't worry, let's try it first

201
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,520
Don't force me, okay?

202
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,080
I didn't force you

203
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,660
It doesn't matter which university you are admitted to

204
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,680
What matters is that you don't have a pressure

205
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,220
Did you listen to me?

206
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,720
It's too early to give up

207
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,360
I still have something. I'm leaving first

208
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,420
Xia Rui!

209
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,180
Let me go

210
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,340
I won't let you go

211
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,300
Do you want to control me?

212
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,240
Yes, I do

213
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,260
Why do you care about me? Who are you to me? Let me go

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,330
Rui is really angry this time

215
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,420
What shall we do?

216
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Xia Rui, where are you going?

217
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,060
- Going home
- No more self-study?

218
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,300
No

219
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,580
Then I won't too. I'll go home with you

220
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,180
Are you skipping class for me?

221
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,780
Night self-study is not a class, right?

222
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,440
Besides, I haven't seen your grandma for a long time

223
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
I want to eat your grandma's dumplings

224
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,380
Okay, your wish must be fulfilled Let's go

225
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,940
Rui

226
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,260
Are you angry with us?

227
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,420
I'm mad at myself

228
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,200
I actually really want to go with you,

229
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,680
but it's not realistic at all

230
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,220
Nan Xi said where I go is where he'd go

231
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,360
How could I let him give up his bright future because of me?

232
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,950
So stressful!

233
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,560
I feel so stupid

234
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,520
Why are you stupid? You are smart and cunning

235
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,840
This Rui is not the Rui we like

236
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,780
What we like is the Rui who is always optimistic,

237
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,300
positive and fearless. Why are you shrinking?

238
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,500
Actually, I don't like myself like this

239
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,040
Maybe, I really don't want to think that one day I will be separated from you

240
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,900
You won't. You still have one more year to work hard

241
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,440
Besides, universities don't mean everything

242
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,200
We can always be together as long as we want

243
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,660
Dear Shu

244
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,580
Okay, come here

245
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,660
Don't be angry with us

246
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm not angry with you

247
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,640
Let's look at reading comprehension

248
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,040
The reading comprehension is a little different from the previous ones

249
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,720
Let's take a look and read it for yourself first

250
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,980
Cheng Erluo

251
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Let's keep reading

252
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,640
Who am I to Xia Rui?

253
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,320
Who am I to Xia Rui...

254
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,620
Cheng Erluo! Stand up!

255
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,720
How many times?

256
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,660
- Is the teacher's class scary? Why are you shouting?
- No

257
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,860
Do you think you have been specially recruited by sports and you are very good?

258
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,540
Read the article!

259
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,580
Where? Mr.. Hu?

260
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,160
Read whichever you know

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, Xiaoxiao, read it

262
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,500
Dance is a present, not hurt, joy and sorrow

263
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,440
Nan Xi, this question is too simple

264
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,760
Not even standing straight. Sit down

265
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,260
Continue

266
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,440
Nan Xi!

267
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,480
I tell you, tighten your nerves a bit

268
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,950
The tripartite talks will begin in a few days

269
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm worried about what to tell your parents

270
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
What happened to them?

271
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,740
Continue to read the paper

272
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,460
Rui was with you last time, now it's me

273
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,160
If you want to exercise, change your way next time

274
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,500
Say it

275
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,260
Say what?

276
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,200
The note

277
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,440
Note?

278
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,640
So you...

279
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,100
Let me tell you, a character like Rui

280
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,280
Even if you become her mother, you can't control her

281
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm telling you the truth

282
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,100
Have you ever met someone who calls her own mother Madam Shao?

283
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,300
You can't control her

284
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,540
But

285
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,100
If you want to control her,

286
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,020
you have to let her be willing

287
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,810
- So how can you make her be...
- Less nonsense

288
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,960
Just kidding

289
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,500
Wait a minute, I show you a big baby

290
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,990
This is a secret weapon I have hidden for many years

291
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,600
I don't show it to many people

292
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,360
I didn't want to chase Xia Rui

293
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Isn't chasing girls and coaxing girls an essence?

294
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,060
Same?

295
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,120
Same!

296
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,560
Dear Shu, Dear Shu

297
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,400
Do you know why Rui was angry these past few days?

298
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,040
Don't you two really not know why?

299
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,820
I don't know, please tell us

300
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,240
Have you noticed that Xia Rui and Liu Bin have come close recently?

301
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,900
I know, but what's wrong?

302
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,020
Maybe Rui thinks that she and Liu Bin are the same people

303
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,520
Impossible!

304
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,790
Because of grades

305
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,820
I understand, you mean that, because Liu Bin's repeating a year

306
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,520
So Rui thinks that only he gets her concerns about the university

307
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
Not just because of grades

308
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,780
Originally, the college entrance examination was a lot of pressure for Xia Rui

309
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,080
And last time you mentioned Bin Hai University

310
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,120
It will make her feel the gap between her and our grades

311
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,780
And she worked so hard last semester, but her grades still didn't improve much

312
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,560
She doesn't want to be left, and doesn't want to hold us back

313
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,780
So what we have to do is not to put pressure on her

314
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,780
but to let her know that we will be by her side

315
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,860
Nan Xi, Mr.. Hu asked you to go to his office

316
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,820
Nanxi, your mom is here

317
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
Hurry up and come sit here

318
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,020
I got a call from Mr. Hu when I got off the plane

319
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,620
Why don't you tell me about

320
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,120
filling out the college entrance examination application form?

321
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,620
President Ren, it's okay

322
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Let's have time to discuss now

323
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Let me show you

324
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,820
These are all the test scores since Nan Xi entered school

325
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
Nan Xi has a very good foundation

326
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
But in terms of test-taking skills,

327
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,320
he broke such a section in the middle

328
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,620
So his grades will fluctuate

329
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,020
Take a look

330
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,720
When he is good, he can take the first place

331
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,220
But when the results are unstable, it will hover around 30th

332
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,620
The college entrance examination is very stressful

333
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,820
So we should take this into consideration in advance

334
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,620
I also thought of this

335
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,220
Mr. Hu, I hope Nan Xi can enter Bin Hai University

336
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,620
Bin Hai University is an old comprehensive university

337
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,820
And the Department of Architecture is a model discipline

338
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,720
They have a quota of independent enrollment every year

339
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,920
Nan Xi likes wood art and is also interested in architecture

340
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,820
See if we can get admission in early decision

341
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,820
The Department of Architecture of Bin Hai University

342
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,420
is among the best in the country

343
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,020
I think this is the best for Nanxi

344
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,620
Nan Xi, what do you think?

345
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,820
I want to be with Xia Rui

346
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,420
Xia Rui?

347
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,820
- Mr. Hu
- Yes

348
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,420
Is it Xia Rui who he tutored one-on-one last time?

349
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,220
Yes, she's the kid

350
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,620
I can decide about the university on my own

351
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,220
- Nan Xi
- Nan Xi!

352
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,820
- Mr. Hu, let me find him first
- Okay

353
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,620
Nan Xi

354
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
OMG

355
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,420
Be careful, be careful. Don't be stunned

356
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,020
- Why are you still stunned?
- You put down

357
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,820
- Isn't it hot?
- Are you okay?

358
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Gosh

359
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,220
I am okay

360
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,920
- Does it hurt?
- Nan Xi

361
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,220
Are you okay?

362
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
I'm okay

363
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,620
What's the matter with you?

364
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,520
Do you know how important Nan Xi's hands are?

365
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,020
Sorry, auntie, I didn't mean it

366
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm fine, don't blame her

367
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,920
Are you okay?

368
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,620
Isn't she to blame , or the hot water?

369
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,520
Rui Rui

370
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,420
Don't take care of everyone

371
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,120
Your own child is a treasure

372
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,220
You can't blame other people's children

373
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,820
Mom, why are you here?

374
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,420
Mr. Hu asked me to attend a parent conference

375
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,520
If I came here a bit later, I wouldn't know that you're bullied

376
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
No, they didn't bully me, mom

377
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,820
Excuse me, please watch what you're saying

378
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,220
Accusation and bullying are serious words

379
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,420
Before you draw a conclusion, can you understand the matter first?

380
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,020
What I saw was that my daughter

381
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,420
was worried about if your son's hands hurt

382
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,920
But you put my daughter's hands away when you came

383
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,020
Then let me ask

384
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:18,120
Are you sure my daughter is to blame?

385
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,620
Let's go, Xia Rui

386
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,820
Come

387
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,820
I'm sorry, I'm leaving now, sorry

388
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,420
Mom

389
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,320
She is Xia Rui?

390
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,220
I have never seen such a protective parent

391
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,620
Regardless of the reason, she said it is Xia Rui's fault

392
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,020
What can she teach their kids?

393
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
You calm down

394
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,820
It must've been Nan Xi's mother

395
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,220
She has been away from her child for a long time due to work

396
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,620
So whenever something happens to Nan Xi, she will be very nervous

397
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,220
And it's easy to get out of control

398
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,420
So I apologize to you on her behalf

399
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,320
Nan Xi?

400
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,620
Yes, the kid who helped Xia Rui with her homework last semester

401
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
So that

402
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,820
Little brat, only you saw my form for college entrance examination

403
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,320
No one knows except you at home

404
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,820
Tell me, did you betray me?

405
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Don't wrong me, I'm a good person

406
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,620
I heard with my own ears that your teacher called mom to come

407
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,320
Why does Mr. Hu keep staring at me?

408
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,420
The matter between you and Nan Xi cannot be kept secret today

409
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,020
The parents met all of sudden and the scene is a bit awkward

410
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,420
There is nothing between me and Nan Xi. Don't talk nonsense

411
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,020
Guilty conscience

412
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,120
It's okay not to say, but how do you plan to repay me?

413
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,420
You little gold digger, how can you

414
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,020
Call as you like, I don't care

415
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,420
- President Shao, this way
- Okay

416
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,420
If that was Nan Xi,why didn't you introduce him to me?

417
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Who can stop you from talking?

418
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,820
Come, please, Xia Rui's mother, please

419
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,120
Xia Rui, sit down too

420
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,520
So Xia Rui, your mother is here today

421
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,220
Just tell us which university you want to apply to?

422
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,820
Mr. Hu, you are so funny

423
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,620
Don't you know about my grades?

424
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,220
It's nothing to do with your grades

425
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,120
Just talk about it, talk about your dream goal

426
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,120
Well, then Bin Hai University

427
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,120
Bin Hai University has a associate degree?

428
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,220
No, no, still undergraduate degree

429
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,120
It's still a top university in China

430
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,920
Undergraduate, I mean undergraduate

431
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes, undergraduate

432
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,640
Rui Rui, it's good to be confident

433
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,760
But is it a bit too much?

434
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,320
How can you discourage your child so much, mom?

435
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,220
Mr. Hu, actually

436
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,820
I told you before that I was going to send Xia Rui to study abroad

437
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,420
The procedures are all going through now

438
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,220
Her English scores are not very good,

439
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,420
so I think she needs to practice language first, for when she goes abroad

440
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
Didn't I say? I'm not going abroad

441
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,620
It's not up to you

442
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,920
Why do you decide for me?

443
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,820
Xia Rui, Xia Rui

444
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,220
I am your mother, I mean no harm

445
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,820
Why do you make decisions for my life? I don't want it

446
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,920
What is your attitude!

447
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,620
You want to go abroad? You go by yourself

448
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,620
I won't go

449
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,820
Xia Rui, Xia Rui

450
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,620
Calm down

451
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,420
It's okay, just get used to it

452
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,420
Dear Shu, see you in the cafe later

453
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,620
[What did you do to Xia Rui?]

454
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,220
[Don't talk nonsense]

455
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,820
[Find out what she wants to do in the future]

456
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,420
[The form still have to be filled]

457
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Xia Rui

458
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
Business is not good today, I'll teach you how to make coffee

459
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,420
Today?

460
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,020
You helped me sell two cups of americano

461
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,820
Let's make it today

462
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,520
Kneel down, call me teacher

463
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,220
Kneel down?

464
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,620
It depends on how well you teach

465
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
What will you teach me?

466
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,820
How about latte?

467
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,320
Latte? Don't I have to learn to make milk foam?

468
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,620
Of course, you are so smart

469
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,020
what are you afraid of?

470
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,620
Then let's go!

471
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,020
Yes, level it well

472
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,620
It must be compacted

473
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,420
otherwise the pressure gauge won't go up

474
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,520
Put both hands up to feel its temperature

475
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,220
How about the temperature? Is it hot?

476
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,620
Then the bubbles on the top will be gone

477
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,820
We need to take our coffee like this, same tilt

478
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,420
Turn around, when you turn to the end

479
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,620
press the milk hard in the middle

480
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,220
then pull it slowly

481
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,620
Stop

482
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,020
It can't be shaken when pulling, just pour

483
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,420
Rui

484
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,420
You are here

485
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,320
What a coincidence

486
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,920
Hurry up

487
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,620
Although you are her good friends,

488
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,820
It's the first time you are drinking her coffee, right?

489
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,020
My debut

490
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,920
Try it

491
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,780
How about it?

492
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,940
Not bad

493
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,500
Dear Shu is so kind

494
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,720
I heard your mom came to school

495
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,120
She actually wants me to go abroad

496
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,300
What?

497
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,940
Going abroad?

498
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,420
What do you think?

499
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,450
My English is so poor

500
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,360
I will just embarrass everyone

501
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,230
The key is that if you go abroad, you don't

502
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,340
know where to go if you want to have a barbecue

503
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,820
So I must not listen to her arrangement

504
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,890
But the score of the college entrance examination

505
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:45,900
is so high, I guess it's a bit beyond my control...

506
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,700
I'm preparing for the art exam these days. Wanna try?

507
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,040
Art exam? Me?

508
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,300
If you pass the professional course, the cultural course will be fine

509
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,180
Then if you try a little harder

510
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,780
An undergraduate degree is possible, not just an associate

511
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,940
But I

512
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,910
You think about it

513
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,680
I can't sing or draw

514
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,620
Sports? Forget it

515
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,160
I can't do anything, what should I take?

516
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,600
In this case, let's help

517
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,460
Rui analyze her specialties

518
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,880
Good idea

519
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,960
Let me say first, she...

520
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,880
She can fight!

521
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,520
She can overturn the wall!

522
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,360
Game master, now she can make coffee

523
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,200
Listen, Rui, which of your specialties

524
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,960
can be used for college entrance examinations?

525
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,620
Talkative

526
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,100
What?

527
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,690
Look even Nan Xi thinks you talk too much

528
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,600
I mean Xia Rui talks a lot

529
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,180
I understand, but what does being

530
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,980
talkative have to do with the art exam?

531
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,120
Broadcasting and hosting professional

532
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
Radio host?

533
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,020
This is reliable

534
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,000
Is the broadcast host the kind of person who stands

535
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,520
on the stage with a microphone and talks all the time?

536
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,280
That's right

537
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,680
Wait, wait

538
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,320
With the long winter

539
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,400
Don't disturb my performance

540
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,080
With the end of the long winter

541
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,270
The polar beer returned to the

542
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,260
ice field, started a new journey

543
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,140
How is it?

544
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,760
Rui, you are so talented

545
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,320
That is a good acting

546
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,010
Wait

547
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,340
Do they have to memorize such a long manuscript without looking?

548
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,260
I can't remember it

549
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,890
Don't worry, you don't have stage fright

550
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,800
The more people there are, the happier you are

551
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,760
Although the broadcast host is also considered an art category

552
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,500
But it is different from music and

553
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
painting which needs a solid foundation

554
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,660
This only requires high school training

555
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,980
Plus passing the cultural class,

556
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,480
there will be no problem

557
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,040
Let me think about it, I'm excited

558
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,380
Xia Rui, no problem

559
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,780
Yeah, you can do it

560
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,780
Really?

561
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,720
How do I look?

562
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,920
Wear a little dress

563
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,440
Xia Rui!

564
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,740
Hello, everyone, I'm the host Xia Rui

565
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,840
Kind of nice

566
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,520
- So silly
- You are stupid

567
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,920
Not stupid at all, so cute

568
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,960
Hey, it looks a good news

569
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,710
She can try broadcasting for professional art exams

570
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,590
[It's a choice, thanks, I will find]

571
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,360
[a chance to help your date with Yang Shengnan]

572
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,480
Okay I can't remember the words

573
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,280
[Don't break your promise]

574
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,780
What else?

575
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,380
Do I talk a lot?

576
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,080
No

577
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,980
Broadcast host

578
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,640
Well. This idea is actually pretty good

579
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,700
You do help me

580
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,080
Xia Rui, I was wrong before

581
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,800
I put you under too much pressure. Can you forgive me?

582
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,220
Then you promise that you will leave me alone

583
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,760
I can not guarantee

584
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,840
Then it's void

585
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,880
Then, it's time for you to apologize

586
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,040
I... apologize?

587
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,260
Yes. Because you did something wrong

588
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
What did I do wrong?

589
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,450
You didn't tell me when you were not happy

590
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,320
And you play games and skip class

591
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,580
Night self-study is voluntary. It can't be called skipping class

592
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,900
I mean that you can tell me if you are not happy

593
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,780
Don't hide from me

594
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,860
Okay. Then I promise that I will tell Nan Xi everything in the future

595
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,580
I won't skip class or play games

596
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,980
I will study hard

597
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,560
I will go to college with you

598
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,540
Okay

599
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,310
Then I will make a new study plan

600
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,200
and add the art exam content

601
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,460
Does that mean that less time can be allocated to cultural classes?

602
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,460
What are you thinking about?

603
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,480
So you mean that I need to cut my rest time

604
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,340
for the art exam?

605
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,020
Yes. You're correct

606
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,240
You just said that you wouldn't put so much pressure on me

607
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,140
I will withdraw my apology if you do this

608
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,540
Wait. Wait. Wait

609
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,340
I'm a bit confused

610
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,630
Nanxi, shouldn't you apologize to Rui?

611
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,340
It's happened Rui wants to take back the apology

612
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,940
You've turned from a guest into a host. Awesome

613
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,580
Master, please teach me

614
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,380
There he goes again

615
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,840
You can do that. But I can't teach

616
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,390
I am not that talented

617
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,060
but I am hardworking

618
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,600
You'd better to confirm that

619
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,520
I am still useful

620
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,560
Think about it carefully. Everything depends on fate?

621
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,360
What does it mean?

622
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,480
I haven't see Nan Xi smiling like that for several years

623
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,640
It's my fault previously

624
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,120
When can you open up your heart to me like to Xia Rui?
