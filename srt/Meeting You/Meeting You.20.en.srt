1
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,350
We can remember these special verbs by
mastering the eight-character language.

2
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,231
First. Sense, Feel.

3
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,721
Second. Listen, Hear.

4
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,311
-Be careful then.
-Bye bye.

5
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:33,886
Cheng Erluo.

6
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:35,613
What are you doing?

7
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,280
Are you going to play?

8
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,278
Darling. Run slowly.

9
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,538
Change! Hug me too, my turn.

10
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,431
You go away, go away.

11
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,369
Shu, my turn to hug.

12
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,833
Why are you guys like this?

13
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:06,967
Wait for me guys.

14
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,823
Finally the first year of university
has finally ended successfully.

15
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:48,918
Spread flowers!

16
00:04:57,402 --> 00:05:00,334
=EPISODE 20
WHAT HE PROMISED IS WHAT I PROMISED=

17
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:02,859
University life is better than I thought.

18
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,821
Although we are not
in the same department,

19
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,496
we can still go to the cafeteria
to eat together after class.

20
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,371
Then go to the library together.

21
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,574
During the weekends.

22
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:13,740
I can play basketball with you,
or go to the movies.

23
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,044
How nice.

24
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,895
Okay, I'll listen to you.

25
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,262
Let's go report.

26
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:27,113
There's at least 13 classes a week.
After the 4th level English test,

27
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,332
the Mandarin test is next.

28
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,461
I just got used to the midterm exam.
And the final exam is already here.

29
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,693
Beauty is all an illusion.

30
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:34,909
Hey.

31
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,677
This scene is a little bit familiar.

32
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,186
Xiao Wan Ling.

33
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,503
Me, a year ago.

34
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,481
Was I also that innocent and romantic?

35
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,569
My aunt.

36
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,006
You still have the mood to say others.

37
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,106
Look at what time is it now.

38
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,998
School just reopened
and we are going to be late.

39
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:48,729
Professor Deng will definitely punish us.

40
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,012
Han Xian Huan.

41
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,025
Here.

42
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,020
Fang Congtong.

43
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,991
Here.

44
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:55,651
Zhuang Weixian.

45
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,571
Here.

46
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:57,752
Fan Jiuran.

47
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:58,941
Here!

48
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,437
Xia Rui, Wan Ling, right?

49
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:05,378
Here.

50
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,387
Here.

51
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,100
Come in, sit down.

52
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,398
Go, go.

53
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,649
What smell is this?

54
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:15,933
Sour and sweet.

55
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:17,623
It turned out to be someone else's love.

56
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:21,873
Sit down.

57
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,472
Hurry.

58
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,517
-Lu Ding.
-Here.

59
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,717
Why are you here?

60
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:32,112
Don't you have no class in the morning?

61
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,289
Why don't you take a break?

62
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,180
I missed you.

63
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,169
You're late again.

64
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:43,880
No.

65
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,033
I set ten alarm clocks.

66
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,891
All ten alarm clocks didn't wake me up.

67
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:49,882
She's also one who can't wake up.

68
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:52,843
You don't know.
I was scared to death just now, My God.

69
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,444
Why were you scared?

70
00:06:58,678 --> 00:06:59,768
The one on stage.

71
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,079
She's not Lao Hu when she's angry.

72
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,780
She's worse than Lao Hu.

73
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:07,782
Okay. We'll go over
what we learned in the last class.

74
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,538
Xia Rui, you go first.

75
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,777
Wan Ling, you next.

76
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:15,975
Exist rules, as long as you can
repeat the texts, you won't be punished.

77
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:17,965
Oh, no, no, no.

78
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:20,050
What I am afraid of has come.

79
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:31,271
For Chinese to apologize with...

80
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,772
Recite, not read out loud.

81
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,747
With a smile.

82
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,864
As a single.

83
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,271
As a single.

84
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:48,701
Reading novels in my class?

85
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,136
I wanted to give you a chance
even after being late.

86
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:53,381
You don't cherish it yourself.

87
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,201
Your attendance this semester and grades.

88
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,489
Not much is left yet, right?

89
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,475
No, no.

90
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:59,601
Teacher, it's my fault for being late.

91
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,704
But the attendance points
are being deducted?

92
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:03,491
Why are the points deducted when I'm here?

93
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:05,160
If you recite this article,

94
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,941
then I will not deduct today's attendance.

95
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,997
If not, you don't even have to come
to the next class.

96
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:11,586
Just retake it the next semester.

97
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:18,696
Then, teacher, whether or not the marks
are deducted depends on your mood?

98
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,585
Then it means whether or not
I attend the class, it's my rights?

99
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:23,321
I operate on my mood?

100
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,304
Okay, then I will operate
on my mood today.

101
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,961
Get out.

102
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:33,414
Sure. Okay. Okay.

103
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,240
This classmate.

104
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,642
Are you from our class?

105
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,822
No.

106
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,337
Teacher, I know him.

107
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,399
He is from the Department
of Architecture of Binhai University.

108
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,717
The new student, handsome boy.

109
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:47,952
I've heard about it.

110
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,877
It's Xia Rui's boyfriend.

111
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:53,152
Falling in love all the way to my class,
is it?

112
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,466
Which level of architecture?

113
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,298
Sophomore.

114
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:57,683
Get out.

115
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,437
I told you guys earlier.

116
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:02,983
If you have good professional abilities.
I don't care about you being late.

117
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,096
Ability in English and reciting articles
replaces your late record.

118
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:09,138
I have given you all the opportunity.
Next, Wan Ling.

119
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,625
Teacher, may I know how many times
has Xia Rui been late?

120
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:13,604
Why?

121
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:16,220
Memorizing the text as you mentioned,
means she doesn't have to resit.

122
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,241
Yes.

123
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:20,567
Then I would like to ask,
specifically how many times?

124
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,711
Six times.

125
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,797
Okay, I understand.

126
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:30,924
Thank you, teacher.

127
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:35,541
Six articles?

128
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:38,557
Nan Xi, are you helping me or hurting me?

129
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:41,096
I'm helping you. It's not good to re-sit.

130
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:43,667
It's better to just re-sit it.
Just re-sit it.

131
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:46,191
Maybe next semester,
I can switch to another teacher.

132
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,589
Have you heard of such a thing?

133
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:50,350
One who hasn't failed in university isn't
considered a complete university graduate.

134
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,151
A life without re-sit
is not a complete life.

135
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:54,584
Don't you worry.

136
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:55,904
I am here.

137
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:59,955
Why do I still have to be tortured
by English even in university?

138
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:03,079
Do you think this English teacher
is possessed by Lao Hu?

139
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,625
She should not be.

140
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:09,845
Different gender.

141
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,064
It's worse than Teacher Hu.

142
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,310
Wait, why are you so free today?

143
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,619
Finished your homework?

144
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,953
The model is also finished?

145
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,001
Oh, Gosh.

146
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,175
University is just too easy for you.

147
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,243
You are so free that
you can find six texts for me to recite.

148
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,031
It's also not easy.

149
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:27,992
What's not easy?

150
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:29,456
Elective courses.

151
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:30,891
What elective courses?

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,807
Don't know what to choose.

153
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:37,173
Oh, my goodness.
Registration will be closed tomorrow.

154
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,278
You haven't chosen yet?

155
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,977
Four points. You don't want it all?

156
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:42,745
I know.

157
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,163
Well, true.

158
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,295
You've finished all those courses
in freshman year.

159
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,352
Ahh, is this the reason why
you came to find me today?

160
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:52,291
You'll help me.

161
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,497
-I help you choose courses?
-Yes.

162
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,135
You will choose whatever I choose for you?

163
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,288
Whatever course you choose,
I will study the course.

164
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,580
You will also attend public classes?

165
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:07,023
Don't.

166
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,098
So there are times when you are scared.

167
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:15,956
I will remember you
giving me six texts to recite.

168
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,284
Oh, what to choose,
wait for me to think about it.

169
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:22,401
Fallen into my hands.

170
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,622
So happy.

171
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,204
-Thank you, auntie.
-No worries.

172
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,768
Hey, Si Bo.

173
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,054
Hey, just finished training?

174
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:32,128
Yeah. I still have to practice
in the afternoon.

175
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,507
Wait a minute.

176
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,248
Aunt, I want this
and this and that. Thanks.

177
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,942
Si bo, why did you come back?

178
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:43,058
I came back to find Professor Gu
for something.

179
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:45,065
Also to stop by the cafeteria for a meal.

180
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,121
As a student, I never liked to eat here.

181
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:49,786
-I feel the opposite after graduation.
-Is it?

182
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,454
Your meal is ready.

183
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,733
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

184
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,340
I heard you're the reserve captain
in the team now.

185
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,960
Starting with reserve captain first.
Gain some experience.

186
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,289
The coach informed me already!

187
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,939
Thank you for your recommendation.

188
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,687
You're a good seed.

189
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,307
How 'bout it?

190
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:16,603
Are you confident about getting
into the University Basketball League?

191
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,073
I will try my best.

192
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,693
I don't know yet.

193
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:20,950
Why aren't you confident?

194
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:22,311
This isn't like you.

195
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:25,106
Everyone has improved a lot
over the past two days of training.

196
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:27,960
I don't seem
to have any advantages anymore.

197
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,914
Everyone's a lot more capable now.

198
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,160
You can practice with me after classes,
if you want.

199
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:34,482
Anytime.

200
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:35,590
Really?

201
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,673
Thank you Si Bo.

202
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,342
Then tell me what requests you have of me!

203
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:39,597
I will do whatever I can!

204
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,753
Come on! No worries!

205
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,788
You're welcome.

206
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,076
Besides, my hands will get itchy
if I don't play basketball.

207
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:48,137
I understand this feeling.

208
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,217
I don't see your fan Zhao Yi Shu
these days.

209
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,219
Isn't she always sitting on the sidelines
watching you practice?

210
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,026
Her drama troupe
recently left for a charity tour.

211
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,927
Should be back soon.

212
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:06,012
If I remember correctly
it should be next Tuesday.

213
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,207
Next Tuesday?

214
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,914
Oh, no, oh no! I need to practice!
I can't pick her up again.

215
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,035
I have to tell her.

216
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:17,728
Hey, Si Bo.

217
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,623
Why are you asking about her
out of the blue?

218
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:24,480
I ran into her at the snack street
behind the school the other day.

219
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,164
Saw her rushing out.

220
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,345
But she doesn't seem
to have any impression of me.

221
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,429
I know.

222
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,645
She must have gone there
to drink hot brine.

223
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,548
Then, she realized that she's late for
rehearsals and called me on her way out.

224
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,231
Hot brine?

225
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:41,352
Yes, hot brine.

226
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,665
Let me tell you.

227
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:45,363
This Yi Shu looks all gentle and quiet.

228
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:47,172
But, she has quite a unique taste.

229
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:48,139
Likes to eat spicy food.

230
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:49,660
And especially likes to eat ice cream.

231
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,568
As kids, I always lost to her
when we played games.

232
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:53,164
She always cheated her way through!

233
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,227
Your relationship is quite good with her!

234
00:13:57,084 --> 00:14:00,472
I always thought Zhao Yi Shu
is a very cold girl.

235
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:02,867
It's all pretend.

236
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:07,648
Actually, she is quite
considerate and kind-hearted.

237
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,205
Many boys follow her,
calling her "the prettiest girl".

238
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,704
So, she's now avoiding people
whenever she can.

239
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,481
Si Bo. You don't know.

240
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,690
You'll find out as you get to know her.

241
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,426
Nan Xi, the delicious food is here!

242
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:23,941
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

243
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:25,586
Hurry, help me open it.

244
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,097
Why? Hurry, help me take it all out.

245
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,330
Smells good.

246
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,699
Sit down and eat.

247
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,126
What are you doing?

248
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:49,143
Xia Rui.

249
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:52,567
Is there nothing else?

250
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,258
That's all.

251
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:55,314
Quick, eat.

252
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,555
This is so good.

253
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,632
Wow. This grease.

254
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,850
The feeling of it bursting
on the tip of my tongue.

255
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:06,046
Giving you one.

256
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:07,883
Giving you one more.

257
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,415
One more of this.

258
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,346
Yummy.

259
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:18,490
Why aren't you eating?

260
00:15:23,662 --> 00:15:28,353
This food contains small intestines,
chicken gizzards and even this heart.

261
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,113
And 100 grams of this food,

262
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:32,248
contains 200 to 300 mg of cholesterol.

263
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,952
The human body should not consume
more than 300 mg of cholesterol, per day.

264
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:38,545
So this meal exceeds three times
the normal amount.

265
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,377
Then, eat this.

266
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,295
This gives you collagen.

267
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,700
This is macro-molecular collagen.

268
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,032
After entering the body,
it's digested, absorbed and stored as fat.

269
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:56,951
In other words,
eating chicken feet helps with nothing.

270
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,271
It will even make you gain weight.

271
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:08,664
Then I'll eat duck neck.
There shouldn't be anything wrong, right?

272
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:11,910
When it undergoes processing,
a lot of spices are added. Even nitrite.

273
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,892
When you consume 0.3 grams to 0.5 grams,
it will cause poisoning.

274
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,772
Even death.

275
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,875
Has anyone told you
that you can't talk while eating.

276
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,112
And you can't eat while you talk.

277
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:29,087
Otherwise it's easy to choke.

278
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,245
I know.

279
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,534
And you're still talking!

280
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,854
I now know why you have to pinch my mouth
every time and not let me talk.

281
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,757
It is actually quite annoying.

282
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,024
I thought you're not eating?

283
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,968
Why did you even swallow it?

284
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:00,730
You can talk now.

285
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:03,617
I have to eat it because you fed me.

286
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:05,593
Then tell me. Is it super delicious?

287
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,415
Why don't you just stop memorizing?

288
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,134
Go and apologize to the English teacher.

289
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,255
Say sorry.

290
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,486
No way.

291
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,511
Nan Xi promised, that means I promised.

292
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:43,245
If I give up now, how can I even continue
living in this world?

293
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:47,078
Also, Nan Xi selected six articles
that are quite suitable for me.

294
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:49,553
I will be fighting until the end
with the English teacher.

295
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,260
I feel as if that's still careless.

296
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,941
At the end of the day I'm still...

297
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,524
Hey.

298
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,351
So if Nan Xi asks you
to do anything, you'll do it?

299
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,256
Sour.

300
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,716
Rest for two minutes.

301
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,799
Why are there no much classes?

302
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:24,345
Hey, hey.

303
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:25,776
Help me take a look.

304
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,889
Help me analyze which class
is more suitable for him.

305
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,154
Please.

306
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,461
Can you not make this single dog...

307
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,421
accept a wave of abandonment
anytime, anywhere?

308
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,466
Please consider how I feel.

309
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,758
Tennis.

310
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,718
Not quite suitable.

311
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:47,059
What is body dance?

312
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:48,256
Yoga?

313
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:51,995
Taekwondo.

314
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:53,797
No way.

315
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:55,063
Taekwondo is not good.

316
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,235
I applied for this class last semester.

317
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,732
I wanted to practice self defense.

318
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:04,060
It the end, it almost took my life away.

319
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,446
Thinking about it now make me feel pain.

320
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:07,523
Forget it.

321
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:08,628
Dangerous.

322
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,099
Okay then forget it.

323
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,804
It's too dangerous.

324
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,041
Then what other classes are there?

325
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,430
I'll continue.

326
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,166
Social administration.

327
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:24,151
What is social development training?

328
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,460
Help students step by step.

329
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,699
Break down social barriers.

330
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,716
Social.

331
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:36,006
Step by step help.

332
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,574
Step by step help.

333
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:43,346
Social.

334
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:47,670
(Successfully picked course)

335
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,092
Hey, Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

336
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,171
Here, here.

337
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:07,556
Hey. Nan Xi,

338
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,280
About this,
sister in law already greeted me.

339
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,552
This time, I was really lured by coercion.

340
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:14,454
The last second
before the end of the course selection.

341
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,569
She made me change my course.

342
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,910
So don't worry this time.

343
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,666
I'll cover you in this class.

344
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,308
Okay.

345
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,067
Well, don't be so cold.

346
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,195
I sacrificed a lot for you.

347
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,426
For you I gave up the flower arrangement
class full of pretty girls.

348
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:33,994
But this brotherhood...

349
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,143
You don't need to say much.

350
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,286
Just keep it in your heart.

351
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,907
I just... Hey?

352
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:43,019
-Social development training.
-Yes.

353
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,389
This sounds like mixed credits.

354
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,008
How important are social skills.

355
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:49,061
Think about us in the future,
we will leave the school.

356
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:52,261
It is inevitable to deal with all kinds
of people after leaving school, right?

357
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:55,566
So we learn social skills
to also settle down.

358
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,688
Learn a skill.

359
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,622
Look at your small advertisement.

360
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,647
How much did they pay you
for your advertising.

361
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,380
A cup of milk tea is enough.

362
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,817
Oh, right.

363
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,396
Your Nan Xi.

364
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,761
Isn't he particularly excluding himself
from contact with others?

365
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:11,343
Can he even take that class?

366
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,414
I placed someone undercover.

367
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:15,506
Reporting to me at all times.

368
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,815
Right now, he should be in class right?

369
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:22,787
Welcome everyone who selected
the social development course.

370
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,398
Instead of saying it is a class,

371
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:27,549
let's just say we're here
to play and relax.

372
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,558
Walk out of your campuses,

373
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,993
to make new friends with different majors.

374
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:36,504
I hope everyone will be able to learn
and enjoy this limited lesson.

375
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,475
What is social development?

376
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,696
I'm sure everyone
will have questions on this.

377
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:49,143
Actually we learn social etiquette from
everyone based on daily communication.

378
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,872
Expanding our social skills.

379
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:53,222
And today is our first lesson.

380
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:55,976
I hope everyone can learn quickly.

381
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,347
So the first project that
we are going to do is...

382
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:01,019
A boy and a girl, one to one.

383
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:03,151
Find your ballroom dancing partner.

384
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:05,047
Okay. Let's start now.

385
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,788
Teacher!

386
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,083
I want to be with Nan Xi as a team.

387
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,035
No, you can't.

388
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:14,157
From the start of our course, we have
determined a ratio of one guy to one girl.

389
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:15,710
If you two become partners.

390
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,405
Two female classmates will be left out.

391
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,879
There will be many more guys and girls
matching activities.

392
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,440
This will make it hard for activities
to proceed well later on.

393
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,747
So this classmate.

394
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:26,455
Actually,
it is not difficult to find a partner.

395
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:27,518
You can try.

396
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,299
Teacher.

397
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:30,506
I can do it myself.

398
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:34,391
It's okay.
If you find it difficult, I can help you.

399
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,249
Come, you come.

400
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:41,287
Okay.

401
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,553
Is everyone done
with setting themselves up?

402
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:45,875
Now, guys and girls,
stand in two separate rows.

403
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:48,892
Each pair stand face to face.

404
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:52,204
Any other girl who did not find a partner.

405
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,342
Please raise your hands.

406
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:55,338
Teacher, it's me.

407
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,233
Can you form a team with that classmate?

408
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:00,670
Teacher.

409
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,204
I really can do it by myself.

410
00:23:02,284 --> 00:23:05,713
How will he dance?

411
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,716
If you find it really difficult,

412
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,436
you may choose
to withdraw from this class.

413
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,650
We have three credits for this course.

414
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,608
Then you count it yourself.

415
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,203
Make it up during the next semester.

416
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:17,305
That's also fine.

417
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:20,267
Let me try.

418
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,934
Then please stand opposite
to that classmate.

419
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:24,710
Then we are going to start class.

420
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:27,665
Teacher.

421
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,333
We met before.

422
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:30,941
Can I be with him?

423
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,884
Can you?

424
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,508
Yes.

425
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:37,599
Sorry.

426
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,853
Then you stand here.
We are going to start the class.

427
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,290
This Hao Tian.

428
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:53,277
Why is he so unreliable?

429
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,541
The class has been on for so long.

430
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,408
There isn't a single message sent to me.

431
00:23:56,927 --> 00:24:00,241
No news might be the best news.

432
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:02,516
I say, Xia Rui.

433
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:04,635
Since you're so worried about him.

434
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,811
Why do you still want him
to apply for this course?

435
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:12,185
It must be because Nan Xi asked you
to recite those English texts.

436
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:13,942
You hold a grudge.

437
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,908
You purposely made it hard for him.

438
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,084
How can it be?

439
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:19,147
You, in your heart.

440
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,409
I'm that narrow-minded?

441
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:21,380
Come on.

442
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,972
When you applied the courses
for Nan Xi yesterday.

443
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:25,894
I saw that smirk on your face.

444
00:24:26,354 --> 00:24:28,698
That was obviously a mom's smile.

445
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,486
Really?

446
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,502
Of course.

447
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:35,039
I was just thinking that Nan Xi
has also stayed in Binhai for a year now.

448
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,417
He's also familiar with the environment.

449
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:38,420
Just want him to open up.
Have his own circle of friends.

450
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,850
Plus this professional teacher
gives him free tutoring.

451
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,495
How can I let go such a good opportunity?

452
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:45,817
Okay.

453
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:50,007
After all, I have not escaped you
showing off your love to me.

454
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,912
But you doubted me just now.

455
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,095
I'm very sad.

456
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,107
I won't let you drink.

457
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,254
Hey! Xia Rui.

458
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,070
I was wrong, I was wrong.

459
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,559
I shouldn't be a villain.

460
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,348
Please forgive this single dog.

461
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,643
Occasionally looking at
you once again. Alright?

462
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,652
Don't be like this.

463
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:12,922
Smiling means you have forgiven me.

464
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:13,878
Okay.

465
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,438
But I really have to remind you.

466
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:18,252
A popular guy like Nan Xi.

467
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:20,258
You put him in that kind of class.

468
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:23,139
That's equivalent
to putting a sheep into the wolf den.

469
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:28,476
I'll see what you're going to do
if one day some girl stole him away.

470
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:29,959
You think too much.

471
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,611
It's simply impossible for this to happen.

472
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,010
Nan Xi doesn't even let Cheng Erluo
touch him.

473
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,227
I have this confidence in myself.

474
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,741
Guys, bow.

475
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,026
Girls, curtsy. Everyone learn along.

476
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:45,519
Boys and girls, step forward.

477
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,245
Hold hands and hold waists.

478
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,102
One, two, three, four.

479
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:53,574
Everyone turn around.

480
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:58,346
Is it better being with me
than being with a stranger?

481
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,239
Can I do this?

482
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,854
So you can lift up your arm?

483
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:11,531
Left hand...

484
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:15,349
You can put it here.

485
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,370
Can I put it on your shoulder?

486
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,361
Relax.

487
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:33,751
Follow my footsteps.

488
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:36,850
Left foot first.

489
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:40,534
Feet together.

490
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:42,799
Stick out your right foot.

491
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,314
Feet together.

492
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,264
Right foot back.

493
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,854
Feet together.

494
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,473
Stretch left foot.

495
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:53,025
Feet together.

496
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,141
Very good.

497
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,653
Left foot.

498
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:57,263
Feet together.

499
00:26:57,343 --> 00:26:58,764
Stretch right foot.

500
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,613
Very good.

501
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,424
Very good.

502
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,237
Very good.

503
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,253
What are you doing?

504
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:36,413
What do you mean what am I doing?
I'm memorizing English words.

505
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:38,228
Can't you see? Have you gone blind?

506
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,480
I just saw it that's why it's scary, okay?

507
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:42,109
Xia Rui.

508
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:45,540
Don't tell me my current university life
is all a dream.

509
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,611
I'm actually in the second year
of high school.

510
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:50,136
Correct.

511
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:51,856
It is a dream.

512
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,252
After you wake up from your sleep.

513
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:57,735
You'll realize you're still
the Chubby Cheng you used to be.

514
00:27:57,815 --> 00:27:59,290
Just chat.

515
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,980
Don't talk about my bad history.

516
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,643
I'm obviously the handsome
and smart guy now.

517
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,457
Heaven and earth.
I'm the one-and-only kind of handsome.

518
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,850
Binhai University Basketball.

519
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:12,111
Reserve captain.

520
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:14,516
Hey.

521
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,977
Why are there so many people
looking at you?

522
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:19,629
Did you get the title
as the most beautiful girl in school?

523
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:28,311
Use your pig's brain
before speaking, okay?

524
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:30,992
Look at me, which cell in me
could relate to the "prettiest girl"?

525
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,813
That's true. Sophomore year.

526
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,952
If it was gold, it would have shone.

527
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:37,475
Are you looking for death?

528
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,660
Hand it over.

529
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,127
What to hand in?

530
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:50,370
One.

531
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,150
Two.

532
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:56,158
I'll hand it over.

533
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:58,829
Xia Rui...

534
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,066
There is nothing.

535
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:03,027
Don't you mind. It's all friends.

536
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:28,630
I know about this.
Nan Xi told me about it before.

537
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,035
It's normal to be holding hands
for a ballroom dance.

538
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:33,370
That's right. There's absolutely nothing.

539
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,505
They don't know anything.

540
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:37,061
They even say Nan Xi is past tense
for Yang Yufei.

541
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:42,007
What Nan Xi, Yang Yufei.

542
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,652
Xia Rui, you're the one
who is Nan Xi's past.

543
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,037
This...

544
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,310
It's past tense
and also present present tense.

545
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,451
It's also the future present tense.

546
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,389
You know, I know.

547
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:59,463
Your English is pretty good.

548
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:01,063
Come, recite this with me.

549
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:02,063
Just this one.

550
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:04,358
If you can't memorize these,
don't even think of eating.

551
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,405
Is the social development class fun?

552
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,807
(It's alright.)

553
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:18,883
Then do you still want to go tomorrow?

554
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,430
(Going on Monday afternoons.)

555
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:23,970
So positive.

556
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:26,689
Seems like this class is the right choice.

557
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:31,530
(Yes.)

558
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,272
Yes.

559
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:36,625
Yes?

560
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,085
What the hell is that?

561
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,386
Dancing with Yang Yufei is so fun
and you still want to go.

562
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:42,526
Still go.

563
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:43,870
What are you doing?

564
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:46,589
Mumbling here alone.

565
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,361
Why?

566
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,589
Come. Come here. Hug me.

567
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:57,502
Follow me. Come.

568
00:30:57,582 --> 00:31:00,049
Right, here.

569
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:02,451
Here.

570
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,270
Like this.

571
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,289
-Go down.
-Down?

572
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:11,074
What are you doing?
Being crazy here during the day.

573
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:16,741
You say, how can you feel nothing at all
when we're so close in distance?

574
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,702
Who is so close with whom?

575
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:19,944
Don't you feel anything?

576
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:21,292
Don't, don't, don't.

577
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:27,194
Could it be that I got it right?

578
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:29,594
There a little witch rushing to Nan Xi?

579
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:30,602
No.

580
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,243
I just saw someone dancing.

581
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,628
So I just wanted to try.

582
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,177
Don't try to lie to me.

583
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:42,243
Or Nan Xi has progressed to dancing
with others already?

584
00:31:42,323 --> 00:31:43,779
Of course not.

585
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,679
That's just a part of his course.

586
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:51,675
Whose vinegar jar has overturned?

587
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,079
How can it be?

588
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,699
How could I be jealous?

589
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,985
Really.

590
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:57,773
So sour.

591
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:00,823
How's your English recitation?
I will check in two days.

592
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,410
Xia Rui. What's wrong with you? Xia Rui.

593
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,962
Hey, Shu.
Let's go back to the dorm together.

594
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,098
Let's go together.

595
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:13,467
Hey. Zhao Yishu?

596
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:14,688
Si Bo.

597
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,033
Why are you here?

598
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:17,466
I just passed by.

599
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:18,932
I'll take you back to the dormitory.

600
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:20,800
No need. I can go by myself.

601
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,298
Since we've bumped into each other.
There's no reason not to help.

602
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:24,336
Give me your luggage.

603
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,577
-Just let him send you.
-Yeah, just let him send you.

604
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:29,911
-Then we'll go first.
-Bye bye.

605
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,186
Bye bye.

606
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,447
Bye bye.

607
00:32:34,657 --> 00:32:35,533
Give it to me.

608
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:37,847
Okay. Thank you, Si Bo.

609
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,055
You're welcome.

610
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:50,982
Cheng Erluo told me that
he has training today.

611
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,822
Did he ask you to come?

612
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,773
No.

613
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,508
Didn't I just say I was just passing by?

614
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:59,688
I heard that your college car
is coming back soon.

615
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:01,139
So I waited a little more.

616
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:06,508
Is there some other reason
you wee looking for me?

617
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,306
Don't call me brother Si Bo.

618
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:11,080
I'm not a few years older than you.

619
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,362
It sounds horrible.

620
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,168
Cheng Erluo called you brother Si Bo.

621
00:33:16,248 --> 00:33:17,946
I'll just follow along.

622
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,199
And also,
we are not from the same college.

623
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,765
It doesn't seem appropriate
to call you senior either.

624
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,005
Brother Si Bo.

625
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,708
I've arrived. Thank you.

626
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:44,206
I can bring it up myself.

627
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:45,353
Okay.

628
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,490
You've been tired for half a month.
Hurry up and rest.

629
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,428
Okay.

630
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:49,745
Oh, right.

631
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:53,714
This is for you.

632
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:56,750
I heard you like eating hot brine
with ice cream.

633
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,994
I'm afraid the temperature
will be affected if I put them together.

634
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:00,373
So I put it in a thermal bag.

635
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:02,413
Hurry, take it up and eat.

636
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:04,493
Is this what Cheng Erluo told you?

637
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:07,608
He casually mentioned while chatting.

638
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:14,541
But he did not say, my favorite
is the one next to our community.

639
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,901
The hot brine both me and him
ate since childhood.

640
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:19,422
Paired with the double dip ice cream
from the store next door.

641
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,288
I really don't know about this.

642
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:25,419
I wonder if it'll be too late
if I go to Cheng Hua city now.

643
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,364
Si Bo.

644
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:29,887
Everything in Binhai is great.

645
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,510
But I still like the original taste.

646
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,927
You are very good too.

647
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,678
But I already have someone I like.

648
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:42,298
Then is it Cheng Erluo that you like?

649
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:43,359
Yes.

650
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,462
Does he know that you like him?

651
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:52,457
I understand now.

652
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:55,223
Actually it doesn't matter Yishu.

653
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,023
You must not feel burdened.

654
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,761
Thank you, Si Bo.

655
00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:05,321
I didn't expect to be rejected
before confessing officially.

656
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,980
Yishu.

657
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,785
-You're really a very special girl.
-Sorry, Si Bo.

658
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,176
I really..

659
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:12,562
Don't say sorry.

660
00:35:13,073 --> 00:35:15,739
There's no right or wrong in feelings.

661
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:18,424
Actually...

662
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:21,086
This is really a very magical thing.

663
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,007
You came to Binhai
for the arts exam that year.

664
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,977
When I saw you for the first time
in front of the school gate.

665
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:28,717
I knew I fell for you.

666
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:34,219
I did not confess to you yet
because I wanted to explore it slowly.

667
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:37,240
The reason that made me like you
at the first glance.

668
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,704
But then I realize this isn't important.

669
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:45,017
Because I realize
caring about you itself...

670
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:47,111
makes me happy already.

671
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:52,496
I hope you don't feel burdened
because I like you.

672
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:55,179
Since you called me brother Si Bo,

673
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:58,036
just treat me as a brother
who cares about you.

674
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,123
Frankly accept my kindness to you.

675
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,401
Can I?

676
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:03,575
Si Bo...

677
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,701
Actually you really don't need to do this.

678
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,661
I really don't deserve you linking me.

679
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,703
No, you deserve it.

680
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,512
Even just as a friend.
