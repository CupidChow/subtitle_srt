1
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,740
Why are you waiting for me here?

2
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,085
No way.

3
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:20,303
You prepared all these?

4
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:22,807
Sit down.

5
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,404
Try my cooking.

6
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:31,743
Smells good?

7
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,936
Good.

8
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:38,561
Try one by one, try this first.

9
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,488
Is it delicious? Is it delicious?

10
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:49,101
-It's delicious.
-Really?

11
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,161
Really.

12
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,733
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

13
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,133
Just a minor injury.

14
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,621
Let me have a look.

15
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:04,082
Really just a minor injury.

16
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,248
Be obedient.

17
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,941
In the future, I will cook.

18
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,864
You don't have to.

19
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:17,025
I will be more careful.

20
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:18,867
-Does it hurt?
-No, it doesn't.

21
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:22,880
Never mind.

22
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,867
Come. Let me see.

23
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,954
How was it?

24
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,536
Nan Xi.

25
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,352
=EPISODE 24 IMPERFECT PERFECTION=

26
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:08,455
Xia Rui.

27
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:10,645
How can you just refuse like this?

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,104
Although it's quite cool this way.

29
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,256
But you should have discussed with us.

30
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,605
What's there to discuss?

31
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,614
I think it's not about what to discuss.

32
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,758
Because of Nan Xi, you give up your dream.

33
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:23,950
Isn't this stupid?

34
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,071
I'm just not going to Italy.

35
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:29,492
I'm staying to make Yami shine,
isn't that a good thing too?

36
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:30,782
Yami has me.

37
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,316
With my Weibo and live broadcast fans.

38
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,529
Enough for a living.

39
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:35,972
Don't worry about it.

40
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:39,004
But isn't there any other way?

41
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,943
Boss Yi.

42
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:46,167
Can't we just look for that, that...

43
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,306
What is it called?

44
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,979
Wang... Wang Wei To.

45
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:50,967
Tell him, we should discuss again.

46
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,848
I asked someone from the WBC.

47
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,990
He left Binhai a long time ago.

48
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,779
He is probably in Milan now.

49
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,197
Okay.

50
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:01,711
I know that you all care about me.

51
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,753
I'm just not going to Italy.
Not like I'm giving up on making coffee.

52
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,224
Moreover, our Boss Yi
is as good as Wang Wei To.

53
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,749
Look at our Xia Rui, all grown up.

54
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,431
What she says really makes sense.

55
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,555
That's right.

56
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,089
Don't tell Nan Xi about this.

57
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,026
Their department recently
has a design competition.

58
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:21,423
Everyone is persuading him
to participate in the competition.

59
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:23,488
Don't disturb him at this time.
He is troubled.

60
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,164
Didn't Nan Xi go to Jiangzhou to find you?

61
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,637
Why didn't you both came back together?

62
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:30,206
He said
there was something urgent in college,

63
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,076
and needed to go back first.

64
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:35,826
Nan Xi.

65
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:38,529
We were talking about you.

66
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,698
Have a look.

67
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:43,054
What is this?

68
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,002
School introduction and admission guide.

69
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,052
School?

70
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,564
What school is this?

71
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,743
Why can't I understand anything?

72
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:52,921
This is Mr. Umberto's training school.

73
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,622
Besides,
I've registered you for language class.

74
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:00,245
-How did you know?
-I didn't tell him anything.

75
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,130
You didn't even have time to tell.

76
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,369
I don't want to go to Italy.

77
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:09,313
What if...

78
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:11,363
we go together.

79
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:14,569
Sir.

80
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,694
Please wait.

81
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,089
What's the matter?

82
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:21,453
Sorry to disturb you.

83
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:24,079
That girl is my girlfriend, Xia Rui.

84
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,540
She loves coffee very much.

85
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,896
Please reconsider again.

86
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,320
This is my email.

87
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:36,530
I'll write it for you.

88
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,744
You can reach me anytime.

89
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,036
Okay, sure.

90
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,358
Thank you.

91
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:58,182
(Dear Nan Xi, Here's the introduction
of the institute that I am in.)

92
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,869
(Take a look and see if there is
any problem. Hope I can see you.)

93
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:03,684
(And your friend in Italy.)

94
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,382
Professor Gu.

95
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,717
Professor Gu.

96
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,591
What is it?

97
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:22,582
Professor Gu, first place
for the architectural design...

98
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,612
gets to go to Milan as exchange student?

99
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:27,583
You're talking about the
College Student's Design competition...

100
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,178
that will be held soon?

101
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:30,278
Correct.

102
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,369
Yes.

103
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:36,315
Our school established a cooperation
with their School of Architecture.

104
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:39,123
The winner will not only
get our college qualification,

105
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,220
like in the previous years.

106
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,633
But now he or she can also go to Milan
as an exchange student for a year.

107
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,970
And you have to ensure that
during your third year of studies,

108
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,563
you have to come back for the graduation
project and graduation thesis report.

109
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:52,908
Understood.

110
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,137
I want to participate.

111
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:58,899
Didn't you always reject the competition?

112
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,713
Why all of a sudden,
you changed your mind?

113
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:02,453
Because I want to go to Milan.

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,959
Nan Xi is really something.

115
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:08,575
Does nothing at all
but once he makes a move,

116
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,264
it makes us
single people look like a fool.

117
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:11,293
You are the fool.

118
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,685
But I really admire
the move that you made.

119
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:15,821
You really want to participate
in the competition?

120
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:18,486
Didn't you say design,
is not meant for competition.

121
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,500
But it could keep both of us together.

122
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,134
Aren't we together now?

123
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:24,651
There's us. And dreams.

124
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,814
But I still don't want you to go.

125
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:31,171
Once we are there,
we have to face lots of new things.

126
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:33,796
New language, new country,
new environment. And a bunch of people...

127
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,747
that we don't even know,
that we have to get to know too.

128
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,343
Everything will be different.
I don't want that because of me...

129
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:40,877
Don't worry. With you, I'm not afraid.

130
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:43,939
I can't take it anymore.

131
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,031
Even this coffee can't wash out
the sweetness in my tooth now.

132
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,918
Binzi, how about you give me another
Italian espresso.

133
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll have a bitter one to neutralize this.

134
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,898
Boss Yi.

135
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,937
When did our cafe
have art selection service?

136
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,768
That was the coffee Xia Rui made
during the rematch.

137
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:05,418
I'm ready to sell it at our shop.

138
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:06,916
Let everyone taste it.

139
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,770
Isn't it little whale?

140
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,400
Why is it that little whale met big whale?

141
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:16,111
You have to ask our Xia Rui.

142
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:18,986
This is too much.
I need a cup of coffee too.

143
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,228
The best would be Chinese herbs flavor.
Just needs to be bitter, nothing else.

144
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,160
It seems like coffee
can no longer neutralize me. I'm leaving.

145
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,554
I'm going to play basketball.
Let's have dinner together later.

146
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,033
Are we going together?

147
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,322
Why not...

148
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,718
You are hiding something from me again?

149
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:40,271
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

150
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,791
You may leave, you may leave,
you may leave. We'll talk later.

151
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,057
Okay then.

152
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:46,992
You try this.

153
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,604
Delicious.

154
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,692
Not bad.

155
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,610
Let's call it a day.

156
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,584
Sure, let's stop here today.

157
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,898
Si Bo.

158
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:10,262
I have a question.

159
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,541
Always wanted to ask you.

160
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:14,120
-Say it.
-There are 14 people in our team.

161
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,886
They are pretty talented too.

162
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,101
Why do you have so much confidence in me?

163
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,196
And are willing to spare time
training in school with me?

164
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:27,637
This question is not easy to answer.

165
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:36,322
Shu. How did you know that
I just finished my training?

166
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,866
Have a meal?

167
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,586
No problem. Then wait for me.

168
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,660
-Shu?
-Yes.

169
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,537
Asking to have dinner together tonight.

170
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:46,564
Si Bo, Let's go together tonight.

171
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:49,109
If you guys are having dinner,
I won't be joining.

172
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,007
No, I've always wanted to invite you
to have dinner together.

173
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,909
It's not easy to pick a date, right?

174
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:55,482
Moreover, Shu is not an outsider, right?

175
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:57,211
You know Nan Xi too.

176
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,644
-Nan Xi is going as well?
-Probably?

177
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,554
We've made an appointment
to have dinner together since lunch.

178
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:05,976
To celebrate Nan Xi,
signing up for the design competition.

179
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,167
Nan Xi already signed up?

180
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,332
That's right.

181
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:10,184
Why did he change his mind
all of a sudden?

182
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:13,923
Si Bo. It's either you ask Nan Xi.
Or you just follow me.

183
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,615
I will tell you about it
when we are on the way.

184
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,002
Let's go I'm so hungry.

185
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,627
Cheng Erluo.

186
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:26,052
Practice went well today.

187
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:28,057
Just that.

188
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,389
The moment when you turn around.
You have to be fast.

189
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:31,932
-The step where my body turns?
-Right.

190
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:35,867
And when I'm backing up your shot,
you must pay attention on...

191
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,219
Si Bo.

192
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,040
What happened during the shot?

193
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,210
You guys are eating here?

194
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,244
Yes. I have never been here before.

195
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,206
But it looks pretty good.

196
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:51,937
Why? Si Bo, have you been here before?

197
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,030
Once or twice.

198
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,316
Wherever you have been once or twice.
It should taste good.

199
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,705
Let's go.

200
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,169
I'm not going.

201
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,981
Yishu could be waiting for you.

202
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:04,478
Cheng Erluo.

203
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,841
I can answer your question now.

204
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:09,098
The reason why I'm helping you out
with your practice.

205
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:12,167
Not just hoping that you could achieve
good results in the CUBA.

206
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:15,658
I also hope you
can be a better Cheng Erluo.

207
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,067
Thank you, Si Bo.

208
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:20,568
I will definitely work hard.

209
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,018
Keep it up.

210
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,967
Are you really not going to eat?

211
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:28,619
Go.

212
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:29,844
Go ahead.

213
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:32,257
Then I'm going.

214
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,199
Keep it up.

215
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,397
Shu. Why are you alone? Where is Xia Rui?

216
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:45,451
Xia Rui and Nan Xi
have something going on tonight.

217
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,733
It's just the two of us.

218
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:50,994
If I'd knew,
I would have brought Si Bo along.

219
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,998
The more the merrier, right?

220
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:56,405
Did you see he was at the doorstep,
but turned around and left.

221
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,782
Did he mention why?

222
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:01,945
He did not. He just left.

223
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,389
Quite suddenly.

224
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:07,227
Maybe he had something all of a sudden.

225
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,123
He must be unlucky.

226
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,631
Because this place seems good.

227
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:14,697
Not like where Xia Rui always brings us.

228
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:16,754
It's either skewer or the food stall.

229
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,488
I smell like lamb skewer.

230
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,065
Our Shu knows how to pick a good place.

231
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:25,385
Cheng Erluo.

232
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:27,308
I...

233
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,024
Actually, today I want to tell you...

234
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,172
Why are you so nervous?

235
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:47,139
Do you want to say something?

236
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:49,918
Is it…

237
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,143
The same thing that I'm guessing?

238
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:55,737
Guess what?

239
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,281
Isn't it just a meal?

240
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,827
My treat. Leave it to me.

241
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:09,882
-Actually I...
-Actually I have a lot that...

242
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,523
I want to tell you.

243
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,323
You first.

244
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:19,727
Si Bo has been helping me
with my practice recently.

245
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,784
A long time has passed.
Actually, he's quite nice.

246
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:25,368
Like just now.
Do you know what he said to me?

247
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,680
What did he say?

248
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,294
"I hope you can become
a better Cheng Erluo."

249
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:34,669
You know how touched I was?

250
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,062
It's like the line
of the idol drama male lead.

251
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,855
If I were a girl, I would have fallen
in love with him on the spot.

252
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,268
-Shu.
-I've thought about it for a long time.

253
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,564
This Si Bo usually takes care of you.

254
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,216
If two of you have any misunderstanding,

255
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,266
I, Cheng Erluo
will untie it all by myself.

256
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:52,028
Our boat of friendship
can't just turn over like that.

257
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,366
Friendship.

258
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:57,283
Yeah!
You see, look at me, how tough I am.

259
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,885
Si Bo is my good brother.

260
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,023
If there's a problem between you two,

261
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,113
I'm between the both of you.

262
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,180
It's very hard for me.

263
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:06,977
Cheng Erluo.

264
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,048
Are we just friends?

265
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,390
Of course not.

266
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,392
Best friends.

267
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:15,476
Buddies.

268
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,697
Bestie.

269
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,191
Whichever it is.

270
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:31,971
What did you want to tell me?

271
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,748
Nothing.

272
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm not feeling well.

273
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,423
I'll go first.

274
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:42,776
Are you okay?

275
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,880
Waiter, pack it up, pack it up!

276
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,250
Shu.

277
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:54,778
Come in.

278
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:00,701
Why did you finish your meal this early?

279
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:03,363
How was it? Did you tell Cheng Erluo?

280
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,148
Is he very excited?
Until he couldn't speak a word?

281
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,929
I didn't say anything.

282
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,219
Why? Come in first.

283
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,150
Sit.

284
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,785
Why?

285
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:22,983
I knew you would ask me,

286
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,610
so I came here immediately
from the restaurant.

287
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,036
What happened? Tell me.

288
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,161
I think...

289
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:35,349
Cheng Erluo doesn't want
to be in a relationship right now.

290
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,297
I think I have to reconsider
our relationship.

291
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,144
Think? About what?

292
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,742
Did he bully you?
I'll teach him a lesson for you!

293
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:44,374
Please don't, Xia Rui.

294
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,643
I came here just to tell you…

295
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:52,141
If you see him,
please don't tell him about this.

296
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,673
And don't tell Nan Xi either.

297
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,496
Are you sure about this?

298
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,615
Growing up,

299
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:08,207
I've been taken care of and
had everything organized by my parents.

300
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,850
Even had you protecting me at school.

301
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:15,254
My life seems a bit too smooth.

302
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:21,845
So smooth that I don't know what I like,
that I don't know what life has given me.

303
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:27,331
But whether if it's yours
or what you have in life, it's all yours.

304
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:30,126
It's not the same.

305
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:35,942
Just like how I grew up with mom and dad
behind the stage.

306
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,665
Like I should be an actor without a doubt.

307
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,896
Cheng Erluo has been by my side
since childhood.

308
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:47,057
I seem to have fallen for him,
as if it was the right thing to do.

309
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,610
Today he asked me,

310
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,039
do we even need
to explain our relationship?

311
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,725
I was a little unclear at that time.

312
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:58,339
Do I like him, or am I used to him?

313
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,238
So I think I should think about it now.

314
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:07,265
But about what it? Of course you like him.

315
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,337
I hope so.

316
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,273
Xia Rui, I'm back.

317
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,857
I better be going.

318
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,361
-Promise me, don't say anything.
-Okay, I won't.

319
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,853
-Okay.
-Nan Xi, I'm leaving now.

320
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,932
-Okay.
-Bye bye.

321
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:29,010
Don't need to send me out.

322
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,097
What happened to Zhao Yishu?

323
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:38,278
She was…

324
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,506
Nothing.

325
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,808
Are you tired today?

326
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,936
A little.

327
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,317
What?

328
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:54,819
Why?

329
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:02,554
Exhausted?

330
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:09,626
Nan Xi.

331
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,612
Don't move. Let me hug you for a while.

332
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,639
Why? Are you using me as a charger?

333
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:19,615
Recovering blood and charge.

334
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,384
Shu was right.

335
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:24,186
You boys are childish.

336
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,592
Yes.

337
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,037
Yes, indeed.

338
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:31,452
Xia Rui.

339
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,488
Are you tired from memorizing vocabulary?

340
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,960
Not tired. I want to try my best.

341
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:20,119
Hand in hand.

342
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:23,564
One step, two steps three four steps,
looking at the sky.

343
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:28,571
Looking at the stars aligning into a line.

344
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:35,003
Shut up! Don't move!

345
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:47,124
Yufei! It's me! It's me!

346
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,410
Yang Yufei!

347
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,548
Yufei, I didn't mean to yell at you.

348
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:56,675
It's okay now, okay?

349
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:58,934
I'm here.

350
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:04,152
-Don't go. Don't go!
-I won't go, I won't go.

351
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,986
I will not go. I'll just be here.
I'll stay with you.

352
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,749
I'm not going anywhere.

353
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,833
Give me your phone.

354
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,505
This is my number.

355
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,533
If you are going home alone in the future,
you just call me.

356
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:31,161
I will go with you, okay?

357
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:32,608
I'll always be with you.

358
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,968
You are...

359
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,339
my friend.

360
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,631
I, Binzi won't let anyone bully my friend.

361
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,015
It's okay.

362
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,387
Are you feeling better?

363
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:55,614
Then I'll take you back.

364
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,429
Let's go.

365
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,521
Come. I'll drive you home.

366
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:14,685
You can hold on to my clothes.

367
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:19,294
Let's go.

368
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,729
If you can't sit still,
then just put your hands on me.

369
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,949
Rest assured.
I don't mean to take advantage of you.

370
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,874
I just think it's too dark,
I'm afraid to knock you off.

371
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:34,367
Actually today, I should've sent that kid
to the police station.

372
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,341
I'm telling you. Not that I'm bragging.

373
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:40,228
What Ermei clan, Wudang clan,
Huashan clan?

374
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,260
I have no problem taking them down.

375
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,234
Ermei? Isn't Ermei a female clan?

376
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:48,471
Doesn't matter male or female clan,
it's all written in the novels.

377
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:52,345
As long as you can beat bad guys,
catch thieves, then it's a good clan.

378
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,141
I'm fine, thank you.

379
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,549
I was just a little scared earlier.

380
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,708
Yufei, don't worry.

381
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:01,660
You don't need to be scared
as long as I'm here.

382
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,024
And don't be too moved.

383
00:23:03,104 --> 00:23:04,859
I'm simply a very righteous person.

384
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:09,508
Then…

385
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:12,535
Mr. righteous Egg Yolk Clan Schoolmate.

386
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:17,191
If you drive at this speed,
I'm not going to reach the dorm in time.

387
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm just afraid you'll fall.

388
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:22,379
Or your bike couldn't speed up?

389
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,996
I really hate people provoking me!
Speeding up!

390
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:38,152
Your school is quite big.

391
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,076
University students are pretty happy.

392
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,788
Liu Bin, let me ask you a question.

393
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:50,217
Have you ever thought of
taking the university entrance exam again?

394
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:55,833
Forget it. I definitely can't.
Forget it. Forget it.

395
00:23:55,913 --> 00:24:00,556
I remember your results
were only slightly lower than Xia Rui's.

396
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:05,514
That means, you're only this close
to getting into Binhai Business School.

397
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,637
How did you know my exam results?

398
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:12,657
Aren't our results on the ChengHua Board?

399
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,666
I just simply took a look.
Just good memory.

400
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:19,557
Then, do you want me
to go to Binhai Business School?

401
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:22,007
Well, how about you? Do you want to go?

402
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:26,434
I'm lying if I say I don't want to.
Also when I was working at Yami,

403
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,348
most of the customers over there
are university students.

404
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:32,108
I was quite envious when I heard them
talking about the school.

405
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:35,676
It is the taste of failing. So painful.
I don't want to experience it again.

406
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:37,640
Actually you have many strengths.

407
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,660
You just didn't realize it yourself.

408
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:44,348
You are meticulous, patient,
quick minded as well.

409
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,205
So if you want to do it, it can be done.

410
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,865
Are those words really describing me?

411
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:54,741
From other people's mouth,
I'm a bad student.

412
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:57,638
Love to fight. Grumpy. Explosive.

413
00:24:57,718 --> 00:24:58,954
That's not explosive.

414
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,544
That's righteousness.
You are sentimental.

415
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:05,851
So you think I can?

416
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,924
Yes, I think you can.

417
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:12,480
We're here.

418
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:16,734
Thank you for sending me home today.

419
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:18,985
Bye.

420
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:20,147
Hey, Yufei.

421
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:23,307
Thank you.

422
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,951
No one has ever said those things to me.

423
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:27,689
Thanks for what?

424
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,533
I should be thanking you.

425
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,702
Thanks for rescuing me today.

426
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:35,231
I hope I can see you at Binhai University
in the coming year.

427
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,300
That's a promise.

428
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,501
Promise.

429
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,074
Bye.

430
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:58,492
I heard the latest news.

431
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:00,083
The designing contest.

432
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,711
The great Nan Xi has also participated.

433
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,708
I've already heard about it.

434
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:08,863
Then the game will be interesting.

435
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,112
At that time,
I'll do a comprehensive in-depth report.

436
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:15,187
Especially with the first-hand information
of the great Nan Xi.

437
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:19,171
This time I want to dominate
the gossip forum of the school papers.

438
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,268
Let me interview you.

439
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:31,156
Do you have confidence
going against Nan Xi in this competition?

440
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,428
Nothing to do with you.

441
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,000
How can this have nothing to do with me?

442
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,551
That Nan Xi and you are a big deal!

443
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:42,995
That's the architecture school battle
between the top two.

444
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:46,776
Besides, isn't it also an
internal friendly match between dormmates?

445
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:50,711
Anyhow, I can't say
it has nothing to do with you, right?

446
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,770
But this time
it's not necessarily predictable.

447
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,707
Yesterday Nan Xi was still chasing
the deadline for registration.

448
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:59,345
Now the public display of work
is only less than a month.

449
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,357
I'm really worried for Nan Xi.

450
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:06,111
Do not worry. The great Nan Xi
wouldn't sign up if he wasn't confident.

451
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,474
That's true.

452
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,206
Nan Xi.

453
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,942
Control your dormmates.
Don't let them bother me.

454
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:26,973
Since the independent
students' enrollment,

455
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:28,459
you have always been number one.

456
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:29,689
This competition,

457
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,183
I will definitely win.

458
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,105
Good luck.

459
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,432
A true God.

460
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,960
That boldness, that steadiness.

461
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,682
Are you always that arrogant?

462
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,698
Not seeing anyone else but you?

463
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,415
No.

464
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:51,247
Or, although you are always number one,
you don't care about the result at all.

465
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:56,256
This time, I care.

466
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:58,891
Then, why are you cheering for me?

467
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,092
Just being polite.

468
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:05,971
How about we leave now?

469
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,466
Feels like blood will be split any time.

470
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,309
Okay.

471
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:13,249
Hope we can do our best this time.

472
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,099
Your time is running out. Good luck.

473
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:18,217
I will.

474
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:14,145
Nan Xi, how's the search for the wood?

475
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,281
It's not going well?

476
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,507
Would you like to talk to me about it?

477
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:51,759
First impression?

478
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:54,469
That's the theme
of this year's competition?

479
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:56,025
Yes.

480
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:00,243
But what's most beautiful in life
isn't the first impression.

481
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:03,302
It's our understanding
and tolerance together.

482
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:10,283
But these two pieces of wood
don't seem to be perfect.

483
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:12,495
Is it intentional?

484
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,618
Yes,

485
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,705
just as imperfect as we are.

486
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:19,524
Us.

487
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:21,370
Us?

488
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,334
When we are together,

489
00:30:26,683 --> 00:30:28,009
we're perfect.

490
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:34,811
So you mean,
the most beautiful thing in life...

491
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:37,157
isn't the first impression's rush.

492
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:39,765
But the romance
in getting to know each other?

493
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:44,502
Two pieces of basswood
shouldn't be together at all.

494
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:47,162
But they tried their best to be together.

495
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:48,969
Living the most beautiful life.

496
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,994
Just like us. Right?

497
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,690
That's right.

498
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:57,685
So the most important thing is
to find the two suitable pieces of wood.

499
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:03,192
I'll go look with you tomorrow, okay?

500
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:07,933
We will definitely find them.

501
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:13,125
Miss, you came to the right shop.

502
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,425
In all of Binhai, there's nothing
you can't find at our shop.

503
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:19,138
Look at the craft work of this wood.

504
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:29,187
As you can see, so much wood.

505
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:30,966
Look around.

506
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:33,065
Which one is more suitable for you?

507
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:35,149
Then we can both suggest our offers.

508
00:31:36,173 --> 00:31:38,135
-All around, good business.
-Sure, just a moment.

509
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:40,492
What do you think? Anything you like?

510
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:44,335
Boss, how about this?

511
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:47,952
We'll think about it back home
and contact you if we need anything.

512
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:52,235
Well, I've been serving you
for a long time, taking you around.

513
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:54,788
I'm thirsty, losing my voice here!

514
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,150
Very sorry. It's just that
we have to think about it, isn't it?

515
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,394
We'll go back and think.
We'll call you if we need anything, okay?

516
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:01,533
Thank you, thank you.

517
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:04,024
-I can give a discount!
-Thank you, thank you.

518
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,270
These kids.

519
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:11,951
Those more realistic wood that you want,
should be here. Take a look.

520
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,584
Should be able to find it, right?

521
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,288
I'll help you look.

522
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:44,608
What are you doing?

523
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,905
Let me climb. Which one do you want?

524
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,362
Be careful.

525
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:53,064
You be careful.

526
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:01,221
Pass me the knife.

527
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:03,899
Let me help you up there.

528
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,353
Don't climb too high.

529
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,610
Be careful.

530
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:19,973
Somebody's coming. What are you doing?

531
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:21,654
-What are you doing?
-Come down! Quick!

532
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:25,027
Stop!

533
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:39,373
-Are you two really students?
-We are really students.

534
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:43,283
We just came
to find the things for him to make.

535
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:47,254
The kind of wood to participate
in a competition. Nothing else.

536
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,472
I've watched the surveillance video.
You didn't really do anything.

537
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:51,263
But the trees here are only for viewing.

538
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:53,196
Without governmental approval,
it's impossible to use.

539
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:54,876
Not even cutting, or selling.

540
00:33:54,956 --> 00:33:57,268
Why don't you go somewhere else
to find what you want?

541
00:33:57,348 --> 00:33:58,820
Stop having this idea again, okay?

542
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,428
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

543
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:07,247
Unbelievable.

544
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,555
Where do we go next?

545
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:16,459
I know who to look for.

546
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,965
In Binhai, there's nowhere
that your Uncle Wang can't look for.

547
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,174
Let's go!

548
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:40,891
Uncle Wang, what is this place?

549
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,222
Don't underestimate this place.

550
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:45,964
It's the biggest root carving market
in Binhai.

551
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,486
If you need wood most of them are here.

552
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,343
Nan Xi, do you think this is the place?

553
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:56,958
Let's see. Look for it slowly.

554
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,549
Since you're here,
just go with your heart.

555
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,833
Here, there's nothing that
you can't look for, only the unimaginable.

556
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,181
Thank you, Uncle Wang.
It's too much trouble for you.

557
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:09,773
Just a small matter.

558
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:11,147
Since President Ren arranged this,

559
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:14,330
I will do my best
to help you find what you want.

560
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:17,369
How about this?

561
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,655
-Nan Xi what do you think?
-This wood is so big!

562
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:24,699
-Still not very satisfied.
-Not yet?

563
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:40,797
What kind of wood is this?

564
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,529
Be careful.

565
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,148
This is it.

566
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:07,589
These two?

567
00:36:09,312 --> 00:36:11,459
These two pieces of rotten wood?

568
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,159
The reason why these two pieces of wood
were abandoned,

569
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,278
it's because they have irregular shapes.

570
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:19,412
But in fact they came from the same tree.

571
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:20,959
Same tree.

572
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,337
What kind of tree is this?

573
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,610
It's a tree connected by root.

574
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,665
This piece is the south part.

575
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:28,426
This piece is the east.

576
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:30,053
All deviated from the main root.

577
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:34,049
Same but different.

578
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:40,331
But is this in line with our theme?

579
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,539
You can even see that?

580
00:36:43,112 --> 00:36:45,270
This son of President Ren,

581
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,558
is really remarkable.

582
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:52,054
Uncle Wang, I want to ask something.
Is the wood for sale?

583
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:56,022
Of course not.
Besides, these are all rotten wood.

584
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,137
Better than giving it out for free.

585
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,542
You just settle it here. Stay here.

586
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:01,635
I'll go talk to them.

587
00:37:01,715 --> 00:37:04,083
-Okay, thank you, Uncle Wang.
-You're welcome.

588
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,325
Nan Xi.

589
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:16,015
How long do you think these two pieces
of wood have been together?

590
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:19,747
About 10 years or so.

591
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:22,239
Then how long do you think...

592
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:24,384
they were together
when they were still trees?

593
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:28,327
About 360 years.

594
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:31,385
Just 360 years?

595
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:35,934
But I want to be with you forever.

596
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,393
I want to be with you forever too.
