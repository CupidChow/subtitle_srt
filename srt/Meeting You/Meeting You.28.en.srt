00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:37,325
=Meeting You=

2
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,325
-Straight to the point.
-Correct.

3
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,284
Okay, okay, my turn.
Place your bet.

4
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:49,201
Here, here.

5
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,265
Clear.

6
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:01,015
-Duck?
-It's close, close, very close.

7
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,666
Pheasant?

8
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,202
-No.
-What are you drawing?

9
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:06,405
It's too abstract, Xia Rui.

10
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:09,386
Ugly duckling.

11
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:12,525
Beautiful!

12
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:15,123
Again, again, again.

13
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:22,302
This.

14
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:23,974
Cheers.

15
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:25,791
That's the one.

16
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,792
What?

17
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,669
I'm not convinced!
Come, come.

18
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:31,711
Again, again.

19
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:35,546
Got it.

20
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,516
This, bang bang.

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,433
Landmine.

22
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:48,715
Boom.

23
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:51,436
Mere paper talk.

24
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:53,070
Beautiful, beautiful.

25
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,827
Nan Xi, you're cheating, right?

26
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:56,660
You can understand her drawing like that?

27
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,380
Who said it's ugly?

28
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,731
-It's obviously pretty good.
-Correct.

29
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:01,654
It's obviously good.

30
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:02,571
That's right.

31
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,712
Love makes people blind.

32
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,379
Okay, Xia Rui. It's Nan Xi's turn.

33
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:13,060
You draw one.

34
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,218
Place your bet.

35
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,023
Nan Xi.

36
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,480
It doesn't have to be so detailed.

37
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,963
How can we guess?

38
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:46,700
This is...

39
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,830
Exhaustion?

40
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:51,579
Given up on love.

41
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:53,988
All wrong.

42
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:59,364
Exhausted?

43
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:00,378
Yes.

44
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,432
-Nan Xi.
-Okay, don't move.

45
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:09,526
Let me hug for a while.

46
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,059
Why? Using me as a charger?

47
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,554
Yes.

48
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:16,300
Charging and rejuvenating.

49
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:21,150
Shu was right, guys are childish.

50
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,264
I am childish.

51
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:30,189
Power bank.

52
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:33,596
Yes.

53
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,091
=Episode 28=
(Thank you for meeting me)

54
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,613
Gao Ting, Gao Ting.
Damn this Gao Ting.

55
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:50,530
I...

56
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,128
No, how did you know?

57
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:57,178
I have a junior in the student union
who is responsible for this award.

58
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:59,913
The email Gao Ting sent to student union,

59
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:02,654
is the same email address that he used
to submit his design draft.

60
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,632
Otherwise, why is it that
we are unable to find this person?

61
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,445
Also, Gao Ting never keep in touch
with anyone in the department.

62
00:05:10,147 --> 00:05:11,579
No one has his contact information.

63
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:14,197
You tell me.
Don't judge a book by its cover.

64
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,413
This brat, how can he be second place
in the school of architecture?

65
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,345
Screw him and his second place, really.

66
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,436
-This kind of person...
-Do me a favor.

67
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,941
Invite Gao Ting here to see me.

68
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,651
Why do you still want to see him?

69
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:26,783
Do you want to chat to him?

70
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,282
Have a heart to heart talk with him?

71
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,119
Just let the school
handle people like him.

72
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:34,372
Wait a second.

73
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,879
No, why don't we just expel him?

74
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:41,431
What do we tell him?
What else is there to say, right?

75
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:42,526
I'm furious.

76
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,531
If he framed Nan Xi this time,
he'll definitely frame others next time.

77
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:46,448
Xia Rui.

78
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:47,843
Take a look at this.

79
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,670
This is his previous design draft.

80
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:00,031
And these are his work
after the plagiarism case.

81
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,632
The difference is too huge.

82
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,375
Design diagram is the inner portrayal
of a designer.

83
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,738
That's why I want to talk to him.

84
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,332
And then what?

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,728
Then you can blow his head.

86
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,749
No, why?

87
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,319
Why would such words
come out of your mouth?

88
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,132
Maybe because I spent too much time
with you.

89
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,111
What is this called again? It's called...

90
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,322
bad influence.

91
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:37,310
You're saying I'm bad?

92
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,037
Come here.

93
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,584
Come here.

94
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:44,385
Come here.

95
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,514
Quick.

96
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,641
How dare you say I'm bad.

97
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,789
Let me tell you,
this is called good influence.

98
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,093
-Bad influence.
-Good Influence.

99
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,965
-Bad influence.
-Good Influence.

100
00:06:58,605 --> 00:06:59,470
I'm neutral.

101
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:01,090
-Bad influence.
-Good Influence.

102
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,215
Die.

103
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,532
Die.

104
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:25,390
You.

105
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:27,940
Where's rat poison?

106
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:30,642
Okay, that's enough! My goodness!

107
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,790
Thank goodness Nan Xi asked me
to monitor you here.

108
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:34,766
Otherwise, Gao Ting might be dead already.

109
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,069
Go away, go away.

110
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:44,369
Coffee.

111
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,793
You tricked me out,
what do you want to say to me?

112
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,587
This is the email you used
to submit the draft to the magazine club.

113
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,708
I don't understand what you're saying.

114
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:15,272
I know, you framed me for plagiarism.

115
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,605
I just want to know the reason.

116
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:18,952
There's no reason.

117
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:20,927
There's no reason.

118
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,166
That means you admit it.

119
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,752
So what if I did it?

120
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,457
Go ahead and expose me then.

121
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,229
Why do you look for me?

122
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,194
To humiliate me?

123
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,031
Or want to hear my confession?

124
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:37,257
I tell you what.

125
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,083
Dream on.

126
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,709
This is between you and I.

127
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,824
So it should be solved by us.

128
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,257
Here we go again.

129
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:53,742
Acting like it doesn't matter.

130
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,473
It's the superior attitude again.

131
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:01,996
Again. And again.

132
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:10,057
What I hate the most
is your self-righteousness.

133
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:13,352
Don't go, don't go.

134
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,471
Don't you want to know why?

135
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,086
Okay, I'll tell you why.

136
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:21,720
Because I am upset with you.

137
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,167
Because you stole all my spotlight.

138
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,532
You make me feel like a mediocre,
because of you!

139
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,732
I can no longer see myself anymore!

140
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,243
Is this reason enough?

141
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,957
All this time,
everyone said I was a genius.

142
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,563
So, I should be number one.

143
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:38,676
But since I met you,

144
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:40,444
I am nothing.

145
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,071
I've also tried to be your friend.

146
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:46,218
But you? Right. Just like that.

147
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,852
Acting superior, disdainful,
looking down on me.

148
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:53,486
Gao Ting.

149
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,991
Just because of this?

150
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:58,021
Just because of this?

151
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:03,126
Does others' failure mean nothing to you?

152
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,291
This matter ends here.

153
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,269
What do you mean?

154
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:13,808
You won't expose me?

155
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,899
All I want is innocence.

156
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,725
I never thought about blaming
or punishing anyone.

157
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:24,567
Tell me.

158
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:25,964
What do you want exactly?

159
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:27,994
If I expose you,

160
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,633
you will get blamed
and badmouthed by many.

161
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,464
What does that have to do with you?

162
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,100
The feeling of being talked
behind my back...

163
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:39,713
I experienced it.

164
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:50,776
Nan Xi.

165
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:53,908
Actually you and I...

166
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:55,159
There's no you and I.

167
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:09,571
Just pretend we never knew each other.

168
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,770
After being verified by our agency,

169
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,522
the design work published
in the second half of October 2017...

170
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:31,818
was designed by Binhai University
Architecture student, Nan Xi.

171
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:36,322
We hereby explain
and sincerely apologize to Nan Xi...

172
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,925
for failing to verify the author
of the work in time.

173
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,314
Nan Xi is innocent!

174
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:50,926
Don't be nervous.

175
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,624
I'm just outside.

176
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:58,277
Remember to thank a lot of people,
Professor Gu, and the organizer.

177
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,220
-And...
-Alright.

178
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,816
I remember, don't worry.

179
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,733
Okay.

180
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,171
Xia Rui,
what kind of life do you yearn for?

181
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,710
Why ask this kind of question now?

182
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:17,874
I want to know.

183
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:26,323
The life I yearn for
is to be with the person I love.

184
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:28,126
And become a barista.

185
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,818
And have my own coffee shop.

186
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:44,176
Don't worry.

187
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,128
I will help to make your dreams come true.

188
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:52,613
Let's invite the winner
of this competition, Nan Xi on stage.

189
00:12:59,017 --> 00:12:59,850
Hurry up.

190
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:01,665
Quick.

191
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,867
Hi everyone, I am Nan Xi.

192
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,940
You must be aware
of what happened some time ago.

193
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:18,801
So.

194
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,744
This glory did not come easily.

195
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,122
I want to thank my friends.

196
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:32,087
And my inspiration, Xia Rui.

197
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:42,618
Without you guys,
there would not be this moment.

198
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:45,536
I nearly got disqualified.

199
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,093
So, I will cherish my profession.

200
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:49,718
Thank you.

201
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,562
You want to be romantic but you
want me to accompany you in the cold.

202
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,058
Doesn't that make you look good?

203
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:18,471
Aren't you both together already?
Why are you nervous?

204
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,916
-I get nervous when I see her.
-Here she comes, Teacher Yang!

205
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:22,544
Good to see you.

206
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,900
Why are you outside?

207
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:26,389
Roses for you.

208
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:28,512
Teacher Yang.

209
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:31,385
You sure are strict.

210
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,457
Look at how scared Yi is of you.

211
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,486
Still do such things at this age.

212
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,159
Both of you are so sweet.

213
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:41,907
Here, here, look who's here.

214
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:44,735
Coach Yang!

215
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,294
Long time no see.

216
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,643
How many years has it been
since graduation?

217
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:52,656
Still afraid of her?

218
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,225
No, she'll always be my teacher,
don't you understand?

219
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:56,324
Don't go.

220
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:59,281
-Then I think I won't go out.
-Xia Rui.

221
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:01,589
Cheng Erluo, Zhao Yishu.

222
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,174
All grown up.

223
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:06,915
And prettier.

224
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:08,269
And more handsome.

225
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:12,020
Yi, not bad.

226
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:16,351
All the talented in our class
are doing free labor for you here.

227
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,585
How could you say that?

228
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:22,194
Xia Rui,
is the most famous barista in our cafe.

229
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:24,549
And she's going to further her studies
in Italy soon.

230
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,466
Amazing, right?

231
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,315
Cheng Erluo,
is our new basketball star in Binhai.

232
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,611
And the best is our Zhang Yishu.

233
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:38,885
This, this is the best actress.

234
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:42,388
All here, acting as our live mascot,
no kidding at all.

235
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,319
Good, very good!

236
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:45,236
Applaud.

237
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:48,945
That's right.

238
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:52,539
I remember you are a group of four.

239
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,609
Why are there only three now?

240
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,653
Where's Nan Xi?

241
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,522
Teacher Hu.

242
00:15:58,982 --> 00:15:59,815
Nan Xi.

243
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:07,933
Still looking so fine.

244
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:10,451
And grown a bit, too.

245
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,529
You don't hide anymore?

246
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,170
Xia Rui.

247
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,367
Is this still the Nan Xi I know?

248
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:31,284
Of course!

249
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,775
Teacher Hu, thank you.

250
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:39,195
And of course each and every one of you.

251
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:41,578
If I didn't meet you,

252
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,764
my life would have been full of darkness.

253
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,964
Like a lonely boat, drifting alone.

254
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,701
Never to see land.

255
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:56,895
Until I met you.

256
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,395
Until I met you.

257
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,911
Xia Rui.

258
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,138
Like a lighthouse,

259
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:08,483
you appeared before me without warning.

260
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:16,300
You let me see the light again
and feel the warmth of light.

261
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:23,049
You dragged me into this world forcefully,
allowed me to hear laughter.

262
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:26,167
Strange and yet so kind.

263
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:31,117
All of these,
should be arrangements of fate.

264
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,960
How lucky it is for me to meet you again.

265
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:39,192
You let me know tears can also be sweet.

266
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:43,176
All I need is courage,

267
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,540
to love, to run, to open the shackles,

268
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:52,686
to hug those waiting at the end.

269
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,072
To feel the joy that comes with it.

270
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,949
I drifted across the sea, like a boat.

271
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,232
Finally found land, thanks to you.

272
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:08,587
And met spring.

273
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:14,010
Xia Rui, happy 18th birthday as an adult!

274
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:18,159
Nan Xi, happy 18th birthday as an adult!

275
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:26,077
I know, spring belongs to us.

276
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:31,355
I know, spring belongs to us.

277
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:39,078
There's brightness in my world,
thanks to you.

278
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:43,547
I have love, because I have you.

279
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:54,093
I just want to protect you in this world.

280
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,846
Protect our home.

281
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,885
And the secrets that only belong to us.

282
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:03,162
All of these,

283
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,764
are still the same as we first met.

284
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:12,921
But now I hope I can do my best
to be your safe haven.

285
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:17,581
I want you to know, I am here.

286
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:19,872
Don't be afraid.

287
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,504
I will be a better me for you.

288
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:32,644
There's nothing better
than meeting you.

289
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,343
Having you now.

290
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:40,750
Having you for the rest of my life.

291
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,480
Senior, you're willing to act as cameo
in our graduation drama,

292
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:29,712
we're so happy.

293
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,284
Yes, senior, you're so busy, but you're
always responsive to our requests.

294
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,234
Thank you.

295
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,867
Are you shooting a new Director Chen
movie with Qiaochen recently?

296
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:37,803
Is Qiaochen handsome?

297
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:41,404
Handsome? Is he as handsome as me?

298
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:42,813
Why are you here?

299
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:44,760
Hi, brother-in-law!

300
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,269
What kind of weird nickname is this?

301
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:51,667
I asked them to call me that to reflect
your importance at home as my wife.

302
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,851
I'm just a sidekick.

303
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,881
Thank you juniors, goodbye.

304
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,049
Goodbye seniors!

305
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,710
No improvements in basketball skills
at all in recent years,

306
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,488
but getting better in sweet talking.

307
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:07,256
My basketball skill are on the same level
as keeping my wife happy.

308
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,740
Last night we even won JiangZhouRuiXing
by 30 points.

309
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:12,956
If we get re-elected
as the most valuable team this year,

310
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,277
the trophy is still my wife's.

311
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:20,089
I've told you not to call me "wife"
in public, who agreed to marry you?

312
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,587
If you continue to behave immaturely
in front of Xia Rui and Nan Xi later,

313
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:24,754
I'll make you pay.

314
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:26,695
I was wrong, I was wrong.

315
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:28,398
Okay, let's go.

316
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,218
Sorry for waiting.

317
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,437
I'm not used to seeing you
with a backpack.

318
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:41,005
I wonder who's the one
who asked me to apply to university?

319
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:43,077
I got accepted but you ran away.

320
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,597
Which is why I look for you
once I returned.

321
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:47,477
Okay, okay.

322
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:49,349
My diplomat Yang.

323
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:55,274
I got accepted earlier than you,
so you have to call me senior.

324
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,644
Who calls their own girlfriend senior?

325
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:07,693
I brought you this.

326
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,635
Every time I try to do something...

327
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:17,534
Let's go.

328
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,214
-Xia Rui, slow down.
-Binhai, my Binhai.

329
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,314
I am back finally.

330
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:42,613
You got out of the car so early,
it's still so far from home.

331
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:44,691
It's the smell of Binhai.

332
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:48,406
You haven't come back for so long.
Don't you miss it at all here?

333
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:52,475
I think you're just thinking
about the roasted sweet potato ahead.

334
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:56,469
How do you know
I want to eat roasted sweet potato?

335
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:03,490
Quick,

336
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:05,782
I want to eat sweet potatoes,
and stinky tofu,

337
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:08,627
grilled fish, skewers, and...

338
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:09,576
And barbecue.

339
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,703
Barbecue? Let's go!

340
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:15,591
Uncle Wang.

341
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,128
It must have been tough.

342
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:22,755
It hasn't changed at all.

343
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:24,823
Welcome home.

344
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:26,573
Come in.

345
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,585
I just hired a cleaner
to clean up yesterday.

346
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:38,737
Uncle Wang I can't believe
you're so thoughtful.

347
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:41,269
It's what I should do.

348
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:45,079
I think Nan Xi inherited
Sister Ren's good foresight in investment.

349
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:48,340
And entrusted me to buy this house
before going abroad last time.

350
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:50,382
That was such a wise move.

351
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,451
Do you know how much
is this house worth now?

352
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:53,394
How much?

353
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,293
Average 60,000.

354
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,709
60,000?

355
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:03,710
If you sell this now,
I can at least help you get this amount.

356
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:07,550
Uncle Wang, this house is for us,
not for sale.

357
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:11,211
For yourself, that's good.

358
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,691
Okay, now it's back to its owner.

359
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:20,056
Although you are all adults now,
but I still want to say this, in Binhai...

360
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,921
We will find Uncle Wang if we need help.

361
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,317
Correct.

362
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:27,705
There's no problem unsolvable
by Uncle Wang in Binhai, I'll go now.

363
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:30,291
-Get some rest.
-Uncle Wang.

364
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:33,576
Thank you for looking
after the house for us.

365
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:36,785
A piece of cake.

366
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:43,400
This house and some of its furnishings
are really important to us.

367
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,550
Got it. I know, don't I?

368
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,055
Uncle Wang was once young, alright?

369
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:58,500
But to be honest, I watched you grow up,
return from abroad and still so happy.

370
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,173
I feel happy for you
from the bottom of my heart.

371
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:04,793
Get some rest, I'm leaving.

372
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,655
-You've worked hard uncle Wang.
-Goodbye.

373
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:10,653
We're back Nan Xi, are you happy?

374
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:13,526
Nothing has changed.

375
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,580
Come here.

376
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,847
You're worried that uncle sold something?

377
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,298
Xia Rui, welcome home.

378
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,226
Welcome home, Nan Xi.

379
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:42,568
Shouldn't we celebrate?

380
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,779
It's all set.

381
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,637
I mean now.

382
00:25:47,836 --> 00:25:50,036
Chubby Cheng will be over in a bit.

383
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,146
They will be here anytime, Nan Xi.

384
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:08,222
You said to celebrate.

385
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:09,790
Don't regret it later.

386
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:38,399
So many years has passed,
I can finally eat Nan Xi's dishes again.

387
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,067
It's been so many years
I'm so used to his food.

388
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:43,890
Obviously, you said that
because you're being oblivious.

389
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:44,878
You're right.

390
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:47,349
You're just being jealous
because you didn't get to eat it.

391
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:52,269
No, no, why am I jealous?
I'm eating these in front of you now!

392
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:56,858
What are you doing? Rushing it.
What will others eat later? Just wait.

393
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:57,778
No way,

394
00:26:57,863 --> 00:27:00,905
I need to have some now to show
that I have different status than others.

395
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:05,262
Don't finish the dish,
otherwise there's nothing left for Yi.

396
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:09,193
Yi is coming? Is Coach Yang coming too?

397
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:12,156
Why? You're a professional player now.

398
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,687
And you're still afraid of high school
physical education teacher?

399
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:18,273
Are you kidding?
Do you think I'm like your Liu Bin?

400
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:21,437
Afraid of his teacher his whole life?

401
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:22,863
What does this have to do with me?

402
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:25,832
I was tortured by them these two years,
I already got used to it.

403
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:29,758
Speaking of Yi, his cafe has been closed
for quite a long time.

404
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:31,717
Where does he has the time
to manage the cafe?

405
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:36,851
Yi said he's coming over later
to discuss his wedding with us.

406
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:40,040
He wants to propose to Coach Yang,
so he wants our opinion.

407
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:42,911
He wants to surprise Coach Yang, surprise.

408
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:46,850
Hi, can I know who is Xia Rui?

409
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:47,884
Me, me, me.

410
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,850
-Your cake.
-Thank you.

411
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:51,926
You're welcome.

412
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,091
Come here, help me.

413
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:56,467
Chopsticks, chopsticks.

414
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:01,752
From your dear Yi.

415
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,795
Hurry up and see what's Yi's agenda.

416
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:11,495
My dear children,
sorry to keep you waiting.

417
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:15,590
Unfortunately I am unable
to meet up with you this time.

418
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:19,168
But I do have a few words from the
bottom of my heart for all of you here.

419
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:22,073
After looking for love my whole life,

420
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:25,114
I finally found the love of my life,
Yang Shengnan.

421
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:27,493
We promised to spend
the rest of our lives together.

422
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:29,674
We've walked a long way
and it wasn't easy.

423
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,396
You need to know
there aren't many lucky people...

424
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,667
who get to marry their loved one.

425
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:36,606
Fortunately, I never gave up.
Fortunately, she likes me.

426
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,721
The dream of my life
is to travel around the world.

427
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:46,562
My dream is now to travel the world
with Shengnan after I met her.

428
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:50,771
I suddenly realised
this is not the wedding we want.

429
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:51,891
And then?

430
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:58,930
I think we should have a travel wedding,
witness love while realizing our dreams.

431
00:28:59,014 --> 00:29:01,163
This is the wedding we really wanted.

432
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:05,845
So, I left,
left together with your teacher Yang.

433
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:06,762
What?

434
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:08,444
Where are they going?

435
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:10,708
He didn't write it down.

436
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,131
This Yi is so unreliable.

437
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:14,932
He said he'll discuss the wedding with us,
how can he leave first?

438
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:15,984
Anything else?

439
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,390
I love you all, Yi.

440
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,300
So cheesy.

441
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,213
Who loves him?

442
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,596
There's one more part.

443
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,514
Xia Rui, I want to tell you something.

444
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:29,312
You are the most talented
and diligent barista I've seen.

445
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:32,816
I don't know
when we will meet again next time.

446
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,411
Yami Cafe is currently closed,
why don't you takeover?

447
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:40,442
If you don't mind,
I'll entrust my cafe to you,

448
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:42,977
and I hope you can pass on my spirit.

449
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,564
Why does the last part sounds like a will?

450
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:49,736
How can you say that?

451
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,370
Travel wedding is so romantic.

452
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,287
Yes.

453
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:54,486
That's right,

454
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:56,609
I haven't eaten anything
since I got off the plane today.

455
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,736
Why don't we eat something first?

456
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,211
Yes, yes.
Didn't we say we're going to party?

457
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:04,127
How did it get so boring
after we graduated, right?

458
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,902
Yi already prepared the party for us.

459
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,526
Already prepared?

460
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:14,154
You started it first.

461
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:22,357
For many years we imagined,
what we'd look like when we grow up.

462
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:27,173
At this moment it's so much
better than what we had imagined.

463
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,310
Time seems to stop on us.

464
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:33,197
Zhao Yishu is still beautiful.

465
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,702
Chubby Cheng is still so unreliable.

466
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,622
Liubin is cool, and the proud Yufei.

467
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,523
Of course, there's my Nan Xi.
Echoing in the bottom of my heart.

468
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,329
Nan Xi who is running in joy and laughter.

469
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,540
I am grateful
for meeting all of you in my youth.

470
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:51,681
You guys take away the loneliness.

471
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:53,633
I'm grateful for the adult us.

472
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:56,881
We can still laugh like when we're young.

473
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,434
They say time flies when you have fun.

474
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:01,677
May we stay forever young.

475
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:04,985
But I believe,
as long you guys are here,

476
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,740
the future can only get better.

477
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:10,270
Look, I can't help but fantasize again.

478
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:11,885
Fantasizing...

479
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,992
Welcoming our 30s and 40s with laughter.

480
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:19,959
We'll grow old, but stay forever young.

481
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,989
I can't believe Yi really left this to me.

482
00:31:56,102 --> 00:31:58,101
This spot is reserved for you next time.

483
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,358
It can be your office desk
as an independent designer.

484
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:04,724
Boss, thank you.

485
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:08,417
You are so very welcome,
I have to rely on your face in the future.

486
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,538
But boss, I'm already taken.

487
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:20,000
I allow you to attract customers here.

488
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:25,540
Then boss, when shall we re-open?

489
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:28,165
Boss is experiencing jet lag.

490
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,513
A bit tired.

491
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:34,724
-Is there anything else you need, boss?
-Yes.

00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,051
Make me a cup of coffee.

493
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:40,970
Don't blame me if it tastes bad.

494
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:41,887
I won't.

495
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,114
Time really flies.

496
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:01,785
I remember the first time I met you,
it felt like yesterday.

497
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,733
Nan Xi.

498
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:09,897
Meeting you is the luckiest thing ever.

499
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,390
The lucky one should be me.

00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:18,475
Xia Rui,
thank you for letting me meet you.
