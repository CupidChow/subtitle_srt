1
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,625
I’m the rising little sun

2
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,600
Little sun

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,875
But the little sun wants to sleep

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,300
What do I do?

5
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,550
I want to sleep

6
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,475
I want to sleep

7
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:55,650
No

8
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,625
I have to study

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
Xia Rui

10
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,900
I have to study

11
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,000
Good

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Scholar-lord and straight A students

13
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,900
I can run faster than you

14
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,725
No, I got up earlier than you

15
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,575
Study slacker and poor students

16
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,200
I can always do better than you

17
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,550
What is this?

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,700
Let me see

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,825
Oh, my god

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,175
What do I see?

21
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,300
Good morning, Rui

22
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,700
Dear Shu

23
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,500
Dear Shu

24
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,650
Dear Shu. Oh, my God

25
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,600
I can’t believe I know so many words

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,250
in a model essay

27
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,675
I didn't expect Rui

28
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,350
can write a whole composition

29
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,575
I love you, Dear Shu

30
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,625
We’re in front of so many classmates

31
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,900
Stop it!

32
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,975
You’re so fat

33
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,450
Tell me your schedule

34
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,425
after the exam

35
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:24,375
Do you want to go to movies

36
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,025
or the amusement park?

37
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,450
Do you want to go to Pizza Hut or McDonald's?

38
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,050
All are on me!

39
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,775
If you don't want

40
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:30,425
any of these,

41
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,975
I’m also willing to contribute

42
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,675
my body…

43
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,675
Come on, Rui

44
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,700
Rui, what's wrong with you?

45
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,350
Are you bewildered?

46
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,600
What review materials?

47
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,475
Xia Rui

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Have you collected all English homework yesterday?

49
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:49,500
Don't worry, Mr. Hu

50
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,113
Five minutes later,

51
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,559
all homework would appear on your office desk

52
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,511
Just be ready!

53
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,375
Okay, I'll check later

54
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,792
Give me your homework quickly

55
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,438
Now!

56
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,456
Three, two, one

57
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:00,275
Give me now

58
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,035
Homework. Homework. Don't sleep. Get up

59
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:03,053
Stop chatting

60
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:03,757
Your homework

61
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:05,156
Stop checking. Give me now

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,678
Give me quickly

63
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:07,839
Your homework

64
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:09,837
Yours? I gave you

65
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:10,912
OK

66
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:13,319
Nan Xi

67
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:23,957
Good handwriting. Keep working on it

68
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,275
I need a break. You just continue

69
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:42,996
Who on earth is it?

70
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,040
Maybe a straight A student

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,886
Could it be?

72
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,017
I really can't imagine that

73
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,072
who has this love and time

74
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:54,395
The point is that he

75
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,536
didn't leave a name after doing a good thing

76
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,097
Don't overthink!

77
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,247
Maybe he just felt sorry for you

78
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,817
It's just the same case of

79
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:01,997
giving alms to handicapped people

80
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:02,796
on the roadside

81
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:04,452
As for why he didn't leave a name?

82
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,022
Maybe he just wanted to help you

83
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:07,392
but to know a study slacker

84
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,914
like you

85
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,741
It may be an accident

86
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:11,873
No

87
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,079
Okay. Okay. Okay.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,876
Dear Shu, what do you think?

89
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:20,751
I've examined this

90
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,273
review material carefully

91
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,594
I found he did so well

92
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:25,698
in these aspects,

93
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:27,772
the composition in particular in which simple words are used

94
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:29,133
It's completely tailor-made

95
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,351
for you

96
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:30,941
And

97
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,072
the review of the key points of the exam

98
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,357
is also very accurate

99
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:36,260
Look at the several templates in here

100
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,992
When you took the exam,

101
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,191
you can apply directly

102
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,437
And all of your difficulties will be solved

103
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,456
Really?

104
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:42,083
Is it so amazing?

105
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:44,556
The color is so vivid

106
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,555
The plate is so clear

107
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,637
Get off your dirty hands

108
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,084
I haven't asked you yet

109
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,034
Why not watch me play basketball?

110
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,318
We’re being Sherlock Holmes here

111
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,097
We saw you. You played very well

112
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:58,676
Sure enough

113
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,237
Who?

114
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,233
What have I done?

115
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,356
Exactly

116
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:06,792
You've done nothing at all

117
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,277
On what background does Dear Shu

118
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,637
become a fan of you?

119
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:12,634
Of course, it is because I’m handsome and play basketball well

120
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,956
Don't be flattered

121
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:17,896
Will you be scared

122
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:18,876
if I upload your photo

123
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,151
of fatso when you were small

124
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,073
to the group chat?

125
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:22,872
Alright. Alright. Alright

126
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,718
Let's continue being Sherlock Holmes

127
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,477
It must take a long time

128
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:29,999
to make such a review material

129
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,274
And it's

130
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:33,006
a cut-out and a binder

131
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:34,233
that's made of large piece of card paper

132
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,478
It's with good-looking contents

133
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:37,734
and drawing

134
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:39,514
It must have come from a skillful man

135
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:40,798
And

136
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,196
it’s about the monthly exam

137
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,117
Who has the free time to make these for you?

138
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,838
If there is indeed,

139
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,674
then it can be someone who

140
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:54,233
has spare time, doesn't have to take the monthly exam

141
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,106
and knows my grades

142
00:06:57,953 --> 00:06:58,591
Mr. Hu!

143
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,075
Probably

144
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:04,071
Maybe there’s a secret negotiation

145
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:07,316
between him and Madam Shao

146
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,191
Oh, my God

147
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:09,552
It sounds terrible

148
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,432
Such a kind helper

149
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:18,191
When can you help me?

150
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:18,876
Come on

151
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,636
You do well in examinations. You don't need, okay?

152
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:21,873
Yeah

153
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:22,796
Whatever

154
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,471
Take things as they come

155
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:25,679
With this,

156
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,191
I must do better in the monthly exam

157
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:28,638
Yeah

158
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:29,713
After the exam,

159
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:31,873
I'll find the kind helper

160
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:32,958
After finding him/her,

161
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,394
I'll thank him/her

162
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:38,315
It's a long break. Just go for training

163
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:38,838
Leave

164
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:41,673
Let's go over

165
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:42,796
Look

166
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,918
The knowledge points were made clear

167
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,516
There are many of them I didn't think of

168
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:47,592
Really?

169
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:53,320
My kind helper has made every endeavor

170
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:46,517
So

171
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:48,752
did the kind helper come back?

172
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:54,537
Expert

173
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,278
E-x-p-e-r-t, expert

174
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,514
Don't recite

175
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,635
The last-minute efforts can only make it worse

176
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,235
Listen

177
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,719
It's better than you who give up last-minute efforts

178
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,356
How to spell expert?

179
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,478
I’m fully prepared this time

180
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,876
So I'm not afraid of anything

181
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,674
You're more confident

182
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:12,558
with the help of the kind helper

183
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:13,967
But are you sure you have no problem

184
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,032
about this exam?

185
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,317
You need score more than ninety

186
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,078
No problem

187
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:18,553
I'm a little over confident now

188
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:19,352
Listen

189
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,874
I can't wait to enter the examination room right now

190
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:21,959
and the results can come out immediately

191
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,320
Thus I can give a blow to

192
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,033
Mr. Hu and Madam Shao

193
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,755
Thus they won't look down upon others

194
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:26,678
Great

195
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:27,792
That's the examination room

196
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,152
Let the light of wisdom shine

197
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:30,275
Shine

198
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:31,236
Bye bye

199
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,111
Bye

200
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:33,320
Go

201
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,115
Loser. Loser. Loser

202
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:38,676
You're a loser

203
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:41,236
The study slacker camp

204
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,632
From today on, I'll stay out of the camp

205
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:46,992
Bye bye

206
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,517
Nan Xi

207
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,076
Do you have to follow me even for the exam?

208
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,798
Listen

209
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,073
This exam is very, very important

210
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,196
to me

211
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,080
So I can't make a single mistake

212
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,431
So I'm begging you

213
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,078
Please

214
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:18,391
Nothing good happens since I meet you

215
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,124
I'm begging you

216
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:21,635
Don't make any mistakes,

217
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:22,473
Okay?

218
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:24,633
Why do you sit down?

219
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:26,079
Hey, hey, hey

220
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:28,239
I'm talking to you. Hello, hello

221
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:29,599
This is someone else's seat

222
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,351
Don't sit down

223
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,359
Straight A student, go wherever you should go

224
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,472
Would you please leave alone us,

225
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,632
the poor students?

226
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:44,718
You're really a man

227
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,040
Okay! I'll take it

228
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,353
Transfer Student

229
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,794
Kind helper, please bless me

230
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,514
Kind helper

231
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:00,351
Ummm...

232
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,634
Get it done!

233
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,394
You can make it!

234
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,960
The exam is about to begin

235
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,273
Brace yourselves up

236
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,393
Are you fully prepared?

237
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:18,391
Rui, Rui, you can make it

238
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:19,152
Let's start handing out test papers

239
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,598
Kind helper, please bless me

240
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,159
There must be no problem

241
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,118
Have all of you got the papers?

242
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:27,915
OK, let's start the exam

243
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,037
For the ninety scores

244
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,073
Rui, hold on to the last!

245
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,033
Today, you'll be a

246
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,156
study slacker that can make progress

247
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,832
May I borrow your eraser?

248
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,031
I forgot to bring mine

249
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,479
Thanks，thanks，thanks

250
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:30,113
Half an hour only

251
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:30,836
Those who haven't applied the answer sheet

252
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:31,959
and written composition

253
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,158
need to hurry up

254
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:46,631
Okay, time's up

255
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,315
I'm collecting your papers

256
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,636
Xia Rui, please stop writing

257
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,397
Not bad

258
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,677
Come on

259
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,351
Free at last

260
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,234
Good

261
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:14,671
God bless me

262
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:15,717
Thanks

263
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,008
No problem

264
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:23,871
Did I not write my name?

265
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:26,431
Madam, I didn't write my name

266
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:38,125
Nan Xi

267
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:39,200
Nan Xi

268
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:40,475
Nan Xi

269
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,919
Why does it have something to do with the waist

270
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,594
whenever I meet you?

271
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,753
Thank you. Here you are

272
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:52,435
Nan Xi

273
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:54,928
This is your clothes

274
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:55,955
Thank you

275
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,391
And

276
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:00,751
this is my favorite book

277
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:02,159
I'm giving it to you

278
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,477
You're welcome

279
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,833
Well, I heard the teacher say that

280
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,871
the classes will be divided again

281
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,631
according to grades

282
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,315
I know your grades are excellent

283
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:21,008
So I'll wait for you in the honors class

284
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,435
I hope we can communicate with each other

285
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:26,793
Then I'll go back to the classroom

286
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,636
As the model student of Chenghua School,

287
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,197
can't she just be reserved?

288
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,596
Nan Xi

289
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:35,755
So you're Nan Xi

290
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,714
Senior Liu Bin

291
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,874
Why do Grade 12 students take exams today?

292
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:42,558
It doesn't matter whether there's an exam or not

293
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,157
Good for you

294
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,356
The applause is for you

295
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,035
I’m warning you

296
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:53,596
Stay away from Yang Yufei

297
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:55,889
Everyone in this school

298
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,754
knows that she's going to be my girlfriend

299
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,912
So I hope you can stay away from her

300
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:02,996
Senior

301
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,032
Liu Bin. Brother Bin

302
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:06,479
We all know about the relationship

303
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,754
between you and Yang Yufei

304
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,951
But the key is if Yang Yufei knows about it?

305
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:11,674
If she doesn't,

306
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,158
please go back and tell her

307
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:15,280
Or she'll bother others again

308
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,203
But if she does,

309
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,240
I think she may not

310
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,125
agree with the point

311
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,314
you just said

312
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:21,112
How about you go back to confirm it?

313
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,519
It's about to the College Entrance Examination

314
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,433
And time is precious

315
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:25,356
Don't waste your time

316
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:27,278
on nobodies like us

317
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,153
Xia Rui

318
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:29,999
Does the grudge between Nan Xi and I

319
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,236
have anything to do with you?

320
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,758
He is in Class Nine Grade Eleven

321
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,033
Of course it has something to do with me

322
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,118
But yours

323
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,231
has nothing to do with me either

324
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,322
Let's go

325
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,359
Bye

326
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,440
Nan Xi, you're so good

327
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,791
Although you're quiet usually,

328
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,675
you have manhood at the crucial moment

329
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,634
Nan Xi

330
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:55,432
Aren't you feeling well?

331
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:02,711
Don't move

332
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:08,239
You don't have to. Nan Xi

333
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,160
Xia Rui

334
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:14,994
How do you feel?

335
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:15,993
It's alright

336
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,078
I'm fine. I'm quite good

337
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:17,953
Sorry

338
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,513
Here it is. Thanks again

339
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:28,753
Bye bye

340
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:29,637
Xia Rui

341
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,918
Shoelace

342
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,048
Shoelace. Shoelace. Shoelace. Get it tied

343
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,035
I'm leaving

344
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:43,158
Bye bye

345
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:02,996
I don't want to make a choice

346
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,157
How do you two choose?

347
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,203
Then... Then... Then...

348
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,192
Then Cheng Erluo. Choose!

349
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:07,877
Okay, Cheng Erluo

350
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,152
Xia Rui

351
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,675
Xia Rui

352
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,872
Hello, Mr. Hu

353
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,165
It was an unfamiliar topic of a composition in the exam

354
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,477
You swore to score above ninety

355
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:19,599
Can you make it?

356
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,399
Mr. Hu

357
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,674
Please show some mercy

358
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:23,034
when you go over the papers

359
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:23,995
Stop it!

360
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:25,280
What do you want me to do?

361
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,126
This is a uniform exam for all students of Grade 12

362
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,477
It will be reviewed strictly

363
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,675
But

364
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:32,435
you've been in a good

365
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,071
study status recently

366
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,088
So no matter what result you'll get in the exam this time,

367
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:38,239
you deserve to be praised

368
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,951
But you need to stick to it

369
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,035
for long

370
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:42,758
Good

371
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:43,872
And you

372
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,204
can't slack off

373
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,031
Or you'll

374
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:47,554
be surpassed by Xia Rui easily

375
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,039
Good

376
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:48,572
Good

377
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:49,276
Go home early

378
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,751
Bye, Mr. Hu. Bye bye

379
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,677
I'm flattered by Mr. Hu's sudden

380
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,114
gentle manner

381
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:01,360
Do you think that...

382
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,758
Yeah

383
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,157
So you also think

384
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:05,518
Mr. Hu is the kind helper?

385
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,639
It's so weird

386
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:30,951
The writings are different

387
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:40,912
Did you find anything?

388
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:42,758
I compared

389
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:44,119
the Mr. Hu's handwriting that he helped mend my composition last time

390
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,079
with that of the kind helper

391
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,040
They aren't quite the same

392
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:50,075
In fact, they still have something in common

393
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:51,797
How?

394
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,631
The neat handwriting!

395
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,836
Is it possible

396
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,283
that Mr. Hu was afraid that the truth would be revealed,

397
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:04,119
so he deliberately used another font

398
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,239
Probably

399
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,075
Mr. Hu is a bean counter

400
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,397
Why don't you ask Mr. Hu in person?

401
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,518
Maybe it's the only way out

402
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,915
Did you do well in the exam?

403
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,237
I heard about the topic of in the exam

404
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:30,951
is quite unfamiliar

405
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:33,719
Wow

406
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,595
How can you know that?

407
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,018
Wow

408
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:41,674
Mr. Yi is oblivious of the outside world,

409
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,320
but you know what happens anywhere

410
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,280
You know that our topic of composition is unfamiliar

411
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,031
You're quite good

412
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:47,792
Oh

413
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,152
I heard about it from others

414
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,596
Anyway, the exam was the past

415
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:54,795
Let fate take its course

416
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:55,556
By the way,

417
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,040
I've placed an order for the books you recommended

418
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,153
I'll receive them within a few days

419
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,152
I'm so looking forward to

420
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,797
Hmmm

421
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,079
Stay grateful

422
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,080
Let's have a small talk

423
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,593
before we analyze the test paper

424
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:28,638
The results of this monthly exam in our class

425
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,075
study status recently

426
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:31,236
made me so happy

427
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,719
What does this mean?

428
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,755
This shows that our quiz

429
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:37,316
is very effective

430
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,838
And I found that

431
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:42,035
you're good at summarizing the

432
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,434
key points of the exam

433
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,317
So we need to take

434
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:48,115
more and more quizzes

435
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:50,323
No

436
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:51,797
That will depend on

437
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:53,558
your performance

438
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,632
Today, I want to praise two students

439
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:56,954
One is Nan Xi

440
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,953
You know

441
00:21:58,315 --> 00:21:59,514
the topic of composition

442
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:00,951
is quite difficult

443
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:02,311
But Nan Xi

444
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:03,995
scored 142,

445
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:05,556
keeping stable results

446
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:06,878
Nan Xi

447
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:08,515
In future, you should share

448
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,323
your experience with other students

449
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:11,284
Mr. Hu,

450
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:13,244
It's easy for

451
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,519
Nan Xi to share because he's born clever

452
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,879
But it's uneasy for us to learn

453
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:16,593
Yeah

454
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:19,438
After all, we can't be born again

455
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,951
Even then, we may be worse than what we are now

456
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,595
Talent isn't the main reason for

457
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,031
your bad results

458
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:28,049
The second person I want to praise today

459
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:30,513
Xia Rui

460
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:32,311
Xia Rui

461
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:34,319
Xia Rui

462
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,516
is the one who made the greatest progress in the exam

463
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:38,401
Let's applause

464
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:43,120
And Xia Rui's recent performance

465
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,633
is also obvious to all

466
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:46,631
Xia Rui

467
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:48,791
Don't be arrogant

468
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,323
Keep trying

469
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:51,873
Rui,

470
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:53,072
it's the first time

471
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,205
for you to be praised because of good results

472
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:56,393
Class is over

473
00:22:56,783 --> 00:22:59,048
See you, Mr. Hu

474
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:02,711
Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu!

475
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:04,557
Although I

476
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:05,480
usually make you angry,

477
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,278
you're always good to me

478
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:07,915
Thank you

479
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:08,876
I'll continue to work hard

480
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,245
Stay still. Stay still

481
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:15,917
Why are you talking nonsense

482
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,040
and being peculiar?

483
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,754
Thanks, Mr. Hu

484
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:19,714
for summarizing key points of monthly exam for me

485
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,551
What key points?

486
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,397
Key points of monthly exam 1, 2, 3 and 4

487
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:23,158
and weekly renewal

488
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:24,395
you put them

489
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:25,632
in my drawer, right?

490
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:34,357
Xia Rui

491
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,126
Do you know what you were talking about just now?

492
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:40,237
The topic of the monthly exam was made by me?

493
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:43,358
How can I give you any key points?

494
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,233
That's cheating

495
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:46,441
Besides,

496
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:48,439
I never make any difference among students

497
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:50,836
When do I treat unfairly on you?

498
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:52,197
Moreover,

499
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,956
Would I be furtive

500
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,831
to give special care?

501
00:23:56,831 --> 00:23:58,049
I'd give special care to everyone

502
00:23:58,724 --> 00:23:59,200
Then

503
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,113
Then what?

504
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,635
Listen

505
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,033
You gained

506
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,356
good results in last exam

507
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,678
You should be modest

508
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:08,315
though you made progress

509
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:10,599
But as I know,

510
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:13,757
there's a gap of two scores between your result and the deal

511
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,194
with your mother, right?

512
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,278
How to explain when you go home?

513
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:19,362
Or

514
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,559
you're ready for the cram school

515
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:26,355
Think about it carefully

516
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,953
Jesus Christ, help me

517
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:40,713
I'm so confused

518
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:41,674
I told

519
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:42,911
it couldn't be Mr. Hu

520
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:45,080
How can it be Mr. Hu?

521
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,879
Oh, my god

522
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:47,278
I was still grateful

523
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,153
with tears in my eyes

524
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,237
I thanked him

525
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:53,872
How bad! My God

526
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,993
What a stain in my life!

527
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,554
How dare you laugh at me!

528
00:24:57,554 --> 00:24:59,714
It's said that all efforts are for a single time of use

529
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:00,713
I’m usually so kind to you

530
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:01,636
How can you treat me like this?

531
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,158
All efforts are paid for a single time of use

532
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:05,080
Listen to what she said. Like that!

533
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,793
Rui, Shu and I

534
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:08,315
have been helping you analyze it

535
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:09,799
You and you. Both of you

536
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,312
led me "astray"

537
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:14,071
I'm so embarrassed

538
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:14,795
Xia Rui

539
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:16,155
How can you be like this?

540
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:19,514
Mr. Yi, I was too embarrassed

541
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:20,913
I'm so confused

542
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,207
Xia Rui,

543
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,119
can you be quiet for a while?

544
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,280
You're spinning around there

545
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,441
That makes me dizzy

546
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,554
Making magic circles

547
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:29,400
It's like this...

548
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,836
Making unbelievable circles

549
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:55,128
Hey, Mr. Yi

550
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:56,441
You have this book

551
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:58,753
Why don't you just lend it to me?

552
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,836
Why did you tell me to buy a new one?

553
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:01,959
You're so stingy

554
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,120
What are you talking about?

555
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,433
Take it if you like

556
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:05,879
I didn't tell you to buy a new one

557
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:06,555
What?

558
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:12,597
I have the chat record

559
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:14,481
Check by yourself

560
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,474
This is not me

561
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,597
I don't even have a QQ number

562
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:24,718
How come? X, right?

563
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:25,394
How come it's not you?

564
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:26,878
I said that isn't me

565
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:30,551
XYZ, aren't Y and Z the first letter of your first name?

566
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:32,245
After I gave you my QQ number that day,

567
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,395
I received a friend request

568
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:35,679
Who would it be if it isn't you?

569
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:45,917
What would you like to drink?

570
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:49,438
That day...

571
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:51,322
Nan Xi stopped by

572
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:53,072
Nan Xi

573
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:56,441
Xi! X represents the first letter of Xi!

574
00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:57,839
It must be him

575
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,075
Why did he pretend to be Mr. Yi?

576
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:02,711
Because Mr. Yi is handsome

577
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,363
I don't think Nan Xi pretended to be Mr. Yi either

578
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:11,246
Did you take it for granted

579
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,397
and mistaken him for someone else?

580
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,957
But I called him Mr. Yi,

581
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:15,232
he didn't deny it

582
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:16,441
and explain

583
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:19,152
In my view, Nan Xi

584
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,836
is really peculiar

585
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:22,673
In the past 17 years,

586
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:24,357
I've met countless people

587
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,031
I've never seen anyone like him before

588
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:28,439
Could it be related to

589
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,246
his social phobia?

590
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,558
Social phobia

591
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:35,993
or Physical Contact Disabilities

592
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,278
They're much similar

593
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:39,552
What... What social phobia?

594
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:40,874
Don't you know?

595
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:42,635
That's the main reason why Nan Xi

596
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:43,596
dropped out of No.1 Experimental High School

597
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,879
Since you don't know,

598
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:47,639
let me tell you the truth

599
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,152
According to Lin Xiaoxiao,

600
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:50,875
the gossip king of our class,

601
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,673
it has always been a "deskmate system"

602
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,394
in that No.1 Experimental High School

603
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,878
But Nan Xi

604
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:58,677
felt uncomfortable

605
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,875
when he had physical contact with others

606
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,598
So he had the privilege

607
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,520
to have a single seat

608
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,443
But unfortunately,

609
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:06,678
there was a new classmate was transferred to the class that day

610
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:08,553
And he sat next to Nan Xi

611
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,799
Nan Xi moved

612
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,912
his desk afar

613
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:12,958
And the new comer thought

614
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,519
Nan Xi had a problem with him

615
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,479
As a result, the new comer was so bad

616
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:17,754
that he contained Nan Xi in the corridor

617
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,076
after school

618
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,113
for an apology

619
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:22,359
He seemed to keep harassing Nan Xi

620
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,244
and almost made him

621
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,956
crushed at once

622
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,165
because of poor breathing

623
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:27,592
That's why

624
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:28,591
he was suspended from school by his parents

625
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:29,076
And then

626
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,361
he transferred to our school

627
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,711
Maybe it's because there're fewer students

628
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:34,357
and everyone has an available seat

629
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:35,594
So it's more suitable for Nan Xi

630
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,239
Nan Xi

631
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,837
What's wrong with you? Aren't you feeling well?

632
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,032
No wonder

633
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,554
So bad!

634
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,152
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

635
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:51,636
Maybe you’re the only one who doesn't know

636
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:52,796
about this matter

637
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,671
Doesn't Nan Xi have

638
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:56,479
Contact Disabilities?

639
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,363
Besides pinching your mouth,

640
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,200
did he do

641
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,285
anything strange?

642
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,673
Strange things

643
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:07,316
Strange things

644
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:12,635
Is that on your chest

645
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,071
yours?

646
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:15,556
Just let me have a look

647
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,271
You don't have to. Nan Xi

648
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:26,593
Xia Rui

649
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:30,113
Contact Disabilities?

650
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:31,208
I think he's just pretending

651
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:32,796
So

652
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,395
did Nan Xi really anything to you?

653
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:36,355
Is it possible

654
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,639
that Nan Xi is the kind helper?

655
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:41,246
That day you said you had reading disorder

656
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,283
and could only read the menu,

657
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:42,996
Nan Xi was here

658
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,128
So the key points of the monthly exam

659
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:46,403
are so concise and clear

660
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:47,402
Oh, my gosh

661
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:48,838
I'm afraid of thinking about it

662
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,285
Nan Xi isn't an insightful boy

663
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,636
to like Rui

664
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:52,911
You're not insightful

665
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:54,519
By the way,

666
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:56,155
where's the little wooden box Nan Xi gave you?

667
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,072
You haven't checked out yet

668
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:04,443
Next time

669
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,325
I put it here

670
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:29,837
You can't be mistaken, can you?

671
00:30:29,904 --> 00:30:30,475
That's impossible

672
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:31,797
Did he take it back?

673
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:41,874
Xia Rui

674
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:42,911
Where's the key points of the monthly exam?

675
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:54,129
Where else did I put it?

676
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:55,166
Xia Rui

677
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:56,479
Look

678
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,037
Look at this handwriting

679
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,635
It's exactly the same

680
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:13,434
Yes

681
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:22,711
What's going on?

682
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,477
Mr. Yi,

683
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,323
I failed in the exam this time

684
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:31,997
And now I'm strolling by myself

685
00:31:32,464 --> 00:31:34,718
How to express I don't know how to go home?

686
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,793
Come on, Rui

687
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:39,514
Don't overact

688
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:45,794
Where are you?

689
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,323
Where are you?

690
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:53,719
I'm...

691
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:02,911
What will you do?

692
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:04,557
Will he come?

693
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:05,632
Rui,

694
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,240
Do you want us by your side?

695
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:09,324
No

696
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:11,036
It's not a big deal

697
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:12,035
and Rui can fix it

698
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:17,992
You are Mr. X?

699
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,286
Why did you pretend to be Mr. Yi?

700
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:20,113
Tell me the truth

701
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:21,674
Isn't it a bit like a punk?

702
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:23,796
No, no, I have to change the way

703
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,594
Thank you, Nan Xi

704
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:27,792
Thank you for combing the key points of the monthly exam for me

705
00:32:28,068 --> 00:32:29,152
How embarrassing if

706
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:30,437
I mistaken again!

707
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:31,636
Come on

708
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:32,758
Xia Rui is a girl of free soul

709
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:33,719
Don't be afraid?

710
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,918
I'm cool

711
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:35,737
Not nervous

712
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:36,679
Not nervous

713
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:38,191
I just have a word with him

714
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:39,752
I am such a cool girl

715
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,598
I can't be so nervous

716
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:42,397
Right?

717
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,514
Nan Xi, can you make a sound

718
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,951
when you show up the next time?

719
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:51,836
You make me

720
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,596
nervous every time

721
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:55,442
Sorry

722
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:56,631
Well, it's okay

723
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,678
Ummm...

724
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:00,713
I want to ask you something

725
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,957
I already know you are X

726
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:05,680
Why do you pretend to be Mr. Yi?

727
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,916
You have to tell the truth

728
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:07,478
If you tell the truth,

729
00:33:07,478 --> 00:33:09,152
I'll let you off

730
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:09,752
And

731
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:10,399
I already know

732
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,359
you made key points of monthly exam 1, 2, 3 and 4

733
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,272
I'm puzzled

734
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,633
why do you help me?

735
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:15,166
And

736
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,517
I heard

737
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:18,287
you have Physical

738
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,362
Contact Disabilities

739
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,036
I'm puzzled

740
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,245
You tied my shoelaces

741
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:23,358
and hit head against my breast

742
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,953
So you usually use the trick of

743
00:33:29,438 --> 00:33:30,475
pretending to be sick to flirt with girls

744
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:31,617
Awesome!

745
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,286
I was wondering why I couldn't find it

746
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:41,160
You should tell me if you wanted to take it away

747
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,873
I've been looking for it for a long time

748
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,671
Can you stop doing this next time?

749
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,797
Thank you for your monthly exam summary for me

750
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:52,559
I got it

751
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,358
Thanks

752
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:56,878
OK, I got it

753
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,287
I got it

754
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,247
Nan Xi, what's wrong?

755
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:06,593
I'm sorry. Sorry

756
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,285
That's nice

757
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,111
You don't like talking

758
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,033
like this little piece of wood

759
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,637
I love talking

760
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:42,397
like the little bell inside

761
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:50,637
I'll call you Xiaomutou from now on

762
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,445
I'll call you Xiaolingdang

763
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:55,232
Baby whale is a secret between us

764
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:56,878
You can't tell anyone

765
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,363
I got five stitches today

766
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:40,152
The doctor said there might be a scar

767
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,207
I'll make a new one if you lose it

768
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,168
Don't fight

769
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:44,795
I won't lose it

770
00:35:44,861 --> 00:35:45,879
Don't worry

771
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:05,280
It doesn't matter if you lose it

772
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:08,363
I made a new one for you

773
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:12,483
Don't fight

774
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,871
Leave scar?

775
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,521
Just tell me

776
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,957
if someone bullies you in the future

777
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,192
Xiaomutou

778
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,752
Xiaolingdang

779
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,719
I find you
