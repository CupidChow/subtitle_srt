1
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,778
This building,
we use a symmetrical layout.

2
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,136
The building has a clear central axis.

3
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,012
The main body of the building is white.

4
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:51,324
Strong vertical lines
makes it look tall and straight.

5
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:55,027
The design this time
is mainly Nan Xi's work.

6
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,841
Here is our display.

7
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,059
A new store opened...

8
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:33,840
Sister in law.

9
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,513
Isn't it sister in law?

10
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,484
You're here to pick Nan Xi up again?

11
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,332
I thought you called me heroine?

12
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:42,295
Nan Xi is our big brother now.
Don't you know?

13
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,415
Even so,
you can't just call me sister-in-law.

14
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,542
Isn't this like pre-payment?
It's the same, it's the same.

15
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:50,699
Sister-in-law, let me tell you.
Thanks to Nan Xi today.

16
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,575
Our dormitory group assignment,
has gotten the first place!

17
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:55,124
-Really?
-It is.

18
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:59,373
Professor Gu also additionally awarded,
five points for end semester results!

19
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,187
How is he?

20
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,791
Failed. Second.

21
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,350
He handed the assignment himself?

22
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,002
He is aloof.

23
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,796
Not interested in us.

24
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,013
Nan Xi.

25
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:22,031
-You've waited for long?
-No.

26
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,110
I heard that you won first place today.

27
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,335
Added five points.

28
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,517
Awesome.

29
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,889
Brother, thanks to you this year.

30
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,165
Let's have a meal later.

31
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:31,704
It's a must.

32
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:33,868
Okay.

33
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,107
Since Nan Xi hasn't lived in a dormitory.

34
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,485
This meal will be our treat.

35
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:39,891
That's great!

36
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,456
=EPISODE 18 OUR HOME=

37
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,641
The delicious food is here.

38
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:51,903
Very good.

39
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,845
Gao Ting. Do you know me?

40
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,047
I am Nan Xi's friend.

41
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,754
I am Xia Rui. Nice to meet you.

42
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:00,558
Wait a second.

43
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,925
I've bought a lot of delicious food.
Look.

44
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:04,246
We can have a meal together.

45
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,607
They are all people you know,
all from the same dormitory.

46
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:09,967
I'm sorry, I'm not very close to them.

47
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,707
Why is he so hard to talk to?

48
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,791
Is this the standard
of Architecture School?

49
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:22,884
That's why I could not enter.

50
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,892
Everybody! I'm coming!

51
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:30,532
-Does it smell good? Does it smell good?
-Yes.

52
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:31,878
Smells so good.

53
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:24,232
Xia Rui.

54
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,717
Let's change to another location.

55
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:26,912
Change location?

56
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:29,309
It's tasty.

57
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,406
How can you eat so much?

58
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:41,794
Xia Rui, eat more.

59
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,391
Meat, meat, meat.

60
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,491
Why do we have to squat...

61
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:50,530
Squat here to eat?

62
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,226
Because this is the only blind spot
for surveillance.

63
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:54,451
What?

64
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,100
No monitoring here.

65
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,124
But when we walked here
weren't we recorded?

66
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,351
That's right!

67
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:17,612
Who's cooking hotpot here?

68
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:21,208
Pack up! Pack up!

69
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,658
Put it on... Put it on.

70
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,044
-Hurry, hurry.
-Wait. Wait for me.

71
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:41,533
-Xia Rui, wait for me.
-Xia Rui. Heroine.

72
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:45,500
-I'm impressed.
-Don't call my name. Hurry.

73
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,147
Stop right there.

74
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:49,419
Don't run.

75
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,030
Which class are you from?

76
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,646
Who are they?

77
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:04,818
-Who?
-Who?

78
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,762
Looks like the one from our next class.

79
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,238
You see.
You can't find out who is it this way.

80
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:10,872
Nobody found out.

81
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,512
Afraid of getting caught.

82
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:14,778
So daring.

83
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:17,907
I'm doomed.
When I went to your lab yesterday,

84
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:20,001
I met him. Will he go and expose this?

85
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,869
God bless me.

86
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,416
Hope he is a gentleman.

87
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,271
God, please open your eyes.

88
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,450
How about this?

89
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:32,091
If anything happens, blame it all on me.

90
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm Class Three anyway. You are Class One.

91
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Your department can't control me at all.
Do you understand?

92
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:38,558
Wait for me.

93
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:40,785
-What is it?
-Xia Rui.

94
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:43,945
We're supposed to have a housewarming
for your new house today. Where are you?

95
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:45,524
I forgot about it.

96
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:48,174
Wait for me. We will go back immediately.

97
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:50,550
Let's go. Go home.

98
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,854
Let's go.

99
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:01,276
You guys are finally back.

100
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,485
I, just now,

101
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,972
waited outside the door,
until my leg was about to break.

102
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:10,850
Don't sit. Get the delivery at the door.

103
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,159
Impossible, Xia Rui.

104
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,465
I have put all my effort on this house.

105
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:17,541
It's just two steps.

106
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,787
Can't you go and get it yourself?
Three, two...

107
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,573
Xia Rui.

108
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,696
After taking the delivery,
you will lose me completely.

109
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:27,697
Okay.

110
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:36,957
Where's the delivery?

111
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,752
It's just a wooden box.

112
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:40,688
Have you lost me now?

113
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,471
Open it and have a look.

114
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,956
Me?

115
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,574
Who else, if not you?

116
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,426
This... This...

117
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,814
I know
you have been working hard recently.

118
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,633
Without your effort, this house
it would be impossible to complete.

119
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,375
This is a small gift from Nan Xi.

120
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:07,092
My goodness...

121
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,980
This... James' 2013 championship ring.

122
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,022
Nan Xi, I love you.

123
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:16,015
Student, Cheng Erluo. Let's do
an interview. How do you feel now?

124
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,284
Moved. Moved completely.

125
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:22,366
I know. This is Nan Xi's,
greatest affirmation of my work.

126
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,240
No need for you to say it,
I can know it myself.

127
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,417
I'm so capable.

128
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:28,228
Look at this, look at this
The curtain hanging. This wall painted.

129
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:30,521
The arrangement of this furniture.

130
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,181
Why not, I moved over to live with Nan Xi.

131
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,715
Xia Rui, Shu the two of you too.

132
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:37,028
Let's form a group,
named The Four Auspicious Treasures.

133
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,483
Don't even think about it.
What Four Auspicious Treasures.

134
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:41,151
You'd better be Roast Duck of 4 Treasure.
Roast Duck of 4 Treasure.

135
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,032
Okay, okay. Quickly go get the food.

136
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,233
Alright.

137
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,035
Nan Xi.

138
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:54,636
You see, it's late already.
We'll go back first.

139
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:57,274
It's late.
Don't let Xia Rui go back and forth.

140
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:58,598
Just let her stay.

141
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:02,041
Shu. Let's go back.

142
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:03,226
Okay.

143
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,987
I say...
Xia Rui, you don't have to go back.

144
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,092
You stay here.

145
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,475
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

146
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,705
Day by day...

147
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:14,861
-You're such a problem, you...
-Xia Rui.

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,982
What is it?

149
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:21,241
I have a present for you.

150
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:23,381
I have a gift too?

151
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:28,492
Be careful on your way home.

152
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:29,743
Bye.

153
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:31,779
What gift?

154
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,556
Close your eyes first.

155
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,875
Close your eyes first.

156
00:10:38,582 --> 00:10:39,638
What are you doing?

157
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:40,696
Do not move.

158
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,492
Follow me.

159
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:44,708
Where, where to?

160
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,943
No, Nan Xi. It's a little scary like this.

161
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:49,744
Raise your left foot.

162
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,414
Left leg.

163
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:55,600
Where to?

164
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:57,231
Left foot.

165
00:10:58,196 --> 00:10:59,546
Raise your left foot.

166
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:02,744
Heading up.

167
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:16,869
You can open your eyes.

168
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:19,552
I'm going to open.

169
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:25,684
You drew this?

170
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:28,824
It's very beautiful.

171
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,411
(OUR HOME)

172
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,036
Our home?

173
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:45,981
Our home.

174
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:51,981
I live here, not to escape...

175
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,931
but for you.

176
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,718
I want to give you our home.

177
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:04,384
Xia Rui.

178
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,342
I like you.

179
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,017
Not Woodie's liking Little Bell.

180
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,033
But Nan Xi's like for Xia Rui.

181
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,132
I want to give Xia Rui a real home.

182
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,716
When you said you want to go abroad,

183
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:48,884
I was really scared.

184
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,386
At that time, I knew how much I like you.

185
00:12:57,469 --> 00:12:58,690
Then...

186
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,748
why are you only telling it now?

187
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,757
This, why is it with you?

188
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,991
Woodie, get well soon.

189
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:35,096
Nan Xi, we boys cannot lose to the girls.

190
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:38,521
What do you want, what's your wish?

191
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,505
I want to be Xia Rui's Nan Xi

192
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,058
You, why are you so good?

193
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:56,867
You know whatever I think and want.

194
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:00,781
But I was still dumb, thinking that...

195
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,136
You tried hard to open me up.

196
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:09,733
I promise you, I will not retract anymore.

197
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,861
Do you still remember?

198
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:17,995
You once told me.

199
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:22,292
You said "I will always look at you."

200
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:25,773
You are waiting for me.

201
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,812
Now it's my turn.

202
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:32,425
Xia Rui.

203
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,417
Look at me.

204
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,037
Look at me.

205
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,658
I want you to only look at me forever.

206
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,742
Only look at me.

207
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:14,018
I want to ask you one question.

208
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:15,977
Say it.

209
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,130
This, do you still want to install it
in the bedroom?

210
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:24,737
I want to install this at the doorway.

211
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,038
At the doorway?

212
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:29,434
When you're home alone, I'm worried.

213
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:32,448
After installing this,
I can see the situation outside the door.

214
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:42,275
What, what situation outside the door?

215
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:45,511
Because, this is our home.

216
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:49,244
And you said it before,
you like this gift.

217
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,645
You also said, you like me.

218
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,952
Yes, this is our home.

219
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,673
But I will stay in the dormitory.

220
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,812
Stay in the dormitory?

221
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:04,427
Why?

222
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,288
Otherwise,
we'll be considered a live-in couple?

223
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:13,840
What I mean is, doesn't this mean
that we're living together?

224
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,584
Then, then, isn't the progress too fast?

225
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,364
There will be no surprise.

226
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,485
Surprise, right?

227
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,644
We'll go look for surprises.

228
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,427
Look for what surprises?

229
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:29,851
Carousel.

230
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,043
I... Nan Xi.

231
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:33,358
I...

232
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,833
Nan Xi, Nan Xi.

233
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,318
Nan Xi. Slow down.

234
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:41,917
Nan Xi.

235
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,662
How was it? Was it fun?

236
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,722
This is a theme park tailor made for you.

237
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,941
Do you like it?

238
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:51,807
What's in your head?

239
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,796
I really like it.

240
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:56,217
Okay. Let's do it again.

241
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,384
Three, two, one. Let's go.

242
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,993
Ever since my dad passed away,

243
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,203
no one has played with me like this.

244
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,767
Thank you.

245
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:41,200
Do you know?
When you said you have a gift for me,

246
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,918
I thought you will wrap yourself up
and give yourself to me.

247
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,188
I am yours to begin with.

248
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,182
I want to see.

249
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,473
It's so beautiful.

250
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:22,297
Nan Xi, do you remember,

251
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:24,979
the day before the adult ceremony, you
took me to the hills to watch the sunrise.

252
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:26,793
We escaped from school.

253
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,760
Cause that idiot, Cheng Erluo bought
loud fireworks instead of silent ones...

254
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,463
and got caught.

255
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:36,648
Why didn't you tell him?

256
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:39,249
What was on your mind then?

257
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,535
I... I was thinking...

258
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,173
I was thinking..

259
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:45,157
This is very interesting.

260
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,351
Why are you so bad?

261
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:52,199
I say, you have an innocent face.

262
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:54,359
Why so cruel?

263
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:03,591
Ever since dad left me,

264
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,448
I've always lived
in my grandparents' house.

265
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:10,163
After mom remarried,
the house became hers and uncle Chen's.

266
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:13,630
I've never had a place that belongs to me.

267
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:16,621
But it's different now.

268
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,853
I can finally say it out loud.

269
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,391
I now have my own home!

270
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:22,429
That's not right.

271
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,774
It's our home.

272
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:29,490
Although it's a rented house, but...

273
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:32,174
Nan Xi, thank you.

274
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:38,137
Between us,
there's no need to say "thank you."

275
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,360
If, in the future, you...

276
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,321
still want to thank me,

277
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:44,829
you can say...

278
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,126
I like you.

279
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,291
You are so bad.

280
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,091
I like you.

281
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,463
I like you too.

282
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,390
Hello.

283
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:34,679
You listen...

284
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,010
Listen to yourself.
Are you still speaking human words?

285
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,769
You went overseas for vacation,
and left Hao for me to take care.

286
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:41,120
You think I'm a nanny?

287
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,129
Be careful of what you say.

288
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,573
Hao is my son,
isn't he your brother as well?

289
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:48,435
Can't you help me
take care of him for two days?

290
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,369
Please, my goodness.

291
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,809
I'm at school.

292
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:53,172
I'm not on a vacation.

293
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,654
Moreover, he is a boy.

294
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,940
I stay in a girl's dorm.
He can't come over to stay with me.

295
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,328
Sending him over
to grandparents' is better, okay?

296
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,655
Your grandparents are back
at their hometown.

297
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:05,136
Moreover,
you can just bring him over to a hotel,

298
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:06,673
and stay for two days, okay?

299
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:07,751
Hotel?

300
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,533
I can provide wages.

301
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:12,405
How much?

302
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:16,505
According to the market's nanny
salary average price.

303
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:17,864
It will be according to that.

304
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:21,369
As his sister,
you're giving me market's average price?

305
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,224
-Twice the average price!
-1.5.

306
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,270
Then, is it according to Chenghua's
standard or Binhai's standard?

307
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,805
Check online.
We'll go with the higher one.

308
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:34,747
How about hourly rate for home tutoring?
I have to guide him with this homework.

309
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,929
This will be according to two hours a day.

310
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,137
How about meals? Can be claimed.

311
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,115
Prize money, plus a fully automatic
coffee machine, new model.

312
00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:47,347
That's too much.

313
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:49,038
Then, I won't be able to take this job.

314
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:50,996
Let him find his grandparents...

315
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,057
I'll decide the coffee machine's price
and model.

316
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,759
I decide, you pay.

317
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:57,707
Deal.

318
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,370
Goodbye.

319
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,332
I finally won her for once.

320
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,951
But I have to check the hotel carefully.

321
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:11,846
Deluxe room. Swimming pool view.

322
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:15,309
What is this?

323
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,642
Space Zero Pressure Bed?

324
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,876
He's not here to enjoy.
Can't be this either.

325
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:23,649
Hao and you are staying in a hotel?

326
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,366
Mom has handed him over to me.

327
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:31,298
Of course,
I'll have to be responsible for him.

328
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,699
Just for this?

329
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,271
Actually it's not just this.

330
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,669
Hotel is a little expensive.

331
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:41,109
But if two people stay together,
it's still a good deal.

332
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,515
I have a more cost effective plan.

333
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:45,660
Say it.

334
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:48,691
Look at this. Here.

335
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:50,553
Does it fit?

336
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,346
You'll let Hao stay here?

337
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:58,775
Are you sick?

338
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,028
That's not what I meant.

339
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:04,565
Anyway, that's not going to work.

340
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,983
No, no, no. Not going to work.
This doesn't work.

341
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:08,266
Why can't it work?

342
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,720
The money you're gonna save
will be all yours.

343
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:13,001
But I can't drag you along.

344
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:15,283
This plan is bad.
Let's think of another one.

345
00:23:17,422 --> 00:23:19,138
What do you mean by dragging me along?

346
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:25,878
Hao, as you know him,

347
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,222
even as his sister,
I can't help my patience with him.

348
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:29,902
I'll cannot allow him to cause you harm.

349
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:33,655
Your brother, is my brother.

350
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,165
What we are saying aren't the same.

351
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,922
It is the same.

352
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:40,579
You said before,
to let me go back to dormitory more often.

353
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:42,107
Do you still remember?

354
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,559
No.

355
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:47,605
Why are we going into the third isssue?

356
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:50,303
I'm not very familiar
with Hao Tian and Hu Jing.

357
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:51,688
But I'm familiar with Hao.

358
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:53,251
I can start with him.

359
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:59,785
Which is to say, you will take Hao
as a roommate, to give it a try?

360
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,348
Are you sure?

361
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,300
It's Hao. So much more difficult
than those two guys.

362
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,085
Which is why I want to try first.

363
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,851
If that is the case...

364
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,039
It's not that it's impossible.

365
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,494
But I have a condition.

366
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,845
You still have conditions.

367
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:22,096
You can calculate.

368
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,345
This house's rate is 6,630 yuan.

369
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:29,037
If converted into rental,
it's for two months and three days.

370
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:32,979
As for what you dreamed of,
Jura automatic coffee machine.

371
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,805
The grinder above,
you may be able to afford it already.

372
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,857
Then, I'll give up.
Let's talk about the conditions.

373
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:43,623
There's only one condition.

374
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:46,561
That is...

375
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:48,688
you and Hao will stay here together.

376
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:50,365
Sorry. That can't be.

377
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:51,576
That can't be.

378
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:57,498
Think about it.
Hu Jing and Hao Tian are two people.

379
00:24:57,578 --> 00:24:59,682
You and Hao are two as well.
It's the same number.

380
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:00,935
So, it's not a problem.

381
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:02,948
They are not the same.

382
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,148
If...

383
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:10,343
If you accompany Hao the whole day,

384
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:13,329
what should I do by myself?

385
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,618
Isn't it?

386
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:23,944
Then, you think about it.

387
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:28,615
If Hao comes and stays here,
anything that happens...

388
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,847
is your responsibility.

389
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:33,742
-I can't help you with it.
-Okay.

390
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:51,812
This place here...

391
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:54,973
Is it livable?

392
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,388
Comfortable.

393
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,559
Come, come, come.

394
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,006
Go unpack your luggage.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

395
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:18,157
I heard that
you will come stay here occasionally.

396
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:20,932
This is where Nan Xi stays by himself.

397
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,692
Stop running around.
And don't break the furniture.

398
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:25,558
Stays alone...

399
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,429
There's only one room on the second floor?

400
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,246
This is Nan Xi's private room.
Who's letting you run here...

401
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,175
Not like I want to peep into the room.

402
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:43,893
Only one bed...

403
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:47,290
So when you stay overnight,
wouldn't it be...

404
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:52,098
Both are young people, full of passion.

405
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,692
Totally understood.

406
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:58,228
So should I call you
brother-in-law instead?

407
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:04,840
Have a look.
Didn't you just lay down on this sofa?

408
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,973
Isn't it big enough for you to sleep?

409
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,979
Such a good bed, but I can't sleep on it.

410
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,486
Why do I have to sleep on a sofa?

411
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:12,984
Have you been dreaming recently?

412
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,704
You don't even trust what your
sister says, what do you want to do?

413
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:19,725
Feeling nervous? You must be guilty.

414
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:22,879
You can't escape from my 00's sharp eye.

415
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,146
Are you in love now?

416
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,780
You've confirmed the relationship?

417
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:32,173
I was just asking casually,
and it's revealed so easily.

418
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,968
I want to tell mom.
I don't want to be a light bulb here.

419
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:36,916
You both have an affair.
I want to go home...

420
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,119
What're you talking about?
You're really losing it now.

421
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,598
How dare you run wild in my territory?
What is happening?

422
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:44,624
Sit properly.
This week, stay here quietly.

423
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,986
No playing on the mobile phone.
Do not complain to me.

424
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,004
If you dare complain, let me tell you.
You will not make it back.

425
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:52,823
-Help! She wants to murder her brother...
-Xia Rui.

426
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,860
Brother-in-law is still the best.

427
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,480
You, do not forget,
I've got something in my hand.

428
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:05,240
If you dare to touch me again,
I'll drag you down with me.

429
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,908
If you treat me better,

430
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:11,257
I'll still reluctantly
consider to help you both keep the secret.

431
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:14,576
University students falling in love
don't violate the national law.

432
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:16,080
Go tell. I'm not afraid of you.

433
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:19,230
You are not afraid. Why were you nervous?

434
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:23,092
I was afraid that you will complain
to mom exaggeratedly, okay?

435
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:25,669
It was you. So weird.

436
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:28,138
I heard that
you were very reluctant to come here.

437
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,997
You just yelled and wanted to go.

438
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:32,363
What? Is there a secret?

439
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:35,314
It's all because of Li Jiayi.

440
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:38,383
Li Jiayi? Sounds like a girl's name.

441
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:39,580
Who is it?

442
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,031
My ex...

443
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,120
-What?
-Desk-mate...

444
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,160
Do not sigh when you talk to me.

445
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,235
And then?

446
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:50,676
Let's see.
We've been sitting together for a year.

447
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:52,705
We'd promised to always sit together.

448
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:55,292
But, after the final exam was over,
the seats were rearranged.

449
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:58,665
She told the teacher,
she wants to sit with Wang Jiakai.

450
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:01,771
What's good about him?
Just knows how to play Beethoven's pieces.

451
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:03,814
If you allow me to learn for two months,
I can do it too.

452
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:07,918
But it has to be at this time
that mom sent me to Binhai.

453
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,362
Li Jiayi and I
are in different places now.

454
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:12,626
He really watched too much drama.

455
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:16,010
-I'll not let him watch series anymore.
-You don't know the feeling of betrayal.

456
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,515
When I go back to school later,

457
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:19,937
how do I face
a school filled with memories.

458
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:22,070
The eraser we used together.

459
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,657
And also, the blurred lines on the table.

460
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,786
I'm telling you, you're not allowed
to watch TV series anymore.

461
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,835
No mobile phones. Focus on studies.

462
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,232
Brother-in-law seems very popular
with the girls.

463
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,111
Why not teach me some tactics?

464
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:44,501
But if he falls for someone like you,
his standards are not that high.

465
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:46,592
-Say it again.
-Do not touch me.

466
00:29:46,672 --> 00:29:49,260
If not, we will perish together.

467
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,804
Say it again.

468
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:54,220
Do not touch me, do not touch me.

469
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,719
You dare to run wild in my territory.

470
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,981
-Go do your homework.
-This is my vacation time.

471
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:00,426
I can't do homework.

472
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,759
Come here.

473
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,792
Do it or not?

474
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,649
-I'm not doing.
-Say it again.

475
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,495
You think I'll not be able
to catch you like this?

476
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,734
You can really run.

477
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:21,709
I'm not doing it.

478
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:22,772
Come here.

479
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:25,891
I'm not doing it.

480
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,976
Put in the ingredients.

481
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:33,976
Then...

482
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:42,340
How can I get this in?

483
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,476
One, two, three.

484
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,907
Oh, my goodness...

485
00:30:56,517 --> 00:30:57,663
Is your hand okay?

486
00:30:57,743 --> 00:30:59,686
No problem, it's fine.

487
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:01,473
Hao wants to eat.

488
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:05,018
Sorry, I'm not burning your kitchen
on purpose.

489
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:08,220
You treat him so well.

490
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,081
I treat him well?

491
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,699
I can't wait to chop him into ribs,
and put into the pot.

492
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:16,310
If not for the sake of coffee machine
and wages I won't do it for him.

493
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:17,820
Tight lips.

494
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,209
What do you want to do?

495
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:23,558
-Cook.
-Cook?

496
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:25,582
Are you sure?

497
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:51,331
It's done.

498
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,461
You just looked it up.
And you already know how?

499
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,384
Why are you so great?

500
00:31:57,464 --> 00:31:58,931
You know everything.

501
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:01,697
You are so perfect.
Why did God send you to me?

502
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:03,137
You are mine.

503
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:05,028
You won't have the chance to regret it.

504
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:06,284
Let me tell you.

505
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:08,273
Few days later, I'll go to temple
to worship and make a wish.

506
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:10,931
By that time,
you won't have the chance to turn back.

507
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:15,202
If you want to eat,
I'll make it for you every day.

508
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:23,707
Let go of my sister.

509
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,830
Hao, hurry up. Aren't you hungry?

510
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,694
Hurry.

511
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,512
So much delicious food.

512
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:44,358
Brother-in-law, your cooking is awesome.

513
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:47,957
Brother-in-law is your vision really fine?

514
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:50,379
Are you blind that you fell for my sister?

515
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:51,802
What does that mean?

516
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,212
You don't want to eat anymore?

517
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:56,777
I have no opinion.

518
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,655
It's just that...

519
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,528
Just that what?

520
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,705
Mom hired you to take care of me.

521
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,286
I am your master now.

522
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,193
I'm still your sister.

523
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:08,405
Don't touch me.

524
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:12,709
If you touch, I'll tell mom
about your underground affair base.

525
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:13,901
Three,

526
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,668
two,

527
00:33:16,143 --> 00:33:17,856
one!

528
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,959
Get up, get up, get up.
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

529
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,250
Okay. Today's practice is over.

530
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,379
Thank you all.

531
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,102
Thank you, coach.

532
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,080
I heard that a Hunan Cuisine restaurant
just opened at Pedestrian Street.

533
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,426
Let's go try it together later?

534
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:37,709
I'm not going.

535
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,749
In the evening, I have to accompany
a friend to report at the Drama Club.

536
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,053
Drama club?

537
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:43,816
Zhao YiShu.

538
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,423
That's right. What's wrong?

539
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:47,031
I'm very curious.

540
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,604
What is the relation between you two?

541
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,562
Just good friends.

542
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:52,883
Good friends? It doesn't seem like it.

543
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:55,968
The two of you are always together 24-7.

544
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:57,923
Closer than a normal couple.

545
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,937
The relationship between Shu and I,

546
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:02,486
cannot be understood
by ordinary people like you.

547
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:03,881
I'm leaving.

548
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,712
I'm not done speaking,
why are you leaving?

549
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,315
Don't be anxious.

550
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,707
You must be feeling guilty.

551
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:16,580
Make way, make way.

552
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,147
-Shu.
-Erluo.

553
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:20,800
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

554
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,151
Let's go, follow me.

555
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,973
Make way, make way.

556
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:34,313
Shu.

557
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,046
You're panting.

558
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:38,679
Have some sweet Farmer Mountain Spring.
As sweet as you.

559
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:43,590
Why are you here?

560
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,828
Aren't you going to the drama club
to participate in their event?

561
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:47,941
I'll send you there.

562
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:49,813
What's the matter with you?

563
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:52,751
The distance from my school
to the drama club is only five minutes.

564
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:55,432
It's not even half the distance
from the basketball court to here.

565
00:34:55,691 --> 00:34:59,168
Yesterday, I spent the whole night
reading the school forum.

566
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:02,065
The post about you being the
prettiest girl in school has been pinned.

567
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:03,371
This is not the main point.

568
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:04,740
The main point is...

569
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:08,756
these boys' comments below
are really nasty.

570
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:11,287
I've thought about it.
I want to protect you.

571
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,501
If anyone dares to harass you,
I will fight for you.

572
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:16,664
How about you?

573
00:35:16,744 --> 00:35:19,900
Being in the basketball club,
you'll have a number of female fans.

574
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,569
Don't you come back and forth
to pick me up and disrupt your love fate.

575
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:23,624
I...

576
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,262
The coach told me,

577
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:28,404
to become a professional player,
I have to practice hard.

578
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:30,078
Get into C-U-B-A.

579
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:31,970
About love fate...

580
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:34,277
Let it come in two more years.

581
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,331
Then what about my love fate?

582
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,816
I'm in university now,
can I fall in love freely now?

583
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:43,118
Shu.

584
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:45,156
You can't simply look for a boyfriend.

585
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:46,920
Why?

586
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,122
You, me and Xia Rui.

587
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:51,025
The three of us grew up together.

588
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:54,192
If you look for a boyfriend,
you need to let us have a look for you.

589
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,232
Our Shu is kind and gentle.

590
00:35:56,312 --> 00:35:59,810
If you look for boyfriend you need to look
for a good one to be compatible with you.

591
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:01,977
Just because of this?

592
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:03,217
Isn't this enough?

593
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:05,498
Just the other day,
that pervert from Automation.

594
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,677
When I think of him now,
I feel like puking.

595
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:08,888
Disgusting.

596
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:10,103
That day was a coincidence.

597
00:36:10,183 --> 00:36:12,196
We were all there.
How about when you are alone?

598
00:36:12,276 --> 00:36:13,873
What to do?

599
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:16,264
In the future, if anyone dares
to peep at you, harass you...

600
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:17,984
you need to tell me immediately.

601
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:21,203
Okay, it's nothing. No need to worry.

602
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:22,706
This is in school.

603
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:23,875
And you,

604
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:25,520
the competition
will be in few weeks, right?

605
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,405
This is your first competition
in university. You can do it.

606
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:32,548
Against Binhai Polytechnic,
we still have confidence.

607
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:33,997
Come and watch by then.

608
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:35,691
Have I ever missed it?

609
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,173
What about Nan Xi and Xia Rui?

610
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:41,015
We just finished
renovating their little love hut.

611
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:42,668
They won't forget us, right?

612
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:45,275
How can that be? Hao is here.

613
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:47,320
Hao!

614
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:49,980
Why is this kid here in Binhai?

615
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:53,460
Starting from now, this is my bed.

616
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,138
If my sister wants to sleepover,

617
00:36:55,218 --> 00:36:56,873
she must sleep with me.

618
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:59,673
You, get down immediately.

619
00:37:00,894 --> 00:37:04,645
We are both men. Don't assume that
I don't know what you are thinking.

620
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,069
Even if I call you brother-in-law.

621
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:08,923
Even if I really admire you.

622
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:11,190
But before the two of you get married,

623
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:14,674
I can't just let you take advantage
of my silly sister.

624
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:17,576
Let's sleep on the sofa.

625
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:19,136
Xia Rui will sleep on her own.

626
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:20,949
I don't need to avoid suspicion.

627
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:22,466
I want to sleep with my sister.

628
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:23,677
No way.

629
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,772
Stop. I'll sleep on the sofa.

630
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:28,138
-No way.
-No way.

631
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,043
What else do you want then?
